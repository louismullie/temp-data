## Question

Develop a SOAP note template for post-operative follow-up after appendectomy.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me for a SOAP note template for post-operative follow-up after appendectomy with explicit thinking and verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching clinical context and evidence base that should shape the template. Then, I should verify the key elements to include in Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections. Next, I will consider special scenarios such as perforated/complicated disease, interval appendectomy, and pediatric pathways. Finally, I will integrate quality metrics, documentation best practices, and a succinct, printable template while double-checking that each element aligns with current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and evidence base so I don't overstate the need for routine in-person follow-up. Routine in-person postoperative visits after uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy rarely change management, with only about 2% of encounters altering care, and most postoperative events present outside scheduled follow-up, which supports a telemedicine-first model for low-risk patients while reserving in-person visits for higher-risk scenarios such as perforation or persistent symptoms [^114B3qdT]. I should also anchor the template to SAGES guidance emphasizing standardized documentation and patient-centered outcomes, even though the certainty of evidence varies and long-term data remain limited, which reinforces the need for structured follow-up that captures what matters to patients [^111cai8E] [^116hAV8B].

> Now, I will examine the Subjective section and make sure I capture the essentials without redundancy. I need to check pain trajectory using a numeric rating scale, characterize wound concerns, screen for nausea/vomiting and bowel function, and explicitly ask about fever, chills, or abdominal distension that could herald abscess or ileus; I should also confirm activity and return-to-work status and review medication adherence, especially antibiotics if indicated for complicated disease, and document any ED or urgent visits since discharge to avoid missing intercurrent events [^114B3qdT]. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overloading the pain assessment; a single NRS with functional impact is sufficient and aligns with pragmatic postoperative pain assessment in ambulatory surgery literature.

> Next, I should review the Objective section and ensure it is efficient yet comprehensive. Vital signs with attention to fever, tachycardia, and blood pressure are foundational; inspection of incisions for erythema, drainage, dehiscence, and ecchymosis should be paired with a focused abdominal exam for tenderness, guarding, rebound, and distension; I need to check for a fluid wave or shifting dullness if ascites is suspected and confirm that bowel sounds are present; a brief cardiopulmonary exam adds safety, and I should document wound classification if not already recorded from the operative note. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not implying routine labs; in uncomplicated cases, routine labs are not necessary, but I will flag when they are indicated in the Assessment/Plan based on clinical suspicion.

> I will now synthesize the Assessment section and make sure I explicitly stratify risk. For an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy, the expected course is steady pain improvement with return to normal activities by about 1–2 weeks and wound healing by 2–3 weeks; persistent pain beyond 2 weeks, new fever, or localized tenderness should prompt evaluation for SSI, intra-abdominal abscess, or retained foreign body; I should confirm pathology review status and note any unexpected findings that alter surveillance, and I will use a concise problem list such as "Status post laparoscopic appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, postoperative day X, recovering as expected" versus "Status post perforated appendicitis with abscess, postoperative day Y, on antibiotics, risk for intra-abdominal abscess" to guide intensity of follow-up [^111MKBMj] [^114B3qdT]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include a routine WBC or CRP for everyone at follow-up, but I should correct that; routine labs are not indicated for asymptomatic, uncomplicated recoveries and should be reserved for clinical suspicion of complications.

> For the Plan, I need to ensure it is actionable and aligned with evidence. In low-risk, asymptomatic patients, a telemedicine visit is appropriate and can safely replace in-person follow-up; I should provide clear return precautions for fever, escalating pain, wound drainage, persistent vomiting, or inability to tolerate oral intake, and reinforce activity as tolerated with avoidance of heavy lifting until comfortable; medication reconciliation should confirm non-opioid analgesia as first-line and document any opioid quantity if still required; I should confirm wound care instructions and suture removal timing if applicable; for complicated cases, I will arrange in-person follow-up within 1–2 weeks, consider imaging if symptoms persist, and ensure antibiotic completion and documentation of adherence; I will also schedule pathology review and, when indicated, discuss interval appendectomy timing and shared decision-making with families, especially in pediatrics [^114B3qdT] [^116wYBbd] [^114nHaqt]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overpromising opioid elimination; educational pathways can reduce opioid prescribing without worsening pain control, but patient-specific needs should still be addressed [^116wYBbd].

> Let me consider special scenarios so the template remains adaptable. If the patient had perforated or gangrenous appendicitis, I should double-check for abscess risk and maintain a lower threshold for in-person visits and imaging; if an interval appendectomy is planned after initial nonoperative management of perforated appendicitis, I need to ensure shared decision-making and counseling about neoplasm risk in older adults, which can be substantial in some cohorts; in pediatrics, I should incorporate caregiver education, return-to-school timelines, and decision aids where relevant to reduce decisional conflict; if pathology reveals an appendiceal neoplasm, I should align follow-up with ASCRS guidance for surveillance including cross-sectional imaging and colonoscopy as indicated [^1135KB9K] [^114nHaqt] [^112HD6Mj]. I should confirm that I've integrated these branches into the template as conditional prompts rather than fixed orders, to preserve clinician judgment.

> Next, I should review quality metrics and documentation standards so the template supports performance improvement. I need to ensure the note captures whether the follow-up altered management, because routine in-person visits rarely do in uncomplicated cases; I should document antibiotic stewardship and non-opioid-first analgesia; I will track patient-reported outcomes such as pain, activity, and satisfaction; and I should confirm that pathology review and communication of unexpected findings are recorded, aligning with pediatric quality process measures for consistent outpatient follow-up and communication [^114B3qdT] [^116wYBbd] [^113x5PfE]. Wait, let me verify that I'm not implying mandatory imaging; imaging should be symptom-driven rather than routine in uncomplicated recoveries, which I will state explicitly in the template.

> I will now examine documentation best practices to ensure clarity and completeness. Using a SOAP structure with a concise one-liner in the Assessment improves readability; I should include patient-centered language and avoid jargon; I need to ensure the Plan has specific actions, responsible parties, and timelines; and I should confirm that the operative approach, intraoperative findings, and any drains or special circumstances are referenced or summarized to contextualize recovery expectations [^1118CWCS] [^115bhQ3G]. Hold on, I should verify that I've prompted for a brief review of the operative note details if the patient reports unexpected symptoms, to avoid missing a plausible iatrogenic or intraoperative contributor.

> Finally, I will synthesize a succinct, printable template that clinicians can adapt, while preserving the evidence-based guardrails. The template should open with patient identifiers and procedure/date, then proceed through Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, with embedded prompts for red flags, medication reconciliation, activity, wound care, and follow-up modality; it should include conditional branches for complicated disease, pediatrics, and unexpected pathology; and it should close with quality checkpoints such as whether management changed at this visit and whether patient education was provided, all consistent with the evidence that routine in-person follow-up rarely changes management in uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy [^114B3qdT]. I should double-check that the final version remains flexible enough for local workflow and payer constraints while maintaining safety and patient-centeredness.

A post-appendectomy SOAP note should document **pain control, wound healing, bowel function, and activity tolerance**, and screen for **infection, ileus, or bleeding** [^113Nv3FZ]. Include **objective vitals, incision inspection, and abdominal exam**; assess for complications such as SSI, abscess, or dehiscence; and provide a clear plan for analgesia, wound care, antibiotics, activity, and follow-up. Use this structured approach to ensure **comprehensive, consistent care** and early detection of complications [^115yWjvX].

---

## Subjective

Document the patient's **chief complaint** and **history of present illness** (HPI) with attention to pain, gastrointestinal function, and activity.

- **Chief complaint**: Patient's primary concern (e.g. "post-appendectomy follow-up").

- **Pain**: Location, intensity (0–10 scale), character, radiation, aggravating/relieving factors, analgesic use and effectiveness [^111sY8Aj].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, appetite, bowel movements, flatus, bloating, constipation, diarrhea [^111NogsU].

- **Activity tolerance**: Ability to ambulate, return to normal activities, fatigue, weakness.

- **Wound concerns**: Redness, swelling, discharge, pain, warmth, separation of wound edges.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, night sweats, malaise, weight loss.

---

## Objective

Record **vital signs**, **incision findings**, and a focused **abdominal exam**.

| **Attribute** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Vital signs | Temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation |
| General appearance | - Appearance <br/> - Level of discomfort <br/> - Ambulation status |
| Incision inspection | - Number <br/> - Location <br/> - Size <br/> - Redness <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Ecchymosis <br/> - Drainage <br/> - Dehiscence <br/> - Warmth <br/> - Pain on palpation |
| Abdominal exam | - Tenderness <br/> - Rebound <br/> - Guarding <br/> - Rigidity <br/> - Distension <br/> - Bowel sounds <br/> - Masses |
| Wound assessment | - Surgical site infection (erythema, warmth, purulence, fluctuance) <br/> - Hematoma <br/> - Seroma <br/> - Dehiscence |

---

## Assessment

Summarize the **postoperative status**, **complications**, and **recovery trajectory**.

- **Postoperative status**: Day post-op, surgical approach (open vs laparoscopic), intraoperative findings (simple vs complicated appendicitis) [^111sY8Aj].

- **Complications**: Presence or absence of surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess, ileus, bleeding, wound dehiscence, or other complications [^113kLrma].

- **Recovery trajectory**: On track vs delayed recovery, factors influencing recovery (e.g. age, comorbidities, operative complexity) [^115epWPU].

---

## Plan

Provide a clear, actionable plan covering **pain management**, **wound care**, **activity**, and **follow-up**.

- **Pain management**: Current analgesic regimen, adjustments needed, non-pharmacologic measures [^116wYBbd].

- **Wound care**: Instructions on dressing changes, showering, signs of infection, suture removal timing.

- **Activity**: Gradual return to normal activities, lifting restrictions, driving restrictions.

- **Medications**: Antibiotics if indicated, bowel regimen if needed, antiemetics if nauseated.

- **Follow-up**: Timing of next visit, imaging if indicated, patient education on warning signs requiring immediate attention [^1163hVX1].

---

## Example SOAP note

Here is a **concise example** illustrating the structure:

---

Subjective: The patient is a 25-year-old male, post-laparoscopic appendectomy day 5, reporting mild incisional pain (3/10), controlled with ibuprofen. He has no nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain; bowel movements are regular, and he is eating normally. He reports no fever, chills, or malaise and is ambulating without difficulty.

---

Objective: Vital signs are stable (T 37.0°C, HR 78, BP 120/80, RR 16, SpO2 98%). The patient appears comfortable and ambulates independently. Incisions are clean, dry, and intact, with minimal erythema at the umbilical port site and no drainage or dehiscence. The abdominal exam reveals mild tenderness at the umbilical incision, no rebound or guarding, no distension, and normal bowel sounds. No masses are appreciated.

---

Assessment: Post-laparoscopic appendectomy day 5, recovering well without complications. Mild incisional erythema likely represents normal healing; no evidence of surgical site infection or other complications.

---

Plan: Continue current analgesic regimen (ibuprofen 600 mg PO q8h PRN). Keep incisions clean and dry; shower permitted; no soaking. Gradually increase activity, avoiding heavy lifting (> 10 lbs) for 2 weeks. No antibiotics required. Return to clinic in 2 weeks for wound check and suture removal if nonabsorbable sutures were used. Educate on signs of infection (fever, increasing redness, warmth, purulent drainage, worsening pain) and advise immediate contact if these occur [^notfound].

---

A structured post-appendectomy SOAP note ensures **consistent, comprehensive care** by systematically capturing pain, wound healing, bowel function, and activity, while screening for complications and providing a clear plan for recovery and follow-up [^1163hVX1].

### Routine in-person post-operative follow-up for uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy does not change management [^114B3qdT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eliminating points in the continuum of care that do not change management is a safe strategy for cost containment and workflow efficiency in health systems. As a process improvement initiative, we sought to identify whether routine, outpatient follow-up changes management in laparoscopic appendectomy in a military hospital.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of adult patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy during a one-year period. The primary outcome was identification of a change in management during routine in person follow-up. Secondary outcomes included location of patient presentation with a post-operative event (clinic, emergency department, primary care provider), and if those visits changed management. Events were defined as any deviation from the typical post-operative course within 6 weeks of surgery, including abnormal specimen pathology.

Results

One-hundred and seventy-six appendectomies were performed over one year, and 148 patients met inclusion criteria (median age = 27, 66.9% male). Perforation was identified in 10.1% of patients. Seventeen-point-five percent of patients had a post-operative event, of which persistent pain was the most common. Only 2.0% of all patients saw a change in management at their routine in person follow-up appointment. Eighty percent of patients with any post-operative events sought care outside of their routine in person follow up appointments. No variable was independently associated with a change in management.

Conclusion

Routine in-person clinical follow-up for laparoscopic appendectomy almost never changes management. Perforated appendicitis may be an indication for in-person follow-up. Considering a telemedicine model for post-operative follow-up of laparoscopic appendectomy patients will provide a safe and effective alternative to in-person clinic visits, while saving patients time and allowing providers the clinic freedom to prioritize more urgent and new patients.

Appendicitis research recommendations emphasize that further long-term outcome and quality of life data is needed for both treatment options, studies should transparently report the diagnostic criteria as well as treatment protocols, and evidence of the value placed by patients or parents on the avoidance of appendectomy relative to the risk of recurrence would be useful.

### Variation in postoperative narcotic prescribing after pediatric appendectomy [^116wYBbd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Overuse of prescription opioids by both pediatric and adult patients has garnered significant attention in recent years. Educational interventions have been shown to decrease prescription opioids post-operatively in the adult population; similar data have not previously been reported in pediatrics.

Methods

Educational interventions included staff education, institution of opioid standardization protocol, and distribution of educational materials to families. Chart review was performed pre- and post-intervention to compare prescribing practices following appendectomy in patients less than 19 years of age. Follow-up phone calls were used to assess patient satisfaction and pain control.

Results

Three hundred thirteen cases were identified pre-intervention [PRE] and compared to 119 cases postintervention [POST]. 84.3% of patients were given a prescription for opioids at time of discharge in the PRE cohort compared to 6.7% (p < 0.001) POST. There was a significant increase in non-opioid analgesia (p < 0.001) POST. There was no significant variability in opioid usage by type of surgery performed, attending provider, or patients' gender or age. Of the patients in the POST cohort, 60.5% were available for telephone follow-up. More than 80% of patients were given acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen POST and 94.4% reported adequate pain control; 88.9% reported that they would agree to avoid opioids again in the future. On follow-up survey, there was no increase in emergency department visits or phone calls for poorly controlled pain following the intervention.

Conclusion

Low-fidelity educational interventions and creation of a standardized pathway is an effective tool to reduce opioid prescribing and promote alternative means of analgesia without an increase in readmissions or presentation for pain.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^116hAV8B]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Limitations — The main limitation is the low certainty of evidence for all of the key questions; there is minimal long-term data for both recurrence of appendicitis and malignancy rates, which decreases the ability to strongly advocate for a particular recommendation; and the level of importance for the patient-centered outcomes was determined by the panel members rather than by patient advocates, so different patients may place more or less weight on these outcomes, potentially changing the balance of effects.

### Improving medical student surgery notes through near-peer targeted education: a qualitative analysis [^1118CWCS]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is necessary for medical students (MSs) to develop proficiency in medical documentation before residency; however, there is limited education focused on this task. We conducted a qualitative analysis of surgical clerkship note evaluations to create an intervention to improve note writing skills and utilized post-intervention assessments to determine the effect on the quality of clerkship student notes.

Methods

An intervention consisting of an in-person senior MS led lecture during the surgery clerkship orientation focused on Subjective-Objective-Assessment-Plan (SOAP) notes was introduced to MS with limited prior note writing education. Examples of complete and accurate surgical SOAP notes were discussed in-person and shared online. Reports from note assessments were analyzed for four clerkship cycles (2 pre-intervention and 2 post-intervention). Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact tests were performed to compare assessment responses pre-intervention and post-intervention. Thematic analysis was performed on open-ended responses focused on areas for improvement from the anonymized evaluations.

Results

One hundred seventy-one total note assessments were evaluated (85 pre-intervention and 86 post-intervention). Pre-intervention, MS struggled with note organization and lack of inclusion of patient-centered language within their documentation. Post-intervention, students struggled less frequently with flow and chronology of notes but had continued opportunities to improve in concise and organized presentation of information. Students improved in their ability to provide a one-liner, prioritize a differential diagnosis, and organize and structure their notes effectively. Feedback focused on advanced skills including plan specificity, discharge details and parameters, or advanced physical exam finding documentation.

Conclusions

MS improved their SOAP format note writing skills in response to a targeted near-peer led educational intervention. Remaining growth opportunities in note writing skills appear more connected to evolving clinical reasoning and surgery-specific knowledge which can evolve with ongoing exposure and further education.

Profile of post-discharge recovery in each treatment arm

Figure 1
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (CHU-9D) during the trial. Data are mean with SD, HRQoL is scored on a scale from 0 (dead) to1 (perfect health).

While we acknowledge a relatively small sample size and incomplete data, our observation of an apparent difference in early post-discharge recovery profile between participants allocated to appendicectomy or non-operative treatment is an important finding with relevance for both clinical practice and future research. Avoidance of general anaesthesia, trauma of surgery and lack of exposure to operative/postoperative complications are viewed as potential benefits of non-operative treatment over surgery by patients and parents. Our data suggest there may be additional benefits to non-operative treatment over surgery in terms of more rapid return to baseline activity status and societal benefits with fewer days of parental work absence. Patients and parents may wish to consider these as well as more direct clinical outcomes when considering choice of treatment. Furthermore, there appear to be short-term differences in HRQoL between treatment arms, which may be clinically meaningful and will inform the design of future cost–utility analyses.

Overall our data emphasise the importance of measuring a full range of outcomes including these patient-centred outcomes in future research and provide greater insights into short-term differences in outcomes between treatment arms.

### Outcomes in 74 patients with an appendicolith who did not undergo surgery: is follow-up imaging necessary? [^115QoEDM]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to report the clinical outcome of patients with an appendicolith on computed tomography (CT) who did not undergo appendectomy on initial presentation. Reports from 45,901 abdominal CT examinations performed between March 2000-March 2004 containing the words "appendicolith" or "fecalith" were identified. Patients with appendicoliths not initially undergoing appendectomy were followed to assess re-presentation with abdominal pain ultimately requiring appendectomy. Seventy-four patients had an appendicolith on CT report, were discharged without surgery, and had clinical follow-up. Fifty-two of 74 (70%) patients had no appendiceal symptoms, were given an alternate diagnosis, and did not return with appendicitis. Twenty-two of 74 (30%) patients were discharged without acute appendicitis but with possible appendiceal symptoms. Five of these 22 (23%) patients returned with pathologically proven acute appendicitis, and all had possible appendiceal symptoms at initial presentation. An appendicolith may be a marker of increased risk for appendicitis but is not an indication for appendectomy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1165Vqrr]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Appendicitis research priorities — future research recommendations: High-quality data are essential to continue to inform this discussion, with a paucity of quality-of-life measure-based studies and cost-effective analyses that could augment the clinical outcome data. The patient perspective on both short- and long-term outcomes would be helpful in studies going forward, and these data are required to fully illustrate the risk versus benefit profile. Large database studies may provide some additional insight without the inherent challenges of randomized controlled trials, but these studies have additional sets of limitations which can limit the interpretability and generalizability of conclusions drawn from them.

### Long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial of open versus laparoscopic appendicectomy [^111MKBMj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to assess long-term outcome following open versus laparoscopic appendicectomy.

Methods

A total of 105 patients with suspected acute appendicitis were randomized to LA (51) or OA (54) between 1997 and 1999 at one hospital. Perioperative factors and follow-up data from the outpatient clinic were recorded. Information about symptoms and overall satisfaction was obtained by telephone interview. In addition, appendicectomy data for 2008 were analysed retrospectively for comparison in a contemporary setting.

Results

Data from 52 patients who had OA and 47 who had LA were analysed. OA was performed mostly by trainees, but LA was more likely to be undertaken by a consultant. The open procedure was quicker than the laparoscopic operation in the trial period (median 38 versus 65 min respectively; P < 0.001), but the difference was only 10 min in 2008. The OA group returned to work later than the LA group (median 13 versus 8 days; P = 0.013) and had more complications (22 versus 6; P = 0.014). Only one patient (OA) had a reoperation, owing to abdominal adhesions. Among 76 patients available for telephone interview, satisfaction scores were marginally higher for LA than OA.

Conclusion

LA has some advantages compared with an open approach.

### Appendectomy during pregnancy: follow-up of progeny [^115JqnZM]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of appendicitis in pregnant patients is 0.04% to 0.20%, making it the most common nonobstetric surgical procedure in pregnancy. This study examines whether an appendectomy during any stage of pregnancy affects future development of motor, sensory, and social skills of the progeny.

Study Design

A prospective survey was administered to women who underwent an appendectomy during pregnancy at Mount Sinai Hospital from 2000 to 2009. The survey, which ranged from 1 to 9 years postpartum, consisted of questions about motor, sensory, and social development of their progeny, based on established pediatric milestones. Data were collected from the medical records of mother and child. Additional follow-up was gathered from outpatient and emergency room records.

Results

Fifty-two pregnant patients underwent an appendectomy during our study period. All pregnancies continued to full term with the exception of one fetal death due to extreme prematurity. Twenty-nine patients completed the follow-up survey, making the yield response rate 55.8%. There were 7 (26.9%), 14 (48.3%), and 8 (27.6%) appendectomies in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Mean follow-up time was 47.2 months (range 13 to 117 months) after delivery. None of the children exhibited any developmental delay by their third year of life. Timing of the surgery (trimester) had no effect on child development.

Conclusions

Appendectomy during pregnancy is not associated with developmental delays in children, regardless of which trimester the procedure was performed. All children in this study had normal motor, sensory, and social development by 3 years of age.

### Risk of appendiceal neoplasm in periappendicular abscess in patients treated with interval appendectomy vs follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging: 1-year outcomes of the peri-appendicitis acuta randomized clinical trial [^1135KB9K]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The step after conservative treatment of periappendicular abscess arouses controversy, ranging from recommendations to abandon interval appendectomy based on low recurrence rates of the precipitating diagnosis to performing routine interval appendectomy owing to novel findings of increased neoplasm risk at interval appendectomy. To our knowledge, there are no randomized clinical trials with sufficient patient numbers comparing these treatments.

Objective

To compare interval appendectomy and follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging after initial successful nonoperative treatment of periappendicular abscess.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Peri-Appendicitis Acuta randomized clinical trial was a multicenter, noninferiority trial conducted in 5 hospitals in Finland. All patients between age 18 and 60 years with periappendicular abscess diagnosed by computed tomography and successful initial nonoperative treatment from January 2013 to April 2016 were included. Data analysis occurred from April 2016 to September 2017.

Interventions

Patients were randomized either to interval appendectomy or follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging; all patients underwent colonoscopy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was treatment success, defined as an absence of postoperative morbidity in the appendectomy group and appendicitis recurrence in the follow-up group. Secondary predefined end points included neoplasm incidence, inflammatory bowel disease, length of hospital stay, and days of sick leave.

Results

A total of 60 patients were included (36 men [60%]; median [interquartile range] age: interval appendectomy group, 49 [18–60] years; follow-up group, 47 [22–61] years). An interim analysis in April 2016 showed a high rate of neoplasm (10 of 60 [17%]), with all neoplasms in patients older than 40 years. The trial was prematurely terminated owing to ethical concerns. Two more neoplasms were diagnosed after study termination, resulting in an overall neoplasm incidence of 20% (12 of 60). On study termination, the overall morbidity rate of interval appendectomy was 10% (3 of 30), and 10 of the patients in the follow-up group (33%) had undergone appendectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance

The neoplasm rate after periappendicular abscess in this small study population was high, especially in patients older than 40 years. If this considerable rate of neoplasms after periappendicular abscess is validated by future studies, it would argue for routine interval appendectomy in this setting.

### Developing a patient information leaflet to improve information offered to patients undergoing appendicectomy [^111kzLYh]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

An appendicectomy is one of the most common operations performed in North Devon District Hospital (NDDH) with over 200 carried out between 2013 to 2014. Despite this, a patient information leaflet (PIL) about appendicectomy is unavailable, which is compromising standards of care and uncompliant with Trust policy. This project aimed to establish levels of written information offered to patients undergoing an appendicectomy, develop a PIL, and assess its impact on the provision of written information using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) methodology. Case notes of patients operated on between January 2013 to October 2014 were randomly sampled at baseline. The primary outcome measure was whether written information was offered, retrospectively determined by reviewing the medical record. A PIL was then designed following a standard protocol, published on NDDH's website and distributed onto surgical wards. Posters were displayed in staff rooms to encourage use of the PIL for PDSA cycle 1. An article further promoting the PIL was written for the wards monthly newsletter and a local presentation was delivered for PDSA cycle 2. Patients views about the PIL were assessed prospectively using a questionnaire. The primary outcome was measured at 10 weeks following PDSA cycle 1 and at 5 months following PDSA cycle 2. 17% (5/30) of patients were offered written information at baseline. Following PDSA cycle 1, this rose substantially to 53% (8/15) but rates fell to 46% (7/15) following PDSA cycle 2. 89% of patients (8/9) surveyed agreed or strongly agreed that the PIL was helpful. This project indicates that provision of written information is poor despite it being highly valued by patients. The first ever Trust appendicectomy PIL has been established which substantially improved provision of written information after 10 weeks. However, continued education of staff is essential to embed good practice over the long term.

### Needs assessment of parents for a patient decision aid in pediatric interval appendectomy via the qualitative interview method [^114yFYJj]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Usefulness of a decision aid

All parents stated a decision aid would be invaluable for future parents in this situation, with most (n = 10) expressing how they wished such a tool would have been available to them.

I think because you're often dealing with many different health professionals, having something in front of you, concrete — that even when you're exhausted or kind of overwhelmed — it's easier to have something that you can refer back to that can help you make that decision. — Parent 8

It (PDA) could help a lot with making the decision. — Parent 6

I think future parents who are in that same situation could really benefit from helpful weighing out their options. — Parent 1

I feel like it (PDA) would certainly help if somebody's at a crossroads, for sure. I feel like we're at that crossroads where we're kind of debating yay or nay. — Parent 12

Useful features of a PDA

The final theme that emerged was useful features of a PDA for parents/caregivers in this situation (box 1).

Box 1
Useful features of a patient decision aid

General information on the condition (eg, prevalence, severity, long-term effects) and prognosis.

Parent stories of similar experiences and social connections.
Treatment options (probabilities for risks and benefits).
Recovery information.
Symptoms of recurrence.

The majority of parents (n = 11) stated that an overview of risks versus benefits of both treatment options including treatment/recovery timelines would be important to include. This also should include a list of symptoms for possible recurrence. Numerous parents (n = 7) wanted this information to include statistics for recurrence and surgical complications. Seven parents talked about how useful it would be to have stories from other parents in the decision aid or to have a link to a platform to discuss treatment options with other families.

Preferences for formatting varied, with a physical pamphlet being the most popular choice, followed by electronic PDF, or an electronic app. Some suggested having helpful visual graphics regarding anatomy and treatments.

Timing of when to deliver of the PDA varied among those who discussed it. Some suggested it would be helpful if it was received at initial discharge (n = 4), whereas others felt it would be most appropriate at the follow-up appointment (n = 3). Few felt it would be useful during initial admission (n = 2), with many saying that they were still processing all that was occurring.

### Appendectomy versus non-operative treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children: study protocol for a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^111qZFHR]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

We have therefore selected a primary end point that we believe reflects the important aspects of treatment outcomes on which we as clinicians and researchers would base future treatment decisions for children with acute appendicitis. We have also been influenced by our discussions with our patients and their parents. Negative appendectomy is a frequent finding in most series of paediatric appendectomy and suggests that an unnecessary operation has been performed. A benefit of a non-operative approach would be to avoid an unnecessary operation, although at the cost of an unnecessary course of antibiotics. Complications of treatment are important when evaluating treatment efficacy. Our definition of complications has been designed to capture the failure of non-operative treatment as well as complications requiring general anaesthesia in either treatment group. General anaesthesia has been selected as a marker of the impact of the complication on the patient as per the widely used Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. Finally we have included recurrent appendicitis in our primary outcome. If the rate of recurrent appendicitis is high then the benefit of initial non-operative treatment is less. If an appendectomy is going to be required for recurrence then it may as well be performed at first presentation. As the primary motivation of non-operative treatment is to avoid an operation and general anaesthesia, we felt the components of the primary outcome should reflect this motivation and therefore be centred around general anaesthesia. Other complications not requiring a general anaesthetic are extremely important to capture and are therefore included as a specific secondary outcome measure (ie, complications not resulting in general anaesthesia classified according to the Clavien-Dindo Scale). In addition the resource utilisation aspect of these complications will be captured in the economic analysis.

Currently diagnosis of acute appendicitis in participating centres results in a false positive rate of 4%–6%, that is, a 4%–6% rate of negative appendectomy. Thus, some of those recovering from non-operative management of suspected acute appendicitis will likely be those false positives who did not have acute appendicitis in the first place, in addition to children with antibiotic-responsive acute appendicitis. As no pathological specimen is taken from those who recover effectively with non-operative treatment, we will not accurately know how many of these patients actually had appendicitis. It would not be ethically acceptable to undertake additional tests (eg, CT, laparoscopic biopsy) in order to determine whether these patients actually had appendicitis or not, but we believe that not operating on patients who do not have acute appendicitis is one of the potential benefits of non-operative management.

Study Outcomes

Primary Outcomes

This study had 3 primary outcomes: (1) caregiver decision self-efficacy immediately after the treatment decision using the Decision Self-efficacy Scale; (2) caregiver health care satisfaction at discharge using the PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) 4.0 Healthcare Satisfaction Generic Module–Parent Report; and (3) disability days of the patient at 1 year. Disability days were defined as days in which the patient did not participate in their normal routine secondary to discomfort, symptoms, complications, or follow-up related to their appendicitis treatment.

Secondary Outcomes

Decision-making and patient-centered outcomes assessed in caregivers included decision self-efficacy at discharge and 30-day follow-up; preparation for decision making, decisional conflict, and Parent-Patient Activation Measure (Parent-PAM) immediately after treatment decision using the Preparation for Decision Making Scale, Decisional Conflict Scale, and a version of the healthy child Parent-PAM adapted with permission; decision regret at discharge and 30-day follow-up using the Decision Regret Scale; health-related quality of life at discharge and 30-day follow-up using self-reports and caregiver proxy reports on the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales–Child and Parent Report; health care satisfaction at 30-day follow-up; satisfaction with decision at 30-day and 1-year follow-up, and caregiver knowledge or recall immediately after treatment decision and at 30-day follow-up using an internally created survey. Medical outcomes of the patient assessed included disability days, length of hospital stay, medical or surgical complications, recurrence, and readmissions. eTable 4 in Supplement 1 details all outcomes assessed. Complicated appendicitis was defined based on pathologic results and included ruptured, perforated, and gangrenous appendicitis.

### Appendicectomy plus standard medical therapy versus standard medical therapy alone for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (ACCURE): a pragmatic, open-label, international, randomised trial [^116bpP7B]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Procedures

Patients in the appendicectomy group underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy within 9 weeks of randomisation. The appendix, including the cuff of caecal pole surrounding the appendiceal orifice, was removed using a laparoscopic endostapler by or under direct supervision of a senior colorectal surgeon; a detailed standard operating procedure is listed in the appendix (p 6). Standard day-care procedures were followed across sites, similar to those used for typical day-case laparoscopic colorectal operations. Patients were typically discharged on the same day, provided they met standard discharge criteria: being afebrile and clinically stable, tolerating oral intake, mobilising independently, having adequate pain control with oral analgesia, and showing no signs of complications. No standard additional postoperative antibiotics were prescribed. Both groups continued their medical therapy at the discretion of the treating gastroenterologist.

Follow-up included outpatient clinic visits or telephone consultations at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after appendicectomy or after randomisation for the control group. Postoperative complications and surgical morbidity were assessed at 6 weeks after appendicectomy. Relapse data, disease activity, outpatient clinic visits, hospital admission, and medication use were assessed quarterly. Disease activity was measured using the total Mayo score at baseline and 12 months, and the non-invasive partial Mayo score at 3, 6, and 9 months. An endoscopy was done at the time of clinical suspicion of a relapse or at the end of the 12-month trial period to objectively assess mucosal appearance and determine the total Mayo score. Health-related quality of life was measured with the EQ-5D 3-level utility score (EQ-5D-3L; range –0.33 to 1.00, with higher scores indicating better health status), the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life core score (EORTC QLQ-C30; range 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better global quality of life), and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ; range 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), and questionnaires were completed at baseline and quarterly throughout the 12-month follow-up period. The protocol was amended after 79 patients had been enrolled to remove concomitant immunomodulators as an exclusion criterion (to increase the trial's generalisability and external validity, and to enhance recruitment rates) and to include a dichotomous patient-reported global change assessment at 12 months follow-up, to assess the clinical relevance of IBDQ changes. The trial design and procedures are detailed in the appendix (p 11).

### Development and evaluation of a patient decision aid for pediatric interval appendectomy [^114nHaqt]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

One option for the treatment of perforated appendicitis in pediatric patients is interval appendectomy (IA). A patient decision aid (PDA) can be useful in the decision-making process regarding IA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate parents' decisional conflict before and after engaging with a developed PDA.

Methods

Participants included (a) parents who are considering IA surgery for their child, (b) have not yet had their follow-up appointment postdischarge, and (c) were fluent in either the official languages of English or French. This study used a pretest and post-test design to measure participants' decisional conflict and treatment option choice. Perceptions and acceptability of the PDA were also assessed.

Results

A total of 18 participants completed the study (16 mothers). Major findings include significant decreases in all Decisional Conflict Scale items from pre-PDA to post-PDA engagement, except for one item. The majority of participants perceived the PDA to be useful, easy to find information regarding risks and provided enough information to help them make a decision regarding their child's treatment.

Conclusions

This is the first study to develop and evaluate a PDA among parents who are making a decision regarding IA surgery. The results showed a significant decrease in decisional conflict after using the PDA. The results also showed that the PDA was generally accepted among parents and had positive perceptions regarding length, content, and balance. The use of PDA for this population can help ease feelings of decisional conflict and equip parents with the information to make informed decisions.

Criteria for inclusion/exclusion of titles, abstracts, and articles — study selection for surveillance after colonoscopy was staged: At title and abstract review, the goal was to identify articles examining the relationship between baseline colonoscopy examination and subsequent neoplasia on follow-up, with exclusions including narrative review or editorial, guidelines, focus on high-risk conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, history of CRC, or hereditary CRC syndromes, and focus on children; additional abstract exclusions included abstract only; no associated article, focus exclusively on endoscopic resection method or immediate completeness of resection, and focus other than on post-polypectomy surveillance or normal colonoscopy outcomes. For full-article review, inclusion required relevance to patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions — specifically, relevance to 1 or more PICO questions, examination of baseline colonoscopy findings and detection of CRC or advanced adenoma on follow-up, or examination of surveillance vs no surveillance for individuals after baseline polypectomy.

### Meta-analysis of in-hospital delay before surgery as a risk factor for complications in patients with acute appendicitis [^116SxBoC]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Critical appraisal

All studies were observational cohort studies (40 retrospective, 5 prospective). Therefore, risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (Table S3, supporting information). Most studies did not apply inclusion criteria other than a confirmed diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Seven studies included only patients under the age of 18 years. As children comprise a substantial proportion of patients with acute appendicitis, all study cohorts were considered representative of patients in the community. In all studies the unexposed cohorts were drawn from the same hospitals and communities.

This review included only patients with a surgically or pathologically confirmed diagnosis of acute appendicitis; therefore, exposure was ascertained in all patients. All but four studies did not affirm the absence of perforation of the appendix at the start of treatment. This introduced bias for the outcome measure 'complicated appendicitis' at the time of surgery. After all, when a case of acute appendicitis is already perforated on arrival in the hospital, delaying the treatment could never result in a change of the outcome 'perforation'. Four 18, 35, 36, 47 of 45 studies attempted to reduce this limitation by including only patients without signs of complicated appendicitis on preoperative CT.

Only studies that reported adjusted ORs gave comparability between the study groups. All other studies suffered from limited comparability because of the tendency to operate on clinically ill patients earlier. Assessment of outcome was not blinded and based on medical records in all studies. Details of the follow‐up were lacking in most studies. For studies on the association between delay and rates of complicated appendicitis, this was not a major problem. All patients underwent surgery, which automatically means sufficient follow‐up to verify the stage of appendicitis. However, all other outcomes (SSI and morbidity) occur during follow‐up. Therefore, the lack of description of this follow‐up, especially the lack of information about the differences in rates of loss to follow‐up between groups, could have introduced attrition bias.

The level of evidence by GRADE was downgraded from 'low' (evidence originating from observational studies) to 'very low' due to study quality and inconsistency (Table 1).

### Patient-centred outcomes following non-operative treatment or appendicectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children [^114W749z]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of appendicitis in children has traditionally been by appendicectomy. Over recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of non-operative treatment as an alternative to appendicectomybut comparative outcomes of these two different treatment modalities are poorly understood. Previous reports have tended to focus on outcomes most relevant to surgeons such as surgical complications and other treatments required rather than considering a full range of outcomes that we know are important to patients and families. Here, we report a number of patient-centred outcomes including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in data arising from a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT).

A feasibility RCT comparing appendicectomy and non-operative treatment in children with suspected uncomplicated acute appendicitis was undertaken in three UK centres over a 12-month period beginning March 2017. Full details of the methodology, key clinical findings and feasibility findings of the trial have been previously reported. To understand patient-centred markers of recovery, we used parent completed diary cards following hospital discharge to record duration of analgesia use, time taken to return to normal and full activities and duration of parental absence from work. We used the CHU-9D toolto measure HRQoL during the trial period. Since this was a feasibility trial, we report descriptive data without formal statistical analyses. Data are reported on an intention-to-treat basis as per trial allocation.

Patients and families were involved in the design of the trial, development of patient and family facing materials and defining outcomes to be measured.

A total of 57 participants were enrolled in the trial of whom 28 were allocated to appendicectomy and 29 to non-operative treatment. Data relating to early post-discharge recovery were available for 26 participants — 15 in the appendicectomy arm and 11 in the non-operative treatment arm (Table 1). The proportion of participants taking analgesia was generally lower for each day following discharge in the non-operative treatment arm than the appendicectomy arm. Following non-operative treatment, participants were able to return to normal or full activities earlier than those in the appendicectomy arm. Fewer than half of participants in the appendicectomy reported being able to participate in full activities by 2 weeks following discharge. Parents of participants in the non-operative treatment arm were able to return to work earlier than those in the appendicectomy arm. HRQoL assessed using the CHU-9D tool at enrolment, hospital discharge and further time points during the 6-month follow-up period is shown in figure 1.

### Patient and parental scar assessment after single incision versus standard 3-port laparoscopic appendectomy: long-term follow-up from a prospective randomized trial [^1147cp8k]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Single site laparoscopy for appendectomy is a technique with several case series suggesting a cosmetic advantage, but without prospective comparative data. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing single site laparoscopic appendectomy to the standard 3-port approach, including scar assessment at early and long-term follow-up.

Methods

Enrolled patients over 12years old and parents of patients less than 12years old were asked to complete the validated Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) at early follow-up around 6weeks and by phone after 18months. The PSAQ consists of 4 scored subscales: Appearance, Consciousness, Appearance Satisfaction, and Symptom Satisfaction. Each subscale has a set of questions with a 4-point categorical response (1 = most favorable, 4 = least favorable). The sum of the scores quantifies each subscale.

Results

Early questionnaires were obtained from 98 3-port and 100 single-site patients with the single-site approach producing superior overall scar assessment (P = 0.003). By telephone follow-up, questionnaires were completed by 49 3-port and 56 single-site patients at a median of 25 (18–32) months. In this longer-term follow-up, overall scar assessment was not significantly different between groups (P = 0.06).

Conclusion

Patients or parents express superior scar assessment with the single site approach at early follow-up, but this difference disappears in the long-term.

Results

Study profile

A total of 755 patients were included in the present study. Some 72% of the patients underwent conventional appendectomy (OA), and in the other 28% the operation was performed laparoscopically (LA). A diagnostic laparoscopy preceded 32% of the conventional appendectomies, and 7% of the laparoscopic appendectomies required conversion to a McBurney's incision. Some of the patients had died (n = 34) or emigrated (n = 46), or the contact information was missing or false (n = 50). A questionnaire was sent to the remaining 625 patients, which was replied by 46%. After they received a reminder, another 87 patients responded. Patient information was obtained by the general practitioner for another 246 patients. Overall, a response rate of 83% was achieved (Fig. 1).

Patient characteristics

Demographics for the two groups are shown in Table 1. The groups had an identical median age (34 years). The OA group consisted of more men (63%), while the LA group was dominated by women (63%). Prior abdominal surgery, unrelated to appendicitis, was found in 16.3% (OA) and 16.2% (LA) of the patients (NS). There was no significant difference in the mean follow-up of the two groups: 9.0 years (OA) vs. 8.7 years (LA; p = 0.321).

### Needs assessment of parents for a patient decision aid in pediatric interval appendectomy via the qualitative interview method [^11142V7r]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Appendicitis is one of the most commonly encountered pediatric surgical diagnoses, with non-operative management of perforated appendicitis leading to two treatment options: an interval appendectomy (IA) or expectant management. The primary objective of this study was to assess parents' need for a patient decision aid (PDA) among parents considering IA or expectant management. A secondary objective was to determine parent preferences for the format and distribution plan of a drafted patient decision aid.

Methods

Coulter's systematic development process for PDA was used to guide the assessment interviews for parents. Participants included caregivers of a patient who experienced perforated appendicitis, and admission between 2019 and 2020. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted to collect information about decision-making needs of parents of children who experienced perforated appendicitis.

Results

A total of 12 different parents participated in the interviews. Results indicate decisional conflict associated with the lack of evidence for optimal treatment, supporting the need for the development of a patient decision aid to assist in clarifying information and parent values with practitioners. Parents clearly identified a need for evidence to support decision-making in various formats (eg, pamphlet or electronic). Timing of when to deliver the PDA varied (ie, during hospital admission, at discharge, or at follow-up appointment).

Conclusion

Results indicated various factors contributing to parental decisional conflict, including the lack of evidence showing the optimal treatment, the need for more information, and guidance from practitioners. Overall, findings indicate a strong need for a patient decision aid.

### Operative findings are a better predictor of resource utilization in pediatric appendicitis [^115epWPU]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Post-operative management following appendectomy is dependent upon intraoperative assessment. We determined concordance between surgical and histopathologic diagnosis to better predict resource utilization in pediatric patients undergoing appendectomy.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 326 patients with operative appendicitis from July 2012 to July 2013 was performed. Based on operative findings, patients were classified as simple appendicitis (SA) or complex appendicitis (CA).

Results

The SA group included 194 (59.5%) patients while the CA group included 132 (40.5%) patients. There were significant differences in WBC, CRP, operative time, length of stay, and 30-day complications. Seventy percent of patients with intra-operative findings of SA were found to have complex pathology while 10.6% with intra-operative findings of CA were found to have simple pathology. There is poor agreement between intra-operative findings and histopathologic findings (κ = 0.173). Although 70% of patients with intra-operative findings of SA were labeled as complex pathology, 86% followed a fast track protocol (same day discharge) with a low complication rate (1.7%).

Conclusions

Pathology findings that overestimate the severity of disease correlate poorly with the post-operative outcomes for appendicitis. We conclude that operative findings are more predictive of clinical course than histopathologic results. This can have an impact on resource utilization planning.

### Should ambulatory appendectomy become the standard treatment for acute appendicitis? [^111j774a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Appendectomy is increasingly performed as a 'short stay' or 'ambulatory' procedure, yet there is no consensus for selection of patients with acute appendicitis for ambulatory surgery (AS). We aimed to compare characteristics and outcomes of complicated and uncomplicated appendectomies performed in ambulatory vs. conventional settings, and to determine factors associated with unexpected re-consultations and re-hospitalizations.

Methods

The authors reviewed a consecutive series of 185 laparoscopic appendectomies. Whenever possible, patients were offered AS, defined as 'discharge on the same working day'. Multivariable regressions were performed to determine associations of unexpected re-consultations and re-hospitalizations with surgery type (ambulatory or conventional) and patient characteristics (age, gender, obesity, symptoms, appendicolith, perforations, appendix diameter, serologic results, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and Saint-Antoine score).

Results

From the initial cohort, 117 patients (63.2%) were eligible for AS, of which 8 had peri- or post-operative contraindications. Therefore, 109 patients (58.9%) were operated by AS, with median length of stay 8.5 h (range, 3.3–20.5). Ambulatory cases had a lower incidence of complications (11.9%) than conventional cases (25.0%) (p = 0.029). Uni- and multi-variable regressions revealed that unexpected re-consultations were not significantly associated with any of the pre- or peri-operative variables but that unexpected re-hospitalizations were 4 times more likely for patients with appendicolith (OR, 4.32; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Ambulatory surgery could be considered as a standard procedure for both complicated and uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Appendicolith was found to be an independent risk factor for unexpected re-hospitalization and should therefore trigger closer monitoring.

### Quality of life assessment between laparoscopic appendectomy at presentation and interval appendectomy for perforated appendicitis with abscess: analysis of a prospective randomized trial [^117TLFtg]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The current study examined the impact of immediate laparoscopic surgery vs nonoperative initial management followed by interval appendectomy for appendicitis with abscess on child and family psychosocial well-being.

Methods

After obtaining Internal Review Board approval, 40 patients presenting with a perforated appendicitis and a well-formed abscess were randomized to surgical condition. Parents were asked to complete child quality of life and parenting stress ratings at presentation, at 2 weeks postadmission, and at approximately 12 weeks postadmission (2 weeks postoperation for the interval appendectomy group).

Results

Children in the interval arm experienced trends toward poorer quality of life at 2 and 12 weeks postadmission. However, no group differences in parenting stress were observed at 2 weeks postoperation. At 12 weeks postadmission, participants in the interval condition demonstrated significant impairment in both frequency and difficulty of problems contributing to parenting distress.

Conclusion

Families experience significant parenting distress related to the child's functioning and disruption in the child's quality of life that may be because of the delay in fully resolving the child's medical condition. In addition, parents experience negative consequences to their own stress as a result of the delay before the child's appendectomy.

The value of laparoscopy in appendicitis is not established. Studies suffer from multiple limitations. Our aim is to compare the safety and benefits of laparoscopic versus open appendectomy in a prospective randomized double blind study.

Methods

Two hundred forty-seven patients were analyzed following either laparoscopic or open appendectomy. A standardized wound dressing was applied blinding both patients and independent data collectors. Surgical technique was standardized among 4 surgeons. The main outcome measures were postoperative complications. Secondary outcome measures included evaluation of pain and activity scores at base line preoperatively and on every postoperative day, as well as resumption of diet and length of stay. Activity scores and quality of life were assessed on short-term follow-up.

Results

There was no mortality. The overall complication rate was similar in both groups (18.5% versus 17% in the laparoscopic and open groups respectively), but some early complications in the laparoscopic group required a reoperation. Operating time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (80 minutes versus 60 minutes; P = 0.000) while there was no difference in the pain scores and medications, resumption of diet, length of stay, or activity scores. At 2 weeks, there was no difference in the activity or pain scores, but physical health and general scores on the short-form 36 (SF36) quality of life assessment forms were significantly better in the laparoscopic group. Appendectomy for acute or complicated (perforated and gangrenous) appendicitis had similar complication rates, regardless of the technique (P = 0.181).

Conclusions

Unlike other minimally invasive procedures, laparoscopic appendectomy did not offer a significant advantage over open appendectomy in all studied parameters except quality of life scores at 2 weeks. It also took longer to perform. The choice of the procedure should be based on surgeon or patient preference.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^111NogsU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) introduction — clinical impact and prior guidance notes that PONV is a common adverse event after surgery and anesthesia, and it is distressing for patients, delays post-anesthesia recovery, and can sometimes lead to more serious complications. Optimal management of PONV requires a multidisciplinary approach, with evidence-based care and appropriate institutional infrastructure, and in the last consensus guideline, the expert panel recommended a general approach to multimodal PONV prophylaxis, and rescue treatment with antiemetics from a different pharmacological class. Since the last guideline, there has been a plethora of studies on various novel antiemetic combinations and a growing body of literature on genetic, socioeconomic, and diversity considerations, and the updated guidelines will address the emerging clinical evidence as well as novel considerations in PONV management.

Postoperative treatment and measurement

The most frequently used postoperative analgesics were morphine and acetaminophen. Other morphine-derivative analgesics were usually not prescribed and if applied converted to morphine equivalent dose for analysis. Postoperative temperatures were routinely taken every morning orally. In case of repeated measurement the highest temperature during 24 hours was included for analysis. The white blood cell count (WBC) (physiological range from 4.5 to 10.5/nl) were counted by SE 900 (Sysmex, Germany) and the C-reactive protein (physiological range < 0.5 mg/dl) was measured by Analytic analyser 912 (Hitachi, Japan). These data were not measured for every patient every day. The frequency of these measurements depended on the clinical course.

Complications were divided into general complications that were not related to the surgical procedure and specific postoperative complications related to the operation procedure.

Wound infections were defined following the CDC (Centres of Disease Control and Prevention) definitions of surgical site infections (SSI) (modification 1992). Haematoma and seroma categorization followed the ultrasound criteria if there were no signs of infection to be detected in the patient. Patients returning to the hospital with complications following appendectomy during the first four weeks were included in the analysis.

Short term outcomes of the study

Investigated outcomes were operative time, required analgesics and postoperative complications within the first 30 days.

Long term outcomes of the study

In 2008 a quality of life questionnaire (Short-Form 36 Health Survey, SF 36) was distributed to all operated patients by mail. This questionnaire was supplemented by additional questions regarding the appendectomy such as satisfaction with the size and appearance of the scar(s), as well as the quality and intensity of pain. Additionally, patients were asked whether they would recommend the operation method to family members or friends. The original version of this questionnaire was published in. Answers were evaluated using a point score: not at all = 1, few = 2, moderate = 3 and very = 4. A control question was asked twice in order to ensure the reliability of the answers. Additionally, body weight and height were monitored in order to evaluate the BMI at follow-up.

We analysed primarily the summarizing question regarding the recommendation of the experienced method. Moreover, the remaining questions of the self-developed supplement regarding the operation method and the eight scaled scores of SF-36 (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social role functioning, emotional role functioning, mental health) were evaluated.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114rBX6D]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — narrative formats for EMS documentation note that documentation by EMS clinicians demonstrates a wide variation of training and practice reinforcement; therefore, it is essential that the EMS clinician uses a standard format to ensure they are consistent and complete in their documentation, and EMS clinicians should choose the best match for them, master the format, and be consistent in its use. There are three standard formats for EMS documentation: Medical Narrative, SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), and CHART (Complaint, History, Assessment, Rx (Treatment) and Transport). Medical Narrative is intuitive and easy to learn but a drawback is that it is easy to forget to include facts because of the lack of structure; SOAP is very common in the medical field; and CHART minimizes the likelihood of forgetting information, ensures documentation is consistent between records and clinicians, is the format most recommended as best practice by EMS legal authorities, and is considered the standard in many EMS systems.

### Development of a core outcome set to determine the overall treatment success of acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children: a study protocol [^112wgj7t]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, there has been growing interest in alternatives to appendicectomy. In particular, non-operative treatment of appendicitis, with antibiotics alone, has been proposed as a potential treatment. A small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and, more recently, children suggest that antibiotic treatment may be a valid alternative to appendicectomy. However, there is currently insufficient data to justify its widespread use. Prior to performing further efficacy studies of the treatment of appendicitis in children, it is imperative to identify the most relevant outcome measures for inclusion in the design of comparative studies. This is of particular importance when evaluating a novel treatment approach since the outcomes of importance may differ from those commonly reported with traditional therapies. A review of the relevant literature and electronic resources failed to identify a core outcome set (COS) for children with appendicitis. We aim to define a COS for the measurement of treatment interventions in children (< 18 years) with acute appendicitis.

Methods and Analysis

This project will entail: (1) a systematic review to identify previously reported acute uncomplicated appendicitis treatment outcomes; (2) assembly of stakeholder panels (paediatric and adult surgeons, patients and parents); (3) a three-stage Delphi process; and (4) a final consensus meeting to complete the COS.

Ethics and Registration

COS development is part of CONservative TReatment of Appendicitis in Children - a randomised controlled Trial (Feasibility) (CONTRACT) study, for which full ethical approval for CONTRACT has been granted. The COS development study is registered with the COMET Initiative in May 2017 (http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/987).

### Laparoscopic versus open appendectomy: a retrospective cohort study assessing outcomes and cost-effectiveness [^113Nv3FZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Acute appendicitis is the most common intra-abdominal condition requiring emergency surgery. The possibility of appendicitis must be considered in any patient presenting with an acute abdomen, and a certain preoperative diagnosis is still a challenge. Although more than 20 years have elapsed since the introduction of laparoscopic appendectomy (performed in 1983 by Semm, a gynaecologist), open appendectomy is still the conventional technique. Some authors consider emergency laparoscopy as a promising tool for the treatment of abdominal emergencies able to decrease costs and invasiveness and maximize outcomes and patients' comfort. Several studies have shown that laparoscopic appendectomy is safe and results in a faster return to normal activities with fewer wound complications. These findings have been challenged by other authors who observed no significant difference in the outcome between the two procedures, and moreover noted higher costs with laparoscopic appendectomy. Anyway, a recent systematic review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopic versus open appendectomy concluded that both procedures are safe and effective for the treatment of acute appendicitis. Total operative time in our series was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group than in open group (P < 0.0001). Generally, the lack of experience of surgeons in the laparoscopic approach may contribute to a longer duration of the operation. By contrast, in the present study the learning curve effect was minimal as the surgeons performing the procedures were highly experienced in laparoscopic procedures, including laparoscopic bariatric surgery and colectomy surgery. So, in our series the longer operation time in laparoscopic appendectomy may be due to additional steps like setup of instruments, insufflation, making ports under vision and a phase of diagnostic laparoscopy. Length of hospital stay represents a critical factor that directly influences the economy and the well-being of the patient. We found that hospital stay was significantly shorter in laparoscopic group (P = 0.015) with a concomitant earlier bowel movements in patient managed laparoscopically, leading to earlier feeding and discharge from hospital. Our findings are in agreement with several studies that demonstrated a significantly short hospital stay for the laparoscopic approach. In our Surgery Department, post-operative pain is assessed both subjectively via a visual analogue scale and objectively by the tabulation of analgesic use. In the present study, to prevent that the perception of pain may have been influenced by the patient's enthusiasm for a novel technique, we used only the number of analgesics doses (oral and parenteral) required by individual patient to compare the 2 groups. In this series, parenteral and oral analgesic requirements were less in the laparoscopic group [parenteral 1 (mean); oral 1.86 (mean)] than in the open group [parenteral 1.5 (mean); oral 2 (mean)] and we found a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) in agreement with many other studies that reported less pain in the laparoscopic group. Several studies showed no difference between open and laparoscopic appendectomy with respect to early return to activity and performance of daily activities. However, this issue is still debated because of the different definitions and classifications of "activity" in such studies. In this study we used the return to work as an endpoint with a mean time of 11.5 ± 3.1 days in the laparoscopic group and 16.1 ± 3.3 in the open group (P < 0.001). Our results are in agreement with a study by Hellberg et al. and other randomized clinical trials and meta-analysis. The mortality rate was nil in our study. The low mortality rates reported in previous research (0.05% and 0.3% rate in laparoscopic and open groups) indicated that appendectomy, especially in absence of complicated disease, is a safe procedure regardless of the technique used. In the present study, the overall complication rates were 24.5% and 6.7% for open and laparoscopic appendectomy respectively, with a rate of wound infection and dehiscence significantly higher in the open group (P < 0.001). Wound infection is more common in complicated appendicitis and may not represent a serious complication per se but has a strong impact for convalescence time and quality of life of patients. In our study no statistically difference was observed in the intraoperative findings between the two groups (Table 2), so the lower rate of wound infection in laparoscopic group may be due to placement of the detached appendix into an endobag before its removal from the abdominal cavity, reducing contact with the fascial surfaces and minimizing contamination. Conversely, intra-abdominal abscess is a serious and life-threatening complication. We observed intra-abdominal abscess formation in 4 patients in laparoscopic group (4.1%) and in 1 patient in the open group (0.32%). These findings are consistent with other studies that showed an increased risk of intra-abdominal abscess after laparoscopic appendectomy compared with open surgery. Several hypotheses have been suggested to find possible explanations: mechanical spread of bacteria in the peritoneal cavity promoted by carbon dioxide insufflation, especially in case of ruptured appendix, inadequate learning curve, the meticulous irrigation, instead of simple suctioning, of the infected area in severe peritonitis, that leads to contamination of the entire abdominal cavity, which is difficult to aspirate latter. However, in our study this finding was not statistically significant (P = 0.147). The management of intrabdominal abscesses included percutaneous drainage as first-line therapy, and surgical procedures. Antibiotics were given before and after percutaneous drainage or surgery. Other observed postoperative complications included vomiting, paralytic ileus and hemoperitoneum (Table 4). The higher cost of laparoscopic instruments (1245 € in our Department) compared to the conventional technique (50 € in our Department) represents an obstacle to its greater use. However, because of the shorter hospital stay, the total cost for laparoscopic appendectomy (operating room + ward costs) was only 155 € higher than open appendectomy. In addition, Moore and al. demonstrated an economic benefit of laparoscopic appendectomy from a social perspective, since earlier return to daily activities is crucial, especially for patients who are young and lead a productive life. Limitations of our study included the lack of evaluation of laparoscopic surgery in obese patients, as we did not collect data on body mass index (BMI). Moreover the follow up period was only limited to two weeks after hospital discharge.

### Effects of pre-operative psychological status on post-operative recovery: a prospective study [^112vkQBq]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Often in clinical practice, a spectrum of outcomes from surgery may be observed ranging from a quick and comfortable recovery to a recovery punctuated by persistent pain and decreased quality of life. While there has been a fast pace of advances made in the field of operative surgery, surgeons seldom pay attention to factors such as the psychological profile of a patient that can affect recovery from surgery.

Objective

To study the effects of pre-operative psychological profile on post-operative recovery in terms of pain, return to work and quality of life.

Materials and Methods

Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries at Sagar Hospitals, Jayanagar, were recruited. All patients were assessed for psychological status using the screening for illness behaviour questionnaire (SIBQ) and pain catastrophizing scale (PCS). Following surgery, they were followed up for a period of 3 months-on post-operative day 1, post-operative day 7, 1 month and 3 months from the date of surgery. Post-operative pain was measured using the visual analogue scale (Wong-Baker's), return to work was documented in days and quality of life was measured using the Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2) Health Survey. The Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to compare variables with continuous data and Chi-square and Fisher's tests were used to test categorical data for significance.

Results

In a total of 98 patients recruited, 50 patients had a complete follow-up of 3 months. Significant correlations existed between the pre-operative markers and markers of recovery. The Chi-square test and Fisher's exact tests showed significant differences in the scores of pre-operative markers between the groups of patients who developed chronic pain and those who did not. Difference in scores with regard to quality of life was also noted.

Conclusion

Psychological status does play a role in post-operative recovery. This result opens up scope for counselling patients towards a healthy and comfortable recovery from surgery.

Step 9: Guidelines Development — the guidelines development process begins with meeting of the Guideline panel following the GRADE methodology once the systematic review component has been completed, with or without a separate manuscript. The panel first reviews the evidence tables and a narrative of the systematic review results, works with the methodologist to appraise the systematic review results, and reprioritizes the outcomes based on the evidence presented, deciding which of the outcomes are "critical" or "important", while outcomes whose evidence would not influence their decision on the key question(s) are deemed "not important" for guideline decisions. The panel then populates the GRADEpro Evidence to Decision table (EtD) with the critical and important outcomes from the systematic review and formulates the evidence-based recommendations by voting on each section of this EtD table, and sections include assessment of the magnitude of both the desirable and undesirable effect the intervention has relative to the comparator and the certainty in the evidence (based on the evidence for critical outcomes).

### Defining the impact of resident participation on outcomes after appendectomy [^112sd4qp]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether resident participation impacts complication rates after appendectomy.

Background

The effect of resident participation on postoperative outcomes has not been well defined.

Methods

Data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant User File from 2005 through 2009 were used to assess the association between resident participation during appendectomy and postoperative complication rates. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for patient comorbidity, surgical approach, and severity of appendiceal disease. Similar analyses were performed to determine whether outcomes after appendectomy are influenced by the postgraduate training level of the participating surgical resident.

Results

A total of 54,467 appendectomy procedures were included in our analysis. Resident participation was an independent risk factor for major complications [adjusted odds ratio 1.27 (95% CI 1.14–1.42), P < 0.0001] after appendectomy. Increasing seniority of the participating resident was associated with longer operative time and higher postoperative complications rates.

Conclusions

Resident participation represents an independent risk factor for postoperative complications after appendectomy.

Colonoscopy quality assumptions — high quality is defined based on colonoscopist performance and examination-specific characteristics, including adequate adenoma detection rate (ADR), examination complete to cecum, attention to complete polypectomy, and adequate bowel preparation to reliably detect lesions > 5 mm; benchmarks for ADR (ADR > 30% in men; > 20% in women), proportion of examinations with adequate preparation (> 85%), and proportion of examinations complete to cecum (> 95%) should be universally and routinely monitored as colonoscopy quality metrics in practice; given the importance of polyp size for informing surveillance intervals, documentation of a polyp ≥ 10 mm within a report should be accompanied by an endoscopic photo of the polyp with comparison to an open snare or open biopsy forceps, and such documentation is important for HPs because small size (< 10 mm) is associated with well documented low risk for subsequent advanced neoplasia.

### Short-and long-term results of open versus laparoscopic appendectomy [^112LqvNv]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical advantages of laparoscopic appendectomy have been shown in numerous trials and reviews. Most of these advantages are small and of limited clinical relevance, while laparoscopic operation costs are reported to be higher. The present study compares short- and long-term results of conventional appendectomy with or without diagnostic laparoscopy (OA), and laparoscopic appendectomy (LA).

Methods

All adult patients who underwent appendectomy in our institution from 1995 to 2005 were included retrospectively. Patient data were retrieved from medical records, questionnaires sent by mail, and records of general practitioners. Primary outcome parameters were long-term complications, readmissions, and reinterventions (> 30 days postoperatively). Secondary outcome parameters were short-term complications, readmissions, and reinterventions (≤ 30 days postoperatively).

Results

A total of 755 patients were included, 545 of whom underwent OA, with the remaining 210 undergoing LA. In the long term there were few complications noted, and there were no significant differences in complications between the two groups. Within 30 days postoperatively, LA was associated with a significantly higher incidence of abdominal abscesses with consequent diagnostic investigations, interventions, and readmissions.

Conclusions

Although laparoscopic appendectomy is known to deliver clinical advantages, it is associated with a higher incidence of abdominal abscesses. Because the procedure is about to become the standard of care, future research must be directed at solving this issue. The expected lower incidence of incisional hernia and small bowel obstruction after laparoscopic appendectomy was not shown in the present study.

### High incidence of appendix carcinoid tumors among candidates for bariatric surgery: diagnostic and therapeutic implications [^113KwzpS]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Although the appendix has been recognized as a preferential site for carcinoid tumors in obese patients, no definitive guidelines are so far available regarding the management of these patients when candidates for bariatric surgery. This study was designed to fill that gap. Between 2000–2008, 558 patients underwent bariatric procedures. Appendectomy was routinely performed in 477 cases. Their charts were retrospectively retrieved and histopathology responses on surgical specimens were recorded. We aimed to assess: incidence of appendix carcinoid tumors (ACTs) and any possible risk-factor; modality of diagnosis (pre-, intra- or post-operatively); impact on the planned bariatric procedure; treatment reserved to such cases. Typical ACTs were diagnosed in 7 patients (1.4%) (median age: 33 years; median BMI: 49 kg/m²; males/females: 1/6). Four were diagnosed intra-operatively. Because of dimensions (< 2 cm) and absence of mesoappendiceal or serosal involvement, simple appendectomy was performed during bariatric procedure, as planned. Three were diagnosed post-operatively (all < 2 cm). In 1 case right hemicolectomy was performed 1 month later due to mesoappendiceal involvement. No appendectomy-related complication was encountered. All patients remained tumor-free during follow-up (mean: 64 months; range, 25–92). Young age, female sex, high BMI and diabetes mellitus resulted significantly associated with ACT. Our study sustains routine appendectomy or at least careful investigation of the appendix during bariatric surgery. For tumors < 2 cm without mesoappendiceal or serosal involvement, simple appendectomy proved sufficient. Bariatric surgery did not have a negative effect on the treatment of malignancies that are discovered intra- or post-operatively.

### Laparoscopic versus open surgery for suspected appendicitis [^111sY8Aj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The removal of the acute appendix is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Open surgery associated with therapeutic efficacy has been the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. However, in consequence of the evolution of endoscopic surgery, the operation can also be performed with minimally invasive surgery. Due to smaller incisions, the laparoscopic approach may be associated with reduced postoperative pain, reduced wound infection rate, and shorter time until return to normal activity. This is an update of the review published in 2010.

Objectives

To compare the effects of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) and open appendectomy (OA) with regard to benefits and harms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE and Embase (9 February 2018). We identified proposed and ongoing studies from World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trials Register (9 February 2018). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and the congress proceedings of endoscopic surgical societies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LA versus OA in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed the meta-analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the Peto odds ratio (OR) for very rare outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (or standardised mean differences (SMD) if researchers used different scales such as quality of life) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified 85 studies involving 9765 participants. Seventy-five trials included 8520 adults and 10 trials included 1245 children. Most studies had risk of bias issues, with attrition bias being the largest source across studies due to incomplete outcome data. In adults, pain intensity on day one was reduced by 0.75 cm on a 10 cm VAS after LA (MD -0.75, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.45; 20 RCTs; 2421 participants; low-quality evidence). Wound infections were less likely after LA (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.51; 63 RCTs; 7612 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses was increased following LA (Peto OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.43; 53 RCTs; 6677 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The length of hospital stay was shortened by one day after LA (MD -0.96, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.70; 46 RCTs; 5127 participant; low-quality evidence). The time until return to normal activity occurred five days earlier after LA than after OA (MD -4.97, 95% CI -6.77 to -3.16; 17 RCTs; 1653 participants; low-quality evidence). Two studies showed better quality of life scores following LA, but used different scales, and therefore no pooled estimates were presented. One used the SF-36 questionnaire two weeks after surgery and the other used the Gastro-intestinal Quality of Life Index six weeks and six months after surgery (both low-quality evidence). In children, we found no differences in pain intensity on day one (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.65 to 0.05; 1 RCT; 61 participants; low-quality evidence), intra-abdominal abscesses after LA (Peto OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22; 9 RCTs; 1185 participants; low-quality evidence) or time until return to normal activity (MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.30 to 0.30; 1 RCT; 383 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, wound infections were less likely after LA (Peto OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.42; 10 RCTs; 1245 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and the length of hospital stay was shortened by 0.8 days after LA (MD -0.81, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.62; 6 RCTs; 316 participants; low-quality evidence). Quality of life was not reported in any of the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Except for a higher rate of intra-abdominal abscesses after LA in adults, LA showed advantages over OA in pain intensity on day one, wound infections, length of hospital stay and time until return to normal activity in adults. In contrast, LA showed advantages over OA in wound infections and length of hospital stay in children. Two studies reported better quality of life scores in adults. No study reported this outcome in children. However, the quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate and some of the clinical effects of LA were small and of limited clinical relevance. Future studies with low risk of bias should investigate, in particular, the quality of life in children.

### Improving the value of care for appendectomy through an individual surgeon-specific approach [^116QCK6J]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Standardized care via a unified surgeon preference card for pediatric appendectomy can result in significant cost reduction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of cost and outcome feedback to surgeons on value of care in an environment reluctant to adopt a standardized surgeon preference card.

Methods

Prospective observational study comparing operating room (OR) supply costs and patient outcomes for appendectomy in children with 6-month observation periods both before and after intervention. The intervention was real-time feedback of OR supply cost data to individual surgeons via automated dashboards and monthly reports.

Results

Two hundred sixteen children underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for non-perforated appendicitis (110 pre-intervention and 106 post-intervention). Median supply cost significantly decreased after intervention: $884 (IQR $705-$1025) to $388 (IQR $182-$776), p < 0.001. No significant change was detected in median OR duration (47min [IQR 36–63] to 50min [IQR 38–64], p = 0.520) or adverse events (1 [0.9%] to 6 [4.7%], p = 0.062). OR supply costs for individual surgeons significantly decreased during the intervention period for 6 of 8 surgeons (87.5%).

Conclusion

Approaching value measurement with a surgeon-specific (rather than group-wide) approach can reduce OR supply costs while maintaining excellent clinical outcomes.

Level Of Evidence

### Meta-analysis of in-hospital delay before surgery as a risk factor for complications in patients with acute appendicitis [^117DwqzA]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study identification

Two authors independently searched PubMed and EMBASE databases with the following search terms: appendicitis, appendectomy, appendicectomy, surgical procedures, surgery, operation, time‐to‐treatment, timing, time, early, delay, prompt and immediate (, supporting information). A clinical librarian was consulted on the search strategy. No language limit was applied. When articles were published in a language not familiar to one of the authors, a translator was consulted. The search was limited to dates later than 1990, and the last search was performed in July 2016. When full text was not available or presented results were incomplete, the corresponding author was contacted. Reference lists of obtained articles were reviewed for any omitted studies. Where there was overlap in patient cohorts of two studies, the most recent and largest study was included in the systematic review. If patient cohorts of two studies overlapped but different outcome measures were reported, both studies were included in the review. Meta‐analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) 13 and PRISMA 14 guidelines for reporting were followed. A review protocol for this meta‐analysis was not published or registered before the study was undertaken.

Study selection

Eligible prospective and retrospective studies should compare at least two time intervals of in‐hospital delay in patients with acute appendicitis. A prospective cohort study was defined by data collection after the idea for the study was developed, and a retrospective cohort study was defined by data collection before the idea for the study was developed. Letters, reviews, comments, case reports and patient cohorts of fewer than ten patients were excluded, as were: studies that analysed patients treated without surgery from which the data of interest could not be analysed separately; studies that analysed patients with pathology other than acute appendicitis from which the data of interest could not be analysed separately; studies that did not define in‐hospital delay; studies that included only a graphical display in figures or graphs without absolute numbers; studies that reported the number of patients in only one group of the outcome variables (for example, only the number of patients with uncomplicated appendicitis but not the total number of patients or number with complicated appendicitis); studies that did not clearly define the boundaries of time intervals; studies that reported only percentages instead of absolute numbers or odds ratios (ORs); abstracts and conference proceedings; and animal or laboratory studies. The two reviewers independently considered all studies retrieved from the search for eligibility against these criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion.

An operative template reporting tool was reported in 6 studies. Deal and colleagues reported the use of a dictated operative template which incorporated 42 data fields including patient and operating team identifiers, pre-operative assessment, intra-operative findings, intra-operative complications, procedures, the use of intra-operative cholangiography (IOC), use of drains and wound closure technique. They did not include post-operative instructions or mention the surgeon's signature. The study by Harvey et al. reported 14 items which were subdivided and contained expanded prompts within the template. These included documentation of operative urgency, patients' admission status and indication for surgery. Booij et al. developed a template of 33 operative details to analyze patients' referrals to a single centre with common bile duct (CBD) injuries post LC.

### Short term and long term results after open vs. laparoscopic appendectomy in childhood and adolescence: a subgroup analysis [^114npwB7]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

For short term outcomes the statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, t-test (if normality could be assumed) and Pearson's χ² test for categorical data.

A subgroup analysis was performed for children between 2 and 10 years and adolescents from 11 to 16 years. This discrimination addressed the question, whether any differences occurred depending on the patients' age. The evaluation was performed with Sigma Plot® (Version 11, Systat Software Inc.).

For long term outcomes patients differing more than one point in their answer to the control question (Q16 and Q23) were excluded from further analyses (two patients). An additive unweighted score was used for the two questions concerning the appearance and the size of the scar (Q13 and Q14, minimum 2, maximum 8), and answers were categorized into two groups (2–5 and 6–8).

The answers to the three questions concerning pain (Q20, Q21 and Q22) were summarized in an additive unweighted score (minimum 3, maximum 12), and answers were grouped into two categories (3–7 and 8–12).

Categorical outcomes were compared between laparoscopic and open appendectomy by Pearson's χ² test. For the comparison of the BMI values, age and the scores of SF-36, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied. The statistical calculations were performed using the statistical program SPSS 15.0 for Windows® (Version 15.0.1).

All performed tests were two sided and a p -value smaller or equal to 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

This retrospective study is of exploratory nature and therefore no adjustment for multiple testing is applied. Results have to be verified in an additional prospective randomized double blinded study.

Ethics

This investigation was carried out in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Laparoscopic and open appendectomies are part of standard surgical treatment without change in standard operating procedure and therefore did not require ethical approval. According to the Hamburg Hospital Law (Hamburgisches Krankenhausgesetz) the utilization of anonymized patient data for scientific research is part of the treatment agreement. This applies for a retrospective analysis of short term results as well. Written informed consent provided by the participants has been obtained prior re-evaluation. A counselling of the ethic committee (University of Kiel) was performed. For patients younger than 18 years the parents were consented as well and it was made clear for all participants that their participation is on voluntary basis.

### The accuracy of pre-appendectomy computed tomography with histopathological correlation: a clinical audit, case discussion and evaluation of the literature [^116QYqMa]. Emergency Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The learning points identified in this audit were presented at the annual departmental audit meeting and at both a Singaporean and British national radiology conference. Other interventions included self-directed and consultant-led education, modification of the current appendicitis CT protocol to include more senior guidance and the addition of an ongoing RADPEER peer-review scoring system to identify further areas for improvement.

There are three important limitations to this study. Firstly, in excluding patients with suspected appendicitis who underwent CT without appendectomy, we cannot calculate the sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value of CT in suspected acute appendicitis. These particular statistics can, therefore, not be compared to the published literature, and we are limited to the positive predictive value and negative appendectomy rate. To overcome this would require a prospective rather than retrospective study, following up patients with suspected appendicitis who undergo CT but not appendectomy. Secondly, we also excluded patients who underwent appendectomy without pre-operative CT. This skews our data set towards ambiguous or equivocal cases, as patients who go to theatre without prior imaging would presumably have a more classical clinical picture. A final limitation is in the use of positive predictive value and negative appendectomy rate in assessing the quality of radiology reporting. These measures are suboptimal as they are compounded by two other factors: firstly, by how they are defined and secondly, by individuals other than the interpreting radiologists. Defining a positive appendectomy as an appendectomy for primary appendicitis ignores the fact that appendectomy is an appropriate management plan for conditions other than primary appendicitis; the positive predictive value does not account for these and will, therefore, tend to be lower than expected. This may account for why our second standard was not achieved. Secondly, the positive predictive value is affected by not only the radiologist but also the referring clinician, the surgeon, the radiographer and the histopathologist. Improving the positive predictive value and negative appendectomy rates is, therefore, not solely the responsibility of the interpreting radiologists, but other members of the multidisciplinary team as well. To overcome this, rather than using the positive predictive value and negative appendectomy rate, we would instead compare our RADPEER scores to the standard set by the literature (e.g. a large, multicentre sample of RADPEER scores). This would eliminate these confounding factors and also take into account the imperfections of the test itself, the intrinsic limitations of computed tomography in suspected acute appendicitis. However, no such sample exists. Therefore, the next best standard is the positive predictive value and negative appendectomy rate. Any further interventions should also target other relevant members of the multidisciplinary team.

### Effect of a clinical practice guideline for pediatric complicated appendicitis [^115yWjvX]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Complicated appendicitis is a common condition in children that causes substantial morbidity. Significant variation in practice exists within and between centers. We observed highly variable practices within our hospital and hypothesized that a clinical practice guideline (CPG) would standardize care and be associated with improved patient outcomes.

Objective

To determine whether a CPG for complicated appendicitis could be associated with improved clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A comprehensive CPG was developed for all children with complicated appendicitis at Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, a freestanding children's hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, and was implemented in July 2013. All patients with complicated appendicitis who were treated with early appendectomy during the study period were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts, based on whether they were treated before or after CPG implementation. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded for 30 months prior to and 16 months following CPG implementation.

Exposure

Clinical practice guideline developed for all children with complicated appendicitis at Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of any adverse event such as readmission or surgical site infection. In addition, resource use, practice variation, and CPG adherence were assessed.

Results

Of the 313 patients included in the study, 183 were boys (58.5%) and 234 were white (74.8%). Complete CPG adherence occurred in 78.7% of cases (n = 96). The pre-CPG group included 191 patients with a mean (SD) age of 8.8 (4.0) years, and the post-CPG group included 122 patients with a mean (SD) age of 8.7 (4.1) years. Compared with the pre-CPG group, patients in the post-CPG group were less likely to receive a peripherally inserted central catheter (2.5%, n = 3 vs 30.4%, n = 58; P < .001) or require a postoperative computed tomographic scan (13.1%, n = 16 vs 29.3%, n = 56; p = 0.001), and length of hospital stay was significantly reduced (4.6 days post-CPG vs 5.1 days pre-CPG, P < .05). Patients in the post-CPG group were less likely to have a surgical site infection (relative risk [RR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27–0.74) or require a second operation (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.12–1.00). In the pre-CPG group, 30.9% of patients (n = 59) experienced any adverse event, while 22.1% of post-CPG patients (n = 27) experienced any adverse event (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.48–1.06).

Conclusions and Relevance

Significant practice variation exists among surgeons in the management of pediatric complicated appendicitis. In our institution, a CPG that standardized practice patterns was associated with reduced resource use and improved patient outcomes. Most surgeons had very high compliance with the CPG.

### Colonoscopy for diagnostic evaluation and interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Awczi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) clinical guideline — elective surgery to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis is presented for patients with diverticulitis that is persistent or recurs frequently or with complicated disease as a conditional recommendation with low-certainty evidence; high-certainty evidence reports lower recurrence after elective surgery when symptoms are smoldering (persisting > 3 months) or frequently recurring (≥ 3 episodes within 2 years), but low- to moderate-certainty evidence shows 1.4% to 5.5% perioperative surgical complications; the Clinical Guidelines Committee judged elective surgery likely cost-effective in acute left-sided cases that persist, recur frequently, or are acute complicated, including those with 3 or more episodes; the decision whether to undergo surgery should be personalized, clinicians should take a team-based approach to shared decision making, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis that is not persistent or frequently recurring.

### A normal appendix found during diagnostic laparoscopy should not be removed [^113od8gi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic laparoscopy has been introduced as a new diagnostic tool for suspected appendicitis. While the normal appendix used to be removed routinely, laparoscopy allows us to leave a normal looking appendix in place. This latter strategy is, however, not generally accepted. The long-term results of not removing a normal looking appendix were evaluated.

Methods

This was a prospective evaluation of 109 diagnostic laparoscopies for suspected appendicitis in which a normal looking appendix was left in place. After a median follow-up of 4.4 years a telephone questionnaire was performed.

Results

There were no false-negative laparoscopies. In 65 patients (60 per cent) another diagnosis was obtained (group 1). In 44 patients (40 per cent) no diagnosis was obtained (group 2). After a median interval of 8 months, 15 patients presented to the emergency department for symptoms possibly involving the appendix, during the median follow-up of 4.4 years. This resulted in readmission of nine patients, of whom eight were reoperated. In only one patient (1 per cent) was a histologically proven appendicitis found and the appendix removed. Some 105 patients were eligible for follow-up. Of the 100 patients interviewed (95 per cent), nine patients (9 per cent) (six in group 1 and three in group 2) still had recurrent pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant. There were no differences between patients with or without another diagnosis obtained during preceding laparoscopy.

Conclusion

It is safe to leave a normal looking appendix in place when a diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected appendicitis is performed, even if another diagnosis cannot be found at laparoscopy.

### Colonoscopy for diagnostic evaluation and interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117AwKqn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) GRADE classification — Grading the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations is defined as follows: High, "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect". Moderate, "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different". Low, "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". For recommendation strength, Strong indicates "Confidence that the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs". Conditional indicates "Benefits probably outweigh the risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Pediatric appendiceal ultrasound: maintaining accuracy, increasing determinacy and improving clinical outcomes following the introduction of a standardized reporting template [^112nKZCN]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric patients who underwent appendiceal US and received an equivocal interpretation had poorer clinical outcomes and higher medical costs compared to those to whom a definitive interpretation was given, either positive or negative. In an effort to reduce equivocal interpretations, we educated our group on the importance of increasing determinacy and encouraged the use of a reporting template with a definitive impression.

Objective

We hypothesized that educational sessions and implementation of an optional reporting template with only a definitive impression would reduce equivocal reporting and improve clinical outcomes without negatively impacting US diagnostic performance.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients < 18 years old at Mayo Clinic Rochester whose initial evaluation for acute appendicitis was a US in the 3-year period following educational sessions and template implementation. All studies were interpreted by board-certified fellowship-trained pediatric radiologists. We performed statistical analysis to compare the pre- and post-implementation cohorts.

Results

Following intervention, the rate of equivocal US interpretations was reduced from 23.7% to 9.3% (P < 0.001). For studies with a definitive interpretation, measures of diagnostic performance of appendiceal US were similar for the pre- and post-implementation groups. US performance parameters were independent of appendiceal visualization. Follow-up CT utilization decreased from 18.7% to 8.9% (P < 0.001). The negative laparotomy rate resulting from false-positive US interpretations remained low (6.8% vs. 5.0%, P = 0.31).

Conclusion

Following education sessions and implementation of an appendiceal US reporting template encouraging definitive reporting, equivocation was reduced, excellent diagnostic performance was maintained, follow-up CT utilization was reduced, and a low negative laparotomy rate was preserved.

### Effects of a patient activation tool on decision making between surgery and nonoperative management for pediatric appendicitis: a randomized clinical trial [^115ojhG8]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Strategies to activate and engage patients and caregivers in shared decision making in the acute care setting may result in improved outcomes.

Objective

To determine whether a patient activation tool (PAT) can improve decision-making and patient-centered outcomes among pediatric patients and their caregivers who choose between surgery and nonoperative management for their child's appendicitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This single-blind, randomized clinical trial collected data from a single tertiary children's hospital from March 1, 2014, through April 30, 2016, with 1-year follow-up completed on May 1, 2017. Two hundred of 236 eligible children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years with uncomplicated appendicitis enrolled with their caregivers. After receiving the randomized clinical intervention, caregivers chose surgery or nonoperative management. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2014, through May 1, 2017.

Interventions

Randomization to a scripted standardized surgical consultation that emphasized patient choice or a scripted standardized surgical consultation plus the PAT (a tablet-based tool that presents each treatment, encourages participation in medical decision making, and aims at alleviating decisional uncertainty).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Decisional self-efficacy immediately after treatment decision, health care satisfaction at discharge, and disability days for the child at 1-year follow-up.

Results

Among 200 participants (median age, 12 years [interquartile range (IQR), 9–15 years]; 120 [60.0%] male), 98 were randomized to the PAT and 102 to the standardized consultation groups. The percentages choosing nonoperative management were similar (standardized consultation group, 42 of 102 [41.2%]; PAT group, 31 of 98 [31.6%]; p = 0.19). Immediate decisional self-efficacy was similar in the standardized consultation and PAT groups (median score, 100 [IQR, 97.7–100] vs 100 [IQR, 95.5–100]; p = 0.03), which was not significant at the planned significance level of P = 0.02. Total scores on health care satisfaction at discharge were similar (median, 99 [IQR, 94.7–100] vs 98 [IQR, 91.7–100]; p = 0.27). Disability days at 1-year follow-up were also similar (median, 6 [IQR, 2–11] vs 5 [IQR, 2–15]; p = 0.67). No difference in the failure rate of nonoperative management at 1 year (13 of 38 [34.2%] vs 11 of 30 [36.7%]; P > .99) or in the rate of complicated appendicitis 30 days after discharge (7 of 68 [10.3%] vs 9 of 71 [12.7%]; p = 0.79) occurred.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, a technology-based PAT did not improve measures of decision making for pediatric patients and caregivers needing to make an urgent treatment decision between surgery and nonoperative management for appendicitis. However, the overall high scores in both groups suggest that pediatric patients and caregivers can process information in the acute care setting and effectively participate in an informed shared decision-making process around the need for surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^117Q2hc9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis postoperative outcomes tracking — benefits, harms, exceptions, and implementation emphasize that follow-up provides benefits including ensuring follow-up, reinforcing the need for ongoing care or follow-up visits, and detecting adverse outcomes or complications, with the primary harm being the time and expense of follow-up care and an overall preponderance of benefit. Value judgments specify that CT scan imaging is not routinely required to assess postoperative effects, while a particular validated instrument, endoscopy scoring mechanism, thresholds, and visit cadence are not specified so the surgeon may exercise judgment. Patient perspectives are incorporated and endoscopy is recommended but not mandatory within the larger context of tracking outcomes; exceptions include circumstances limiting return for care in which CT may be indicated (eg, concern about complications, concerns about synechiae). Implementation considerations note availability of validated means to assess subjective outcomes (eg, patient-reported outcome measures), provision of common scales for endoscopy, and electronic materials to facilitate collection of subjective and objective outcomes, with resources that include links to validated tools, adaptive assessments, and means to measure completion rates.

Grading of the evidence and recommendations — The panel used methods from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group, and each recommendation received a separate grade for the strength of the recommendation (strong or weak) and for the quality of evidence (high, moderate, or low). In this framework, most clinicians and patients would choose to follow a strong recommendation, whereas a weak recommendation is on the basis that benefits outweigh potential harms and burdens but the balance is smaller or evidence is weaker; decisions to follow a weak recommendation could vary depending on specific clinical circumstances or patient preferences and values. The development process included systematic searches with investigators reviewing 6556 abstracts and including 107 systematic reviews and 858 primary studies, a voting threshold in which a two-thirds majority was required for a recommendation to be approved, solicitation of more than 20 external peer reviewers, approvals in April 2015, October 2015, and August 2015, and an intention to update the guideline by 2021.

### Care protocols reduce appendectomy complications… [^113kLrma]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Appendectomy is the fourth most common abdominal surgery performed in the United States. Up to 18 percent of patients have postoperative infectious complications ranging in significance from wound infection to intra-abdominal abscess. The rate of infections depends on the degree of contamination during surgery and reaches nearly one third of cases when the appendix is perforated or gangrenous. Helmer and colleagues studied the effect of an evidence-based clinical practice guideline in reducing infectious complications of appendectomy. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The clinical practice protocol that was developed from a critical review of the literature. Eight patients who were treated according to the protocol had postoperative surgical infections, compared with 20 patients in the comparison group.

The number of patients with intra-abdominal abscesses dropped from 12 to five after introduction of the protocol, and the number of wound infections dropped from 14 to four. The improvement was particularly significant in patients presenting with a perforated or gangrenous appendix. In these patients, the total number of infections dropped from 16 to five. The authors conclude that use of an evidence-based clinical practice guideline can significantly reduce surgically related infections following appendectomy and is particularly effective in patients with perforation or gangrene of the appendix. editor's note: It is good to see the application of evidence-based practice result in positive outcomes for a common condition.

This study should be directly applicable to practice in many locations, although the antibiotics selected for this study probably are not those of first choice in most institutions. The authors do not tell us how they persuaded all surgeons to adhere to the protocol. Getting consensus to consistently implement a clinical guideline is the most difficult part of the entire process. One wishes that they had measured additional outcomes, such as length of stay or reduction in other infections, especially of the respiratory and urinary tracts. Those of us who might be tempted to introduce the protocol into our own hospitals need all the available information to persuade our colleagues to abdicate personal practice preferences in favor of evidence-based protocols. — a. d. w.
