## Question

Can SSRIs be used for bipolar disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SSRIs can be used for bipolar disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the phase of illness, because SSRIs behave very differently in acute mania versus bipolar depression. Then, I should separate bipolar I from bipolar II, since switch risk and guidance differ. Next, I will examine the evidence for efficacy, followed by the evidence for manic/hypomanic switch risk. After that, I should review high-credibility guideline recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and monitoring plan, making sure I verify where the data are strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the scope. SSRIs have no therapeutic role in acute mania, and in fact antidepressants should be stopped when a patient presents manic or with mixed features, so I need to focus on bipolar depression when considering SSRIs. Wait, let me verify that guidance is consistent: CANMAT/ISBD advise discontinuing antidepressants in mania and avoiding them in mixed features or recent rapid cycling, and VA/DoD recommendations for acute mania do not include SSRIs, reinforcing that they should not be used for manic states [^116gW6b1] [^111snD63] [^111Vz1W6].

> Now, I should review the efficacy signal for SSRIs in bipolar depression. The early high-credibility systematic review in 2004 found antidepressants, largely used adjunctively with mood stabilizers, were superior to placebo for acute bipolar depression, which suggests some benefit exists, though effect sizes were not fully detailed in that paper, so I need to be cautious about magnitude claims [^112pUcJn]. Hold on, I should double-check more recent data: the 2016 Lancet Psychiatry meta-analysis of adjunctive second-generation antidepressants showed only a small improvement in depressive symptom scores and no significant advantage for response or remission, which tempers expectations about clinical impact [^115kt8Ce]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overinterpreted the benefit as robust for remission; the NEJM STEP-BD effectiveness trial also failed to show superiority of adjunctive antidepressants over placebo for durable recovery, reinforcing that the average benefit is modest at best [^1154pNpc]. For longer-term prevention, a 2017 high-credibility meta-analysis suggested antidepressants reduced depressive relapses without increasing mania, but I need to remember risk of bias was moderate and populations were heterogeneous, so generalizability requires caution [^111WvWua].

> Next, I should examine switch risk because that's the critical safety concern. Let me first confirm short-term RCT data: the 2004 systematic review reported no increase in early switch with antidepressants versus placebo overall, and clearly higher switch rates with tricyclics than with SSRIs, indicating a meaningful class difference favoring SSRIs on switch risk in the short term [^112pUcJn]. I need to check more recent pooled evidence: a 2022 meta-analysis found no association between adjunctive antidepressants and mood switching, which is consistent with the earlier randomized data but still requires clinical vigilance given study limitations [^111o1c3H]. But wait, what if antidepressants are used alone? Observational registry work associates antidepressant monotherapy with a several-fold increase in mania risk, so antidepressant monotherapy — especially in bipolar I — is a clear hazard despite confounding in observational designs [^112PDUaB]. I should also confirm guidance that patients with rapid cycling, mixed features, or prior antidepressant-induced mania are higher-risk subgroups where avoidance or very cautious use is recommended [^111Vz1W6].

> I will now review guideline positions to align clinical decisions with high-credibility recommendations. The VA/DoD 2023 guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against antidepressants as monotherapy or as augmentation for acute bipolar depression, and it recommends first-line monotherapies such as quetiapine or cariprazine instead, indicating a conservative stance given the small net benefit and potential risks [^116t5KN3] [^117V3BQe] [^1171DHch]. The BAP 2016 guidance emphasizes psychotherapies as adjuncts and does not endorse SSRIs as first-line for bipolar depression, aligning with a cautious approach [^notfound]. In contrast, CANMAT/ISBD 2018 places SSRIs or bupropion as second-line adjunctive options for bipolar depression when added to a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic, while explicitly advising against antidepressant monotherapy in bipolar I and cautioning against use in patients with switch risk factors, which is a more permissive but still selective position [^111Vz1W6] [^1118n2W1].

> Let me think about how this translates to bipolar I depression. I should confirm that SSRI monotherapy should not be used in bipolar I, which is a consistent cross-guideline position, and that first-line choices remain quetiapine, lurasidone, lithium, or lamotrigine before considering an antidepressant add-on. If first-line agents are optimized and inadequate, an SSRI or bupropion can be considered as a cautious, second-line adjunct with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic, understanding the likely modest benefit and the need for vigilant monitoring for switch or cycle acceleration. I need to ensure I am not implying maintenance use: long-term continuation of antidepressants in bipolar I is generally not recommended due to uncertain prophylactic benefit and concerns for destabilization, unless there is a clearly demonstrable individualized benefit that outweighs risks under close follow-up [^115m8nwC] [^1173MmEE] [^111Vz1W6] [^112Sg7Jd].

> For bipolar II depression, let me reconsider the calculus. Quetiapine is the preferred first-line agent, and some guidelines allow SSRIs or venlafaxine as second-line options, often with somewhat more permissive consideration than in bipolar I because switch risk to hypomania may be lower on average, though not absent, and monitoring remains essential. I should double-check the small body of evidence suggesting fluoxetine or venlafaxine strategies in bipolar II can be effective with low switch rates in selected populations, but these data are limited and do not override the need to prioritize mood-stabilizing options first and to avoid use in mixed states or rapid cyclers [^111v14sJ] [^113CsjcN] [^112hZRRw].

> Before recommending use, I need to ensure a clear, safety-forward process. Let me first confirm that if an SSRI is considered, it should be adjunctive to a therapeutic mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic in bipolar I and typically time-limited, with reassessment at about 8–12 weeks for clear benefit; earlier discontinuation is warranted for emerging hypomania, mixed features, or rapid cycling. I should double-check monitoring guidance: educate patients and families on early warning signs of switch, use structured measures like the YMRS for emerging hypomanic symptoms, and review for drug–drug interactions given frequent polypharmacy in bipolar disorder. Hold on, I should verify DDI risks especially with CYP interactions and serotonin toxicity potentials when combining agents, and incorporate routine safety labs aligned with ISBD monitoring guidance for the broader regimen rather than for SSRIs alone [^111Vz1W6] [^117KiuNU] [^111sfqyZ].

> Synthesis and final stance: Yes, SSRIs can be used for bipolar disorder, but only in highly selected circumstances, not as routine first-line therapy, and generally not as monotherapy in bipolar I. The acute efficacy signal is statistically significant but clinically modest on average, response and remission advantages are inconsistent, and switch risk appears low in RCTs for adjunctive SSRI use yet meaningfully higher with antidepressant monotherapy and in high-risk clinical phenotypes, warranting judicious, individualized trials after failure or intolerance of first-line mood-stabilizing options and with close monitoring. Long-term maintenance antidepressant use is typically discouraged unless there is a demonstrated, sustained benefit with ongoing risk surveillance. I should emphasize that these conclusions align most closely with the conservative VA/DoD and BAP positions and the selective, second-line adjunctive stance of CANMAT/ISBD, while the meta-analytic data explain why the field remains cautious despite some positive signals [^115kt8Ce] [^112pUcJn] [^111WvWua] [^116t5KN3] [^111Vz1W6].

SSRIs are **not first-line** [^111Vz1W6] for bipolar depression due to limited efficacy and risk of mood switching [^115kt8Ce]; they should be used only as adjuncts to mood stabilizers or antipsychotics, and never as monotherapy in bipolar I [^1118n2W1]. The risk of antidepressant-induced mania is lower with SSRIs than with TCAs [^112pUcJn] but **remains significant**, especially in bipolar I or with a history of switches [^112PDUaB]. If used, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for mood elevation or rapid cycling [^117KiuNU]; discontinue if switching occurs [^111Vz1W6]. First-line treatments for bipolar depression are quetiapine, lurasidone, lithium, or lamotrigine [^115m8nwC]; SSRIs are reserved for refractory cases with careful monitoring.

---

## Efficacy of SSRIs in bipolar disorder

- **Limited efficacy**: SSRIs have modest efficacy in bipolar depression [^1154pNpc], with small effect sizes [^111o1c3H] and inconsistent benefits across studies [^111Vz1W6].

- **Adjunctive use**: SSRIs may be considered as adjuncts to mood stabilizers or antipsychotics [^111Vz1W6] in refractory cases, but are not first-line [^115kt8Ce].

- **Monotherapy caution**: SSRIs should not be used as monotherapy in bipolar I [^111Vz1W6] due to high risk of mood destabilization [^1118n2W1].

---

## Risks associated with SSRI use in bipolar disorder

- **Manic switch**: SSRIs can precipitate mania or hypomania [^111Vz1W6], especially in bipolar I or with prior antidepressant-induced switches [^112PDUaB].

- **Rapid cycling**: SSRIs may increase rapid cycling [^112PDUaB], particularly in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or mixed features [^111Vz1W6].

- **Long-term instability**: Prolonged SSRI use [^113NvebT] can worsen mood instability [^112Sg7Jd] and increase episode frequency [^112PDUaB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding SSRIs** |
|-|-|
| CANMAT/ISBD 2018 | - Second-line adjunctive therapy with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics <br/> - Avoid monotherapy in bipolar I [^111Vz1W6] <br/> - Use cautiously in bipolar II |
| VA/DoD 2023 | - Insufficient evidence to recommend SSRIs as monotherapy [^117V3BQe] or adjunctive therapy [^116t5KN3] for acute bipolar depression |
| Japanese Expert Consensus 2020 | - Not strongly recommended due to risk of manic switch and rapid cycling [^112PDUaB] <br/> - Use cautiously if necessary |

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

- **Bipolar I disorder**: Avoid SSRI monotherapy [^111Vz1W6]; consider only as adjuncts with close monitoring.

- **Bipolar II disorder**: SSRIs may be considered cautiously as adjuncts [^113CsjcN], but monitor for hypomanic switches [^111v14sJ].

- **Rapid cycling or mixed features**: Avoid SSRIs [^111Vz1W6] due to high risk of mood destabilization [^112PDUaB].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Monitoring should include **regular assessment** [^111Vz1W6] for manic or hypomanic symptoms, rapid cycling, and mood instability [^117KiuNU]. Educate patients and caregivers [^111Vz1W6] on **early signs of mood switching or cycle acceleration**. If manic or hypomanic symptoms or rapid cycling emerge [^116gW6b1], **discontinue the SSRI** [^111Vz1W6].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

Alternative pharmacological options include **first-line agents** — quetiapine, lurasidone, lithium, and lamotrigine [^115m8nwC] — preferred for bipolar depression [^1171DHch]. **Combination therapy** — a mood stabilizer plus an atypical antipsychotic — may be more effective than monotherapy [^114aDL74] in severe cases [^1146mE64].

---

SSRIs are **not first-line** for bipolar depression due to limited efficacy and risk of mood switching; **use only as adjuncts** with careful monitoring. Prefer quetiapine, lurasidone, lithium, or lamotrigine, and **avoid SSRIs in rapid cycling or mixed features**.

### Antidepressants for bipolar depression: A systematic review of randomized, controlled trials [^112pUcJn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). High credibility.

This study reviewed the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression.

- **Method**: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. They searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety, and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, incorporating results of searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, PSYNDEX, and LILACS. The main outcome measures were the proportion of patients who clinically responded to treatment and the rate of switching to mania.

- **Results**: Twelve randomized trials were included, with a total of 1,088 randomly assigned patients. Five trials compared one or more antidepressants with placebo; 75% of these patients were receiving a mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic. Antidepressants were more effective than placebo. Antidepressants did not induce more switching to mania; the event rate for antidepressants was 3.8%, and for placebo, it was 4.7%. Six trials allowed comparison between two antidepressants. The rate of switching for tricyclic antidepressants was 10%, and for all other antidepressants combined, it was 3.2%.

- **Conclusions**: Antidepressants are effective in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. The trial data do not suggest that switching is a common early complication of treatment with antidepressants. It may be prudent to use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor rather than a tricyclic antidepressant as first-line treatment.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^112PDUaB]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Use of antidepressants is not strongly recommended for BP-I and BP-II, consistent with several treatment guidelines. This hesitation is due to the potential risk of antidepressant-induced switching to mania and rapid-cycling. In a within-individual comparison study conducted among 3,240 patients with bipolar disorder using the Swedish national registry, antidepressant monotherapy was associated with a three-fold increased risk of mania three months after the start of antidepressant treatment. A 1994 study using all available clinical trial data on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — including fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline — compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or placebo demonstrated that treatment-emergent manic switch was more frequently observed in bipolar patients treated with TCAs (14 patients out of 125, 11.2%), than with SSRIs (9 patients out of 242, 3.7%) or placebo (2 patients out of 48, 4.2%).

In a sub-analysis of the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study, a higher frequency of mood episodes was reported in rapid cyclers who continued to take antidepressants in addition to a mood stabilizer compared to those who discontinued. In terms of antidepressants to be used, mirtazapine and escitalopram were ranked high as second-line treatments for BP-I, and escitalopram and sertraline for BP-II. Another expert consensus guideline indicated that the first-line choices of antidepressants for bipolar depression included bupropion and SSRIs. However, only short-term venlafaxine monotherapy and long-term considerations remain incomplete in the context of the guideline's recommendations.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111Vz1W6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, monotherapy with divalproex (level 2) is included as a second-line option.

- **Second-line treatment options**: Adjunctive use of antidepressant therapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or bupropion, with lithium/divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic may also be considered as a second-line add-on treatment. While some individual studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy, a recent meta-analysis (level 1) supports efficacy, albeit with a small effect size.

This is a key aspect of decision-making regarding antidepressants, as historically much of the focus has been on the risk of manic switch or rapid cycling, with an underappreciation of the relatively weak efficacy data. This new appreciation, exemplified by the small benefit seen in the above meta-analysis, led to the change from the last CANMAT guidelines, which previously gave add-on SSRI/bupropion antidepressants a first-line recommendation.

As per the ISBD Antidepressant Task Force recommendations, antidepressants should ideally be avoided, or used cautiously if necessary, in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania, predominant mixed features, or recent rapid cycling. Patients and caregivers (as appropriate) should receive education regarding early warning symptoms of mood switching or cycle acceleration, and antidepressants should be discontinued if these emerge. Antidepressant monotherapy should NOT be used for the treatment of BDI depression.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115m8nwC]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

First-line treatments such as quetiapine (level 1), lithium (level 2), lamotrigine (level 2), and lurasidone (level 2) are all recommended as monotherapy options with evidence for efficacy. Lurasidone (level 1) and lamotrigine (level 2) are also recommended as first-line adjunctive treatments. Although quetiapine and lithium have not been assessed for efficacy as adjunctive treatments for acute bipolar depression, clinicians may choose to apply this combination in patients who experience depression when optimized on one of these medications.

- **Summary of evidence**: Lithium and lamotrigine as first-line agents for bipolar I depression.

Recommendations regarding which first-line treatment should be considered initially are outlined in our hierarchy. We recommend trying the agents listed first, unless patient-specific reasons exist for choosing an agent lower in the order, such as prior response or clinical features. For instance, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and has not been treated, they should commence quetiapine monotherapy if there is no prior history of non-response or tolerability concerns with quetiapine. However, if a patient has been taking lithium and experiences a breakthrough acute bipolar depression…

These guidelines are organized into eight sections, including the introduction. Section 2, foundations of management, discusses the epidemiology of BD, screening and diagnostic considerations, the importance of monitoring risk for suicide, the chronic disease management model, and patient-centered care, including shared decision-making. It also emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychoeducation and other psychosocial treatment strategies into treatment.

Additional information on presentation and hierarchical rankings of treatment options for acute mania (Section 3) and depression (Section 4) is reviewed, including descriptions of clinical features that may help direct treatment choices. Section 5 discusses the importance of long-term maintenance treatment, the promotion of treatment adherence for mood stability, and hierarchical rankings of treatment options.

Section 6 presents an expert review of the available evidence for treatments of bipolar II disorder (BDII) and recommendations based on those findings. Management issues related to specific populations, including women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, older adults, and those with psychiatric or medical comorbidities, are discussed in Section 7. Lastly, Section 8 provides the principles of medical monitoring and an overview of safety and tolerability concerns for recommended treatments.

### Effectiveness of adjunctive antidepressant treatment for bipolar depression [^1154pNpc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Episodes of depression are the most frequent cause of disability among patients with bipolar disorder. The effectiveness and safety of standard antidepressant agents for depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar depression) have not been well studied. Our study was designed to determine whether adjunctive antidepressant therapy reduces symptoms of bipolar depression without increasing the risk of mania.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned subjects with bipolar depression to receive up to 26 weeks of treatment with a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy or a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo, under conditions generalizable to routine clinical care. A standardized clinical monitoring form adapted from the mood-disorder modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, was used at all follow-up visits. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting the criterion for a durable recovery (8 consecutive weeks of euthymia). Secondary effectiveness outcomes and rates of treatment-emergent affective switch (a switch to mania or hypomania early in the course of treatment) were also examined.

- **Results**: Forty-two of the 179 subjects (23.5%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy had a durable recovery, as did 51 of the 187 subjects (27.3%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo (P = 0.40). Modest nonsignificant trends favoring the group receiving adjunctive antidepressant therapy were observed.

### New approaches in managing bipolar depression [^112r9h19]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Historically, the pharmacologic treatment of bipolar depression has not been well studied. New data are beginning to emerge regarding the efficacy of new medications and the use of combinations of mood stabilizers and antidepressants in the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar depression. We reviewed data from recent randomized, controlled trials of mood stabilizers and antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression and naturalistic studies examining the risk of switching and depressive relapse with ongoing antidepressant treatment.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^115yUNPU]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to be noted in this study. First, although highly practical, an expert consensus guideline is considered to provide less evidence than randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Second, psychosocial interventions were not evaluated in this survey since they were beyond our scope in the present study, although their relevance should be highly acknowledged in patients with bipolar disorder. Third, there may not be enough information to choose the appropriate treatment options in some questions. Heterogeneity of the patients should be acknowledged when the recommendations in this guideline are translated into clinical practice. Fourth, the generalizability of our findings may be limited, as all of the experts who participated in this study were Japanese. Moreover, some of the medications listed in the questionnaire are not available outside of Japan. Fifth, although we obtained responses from over 100 specialists, the response rate was relatively low. Finally, our distinction into three categories [i.e. 1–3 (disagree), 4–6 (neutral), and 7–9 (agree)] and methods of analyses are somewhat arbitrary.

In conclusion, the Japanese experts highly recommend lithium monotherapy and combination therapy for both bipolar disorders I and II, regardless of illness phases or episodes. The use of antidepressants remains controversial. Although antipsychotic drugs are considered to be reasonable choices in case of treatment failure or intolerable side effects, clinicians are advised to carefully monitor potentially serious side effects, particularly during long-term use.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^115Xvdsm]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, specifically with respect to maintenance therapy, the 2023 DoD/VA guidelines report insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of other first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants (including valproate) as monotherapy or in combination with a mood stabilizer for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes.

---

### Combination therapy versus monotherapy in bipolar disorder [^114vSSs2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing breakthrough manic or mixed episodes during maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder should first be assessed to ensure they are receiving an optimal dose of the first-line medication. If further intervention is needed, one option is to combine an atypical antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. The decision to use a particular combination should be made on the basis of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication for individual patients. Psychosocial therapy as an adjunct to medication is also useful in delaying relapse.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^116cc7Zx]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, specifically in the case of acute mania, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of brexpiprazole, topiramate, or lamotrigine as monotherapy for acute mania.

### Use of asenapine in clinical practice for the management of bipolar mania [^111jHRnN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness associated with high levels of somatic morbidity, comorbidity, and mortality. Treatment guidelines for bipolar mania generally recommend initiating first-line therapy with a second-generation antipsychotic or mood stabilizer, either alone or in combination. Asenapine is a second-generation antipsychotic with a unique receptor binding profile, licensed for the treatment of manic episodes in adults with bipolar I disorder.

'Real-world' data are needed to complement evidence from clinical trials in order to provide clinicians with pragmatic information regarding the likely risks and benefits of using a new agent in clinical practice. Evidence from real-world case reports demonstrates that, as in clinical trials, asenapine is effective in treating mania and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, whether used as monotherapy or in combination with a mood stabilizer. It has a rapid onset of antimanic effect, and early improvement is associated with treatment outcome. Asenapine also shows promise in controlling depressive symptoms and clinically challenging mixed states. Additionally, asenapine has a favorable tolerability profile compared with other first-line agents, having a minimal impact on weight and metabolic parameters. Therefore, asenapine should be considered a first-line treatment option for adults with bipolar I disorder.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Examination of a patient presenting in a manic state should include an immediate assessment for the risk of aggressive behavior, violence, and safety threat to others, as well as suicide risk, especially in those with mixed features. The degree of insight and the ability to adhere to treatment, comorbidity (including substance use that may be aggravating or contributing to the clinical presentation), and availability of a psychosocial support network should also be evaluated. A physical examination with laboratory investigations, described in Section 8, should be conducted but may be deferred for patients who are uncooperative. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting, such as ambulatory or inpatient care.

Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a manic episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to drugs of abuse, medications, other treatments, or a general medical or neurological condition, although even in these cases, symptomatic treatment may be applied on a short-term basis. Steps should be taken to rule out any other factors that may be perpetuating symptoms, such as prescribed medication, illicit drug use/abuse, or an endocrine disorder. Any patients presenting with mania who have been taking antidepressants should have these medications discontinued. If there is a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder, it is appropriate to immediately commence antimanic agents. If this is the first emergence of manic symptoms, clinicians are advised to confirm the diagnosis of bipolar disorder by monitoring the patient.

- **Efficacy ratings for pharmacological agents used as maintenance therapy: Importance of naturalistic and cohort studies**: Evidence from RCTs is at the core of the recommendations in these guidelines. Nonetheless, RCTs are not the only source of clinically useful information, particularly when evaluating maintenance therapy. RCTs offer relatively limited follow-up time frames, while for some patients, maintenance therapy may extend across decades. Furthermore, new medications are often assessed in studies with an enriched design (including only patients who have responded to the medication under study in the acute phase), limiting the generalizability of positive findings to patients who responded to the medication acutely.

	- Useful data can be obtained from large, often whole-population databases constructed from electronic medical records or electronic patient registries with large numbers of patients that would be difficult to obtain in RCTs. In some instances, they allow comparisons of multiple treatments. These large numbers make it possible to evaluate differences in rates of rare events such as less common side effects or suicide [^361, 362].

	- Patient cohorts followed in a specific setting provide another source of informative data. Their main advantage usually is the length of observation, in some instances reaching several decades. This comes at the cost of generalizability, in terms of both patient selection and non-random treatment allocation.

### SSRIs as mood stabilizers for bipolar II disorder? A proof of concept study [^115oXkon]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

We have previously observed that the prescription of certain antidepressant drugs, particularly SSRIs, is associated with attenuation of the number, duration, and severity of both high and low mood states in individuals with bipolar II disorder. We examined whether SSRIs serve as mood stabilizers for bipolar II disorder.

- **Method**: We report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study lasting 9 months in a sample of 10 patients who had not undergone previous treatment with any antidepressant, antipsychotic, or mood stabilizer drug.

- **Results**: Treatment with the SSRI led to a significant reduction in depression severity, percentage of days depressed or experiencing high mood, and percentage of days impaired, compared to the placebo. There was no indication that the SSRI led to worsening of the illness course.

- **Limitations**: Given the small sample size and a weighting towards those with a rapid cycling condition, replication with a larger and more heterogeneous sample of individuals with bipolar disorder is required.

- **Conclusions**: This proof of concept study finds preliminary support for the potential utility of SSRIs in managing bipolar II disorder, with clear improvements in depression and impairment and some suggested benefit for hypomania.

### Treating bipolar disorder: Monotherapy versus combination therapy [^113sTUb2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Combination treatments for patients with bipolar disorder can be potentially advantageous due to therapeutic synergy. However, combining treatments may increase the possibility of drug interactions and adverse effects. When considering combination therapy, clinicians should evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the combination for each individual patient. Physicians should exercise caution when treating patients with a combination of medications and strive to use monotherapy when feasible.

### Atypical antipsychotics in bipolar depression: Potential mechanisms of action [^115GjEnb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

"Conventional" antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), bupropion, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are not recommended as monotherapy for bipolar depression. Although they are likely to provide effective symptom relief in combination with mood stabilizers, the risk of precipitating a switch to mania often complicates their use even as combination therapy.

Recently, two psychotropic medications approved for treating acute mania, olanzapine and quetiapine, have also been shown to possess antidepressant activity without destabilizing mood and, as such, are potential mood stabilizers. This article aims to review the mechanism of action of conventional antidepressants and newer agents that are effective in the treatment of bipolar depression.

A number of mechanisms have been postulated to play a role in the effective treatment of bipolar depression, including targets as diverse as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and various second messenger signaling pathways. A review of the data reveals an important point of commonality among the antidepressant treatments, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Antidepressant treatments, such as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, and electroconvulsive therapy, induce a reduction of 5-HT(2A) receptors. Both olanzapine and quetiapine not only are antagonists at this receptor but also induce downregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. It is possible that the antidepressant efficacy of these agents is mediated by this receptor.

Bipolar depression

There are no RCTs of any agents in older adults with acute bipolar depression. Post hoc analyses of RCTs suggest efficacy of quetiapine (level 2) and lurasidone (level 2) monotherapy, and hence these are recommended as first-line options. However, in older adults, given the concerns about side effects of atypical antipsychotics, clinicians may wish to try lithium or lamotrigine first based on their efficacy in adult populations, although the evidence of efficacy is limited in older adults (lithium, level 4; lamotrigine, level 4). Divalproex (level 4), aripiprazole (level 4), and carbamazepine (level 4) are third-line options. ECT (level 4) is an important option that should be considered in treatment-resistant cases, for suicidal patients, or for patients with inadequate food or fluid intake.

While the use of antidepressants in BD remains controversial and there have been no studies in older age BD, antidepressants are frequently used in this population (> 40% of patients). Antidepressants with lower manic switch potential (e.g. SSRIs and bupropion) used in combination with mood stabilizers may be beneficial in selected patients who cannot tolerate/do not respond to other agents with a stronger geriatric evidence base. Possible medication interactions with ongoing medications for non-psychiatric conditions must always be considered.

Maintenance

Choice of agents should be based on what has been effective in the acute phase, with recommended options with geriatric efficacy data being lithium (level 2).

### Effective treatment of bipolar depression: Monotherapy and combination strategies [^115dE17W]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Managing patients with bipolar disorder remains a challenge due to its chronic nature. Bipolar depression is particularly understudied, despite patients spending more time in depressive episodes than in manic ones. Effective treatment necessitates an accurate and timely diagnosis, psychoeducation, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and implementation of elements of the chronic care model.

Pharmacologic strategies for treating bipolar depression differ from those for bipolar mania and unipolar depression. They require knowledge of the efficacy and safety of agents, including mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants, both as monotherapy and in combination.

### Risperidone and paroxetine given singly and in combination for bipolar depression [^112xSiye]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is a major clinical problem that remains under-researched. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of the novel antipsychotic risperidone, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine, and their combination in patients with bipolar disorder.

- **Method**: Thirty patients with DSM-IV bipolar (I or II) disorder, in the depressed phase and receiving a stable dose of a mood stabilizer, were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with risperidone (plus placebo), paroxetine (plus placebo), or the combination of risperidone and paroxetine. Data were gathered from August 1999 to September 2001.

- **Results**: All three groups experienced significant reductions in depression ratings from baseline to endpoint. However, there were no significant differences in outcomes between groups. Statistically significant differences were found in paroxetine doses when contrasting paroxetine plus placebo against the combined condition. The switch rate into mania or hypomania was very low, with only one patient in the paroxetine plus placebo condition experiencing mild hypomania.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that risperidone, paroxetine, and their combination are equally but modestly effective when added to a mood stabilizer in bipolar depression. The paroxetine dose differed between groups, possibly due to drug-drug interactions. Using another SSRI in the combined condition could have produced a more robust effect and should be tested.

### The role of pharmacologic treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder [^117T7Lwt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

With the growth in the number of pharmacologic options available for the treatment of bipolar disorder, clinicians face a challenge in appropriately selecting and sequencing newer and older treatments. Because evidence-based practice has been suggested as a way to improve outcomes across specialties in medicine, a number of practice guidelines and treatment algorithms for bipolar disorder have been developed to aid clinical decision-making. Most of these guidelines and algorithms are based on detailed reviews of the medical literature, with an emphasis on systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Some guidelines incorporate a consensus of expert opinion when the literature does not provide clear evidence. This review examines areas of overlap and discordance in practice guidelines issued by the American Psychiatric Association and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, as well as treatment algorithms developed by the Expert Consensus Guideline Series and the Texas Medical Algorithm Project.

### The International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) consensus guidelines for the safety monitoring of bipolar disorder treatments [^117KiuNU]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Safety monitoring is an important aspect of bipolar disorder treatment, as mood-stabilizing medications have potentially serious side effects, some of which may also aggravate existing medical comorbidities. This paper sets out the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) guidelines for the safety monitoring of widely used agents in the treatment of bipolar disorder. These guidelines aim to provide recommendations that take into consideration the balance between safety and cost-effectiveness, to highlight iatrogenic and preventive clinical issues, and to facilitate the broad implementation of therapeutic safety monitoring as a standard component of treatment for bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: These guidelines were developed by an ISBD workgroup, headed by the senior author (MB), through an iterative process of serial consensus-based revisions. Feedback from a multidisciplinary group of health professionals on the applicability of these guidelines was then sought to develop the final recommendations.

- **Results**: General safety monitoring recommendations for all bipolar disorder patients receiving treatment and specific monitoring recommendations for individual agents are outlined.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines are derived from evolving and often indirect data, with minimal empirical cost-effectiveness data available to provide guidance. These guidelines will therefore need to be modified to adapt to different clinical settings and health resources. Clinical acumen and vigilance remain critical ingredients for safe treatment practice.

### Effective agents in treating bipolar depression [^111cGB3k]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Individuals with bipolar disorder may spend about half of their time euthymic, but recurring mood episodes are common and predominantly characterized by depressive symptoms. Despite the prevalence of depression in bipolar disorder, evidence suggests that antidepressants are not likely to benefit most patients. Lithium has long been the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, but it is not the most effective agent for treating bipolar depression. This activity reviews multiple pharmacologic options that should be considered by clinicians treating bipolar disorder.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^112Sg7Jd]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Many agents recommended for management of acute manic or depressive episodes have prophylactic efficacy. Generally, medications that have been found to be effective in the acute phase should be continued during the maintenance phase. However, there are exceptions to this; the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy has not been examined systematically in large double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Hence, long-term antidepressant use is not recommended, especially considering the concerns about potential risk of manic/hypomanic switch and mood instability. However, in the subgroups of patients who have responded to combination treatment and are stable, preliminary evidence suggests that withdrawal of antidepressants may contribute to destabilization.

Clinical trials have shown that many atypical antipsychotics are effective in preventing the relapse of mood episodes; with many agents, this efficacy is related to prevention of manic episodes but not depressive episodes. However, many of these trials have been conducted in patients with an index manic episode, and given that the polarity of an index episode predicts the polarity of relapse, depressive relapse rates in placebo groups in such studies have been low, compromising the statistical power to test the efficacy of these agents in the prevention of depressive relapses. Thus, the efficacy of many of these agents in preventing depressive relapses remains unknown.

For patients who are currently not receiving or responding to pharmacological treatment…

- **Step 4: Add on or switch therapy (second-line agents)**: Although olanzapine (level 1) is effective in preventing any mood, manic, or depressive episode, it is considered second-line treatment because of safety issues such as metabolic syndrome. Biweekly long-acting injectable risperidone monotherapy (level 1) or adjunctive therapy (level 2) has demonstrated efficacy in preventing any mood or manic episode, but had no clear efficacy in depressive episode prevention in these trials. Further, there was a trend for superiority of oral risperidone adjunctive therapy at six months in preventing any mood episode and in preventing mania but not depression. Carbamazepine (level 2) has not been assessed in any large placebo-controlled trials, but active comparator trials support its efficacy. Paliperidone (level 2) was more effective than placebo in preventing any mood or manic episode but less effective than olanzapine.

	- Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy (level 2) has been shown to be effective in preventing any mood or manic episode, although there are conflicting (positive and negative) data for acute treatment (see Sections 3 and 4). There was a trend for superiority of lurasidone adjunctive therapy in preventing any mood episode (but not manic or depressive episodes individually) in a controlled trial with significant separation from placebo in preventing mood episodes in those with an index depressive episode. Thus, lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be appropriate for those who responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

### The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for treatment of bipolar disorder: a summary [^112neDEG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology has provided a review of the research evidence and clinical experience in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It has produced guidelines that offer practical advice to clinicians in the day-to-day management of this challenging condition. The recommended enhancement of routine care may increase adherence to treatment, particularly if the patient is involved in choosing their medication, leading to lower overall morbidity. This is timely as awareness of the specific needs of bipolar patients is growing, and there is an increased range of effective treatments available for all phases of the illness.

### Short-term fluoxetine monotherapy for bipolar type II or bipolar NOS major depression - low manic switch rate [^112hZRRw]. Bipolar Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the initial treatment of bipolar type II (BP II) major depressive episode (MDE) recommend using either a mood stabilizer alone or a combination of a mood stabilizer plus a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This recommendation is due to concerns over antidepressant-induced manic switch episodes. However, recent evidence suggests that the manic switch rate may be low in BP II MDE during SSRI therapy.

As part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled relapse-prevention study of fluoxetine monotherapy in BP II MDE, 37 patients received open-label fluoxetine 20 mg every day for up to 8 weeks. Outcome measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D 17) rating and the Young Mania Rating (YMR) scale.

Eleven of 23 patients (48%) who completed 8 weeks of fluoxetine treatment showed a HAM-D 17 reduction of ≥ 50%, while 14 (38%) of all treated patients had ≥ 50% reduction in baseline HAM-D 17 score. Using a conservative YMR score of ≥ 8 to identify hypomanic symptoms, the frequency of patients with YMR score ≥ 8 during fluoxetine treatment did not differ from that seen during the screen and baseline period. Only three patients (7.3%) had symptoms suggestive of hypomania, and only one patient stopped treatment because of a rapid mood swing into depression.

Fluoxetine was given at a fixed dose of 20 mg every day. Furthermore, fluoxetine was prescribed in an open-label manner, and the sample size was limited.

These observations support the findings of a low manic switch rate during fluoxetine monotherapy in BP II MDE.

### Role of antidepressants in bipolar depression [^111JdfoQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A gap exists between the standard of care for bipolar depression and actual clinical practice. Although practice guidelines advise against treating bipolar depression with antidepressant monotherapy, this is the most frequently prescribed initial treatment. To provide quality care and improve patient outcomes, clinicians must be aware of the benefits and dangers of antidepressant use in bipolar disorder. Further, they must be informed about alternative, more efficacious treatment options for patients with depressive symptoms.

### Clinical highlights in bipolar depression: Focus on atypical antipsychotics [^111p7m8B]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Despite the considerable burden of bipolar depression, the treatment of this debilitating phase of bipolar disorder is suboptimally addressed by currently available pharmacologic options. Consequently, there is a need for the development of new treatment options with enhanced efficacy and tolerability.

Evidence of antidepressant efficacy for some atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar depression has recently emerged. The findings of a large-scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study of olanzapine alone and in combination with fluoxetine, and a similar study of quetiapine monotherapy, suggest that some atypical antipsychotics may be efficacious in treating depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder.

- **Efficacy in subpopulations**: Subpopulation analyses suggest that quetiapine monotherapy and the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination appear to be effective in treating depression in patients with a rapid-cycling course. The magnitude of improvement in depressive symptoms in the bipolar I population appears to be larger for quetiapine monotherapy compared with either olanzapine or olanzapine plus fluoxetine. However, the limitations of such a cross-study comparison are acknowledged.

- **Tolerability and side effects**: Both olanzapine monotherapy and combination therapy, as well as quetiapine monotherapy, were well tolerated. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent mania was low and comparable with placebo in both studies. Somnolence, weight gain, increased appetite, and nonfasting glucose and cholesterol levels were more commonly reported in patients treated with olanzapine.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^114Sibcw]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, specifically concerning maintenance therapy, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend considering offering lithium or quetiapine as monotherapy for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes.

### Selecting appropriate treatments for maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder [^1143utf9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Long-term management of bipolar disorder is a crucial component of treatment because the recurrence of the illness negatively affects patients' daily lives and increases their risks for poor health and suicide. An ideal maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder is relatively simple to take, prevents recurrence of both manic and depressive episodes, and is well-tolerated over the long term.

Although many different types of medications are used for maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder, none can be considered ideal for a majority of people with bipolar disorder. Each specific form of therapy has different strengths and limitations. Clinicians need to be aware of unique efficacy and side effect factors when choosing long-term therapy. They must consider treatment components, goals, and individual patient characteristics, which are essential to the successful long-term management of bipolar disorder.

Additionally, several forms of psychotherapy specifically tailored to the needs of people with bipolar disorder should be considered as an adjunct to medication.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^113znct7]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Similarly, lithium monotherapy was categorized as a first-line treatment for hypomanic episodes, depressive episodes, and the maintenance phase in BP-II, while combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was endorsed for hypomanic episodes in BP-II. These findings are generally consistent with the Korean expert consensus guideline, except for the strategy for hypomania where only mood stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic monotherapies were recommended.

However, due to inadequate evidence, conventional treatment guidelines other than the CANMAT and ISBD guideline did not include specific treatment recommendations for BP-II. In addition, the CANMAT and ISBD guidelines did not include specific treatment recommendations for hypomania, since the reported studies had significant weaknesses, including small sample sizes and mixed samples. This is also the case for the acute treatment of depressive episodes with mixed features, acute treatment of manic and depressive episodes in the elderly, and the maintenance treatment for rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Notably, there were no first-line treatment options for geriatric bipolar disorder in the present study, which may reflect physicians' struggle to manage this challenging condition with psychopharmacological treatment. Further investigations are clearly needed to fill this gap in the literature.

### Combination treatment in bipolar disorder: A review of controlled trials [^1146mE64]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Monotherapy is often inadequate, and combination drug regimens have become the norm for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Virtually all classes of psychotropic drugs have been used in combination for a variety of indications. This article reviews the available published data from controlled, blinded studies regarding combination treatments in the different phases of bipolar disorder.

Articles for this review were obtained from a search of the Medline database (1966–2002) using the following keywords and phrases: add-on, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, antidepressant, combination treatment, lithium, neuroleptic, and polypharmacy. The search was augmented by data presented at scientific meetings. Data included in this article were only from controlled studies that evaluated combinations of two or more agents.

For acute mania, the most useful combination treatments, as determined by controlled studies, appear to be an antipsychotic drug with a mood stabilizer. The combination of lithium and valproate, even though widely used for acute mania, is lacking in controlled data. For acute bipolar depression, the controlled combination studies reviewed fail to show clear advantages in the efficacy of an antidepressant with a mood stabilizer versus two stabilizers or a mood stabilizer alone. Large, controlled, randomized, long-term studies with modern antidepressants are not available. Controlled combination studies of mood stabilizers suggest gains in efficacy over monotherapy in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116fDKhB]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

There are a range of strategies that have been investigated for use in mania, including lithium, divalproex, other anticonvulsants, typical and atypical antipsychotics, and other agents and therapies. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy as well as safety and tolerability. The evidence for efficacy and the recommendations for treating acute mania are summarized in Table 12.

- **Table 12**: Hierarchical rankings of first and second-line treatments recommended for management of acute mania.

As stated previously, the first and second-line agents are listed hierarchically, taking into consideration not only their efficacy for acute mania but also their efficacy in preventing mania or depression, treating acute bipolar depression, safety/tolerability, and the risk of treatment-emergent switch. The implication of this hierarchical recommendation is that those listed higher in the table should be considered first before moving on to the next, unless other factors such as history of previous non-response or patient's preferences preclude such strategy in a given patient.

Monotherapy and combination therapy are listed separately as first-line treatments for acute mania in Table 12. This does not mean that all monotherapy agents should be tried first before considering combination therapy. We suggest that the treating clinician make a decision as to whether to treat a given patient with monotherapy or combination therapy.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^114aDL74]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine (level 1), aripiprazole (level 2), risperidone (level 1), or asenapine (level 2) and lithium or divalproex is recommended as a first-line treatment option, demonstrating greater efficacy than monotherapy with lithium or divalproex alone, particularly in patients with higher index severity.

In general, combination therapy is preferred over mood stabilizer monotherapy because clinical trials suggest that approximately 20% more patients respond to combination therapy. There is some evidence to suggest the benefit of combination therapy compared to atypical antipsychotic monotherapy, although fewer trials exist. Specifically, lithium plus quetiapine showed superiority over quetiapine alone. While there is level 1 evidence for olanzapine combination therapy over olanzapine monotherapy, this is downgraded to second-line due to tolerability and safety concerns associated with olanzapine.

The decision to treat with one or a combination of available first-line agents should be informed by prior medication use, with treatments previously shown to be effective in managing symptoms preferred. Safety and tolerability factors for each medication, along with clinical features predictive of better response (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices"), should also be considered. In general, combination therapy is associated with more adverse events than monotherapy. Whenever possible, treatment options should be discussed with the patient and/or their caregiver.

### Atypical antipsychotic augmentation of mood stabilizer therapy in bipolar disorder [^114Wpbuj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Although monotherapy with lithium or divalproex is the recommended initial therapy for bipolar disorder, these agents are associated with prolonged favorable outcomes in only 30% of patients. Increasingly, the medical literature is demonstrating that augmentation of mood stabilizers with atypical antipsychotics is a more effective therapy. This form of combination therapy is recommended as first-line treatment for severe bipolar mania. Recent clinical studies have shown that augmentation therapy with the atypical antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone is effective in long-term maintenance treatment. Preliminary evidence is emerging that the use of atypicals with mood stabilizers can help control the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. The atypical antipsychotics also have relatively mild side effect profiles, although augmentation therapy with some antipsychotics and mood stabilizers has been associated with excessive weight gain.

### Balanced efficacy, safety, and tolerability recommendations for the clinical management of bipolar disorder [^112sjotf]. Bipolar Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

To provide practical and clinically meaningful treatment recommendations that amalgamate clinical experience and research findings for each phase of bipolar disorder, a comprehensive search of the literature was undertaken. Electronic database search engines such as Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Reviews were utilized, incorporating keywords like bipolar depression, mania, and treatment. Relevant randomized controlled trials were examined alongside review papers, meta-analyses, and book chapters familiar to the authors. Moreover, recommendations from accompanying papers in this supplement were distilled into summary boxes. These findings, coupled with the clinical experience of international researchers and clinicians specialized in mood disorders, formed the basis of the treatment recommendations presented in this paper.

The process of balancing clinical experience with evidence led to the development of practical clinical recommendations. These emphasize the importance of safety and tolerability alongside efficacy in the clinical management of bipolar disorder.

The paper summarizes treatment recommendations for each phase of bipolar disorder while offering additional, evidence-based practical insights. Medication-related side effects and monitoring strategies underscore the importance of safety and tolerability considerations, which, along with efficacy information, should be given equal merit.

### Efficacy and safety of long-term antidepressant treatment for bipolar disorders - A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111WvWua]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of long-term use of antidepressants (AD) in bipolar disorder (BD) patients remains highly controversial. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to explore the efficacy and safety of long-term AD use in BD patients.

- **Methods**: English-written literature published in peer-reviewed journals was systematically searched from PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Each database was searched from its first available time to August 31, 2016. Additional papers were searched from recent guidelines, expert consensus, and systematic reviews by hand. RCTs exploring the efficacy and safety of long-term (≥ 4 months) antidepressant treatment for patients with bipolar disorder were eligible. Two authors independently extracted the data. Risk ratio (RR), number needed to treat (NNT), and number needed to harm (NNH) for new depressive episodes and new manic/hypomanic episodes were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed based on treatment regimen (AD monotherapy or combined with mood stabilizers), types of antidepressants, funding source, bipolar subtypes, and treatment duration.

- **Results**: Eleven trials with 692 bipolar disorder patients were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias assessment demonstrated moderate bias risk. Antidepressants were superior to placebo in reducing new depressive episodes in bipolar disorders without increasing the risk of new manic/hypomanic episodes, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizers. Subgroup analyses revealed that greater benefit and lower risk may be achieved in BD.

### Adjunctive antidepressants for the acute treatment of bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111o1c3H]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Low credibility.

The depressive phase of bipolar disorder causes significant functional impairment and disease burden. The efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression have long been a subject of debate.

- **Aims**: To synthesize evidence of the effectiveness, risk of mood switching, and tolerability of adjunctive antidepressants in acute bipolar depression compared to using mood stabilizers or antipsychotics alone.

- **Method**: Multiple databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, including open-label and double-blinded studies, for patients aged 18 or older with acute bipolar depression. These studies compared efficacy and adverse events for those who used adjunctive antidepressants versus those who did not. Risk of bias and outcomes were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. This study has PROSPERO registration CRD42016037701.

- **Results**: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Adjunctive antidepressants showed no significant effect on improving response rate (RR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.23). Subgroup analysis indicated that adjunctive antidepressants with antipsychotics had a small but significantly better response rate compared to antipsychotics alone, which was not observed with adjunctive antidepressants combined with mood stabilizers. However, this finding was limited by studies predominantly using olanzapine as the antipsychotic medication. Adjunctive antidepressants had no clinically significant impact but a small statistically significant impact on improving depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.24 to -0.02). There was no association with increased mood switch (RR = 0.97).

### Possible pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions that are likely to be clinically relevant and/or frequent in bipolar disorder [^111sfqyZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder are frequently treated with polypharmacy. This article provides clinicians with an understanding of how polypharmacy can contribute to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions (DDIs).

Recent findings indicate that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lithium and other mood stabilizers, such as valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and eslicarbazepine, as well as antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been reviewed and summarized.

- **Mechanisms**: The first four tables describe their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms.
- **Drug-drug interactions**: Four tables summarize the DDIs likely to be clinically relevant in adults with bipolar disorder. These include two tables for mania treatments (with and without carbamazepine), one for maintenance treatments, and one for depression treatments.

The purpose is to provide practical guidance, helping clinicians manage polypharmacy to avoid adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients with bipolar disorder. This includes both frequent ADRs and those that are rare but potentially lethal. Future articles aim to improve these tables.

Of note, when a treatment is listed as a monotherapy, it implies that it may be used on its own or in combination with other ongoing treatments, even if there are no specific studies demonstrating the efficacy of that combination. In this situation, the assumption is that the previous ongoing treatment was partially effective, and the addition of the new agent will provide benefits in either an additive or synergistic manner. In contrast, agents specifically listed as adjunctive therapy may have no evidence for efficacy as monotherapy and/or may have safety concerns if prescribed as monotherapy (e.g. antidepressants) and are only recommended for use in combination with other evidence‐based agents.

As with previous editions, these guidelines also have a "not recommended" category that includes treatments clearly shown to be ineffective in double‐blind RCTs. Further, we have included another category called "no specific recommendation/agents that require further study" to list treatments with insufficient evidence or clinical experience to make a recommendation, or where there is a reason to believe that negative trials failed because of methodological problems — especially when the results are inconsistent with what is expected based on the pharmacological properties of treatment and clinical experience.

Second-line monotherapy with venlafaxine (level 2) or fluoxetine (level 3) are second-line options.

- **Venlafaxine**: In a small 6-month RCT in patients with BDII who responded acutely to venlafaxine or lithium without a hypomanic switch, there was a trend for lower rates of relapse into depression for patients treated with venlafaxine. Further, the rate of sustained response was significantly greater in those who continued venlafaxine compared to those who continued lithium. No hypomanic episodes occurred in either group.

- **Fluoxetine**: In a 50-week RCT, the mean time to relapse into depression was significantly longer for fluoxetine than for lithium or placebo. Patients had responded acutely to open-label fluoxetine, making the sample enriched for fluoxetine response. Hypomanic episodes occurred in a similarly low frequency in the three groups. In a separate small 6-month placebo-controlled trial, there was a statistical trend for lower relapse rates with fluoxetine compared to placebo. Finally, a post hoc analysis of a large 12-month placebo-controlled trial found that response rates to fluoxetine were similar in BDII and MDD. However, it did not report whether fluoxetine was superior to placebo in BDII.

- **Third-line options**: Divalproex (level 4), carbamazepine (level 3), escitalopram (level 3), other antidepressants (level 3), and risperidone (mainly for prevention of hypomania) (level 4) may be considered as third-line options.

No specific recommendation/agents that require further study: There are insufficient data to make a recommendation.

### Monotherapy versus combined treatment with second-generation antipsychotics in bipolar disorder [^1174gqH7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The American Psychiatric Association guidelines for treating bipolar disorder recommend combination therapies to treat patients experiencing severe acute manic or mixed episodes and breakthrough manic or mixed episodes during maintenance therapy. Combination therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute manic states include the use of second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, in combination with lithium or divalproex; for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination; and for maintenance treatment, quetiapine combined with lithium or valproate.

When combining medications for the management of patients with bipolar disorders, physicians face a potentially complex treatment strategy. Available agents have different mechanisms of action, routes of metabolism and excretion, therapeutic effects, and side effects. Combining treatments can be advantageous owing to therapeutic synergy; however, the liability is an increased possibility of adverse effects. The decision to use a combination therapy should be made based on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication and their specific combination for individual patients.

### Pros and cons of approved therapies for bipolar depression and ongoing unmet needs [^117VzHW7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder tend to experience more depressive episodes than manic ones; however, fewer clinical trials have focused on treatments for bipolar depression compared to bipolar mania. The olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, quetiapine, and lurasidone are the only FDA-approved treatments for bipolar depression. Clinical trials indicate these drugs have similar efficacy but varying side effect profiles. Therefore, clinicians should consider possible adverse events and individual patient characteristics when selecting treatments.

Practice policies and guidelines for the long-term management of bipolar patients have appeared in many parts of Europe and North America. Although recommendations in most areas do concur, remarkable differences are apparent both regarding diagnostic practice and pharmacological management. These differences among recommendations point towards professional and cultural differences between Europe and North America, but they also highlight areas with unresolved research questions and a lack of scientific evidence.

### Balancing benefits and harms of treatments for acute bipolar depression [^115ZDjwt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is more pervasive than mania but has fewer evidence-based treatments.

- **Methods**: Using data from multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses, we assessed the number needed to treat (NNT) for response and the number needed to harm (NNH) for selected side effects for older and newer acute bipolar depression treatments.

- **Results**: The two older FDA-approved treatments for bipolar depression, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) and quetiapine (QTP) monotherapy, were efficacious (response NNT = 4 for OFC, NNT = 6 for QTP) but similarly likely to yield harms (OFC weight gain NNH = 6; QTP sedation/somnolence NNH = 5). Commonly used unapproved agents (lamotrigine monotherapy and adjunctive antidepressants) tended to be well-tolerated (with double-digit NNHs), although this advantage was at the cost of inadequate efficacy (response NNT = 12 for lamotrigine, NNT = 29 for antidepressants). In contrast, the newly approved agent lurasidone was not only efficacious (response NNT = 5 for monotherapy, NNT = 7 as adjunctive therapy) but also had enhanced tolerability (NNH = 15 for akathisia [monotherapy], NNH = 16 for nausea [adjunctive]). Although adjunctive armodafinil appeared well-tolerated, its efficacy in bipolar depression has not been consistently demonstrated in randomized controlled trials.

- **Limitations**: NNT and NNH are categorical metrics; only selected NNHs were assessed; limited generalizability of efficacy (versus effectiveness) studies.

- **Conclusion**: For acute bipolar depression, older approved treatments may have utility in managing the condition, though further insights and developments are necessary to improve treatment strategies.

### "How harmful is your mania to you or others?" Sharing decisions about antidepressant treatment in bipolar depression [^115Vtw3M]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

With only a few approved treatments currently available, the treatment of bipolar depression presents a major challenge for frontline clinicians. The ongoing debate about the off-label use of antidepressants centers on their efficacy and the risk of a switch into mania. Typically, empirical reports involve groups of patients, often overlooking the individual patient perspective. To address this gap, this paper advocates for a practical, patient-oriented approach to managing mania.

### An update on antidepressant use in bipolar depression [^113NvebT]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The effective treatment of depression in people with bipolar disorder remains a clinical challenge. The role of antidepressant medication in treating bipolar depression has been controversial. While early studies and meta-analyses supported a role for antidepressant medication, more recent, high-quality randomized controlled trials in bipolar depression have generally not demonstrated efficacy for antidepressant medications. Although the risk of affective switch and long-term destabilization remains a concern when using antidepressant medications in bipolar disorder, the magnitude of this risk has been difficult to ascertain with confidence. Maintenance use of antidepressant medication has generally not demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Future studies should explore the patient characteristics and response patterns that predict a more favorable response profile to antidepressants amongst patients with bipolar disorder, so that the medications can be rationally used in those who are most likely to benefit.

### Rationale for using lithium in combination with other mood stabilizers in the management of bipolar disorder [^112K6B1c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a complex illness, and no single agent has been proven in randomized, placebo-controlled trials to effectively prevent and/or control all aspects of the illness — acute mania, rapid cycling, and breakthrough depression. However, for the most critical issue, prophylaxis of episodes, lithium has more evidence of efficacy than any other agent. Like lithium, typical antipsychotics, carbamazepine, divalproex, and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine are effective in the treatment of mania.

Carbamazepine, divalproex, and olanzapine seem effective in preventing manic episodes but, like lithium, are less effective in preventing depression. Few trials have been conducted on the more difficult-to-treat characteristics of bipolar disorder, specifically rapid cycling and breakthrough depression. For patients with rapid cycling, carbamazepine or divalproex therapy may improve symptoms, but only lamotrigine has been shown to reduce cycling, mostly in the bipolar II group, in a randomized, placebo-controlled study.

For the treatment of depressive episodes, lithium and olanzapine have shown modest efficacy in controlled trials, and among the mood stabilizers, lamotrigine has the most robust effect. Because manic symptoms may respond best to one agent and depressive symptoms to another, combination therapy may be the optimal treatment for many patients with bipolar disorder. For example, lithium augmentation may improve overall response rates to treatment with carbamazepine or divalproex. The lithium-lamotrigine combination should provide effective prevention of bipolar disorder episodes.

### Current management of bipolar affective disorder: Is it reflective of the BAP guidelines [^113Wd1Hx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

In October 2003, the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP) published evidence-based guidelines on the management of bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to assess whether the guidelines could provide the basis for examining clinical decisions and the extent to which practice accords with these guidelines. Case notes of outpatients with bipolar disorder were reviewed, and demographic details and treatment recommendations were determined. The management of affective episodes was evaluated and compared with BAP guidelines. In 84 subjects, 224 affective episodes were identified. Treatment was consistent with BAP guidelines in 72% of episodes. Mania was more likely to be managed in accordance with guidelines than depression or mixed episodes. The use of antidepressant medication was the most likely intervention to deviate from recommendations. Reasons for treatments at odds with the guidelines were identified. Our study demonstrates that clinical practice among a range of psychiatrists broadly reflects the guidelines that have been issued by the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP). The BAP guidelines offer a practical and auditable basis for the short- and long-term treatment of bipolar affective disorder.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^111P5Vu8]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is primarily based on studies involving nonrefractory patients with bipolar disorder. Consequently, most treatment recommendations and guidelines for bipolar disorder and its various comorbidities rely heavily on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs offer limited guidance for clinicians in determining optimal next steps for non- or partial-responders and those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Given the paucity of RCTs at later treatment stages, we deemed it appropriate to initiate a discussion regarding the quality of data that some field experts might consider when choosing and sequencing drugs and their combinations.

Although many clinical investigators may prefer different sequences, we hope the suggestions provided here will be useful to some clinicians in the field. Moreover, we aim to stimulate discussions of alternative options in the literature and offer a preliminary framework for developing a new round of much-needed clinical trials to improve clinical practice. Due to the broad variability in data quality and clinical principles underlying these suggestions, only minimal references are included. A comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option is beyond this manuscript's scope.

### Effective agents in treating mania [^1118Ag4D]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have been conducted on the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents for bipolar mania since the American Psychiatric Association last revised its guidelines for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. Meta-analyses of the available data show that, of the medications that are efficacious, rates of efficacy are similar, but side effects vary. When determining which drug is best for individual patients, clinicians must consider safety and tolerability in addition to efficacy.

In the edition, an additional distinction is made between safety and tolerability, and a consensus rating is assigned to each medication on these two measures when used in both the acute and maintenance phase. Further, a rating is also assigned to each medication for its propensity to switch patients into mania or depression (treatment-emergent switch). More information on these ratings can be found in the respective treatment sections, as well as in Section 8.

The final grading of recommendations into first, second, or third line considers levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and risk of treatment-emergent switch. In addition, hierarchical rankings were created and are listed in the tables for first and second line recommendations for acute mania, depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder (BDI). This hierarchy was created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness. The rationale for the hierarchical approach is that BD is a chronic lifetime condition with recurrent mood episodes and subsyndromal mood symptoms, and most, if not all, patients will require maintenance treatment. Since treatments prescribed for an acute mood episode are usually continued into maintenance treatment, maintenance efficacy should be considered when choosing acute-phase treatments. Treatments that have demonstrated efficacy across the spectrum of the illness should thus be tried first.

### Safety and efficacy of adjunctive second-generation antidepressant therapy with a mood stabiliser or an atypical antipsychotic in acute bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials [^115kt8Ce]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Although mania and hypomania define bipolar disorder, depressive episodes are more common and impairing, with few proven treatments. Adjunctive therapy with second-generation antidepressants is widely used to treat acute bipolar depression, but their efficacy and safety remain controversial.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to Jan 31, 2016, for randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of second-generation antidepressants adjunctive to a mood stabiliser or an antipsychotic in patients with acute bipolar depression. We extracted data from published reports. The primary outcome was the change in clinician-rated depressive symptom score; secondary outcomes were clinical response, clinical remission, treatment-emergent mania or hypomania, and tolerability (using dropout rates as a proxy). We used pooled random-effects models, subgroup comparisons, and meta-regression for analyses. We made subgroup comparisons based on mood stabiliser or antipsychotic treatment and conducted meta-regression examining trial duration.

- **Findings**: We identified six trials representing 1,383 patients with bipolar depression. Second-generation antidepressants were associated with a small but significant improvement in clinician-rated depressive symptom score (standardised mean differences 0.165 [95% CI 0.051–0.278], p = 0.004). However, clinical response and remission rates did not show significant differences.

Quetiapine is the only recommended first-line treatment for BDII depression (level 1). Pooled analyses of five identically designed trials demonstrated that quetiapine was superior to placebo, and moreover was equally effective for acute depression in BDI and BDII. The latter finding must be reconciled with the fact that quetiapine beat placebo in only three of the five individual trials in patients with BDII, compared to all five in patients with BDI. This is probably because the smaller sample of BDII patients — only about half as many patients with BDII as BDI were enrolled in each of the trials — provided less statistical power for BDII. Finally, open-label studies also suggest efficacy for adjunctive quetiapine (level 4).

- **Second-line treatments**: Include lithium, ideally at a serum level of 0.8–1.2 mEq/L (level 2), and the antidepressants sertraline (level 2) and venlafaxine (level 2), mainly for patients with pure (non-mixed) depression. Lamotrigine (level 2) is also recommended as a second-line agent despite conflicting evidence, with the rationale for this provided in the guidelines. ECT (level 3) can also be considered second-line and is a good option, particularly for treatment-refractory patients and those in need of rapid response.
