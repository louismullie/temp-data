## Question

ascending aorta disection blood pressure medications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about blood pressure medication management in ascending (Stanford type A) aortic dissection, including acute and chronic phases, targets, agents, special populations, and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why BP/heart rate control matters. Then, I should verify acute-phase hemodynamic targets and the sequence of therapy. Next, I will examine first-line agents and alternatives, followed by vasodilator adjuncts and what to avoid. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like hypotension, aortic regurgitation, and pregnancy. Then, I will review chronic-phase targets and oral regimens, including conflicting evidence. Finally, I should confirm monitoring strategies, summarize a practical algorithm, and double-check for any internal inconsistencies to correct them explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pathophysiology. Ascending aortic dissection (Stanford type A) is a hypertensive emergency in which uncontrolled systolic pressure and high dP/dt propagate the false lumen, risking rupture, tamponade, and malperfusion; therefore, immediate reduction of heart rate and systolic BP is foundational to reduce aortic wall stress while arranging urgent surgical repair, which remains the definitive therapy in viable candidates [^115rNeAk] [^1147HFx8] [^114ovjBE].

> I need to verify acute-phase hemodynamic targets. Multiple high-quality guidelines converge on a systolic BP target of 100–120 mmHg and a heart rate target of 60–80 bpm, titrated to the lowest BP that preserves end-organ perfusion. In hypertensive emergency algorithms, a rapid reduction to SBP < 120 mmHg within the first hour is recommended for acute aortic dissection, with continuous invasive arterial monitoring in an ICU setting to guide titration and avoid hypotension [^116wfQTe] [^115Qh8JN] [^114c14TF] [^115uDQbw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about agents before sequencing. The principle is rate before pressure: initiate beta blockade first to blunt catecholamine surge and reflex tachycardia, then add vasodilators if SBP remains above target; vasodilators given alone can increase dP/dt via reflex tachycardia and worsen shear stress, so they should follow adequate beta blockade or be avoided if beta blockade is contraindicated [^115rNeAk] [^115Qh8JN] [^114xpRUb].

> I will now examine first-line therapy. Intravenous beta blockers are recommended initially: esmolol (rapid onset/offset, titratable) or labetalol (alpha/beta blockade) are preferred; metoprolol or propranolol are acceptable alternatives. Wait, I should verify contraindications: avoid beta blockers in acute severe aortic regurgitation, bradyarrhythmias, or heart block; in those cases, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil) are reasonable substitutes for rate control while preparing for definitive care [^115rNeAk] [^116wfQTe] [^115BwZmq].

> Next, I should review vasodilator adjuncts. If SBP remains > 120 mmHg despite adequate beta blockade, add a vasodilator such as nicardipine (preferred for minimal reflex tachycardia), clevidipine, or sodium nitroprusside. Nitroglycerin is less potent for afterload reduction but may be used for pain/ischemia. I need to ensure we avoid reflex tachycardia: vasodilators should not precede beta blockade, and agents like hydralazine or diazoxide that provoke tachycardia should be avoided in this setting [^115rNeAk] [^114xpRUb] [^117JNju4].

> But wait, what if the patient is hypotensive or in tamponade physiology? I should confirm that hypotension in type A dissection often reflects pericardial tamponade or severe aortic regurgitation; in that scenario, aggressive afterload reduction is harmful. The priority is urgent surgical consultation and, if needed, cautious volume resuscitation to a permissive SBP around 90 mmHg to maintain perfusion while avoiding over-resuscitation; pericardiocentesis is controversial and should not delay surgery unless cardiac arrest is imminent [^112gdSkQ] [^116HZQVx] [^115rNeAk].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, beta blockers are first-line (labetalol preferred), whereas ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated due to teratogenicity. Shared decision-making is needed given potential fetal growth effects. In connective tissue disorders such as Marfan or Loeys-Dietz, beta blockers and ARBs are reasonable to reduce hemodynamic stress, though randomized data are limited. ARBs may confer additional benefit in Marfan syndrome for slowing aortic root growth, but this is extrapolated and not specific to acute dissection management [^114rjhka] [^111wNQdV] [^116NuDNy].

> I should double-check the transition to chronic management after stabilization or post-repair. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable and able to take oral medications, convert to oral beta blockers as the cornerstone, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs as preferred adjuncts to achieve and maintain strict BP control; dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be added if needed. Typical chronic targets are SBP ≤ 130 mmHg if tolerated, with more intensive targets of 120–129 mmHg favored by some guidelines, balancing cerebral, coronary, and renal perfusion [^112MGnGp] [^112QR9hP] [^1124pWBH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought beta blockers were unequivocally superior for long-term outcomes, but I should verify the evidence base. Large observational cohorts suggest that both beta blockers and RAAS blockade (ACE inhibitors/ARBs) are associated with lower all-cause mortality and readmissions compared with other antihypertensives, with some signals favoring ARBs over ACE inhibitors; however, recent population-based analyses from Denmark challenge the assumption that beta blockers improve secondary prevention outcomes, highlighting confounding and the need for randomized trials. Given this, a balanced regimen anchored by beta blockade for rate control plus RAAS inhibition for afterload and remodeling effects is reasonable while we await stronger comparative data [^112huPj6] [^111YDxsN] [^116kMdDS] [^112pyYeJ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. In the acute phase, continuous arterial line monitoring is essential because noninvasive cuffs can underestimate BP and delay escalation; I need to ensure frequent reassessment of neurologic, renal, and cardiac perfusion as targets are pursued. Long term, patients require lifelong surveillance imaging of the entire aorta at 6–12 month intervals initially, then annually if stable, along with strict home BP monitoring and aggressive risk-factor modification including statins for atherosclerotic disease and smoking cessation [^117MJdpM] [^111xwpsH] [^113byvaT].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it. Acute type A dissection: start IV beta blocker (esmolol or labetalol) and titrate to HR 60–80 bpm and SBP 100–120 mmHg; if SBP remains high, add a vasodilator (nicardipine or clevidipine) after beta blockade; avoid vasodilators first and avoid hydralazine/diazoxide; manage pain and arrange emergent surgical consultation. Chronic or post-repair: continue oral beta blocker, add ACE inhibitor or ARB, use dihydropyridine CCB if needed, and target SBP ≤ 130 mmHg (ideally 120–129 mmHg if tolerated) with structured imaging follow-up and home BP logs [^116wfQTe] [^115rNeAk] [^112QR9hP].

> Hold on, I should verify one potential inconsistency I introduced earlier. I initially implied that vasodilators like nicardipine could be used first-line in place of beta blockers; that risks reflex tachycardia and increased dP/dt, so the correct sequence is beta blockade first, then vasodilator if needed. Also, I should confirm that sodium nitroprusside remains an option when carefully titrated with adequate beta blockade, but its cyanide toxicity and need for invasive monitoring make nicardipine or clevidipine preferable in many centers [^115rNeAk] [^114xpRUb].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit. Immediate, aggressive control of heart rate and systolic BP is lifesaving in ascending dissection and must begin without delay while arranging surgery. Beta blockers are first-line with vasodilators as adjuncts only after rate control. Chronic therapy should pair beta blockade with RAAS inhibition to achieve stringent BP targets and reduce long-term aortic events, acknowledging evolving and sometimes conflicting evidence and the imperative for randomized trials [^1147HFx8] [^116wfQTe] [^112huPj6].

For ascending aortic dissection, **IV beta-blockers are first-line** (esmolol, metoprolol, or labetalol) to reduce heart rate and aortic wall stress, targeting heart rate 60–80 bpm and systolic BP < 120 mmHg [^116wfQTe] [^115Qh8JN]. If BP remains uncontrolled, add **IV vasodilators** (nicardipine, clevidipine, or nitroprusside) after beta-blockade to prevent reflex tachycardia [^115rNeAk] [^114xpRUb]. Avoid **vasodilators alone** because they can increase shear stress and worsen dissection [^115rNeAk]. For chronic management, use oral beta-blockers with ACE inhibitors or ARBs to maintain SBP 120–129 mmHg if tolerated [^112QR9hP] [^117AArrJ]. Monitor with invasive arterial lines and titrate therapy to the lowest BP that preserves end-organ perfusion [^117MJdpM] [^116wfQTe].

## Acute phase blood pressure management

### Initial medical therapy

- **First-line therapy**: IV beta-blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, labetalol) to reduce heart rate and aortic wall stress [^116wfQTe] [^115Qh8JN].
- **Target heart rate**: 60–80 bpm [^116wfQTe] [^115Qh8JN].
- **Target systolic BP**: < 120 mmHg or the lowest BP maintaining adequate end-organ perfusion [^116wfQTe] [^115rNeAk].

---

### Adjunctive vasodilator therapy

If BP remains uncontrolled after beta-blockade, add **IV vasodilators** (nicardipine, clevidipine, or sodium nitroprusside) [^115rNeAk] [^114xpRUb]. Vasodilators should be started only after adequate **beta-blockade** to prevent reflex tachycardia and increased shear stress [^115rNeAk] [^114xpRUb].

---

### Medications to avoid

Avoid **vasodilators alone** — such as hydralazine or diazoxide — because they can cause reflex tachycardia and increase aortic wall stress [^115rNeAk]. Also avoid **beta-blockers in acute severe aortic regurgitation**, where they may worsen regurgitation and hemodynamics [^111EDqBx].

---

## Chronic phase blood pressure management

### Long-term antihypertensive therapy

- **First-line therapy**: Oral beta-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol, atenolol) to maintain heart rate and BP control [^114WJird] [^114E1Xt4].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs to further reduce BP and aortic wall stress [^114WJird] [^115rNeAk].
- **Target systolic BP**: 120–129 mmHg if tolerated [^112QR9hP].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **BP monitoring** is essential, with home monitoring and clinic visits to ensure targets are sustained [^117JNju4]. Ongoing **imaging surveillance** with periodic CT or MRI is recommended to detect aortic expansion or complications [^111xwpsH].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

Use **beta-blockers** — labetalol is preferred — and avoid ACE inhibitors and ARBs due to teratogenicity [^114rjhka] [^111wNQdV].

---

### Connective tissue disorders

Use **beta-blockers and ARBs** — especially in Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes — to reduce aortic wall stress and slow dilation [^114E1Xt4] [^116NuDNy].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Phase** | **First-line therapy** | **Adjunctive therapy** | **Target bp/hr** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute | IV beta-blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, labetalol) | IV vasodilators (nicardipine, clevidipine, nitroprusside) | SBP < 120 mmHg; HR 60–80 bpm |
| Chronic | Oral beta-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol, atenolol) | ACE inhibitors or ARBs | SBP 120–129 mmHg |

---

Beta-blockers are **first-line** for acute and chronic management of ascending aortic dissection, with vasodilators added only after adequate beta-blockade. Chronic therapy should maintain SBP 120–129 mmHg with regular monitoring and imaging [^116wfQTe] [^112QR9hP].

Substudy 1

Because hypertension is a significant risk factor for AD, a naive comparison between long‐term users of beta blockers and nonusers could result in biased findings due to confounding by underlying hypertension. Confounding by the severity of hypertension should be considered; as hypertension severity increases, there is a greater likelihood of accumulating substantial amounts of beta blockers. Moreover, beta blockers are typically not the first‐line treatment for essential hypertension; individuals resort to high doses of beta blockers only if other antihypertensive treatments prove ineffective. Lastly, confounding by hypertension duration should be noted; the longer the duration, the higher the risk of dissection and the greater the cumulative amount of beta blockers (and other antihypertensive agents), assuming all other factors remain constant. To assess beta blockers as primary prevention, these challenges were addressed by calculating the cumulative dose for each antihypertensive drug used by each individual case and potential control. We applied the defined daily dose (DDD) methodology to express the cumulative dose of all antihypertensives (including beta blockers) in 1 aggregate measure. The DDD is a technical unit of measuring drug quantities, defined by the World Health Organization as the typical maintenance dose when an adult uses the drug for its main indication. By doing this, cases and controls were matched on the presumed severity of the hypertension; never‐users of beta blockers exhibited an equivalent antihypertensive load to the heavy beta blocker users, albeit through different antihypertensive medications. Between 9 and 15 controls for each validated case of AD were matched by age, sex, and cumulative antihypertensive drug use allowing for a range of plus or minus 2 months and a difference of up to 600 DDDs. The index date was set as the date of the first registered event of AD in cases, and controls were assigned an identical index date to their matched case, thereby matching on presumed duration of antihypertensive treatment and hypertension duration. Additionally, cumulative antihypertensive exposure was accounted for using DDD, serving as a proxy for both hypertension severity and duration.

Substudy 2

To evaluate beta blockers as secondary prevention, the validated cases of AD who survived at least 90 days from dissection were followed for up to 5 years, death, or until December 31, 2017. The cohort was stratified as either never‐users or ever‐users of beta blockers after index date, taking the accumulated amount of beta blockers into account (elaborated in the Statistical Analysis section). Here, we focused on medication after the index date because the objective was secondary prevention.

Aortic dissection

Aortic dissection is a devastating complication associated with remarkably high mortality rates in untreated patients. Genetic predisposition and/or degeneration from chronic HTN, aging and atherosclerosis are the usual predisposing factors. Surgical treatment is preferred in type A aortic dissection and in some cases of type B dissection including where there is evidence of a leak (bleeding into cavity) or impending rupture (propagation or development of saccular aneurysm) leading to compromise of blood flow to visceral organs. The Aortic multi-disciplinary team should consider all factors when planning regarding further vascular surgery. Medical management is the treatment of choice for acute uncomplicated type B and chronic aortic dissections. Management of pain and agitation is a priority. The basic principle of treatment is to reduce cyclical load on the wall of the aorta and flap by reducing heart rate to < 60 bpm and lowering BP with β blockers. Reduction of SBP to less than 120 mmHg (target ranging from 90 to 120 mmHg) within 1–2 h has been suggested by several international guidelines, position statements (despite no RCT data to support it. This target may be reasonable in many patients, as long as commensurate with other organ perfusion such as cardiac, renal, and cerebral. Interestingly, hypotension defined as SBP < 90 mmHg is associated with increased mortality in both type A and type B (mortality odds 1.95 (1.08–3.52), 6.43 (2.18–18.98), respectively).

The largest body of evidence for the management of dissection is the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (N = 1301). This retrospective study supported use of β blockers in patients with dissection specifically in Type A and CCBs such as nicardipine in type B dissection, however in practice β blockers are more commonly prescribed in all aortic syndromes. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs may be a useful choice in patients who have contraindications to β blocker therapy. IV labetalol or esmolol infusion (preferred due to shorter half-life) with or without morphine are usually considered first line to lower BP. Nicardipine, GTN, fenoldopam (not available in UK) are mentioned in AHA guidelines as alternatives. Agents that induce tachycardia such as nitroprusside and/or GTN are used only after β blockade.

Long-term surveillance imaging and BP monitoring for all patients with aortic dissection is recommended with SBP maintained to 120 mmHg in patients where this is considered safe (Table 9).

### Long-term use of antihypertensive medications and outcomes in aortic dissection… [^1127PZhJ]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The prevalence of medicated hypertension was highest in the ACEI or ARB group, followed by the control group, and was lowest in the β-blocker group. Patients who underwent surgery for type A aortic dissection were more likely to be prescribed β-blockers than an ACEI or ARB or another antihypertension medication. In aortic dissection, long-term medical therapy is usually prescribed to decrease the stress on the aortic wall and prevent aortic expansion or rupture. 1 Medication therapy for AD is still based on historical observational studies and expert opinion. Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology, 2 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, 3 and Japanese Circulation Society4 recommend β-blockers for the initial management of acute AD.

Observational studies show that the use of β-blockers may decrease the aortic dilatation rate in aortic disease. 5, 6. The prevalence of medicated hypertension was highest in the ACEI or ARB group, followed by the control group, and was lowest in the β-blocker group. Patients who underwent surgery for type A AD were more likely to be prescribed β-blockers than other antihypertensive agents and ACEIs or ARBs. Sensitivity analysis data on all-cause mortality and death due to AD or AA were obtained by using medication use as a time-varying exposure to treatment. The use of either an ACEI or ARB alone or a β-blocker alone was associated with a lower but not statistically significant risk of both all-cause mortality and death due to AD or AA.

Compared with the control group, the use of β-blockers and ACEIs or ARBs was associated with lower risks of mortality and hospital readmission due to any cause. These data provide evidence that ACEI and ARB therapies may be alternatives to β-blocker use for the long-term treatment of AD. Accepted for Publication: January 12, 2021.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection [^113DvzDV]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Adult patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection — hemodynamic management findings include that meeting the heart rate target was associated with lower adverse events (odds ratio 0.25; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.77). Maintaining a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg has not been independently associated with an increase in aortic size in a multivariate analysis. There are no prospective human studies that demonstrate preferential treatment order of lowering heart rate before the blood pressure when selecting the initiating pharmacologic agent. Future research needs to be conducted to define ideal hemodynamic targets and agents in patients with an acute thoracic aortic dissection.

### European Society of Hypertension scientific newsletter: hypertension and aortic diseases [^114ckcai]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension, one of the major cardiovascular risk factors, promotes the formation of atheromatous lesions in the large arteries, including the aorta. It also favors aortic aneurysm and acute aortic syndrome such as aortic dissection or hematoma. In patients with aortic disease, beta-blockers and/or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors should be preferentially used to decrease blood pressure and improve arterial wall properties.

Antihypertensive and beta-blocker management in pregnant patients with aortopathy includes the following: hypertension is a risk factor for aortic dissection in pregnancy; beta blockers are used throughout pregnancy and postpartum, with labetalol suggested as the beta blocker of choice for pregnant women with hypertension; angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are contraindicated during pregnancy; beta-blocker therapy has been shown to lessen aortic growth rates in Marfan syndrome and is recommended to lessen hemodynamic aortic stress in Marfan syndrome and related conditions; in other aortopathies, continuation during pregnancy is recommended unless contraindicated, with shared decision-making given potential fetal growth and weight impacts; in ROPAC, birth weight did not differ significantly between treated and untreated women (2960 g [2358–3390 g] versus 3270 g [2750–3570 g]; P = 0.25); because aortic dissection may occur postpartum, beta-blocker therapy is continued for at least several weeks after delivery and indefinitely when indicated.

The Need to Improve Detection and Management of Inherited Thoracic Aortopathy

Inherited thoracic aortopathies denote conditions in which abnormalities lead to thoracic aortic wall weakness or abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles, predisposing patients to aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, and acute aortic complications. Degradation of the components of the thoracic aortic wall can also occur as part of acquired processes, for example, associated with aging or high blood pressure, factors that potentially compound genetically influenced thoracic aortic wall weakness. Patients with inherited aortopathy are at substantially increased risk of acute aortic complications, including aortic dissection or rupture, carrying with it major mortality risk. Because the outcomes from elective surgery are superior to those associated with emergency repair once dissection has occurred, current international guidelines advocate a focus on recognizing those at risk early, regular monitoring with imaging, and prophylactically replacing the diseased aortic segment once a threshold diameter is reached (Table 1). – Even with these guidelines and robust monitoring, many patients with inherited thoracic aortopathy still experience aortic dissection or rupture while still below the threshold diameter, whereas others may undergo surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysms that are unlikely to dissect or rupture. There is therefore universal agreement that better identification and risk stratification of thoracic aortopathy are urgently required. Indeed, a substantial body of research has been dedicated to exploring and developing novel solutions to this problem. This review summarizes the epidemiology and underlying pathological processes associated with inherited aortopathy, outlines current management strategies, and examines the evidence supporting promising therapeutic targets and emerging biomarkers for these high-risk aortopathies.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergency — BP reduction targets with and without compelling conditions: For adults with a hypertensive emergency related to a compelling condition (eg, acute aortic syndrome or acute aortic dissection), SBP should be reduced to < 140 mm Hg for most conditions and to < 120 mm Hg in acute aortic dissection during the first hour, while monitoring for other target organ dysfunction; for adults without a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced with oral or parenteral therapy by no more than 25% within the first hour, then, if stable, to < 160/100 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours, and then cautiously to 130 to 140 mm Hg during the next 24 to 48 hours to limit target organ injury.

Introduction

Early attempts to pharmacologically reduce the forces that propagate dissection in the aorta were described by Wheat et al in 1965. However, back then, no distinction was made between cases involving the ascending aorta, Stanford type A dissection (TAD), and those originating distal to the left subclavian artery ostium without involvement of the ascending aorta, type B dissection (TBD). The anatomical classifications of aortic dissection (AD) according to DeBakey and Stanford, respectively, were developed during the same era, more than five decades ago, and were put forward in 1965 and 1970, respectively, and surgical repair techniques were described. Since the first publication by the International Registry of acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) consortium in the year 2000, the proportions of patients undergoing surgical management of TAD and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for TBD, respectively, have increased.

The term best medical therapy (BMT) is widely used but rarely defined in studies of AD. In the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) guidelines on the management of descending thoracic aortic diseases, no specific recommendations are given on pharmacological treatment in the chronic phase of AD. In acute AD, treatment with intravenous beta blockers is commonly initiated to reduce the heart rate and the systolic blood pressure. The combination of a beta blocker and one or more vasodilators has often been recommended. The effects on long-term survival in AD patients by statins and antiplatelet drugs, respectively, which play key roles in the management of ischaemic heart disease and stroke, remain to be determined. In the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension, AD is listed as a possible hypertensive emergency, but no disease-specific advice is given regarding blood pressure management in chronic AD.

The aims of the study were to describe medical management in AD in a population-based setting and to analyse the possible associations between antihypertensive, antithrombotic, anticoagulant and statin agents, respectively, and long-term survival.

Clinical Variables Definition

Type A was defined as a dissection involving the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch, and type B was defined as a dissection with an entry tear beyond the left subclavian artery origin and sparing the ascending aorta and aortic arch. AD diagnosis was performed by multislice computed tomography angiography imaging or transesophageal echocardiography. Information regarding clinical presentation and medical history at the time of AD diagnosis was systematically collected from medical charts and included data on age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure (BP) at the arm with highest value, presence of any limb pulse deficit, cardiac tamponade, hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mm Hg), 2 pleural effusion, AD presentation (acute [symptom onset up to 7 days], subacute [symptom onset 8–30 days], and chronic [symptom onset > 30 days or asymptomatic]), 2 AD extension and creatinine levels, history of ever smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, Marfan syndrome, and use of antihypertensive medications. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were defined based on self‐reported diagnosis or reported use of antihypertensive or antidiabetic medications at admission, respectively. Coronary heart disease was defined as a history of previous myocardial infarction or documentation of cardiac ischemia by noninvasive tests (exercise test, stress echocardiography or myocardial perfusion scintigraphy) or coronary angiography. In‐hospital data were also collected and included information on definitive treatment modality used to manage AD (medical therapy, endovascular therapy, or surgery), aortic valve replacement and descending aorta stent placement (solely for patients with type A who underwent surgery), and hospital‐acquired infections.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114Ds5np]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Aortic dilatation and dissection risk — BP targets and pharmacologic prophylaxis in high-risk subjects. Chronic hypertension can be associated with modest aortic root dilatation, and when more extensive dilatation is present or extends beyond the root another cause should be sought; all hypertensive patients with aortic dilatation should have their BP controlled ≤ 130/80 mmHg. In Marfan syndrome, prophylactic use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers seems to be able to reduce either the progression of aortic dilation or the occurrence of complications, although there is no evidence for the specific efficacy of these treatments in aortic disease of other aetiologies.

Blood pressure management in sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) — In patients with TAA and an average systolic BP (SBP) of ≥ 130 mm Hg or an average diastolic BP (DBP) of ≥ 80 mm Hg, the use of antihypertensive medications is recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular events (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In patients with TAA, regardless of cause and in the absence of contraindications, use of beta blockers to achieve target BP goals is reasonable (COR 2a, LOE C-LD), and in patients with TAA, regardless of etiology and in the absence of contraindications, ARB therapy is a reasonable adjunct to beta-blocker therapy to achieve target BP goals (COR 2a, LOE C-EO). Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk for aortic dissection, so achieving a SBP goal of ≤ 130 mm Hg and a DBP goal of ≤ 80 mm Hg is advised, and achieving a more intensive SBP goal of < 120 mm Hg, if tolerated, may have added benefit in selected patients and who are not undergoing surgical repair; no randomized clinical trials have evaluated the optimal thresholds at which BP should be lowered in patients with TAA.

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) medical therapy — scope, typical agents, and cautions: "In all patients with AAS, immediate medical therapy is indicated while considering urgent surgical (in patients with type A aortic dissection), endovascular intervention (in patients with type B aortic dissection), or both; medical therapy includes aggressive heart rate and BP management as well as pain control". "There are no randomized studies that have evaluated different medical treatments in the treatment of AAS", and therapy "is usually accomplished with a combination of intravenous beta blockers (eg, esmolol, metoprolol, and labetalol) and vasodilators (eg, nicardipine, clevidipine, and sodium nitroprusside) with the goal of reducing both heart rate and BP to decrease aortic wall stress". Targets highlighted include "reducing heart rate to 60 to 80 bpm and SBP to < 120 mm Hg", with the principle that "the lowest BP that does not compromise end-organ function should be targeted". "Caution should be used in patients with contraindications to beta blockers (eg, acute AR, heart block, or bradycardia)", and for intolerance "intravenous non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil or diltiazem) are typically used for initial treatment". "Intravenous vasodilators are useful adjunctive therapy for intravenous beta blockers but should be avoided as initial treatment (before starting beta blockers or calcium channel blockers), given the potential for compensatory tachycardia". For longer-term management after dissection, "angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and ARBs are beneficial in the long-term management of hypertension in patients with aortic dissection", and "Statins are used routinely in patients after aortic dissection, although the evidence is not very robust".

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and references in review articles were searched. The authors also attempted to identify the grey literature by contacting trialists.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials that enrolled patients with hypertensive emergencies in which a selected antihypertensive agent was compared with placebo, no treatment, or another drug in a different class. Fifteen randomized controlled trials with 869 patients met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted data from the included studies and selected studies independently. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Primary outcome measures were total serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, and composite of nonfatal cardiovascular events (ie, unstable angina, aortic dissection, acute renal failure, stroke, respiratory failure). Secondary outcome measures were weighted mean difference in systolic pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and withdrawal because of adverse events. The adequacy of concealment and blinding was assessed.

### Current management of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection [^114HtWar]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic dissection is the most common thoracic aortic emergency and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Initial complications are dependent on reduction of sheer stress against the aortic wall to protect against rupture and minimize progression of the aortic wall injury. In patients with dissection starting at or distal to the left subclavian artery (Stanford type B), initial management includes strict blood pressure and heart rate control with monitoring for any complications such as malperfusion, rupture, or hemodynamic instability. Following the acute dissection event, survivors are faced with the lifelong need for blood pressure control and surveillance imaging to monitor for potential aortic deterioration leading to rupture or aneurysm formation. This review will discuss the latest recommendations for current management of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection including the evolving role of endovascular therapies.

A 45 year old executive presents to your office for risk assessment after learning that his sister required an ascending aortic aneurysm repair. He is a well-informed man, concerned about his personal risk for aortic disease, and undergoes a cardiac screen which reveals a dilated ascending aortic aneurysm, measuring a maximal diameter of 4.4 cm. His aortic valve is tricuspid. He is non-Marfanoid and asymptomatic. He realizes that he does not yet meet guideline criteria for aortic surgery, but he is also cognizant of the fact that he is approaching the cut-off for surgical intervention. He wishes to minimize his future risk of aortic rupture, dissection and aortic expansion and seeks your input. Should 'medical treatment' should be employed at this stage? Is there sufficient basis to initiate any form of pharmacotherapy? Would you start a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, an angiotensin receptor blocker, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (doxycycline), or a statin to reduce his aortic risk for rupture, dissection or need for surgical repair? Does your clinical decision match evidence from existing data? Our paper will address these issues among other questions relevant to the role of medical therapy for thoracic aortic disease.

Aortic disease — synopsis highlights risk and treatment emphasis: Hypertension is a major risk factor for AD, including thoracic aortic aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and aortic dissection, resulting in AD-related mortality. The risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture increases by 30% for each 10 mm Hg elevation in BP levels. Intensive BP management and optimal BP control (< 130/80 mm Hg) are important for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with hypertension and AD, although patients may be asymptomatic. BB are recommended, although limited data exist on the optimal choice of antihypertensive medication and have generally been extrapolated from acute aortic syndrome management, such as for acute aortic dissection.

Aortic dissection (AD) is a lethal, treatable disruption of the aortic vessel wall. It often presents without classic features, mimicking symptoms of other conditions, and diagnosis is often delayed. Established high-risk markers of AD should be sought and indicate advanced aortic imaging with CT, MRI, or TEE. Treatment is immediate surgical evaluation, aggressive symptom relief, and reduction of the force of blood against the aortic wall by control of heart rate, followed by blood pressure.

### Evaluation of a standardized protocol for medical management of uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection [^111swtvg]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The goals of medical management for uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection (TBAD) are to prevent expansion of the false lumen and malperfusion syndrome. This is accomplished with antihypertensive agents, but medication selection and titration are typically provider-dependent. Given the paucity of data on evidence-based management of this population, we hypothesized that a standardized TBAD medical management protocol would reduce resource utilization and costs, without compromising patient outcomes.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team developed a goal-directed protocol to standardize the medical management of uncomplicated acute TBAD, with an emphasis on early initiation of oral medications, weaning of anti-hypertensive infusions, and frequent assessment for de-escalation of care. Implementation was in April 2018. A retrospective review of patients with acute TBAD presenting to our institution from April 2016 to April 2020 was performed. Patients requiring aortic or peripheral intervention were excluded. Included patients were analyzed based on treatment before or after protocol implementation. Patient demographics, systolic blood pressure, presence of acute kidney injury at presentation, length of stay, cost metrics, and 30-day mortality were compared.

Results

Thirty-nine patients were included, 21 pre- and 18 post-protocol implementation. Baseline demographics, systolic blood pressure, and presence of acute kidney injury at presentation were similar between the groups. Post-protocol patients had shorter total (8.6 vs 5.5 days; p = 0.02) and intensive care unit (3.2 vs 1.8 days; p = 0.002) length of stay. The protocol was associated with significantly decreased total hospital ($38,928 vs $28,066; p = 0.04), total variable ($23,115 vs $15,627; p = 0.02), and pharmacy ($5094 vs $1181; P < .001) costs, whereas inpatient care costs ($15,152 vs $11,467; p = 0.09) trended down. Post-protocol patients required fewer oral antihypertensive agents at discharge (3.8 vs 2.7; p = 0.005). No significant difference in 30-day mortality was observed.

Conclusions

A goal-directed protocol reduces resource utilization and costs without compromising early mortality rates for patients with uncomplicated acute TBAD. Such a strategy may have broader application in medical management of acute aortic syndromes.

### Poor guideline adherence in a real-world evaluation of hypertensive emergency management [^114C7wyN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association define hypertensive emergency (HTN-E) as a systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg with evidence of end-organ damage (EOD). Based on expert opinion, current guidelines recommend antihypertensive therapy to reduce blood pressure (BP) at specific hourly rates to reduce progression of EOD, outlined by four criteria. Our goal was to describe compliance with guideline recommendations for early management of HTN-E and to analyze safety outcomes related to pharmacologic intervention.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review including patients presenting to the emergency department with HTN-E between September 2016 and August 2020. We excluded patients with a compelling indication for altered therapeutic goals (e.g. acute aortic dissection, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, and pheochromocytoma). The primary outcome was complete adherence with guideline recommendations in the first 24 h.

Results

Of 758 screened records, 402 were included. Mean age was 54 years and majority Black race (72%). Overall, total adherence was poor (< 1%): 30% received intravenous therapy within 1 h, 64% achieved 1-h BP goals, 44% achieved 6-h goals, and 9% had appropriate 24-h maintenance BP. Hypotensive events (N = 67) were common and antihypertensive-associated EOD (N = 21) did occur. Predictors of hypotension include treatment within 1 h and management with continuous infusion medication.

Conclusions

Current practice is poorly compliant with guideline criteria and there are risks associated with recommended treatments. Our results favor relaxing the expert opinion-based recommendations.

### Resistant hypertension in patients with chronic aortic dissection [^113boBxC]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Strict blood pressure control is pivotal in the management of patients with aortic dissection (AD), but is frequently difficult to achieve. We determined antihypertensive medical therapy and levels of blood pressure (BP) control in 40 patients with chronic AD. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical variables, serial BP measurements, and antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients were divided into two groups: patients in group 1 had effective BP control (< 135/80 mmHg), patients in group 2 had resistant hypertension (BP ≥ 135/80 mmHg despite prescription of at least three antihypertensive drugs). Overall, systolic BP (SBP) was 130 ± 20 mmHg, and diastolic BP (DBP) was 72 ± 13 mmHg. Patients received a median of 4 (1–6) antihypertensive drugs. beta-blockers were used in 38/40 (95%) patients. Effective BP control was achieved in 24/40 (60%) patients (group 1), while 16/40 (40%) patients had resistant hypertension (group 2) despite receiving significantly more antihypertensive drugs (5 [4–6] vs 4 [1–5], P = 0.001). Mean SBP was 116 ± 9 (101–132) mmHg in group 1 and 151 ± 13 (137–181) mmHg in group 2 (P < 0.001); there was no difference in DBP. Group 2 patients had a significantly higher body mass index and were younger than patients in group 1. In conclusion, in the majority of patients with chronic AD, effective BP control can be achieved, but usually requires the combination of multiple antihypertensive drugs. However, in a significant proportion of patients (40%), who appear to be younger and more obese, medical therapy fails to achieve effective BP control despite use of a multiple drug regimen.

### Anesthetic management for cesarean section in two parturient with ascending aortic aneurysm: a case-based discussion [^113Zp9nE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In both of our cases, management during pregnancy focused on the reduction of arterial pressure and control of heart rate with the use of a beta-blocker, while anesthesia for cesarean section aimed to mitigate the neuroendocrine response to intubation, thus maintaining hemodynamic stability and minimizing the risks of aortic aneurysm rupture or dissection.

Beta-blockers have been shown to successfully control blood pressure and heart rate and slow the progression of aortic root enlargement. However, not all beta-blockers are safe for use during pregnancy. For instance, atenolol has been associated with fetal malformations and hypospadias when used during the first trimester, whereas metoprolol, propranolol and bisoprolol are deemed safe for use during pregnancy, although regular fetal growth monitoring is recommended.

The management of pregnant patients with aortic aneurysm is probably best conducted through a multidisciplinary approach at a tertiary center, involving obstetrician, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, and preferably medical geneticist. Close monitoring, strict blood pressure control and regular heart ultrasound examinations to evaluate of aortic root diameter every 4–8 weeks are crucial. Echocardiography is considered to be a safe method, so both of our patients had monthly cardiac evaluations that included cardiac ultrasound examination in addition to regular obstetric checkups.

On the other hand, CT angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing acute aortic dissection, with the benefits of an accurate diagnosis outweighing the risks of radiation exposure (0.01–0.66 mGy), which are below the threshold for fetal injury (50 mGy). However, CT angiography was used as a diagnostic procedure before pregnancy in one of the described cases, while in the second case, magnetic resonance angiography was used to diagnose aortic aneurysm during early pregnancy. Currently, there are no studies that have shown any attributable harms of magnetic resonance imaging during any trimester of pregnancy.

Surgical repair of known aortic aneurysms and other valvular and aortic conditions meeting certain criteria is recommended prior to pregnancy (which had been also recommended to our patient in the second case), with surgery during pregnancy considered only when conservative treatment fails to control aortic dilation progression (aortic diameter increases too rapidly or exceeds 5 cm, or if aortic valve regurgitation is present) or when the mother's life is at risk.

Medical therapy after ATAAD — β‑blocker use is associated with improved survival, while angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor use showed no association with mortality. Blood pressure management after ATAAD repair has a dramatic effect on long‑term outcomes and β‑adrenergic blockade reduces heart rate and blood pressure while decreasing aortic wall stress independent of blood pressure effects. In a nationwide study of 396 propensity score–matched pairs, β‑blocker treatment was associated with lower mortality rates (16% vs 27%; P < .001). An IRAD analysis also showed improved survival (P = .006) in patients subsequently treated with β‑blockers. This study showed no association between angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor use and mortality, and other studies have confirmed the importance of β‑blocker usage after ATAAD repair.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^116QqEcL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Aortic Dissection

The short‐term risk of dying immediately after the onset of dissection (particularly the type A) characterizes an aortic dissection as a medical emergency. BP is frequently high at presentation in the emergency setting because of the intense pain and because most patients have chronic hypertension, the primary cause of aortic syndromes. The rationale to lower BP in this context aims to reduce the wall tension and the shear stress, which promotes endothelial tearing and enhances the disruption of the media layer of the aorta.

Hypertension guidelines, and a recent reviewrecommend lowering systolic BP below 120 mm Hg in patients with aortic dissection, accompanied by heart rate reduction. These strategies were not and will not be tested in randomized controlled trials with major cardiovascular outcomes. Specific guideline provides a broader coverage of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, focusing primarily on the criteria to recommend medical, surgical, or percutaneous therapies.

### Hypertension in thoracic aortic dissection: a meta-analysis-based considerations in the choice of antihypertensive agents [^11167x7H]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a potentially fatal condition. It has been linked with hypertension, and guidelines recommend antihypertensives.

Methods

Electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE with the following search strategy: (("thoracic aortic dissection"[Mesh]) AND ("antihypertensive agents"[Mesh] from database inception to August 2024.

Results

Hypertension is associated with a significant risk of TAD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.51 (95% CI: 1.75–3.60). Beta-blocker treatment produces a significant (P < 0.01) lower risk of an MACE HR of 0.55 (95% CI = 0.39–0.77). Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or ACE inhibitors also lower the risk of a major adverse cardiac event with a HR of 0.67 (95% CI = 0.58–0.78). Calcium channel blockers (CCB) significantly (P = 0.0007) lowered MACE outcomes with a HR of 0.66 (95% CI = 0.53–0.84). A network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relative risk of aortic events associated with commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents, using beta-blockers (BB) as the reference comparator. Compared to BB, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE/ARB) were associated with a non-significant increase in risk (HR 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91–1.81). CCB also demonstrated a non-significant reduction in risk (HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.33–1.40) to BBs.

Conclusions

Hypertension is strongly associated with a risk of TAD. Beta-blockers are associated with the greatest reduction in MACE and remain the most effective first-line therapy for patients at risk of TAD. ACE inhibitors and ARBs also demonstrate benefit.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies in nonpregnant and nonstroke adults — acute blood pressure (BP) lowering targets and when to avoid acute reduction: For adults with a hypertensive emergency related to a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced to < 140 mm Hg for most conditions and to < 120 mm Hg in acute aortic dissection during the first hour while monitoring for other target organ dysfunction (COR 1; LOE C-LD). For adults with a hypertensive emergency but without a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced with oral or parenteral therapy by no more than 25% within the first hour; then if stable, to < 160/100 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours; and then cautiously to 130 to 140 mm Hg during the next 24 to 48 hours to limit target organ injury (COR 1; LOE C-LD). For adults with severe hypertension (≥ 180/120 mm Hg) hospitalized for noncardiac conditions without evidence of acute target organ damage, intermittent use of additional IV and/or oral antihypertensive medications are not recommended to acutely reduce BP (COR 3: Harm; LOE B-NR).

Historically, the gold standard for treating acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (TBAD) has been aggressive medical therapy to achieve optimal heart rate and blood pressure control. However, recent data have demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients with medically managed acute uncomplicated TBAD have late aorta-related complications, such as aneurysmal degeneration, that increase mortality and often necessitate surgical intervention. In this review, the authors review existing literature on uncomplicated TBAD and highlight contemporary surgical and medical strategies to manage this condition. Looking ahead, efforts are underway to identify and characterize a high-risk subgroup of acute uncomplicated TBAD patients who may benefit from early intervention.

### Chronic descending aortic dissections [^114NJhtn]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Aortic dissection involving the descending aorta has a predictable and often debilitating course of progressive dilatation that occurs once patients survive the acute phase of the disease. Important factors that impact the rate and degree of dilatation include the persistence of a false lumen channel (and the amount of thrombus), the control of hypertension, and the presence of an underlying connective tissue disorder. The mainstay of management of chronic descending aortic dissections is antihypertensive therapy including beta-blockade until the dissected aorta becomes significantly aneurysmal. Surgical management is recommended at that point. Multiple advances have been made that have improved the results of operative repair of aneurysmal descending aortic dissections including circulation management methodologies, CSF drainage, neurocerebral monitoring, and more recently, endovascular therapies. The presentation, diagnosis and management of chronic descending aortic dissections are discussed.

Loeys-Dietz syndrome — medical therapy and approach: The management of individuals with Loeys-Dietz syndrome includes medical therapy, lifestyle modification, imaging surveillance, and surgical intervention, and to lessen hemodynamic stress on the aorta, beta blockers are used; based on studies of mouse models, ARBs have also been used. There are no randomized trials of medications to reduce aortic growth or the risk of aortic dissection in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and thus the use of beta blockers, ARBs, or both is reasonable.

### Clinical, diagnostic, and management perspectives of aortic dissection [^1131Pp7Y]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

The incidence of aortic dissection ranges from 5 to 30 cases per million people per year, depending on the prevalence of risk factors in the study population. Although the disease is uncommon, its outcome is frequently fatal, and many patients with aortic dissection die before presentation to the hospital or prior to diagnosis. While pain is the most common symptom of aortic dissection, more than one-third of patients may develop a myriad of symptoms secondary to the involvement of the organ systems. Physical findings may be absent or, if present, could be suggestive of a diverse range of other conditions. Keeping a high clinical index of suspicion is mandatory for the accurate and rapid diagnosis of aortic dissection. CT scanning, MRI, and transesophageal echocardiography are all fairly accurate modalities that are used to diagnose aortic dissection, but each is fraught with certain limitations. The choice of the diagnostic modality depends, to a great extent, on the availability and expertise at the given institution. The management of aortic dissection has consisted of aggressive antihypertensive treatment, when associated with systemic hypertension, and surgery. Recently, endovascular stent placement has been used for the treatment of aortic dissection in select patient populations, but the experience is limited. The technique could be an option for patients who are poor surgical candidates, or in whom the risk of complications is gravely high, especially so in the patients with distal dissections. The clinical, diagnostic, and management perspectives on aortic dissection and its variants, aortic intramural hematoma and atherosclerotic aortic ulcer, are reviewed.

### Blunt thoracic aortic injury-concepts and management [^113viBhF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Medical management/resuscitation phase

Initial management involves primary and secondary surveys with adjunctive tests that are appropriate for a patient's clinical status. Sufficient monitoring and large bore IVs should be obtained. This assessment includes the treatment and identification of hemorrhagic shock. However, once blunt thoracic aortic injury is suspected or diagnosed, permissive hypotension and reasonable volume expansion should be practiced, preventing expanding the dissection to rupture or end organ damage. Heart rate and blood pressure control can slow the expansion of the blunt thoracic injury. Goal systolic blood pressure and heart rate are 100 mm hg and less than 100 bpm respectively. In a center without definitive care, these parameters can be used to assist in transferring a stable patient or a bleeding patient with controlled extra-aortic sources of hemorrhage to a definitive care center.

Esmolol is the medication of choice for blunt thoracic aortic injury secondary to its rapid onset and short half-life, making it easy to wear off if hemorrhagic and other causes of shock should arise. Diltiazem, nitroglycerin and nitroprusside can also be used in conjunction with or alternative to esmolol, although understanding their pharmacokinetics and side effects is imperative. Importantly, pharmacologic control of blood pressure and heart rate dramatically reduce the risk of rupture to < 2%.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous antihypertensive drugs for hypertensive emergencies with selected comorbidities — For acute aortic dissection, preferred drugs are esmolol and labetalol, and management requires rapid lowering of SBP to ≤ 120 mm Hg; beta blockade should precede vasodilator administration if needed, and SBP ≤ 120 mm Hg should be achieved within 20 min. In acute coronary syndromes, preferred drugs include esmolola, labetalol, nicardipine, and nitroglycerin; nitrates given in the presence of PDE-5 inhibitors may induce profound hypotension, and beta blocker contraindications include bradycardia (< 60 beats/min) and hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg). For perioperative hypertension defined as BP ≥ 160/90 mm Hg or SBP elevation ≥ 20% of the preoperative value that persists for ≥ 15 min, preferred drugs are clevidipine, esmolol, nicardipine, and nitroglycerin; intraoperative hypertension is most frequently seen during anesthesia induction and airway manipulation.

### Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring may aid in the medical management of hypertensive patients with acute aortic disease [^117MJdpM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blood pressure (BP) monitoring and management is essential in the treatment of acute aortic disease (AoD). Previous studies had shown differences between invasive arterial BP monitoring (ABPM) and non-invasive cuff BP monitoring (CBPM), but not whether ABPM would result in patients' change of clinical management. We hypothesized that ABPM would change BP management in AoD patients.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study of adult patients with AoD admitted to the Critical Care Resuscitation Unit from January 2019 to February 2021. Patients with AoD and both ABPM and CBPM measurements were included. Clinician's BP management goals were assessed in real time before and after arterial catheter placement according to current guidelines. We defined change of management as change of current antihypertensive infusion rate or adding a new agent. We used multivariable logistic and ordinal regressions to determine relevant predictors.

Results

We analyzed 117 patients, and 56 (47%) had type A dissection. ABPM was frequently ≥ 10 mmHg higher than CBPM values. Among 40 (34%) patients with changes in management, 58% (23/40) had [ABPM-CBPM] differences ≥ 20 mmHg. ABPM prompted increasing current antihypertensive infusion in 68% (27/40) of patients. Peripheral artery disease (OR 13, 95% CI 1.18–50+) was associated with changes in clinical management, and ordinal regression showed hypertension and serum lactate to be associated with differences between ABPM and CBPM.

Conclusions

ABPM was frequently higher than CBPM, resulting in 34% of changes of management, most commonly increasing anti-hypertensive infusion rates.

### Acute aortic syndrome [^1178FYTg]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

How is it managed?

In the UK, AAS is managed according to principles set out in the NHS acute aortic dissection toolkit, which NHS England produced to improve outcomes from AAS. Elsewhere, local guidelines are applicable. Acute management involves analgesia and reducing systolic blood pressure to 100–120 mmHg. Type A AAS is usually managed operatively in a regional aortic centre. Type B AAS is split into complicated or non-complicated by the presence of haemodynamic instability and/or malperfusion of an organ system or limb. Uncomplicated type B AAS is usually managed medically with blood pressure control. Although patients may not require transfer to a tertiary centre, they should all be discussed with a cardiothoracic or vascular specialist to agree management. Complicated type B AAS may require tertiary transfer for endovascular stent graft placement. In-hospital mortality is 22% for type A and 13% for type B aortic dissection.

Future developments

Research into biomarkers may produce new tests to assist with diagnosis of AAS, while further evaluation of ADD-RS, D-dimer, and point-of-care ultrasound may clarify their role. This could lead to reduced risk of misdiagnosis and reduced reliance on computed tomographic angiography to rule out AAS.

### Blood pressure and heart rate management in patients after repair of type A aortic dissection [^113oU4CL]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The long-term optimal targets for blood pressure and heart rate in patients after surgical repair of acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD) remain unclear. This study evaluated the long-term association of blood pressure and heart rate control on patients after TAAD surgical repair.

Methods

We identified 839 patients who underwent TAAD surgical repair and survived to discharge between 2003 and 2018 from the Chang Gung Research Database. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, aortic progression, and aortic surgery events. Vital signs examined were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate (HR) at discharge and at 3 months of follow-up.

Results

The patients were a mean age of 57.2 ± 13.6 years, and approximately two-thirds were men. The results showed that SBP > 150 mm Hg at discharge was correlated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.21; 95% CI, 1.61–6.37). Moreover, an HR between 81 and 100 beats/min was associated with a higher hazard of all-cause mortality (aHR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.28–5.24) and an HR > 100 beats/min was also associated with a higher hazard of aortic surgery events (aHR, 2.19; 95% CI 1.24–3.86) compared with an HR of ≤ 80 beats/min at discharge. During the 3-month follow-up, an HR > 100 beats/min was associated with a higher hazard of all-cause mortality (aHR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.19–10.78) relative to an HR ≤ 80.

Conclusions

The careful management of blood pressure and HR contributes to favorable long-term outcomes in patients after surgical repair of TAAD.

Arterial dissection

Arterial dissection is a process in which blood tracks between the layers of an artery wall, forcing them apart. This can be an acute or chronic process, initiated by a defect in the vessel due to shear stress, inflammation, trauma or at the site of an aneurysm. Seventy per cent of major vessel dissections occur in the ascending thoracic aorta (Stanford type A), 7% in the thoracic arch, 20% in the descending thoracic or thoraco‐abdominal aorta (Stanford type B) and 2% in the abdominal aorta (Howard 2014; Roberts 1991). Stanford type A requires urgent or emergency open surgical or endovascular repair, whilst Stanford type B may also be managed by reducing blood pressure with medications (Bannazadeh 2016; Cooper 2016; Elsayed 2017; Ulug 2012). Risk factors for aortic dissection include inherited or acquired connective tissue disorders, high blood pressure and aortic aneurysm (Paterick 2013). Acute aortic dissection has an estimated incidence of 52 per 100,000 per year, 60% occur in men, and it has a high risk of death (approximately 73% 30‐day mortality if Stanford type A, and 13% mortality if Stanford Type B) (Howard 2013). If the aortic valve is involved in thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection, surgical repair may require cardiac surgeons.

### Outcomes of patients with acute type B (deBakey III) aortic dissection: a 13-year, single-center experience [^113e5zwK]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Definitions

Aortic dissection was classified as type B, according to the Stanford classification, if the dissection did not involve the ascending aorta. In recent years, with the increasing use of TEVAR, we have referred to the DeBakey classification, as originally described in 1965, specifically DeBakey type IIIa and IIIb, because this designation is more anatomically specific. Only patients who presented in the acute setting were included in the study. Acute was defined as the clinical diagnosis made within 2 weeks of presentation; subacute, between 2 and 6 weeks; and chronic, > 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

We defined cATBAD as rupture, expansion of diameter on imaging during the admission, persistent pain, and clinical malperfusion leading to a deficit in cerebral, spinal, visceral, renal, or peripheral vascular territories at presentation or during the initial hospitalization. This was determined on both radiographic and clinical grounds. Patients with isolated penetrating aortic ulcers were excluded. Early mortality was defined as death occurring within 30 days of admission or death occurring during initial hospitalization.

Clinical Management

On admission, acute aortic dissection protocol was initiated in all patients diagnosed with ATBAD. This included admission to the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit, continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring, central venous access for antihypertensive medication, and urine output monitoring. The management goal was to achieve a systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 mm Hg with resolution of symptoms. Patients with cATBAD underwent an intervention based on their type of complication.

Once blood pressure was controlled and treatment was transitioned to oral antihypertensive medications, patients were transferred from the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit. Before discharge, patients underwent a chest, abdomen, and pelvis computed tomography study without contrast or magnetic resonance imaging to establish the baseline aortic status and to assess for rapid aortic growth since the initial admission scan.

### Beta blockers as primary and secondary prevention for aortic dissections in nonsyndromic patients with hypertension [^115FQany]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recommendations for beta blockers in preventing aortic dissection (AD) and improving postdissection survival in nonsyndromic patients with hypertension are based on limited evidence.

Methods

This nationwide, population-based study combined a nested case-control and historical cohort design. Using Danish health care registries, all hospitalized adult patients with AD from 1996 to 2016 were identified and validated. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves or connective tissue disorders were excluded. In the case-control analysis, 1657 validated AD cases were matched 1:10 (± 1) with 16139 controls with hypertension based on age, sex, index date, and cumulative antihypertensive drug use. Long-term beta blocker use was defined as ≥ 2000 defined daily doses (DDD). In the cohort analysis, 2120 validated survivors of AD were followed for 5years to assess postdissection mortality stratified by beta blocker use.

Results

Long-term beta blocker use was associated with increased odds of AD type A (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3–2.3]) and AD type B (aOR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.7–5.2]) compared with never-users. A dose-dependent risk increase was observed for AD type B (aOR, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.8–2.2] for DDD 100–199; aOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 1.6–9.8] for DDD ≥ 10000). Beta blocker use was associated with higher 5-year all-cause mortality in survivors of AD type A (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.5 [95% CI, 0.99–2.23]) and AD type B (aHR, 1.5 [95%CI, 1.0–2.3]) compared with never-users.

Conclusions

Beta blocker use did not reduce AD risk or improve outcomes in survivors of AD compared with other antihypertensive agents. Although clinically relevant data as aortic diameters and blood pressure were not available, these findings challenge current clinical practice and highlight the need for randomized trials.

### Ketorolac in the perioperative management of acute type A aortic dissection: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1158z8k1]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Now, aortic dissection continues to have high mortality rates, highlighting the pressing need for new strategies to decrease perioperative deaths. Research by Zhang et al. indicates that ketorolac can reduce macrophage-driven inflammation and matrix degradation. Although the ACC/AHA guidelines warn about possible blood pressure increases and AKI risk with ketorolac, our study found no such adverse effects. Data on postoperative peek BP > 140 mmHg, cytokines related to kidney and liver function (e.g. TNF-α) and serum indicators (e.g. creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) showed no significant changes (Additional file 1: Table S1). With diligent perioperative management-including blood pressure regulation and diuretics-ketorolac's safety profile appears robust. We also noted a non-significant decrease in mortality and organ malperfusion, coupled with significant reductions in ICU stay, intraoperative bleeding, and potentially associated costs, suggesting the broader ACC/AHA guidelines may not entirely apply to aortic dissection cases.

Bleeding remains a significant issue during aortic dissection repairs, leading to the development of various management techniques. However, these approaches often require specialized expertise or costly materials, making the use of affordable medications like ketorolac attractive. Our baseline data indicate that the surgery time was shorter in the ketorolac group. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of CPB, ACC, or DHCA times. Furthermore, thromboelastography and APTT values upon ICU admission showed no differences between the groups. This suggests that the reduction in bleeding and exudation is likely unrelated to coagulation and is more likely associated with ketorolac. The decrease in bleeding and exudation may have contributed to a shorter chest closure time, which could explain the reduction in surgery duration. According to feedback from the primary surgeon, the shortened chest closure time might be related to increased tissue stiffness of the aorta, which facilitated surgical suturing. This was further validated by the reduced drainage volume within 24 h postoperatively, with the ketorolac group showing significantly lower postoperative exudation.

Diagnosis and treatment of severe hypertension and hypertensive emergency — patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 120 mm Hg are evaluated for acute target organ damage, defined as acute heart failure/pulmonary edema, neurologic disorders, acute decompensated heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, acute kidney injury, and acute aortic syndrome. In aortic dissection, reduce to < 120 mm Hg; in pheochromocytoma crisis, reduce SBP < 140 mm Hg in the first hour; otherwise, reduce SBP by 25% in the first hour and to < 160/100–110 over the next 6 hours and to normal in the next 24–48 hours. Evaluate inpatient (INP) versus outpatient (OPT) treatment depending on indication(s) other than BP alone and avoid parenteral BP lowering therapy or intensified oral therapy in the acute setting. When identified in the outpatient (OPT) setting, there is no need to refer to the emergency department (ED); reinstitute and intensify or modify medical therapy in the OPT setting, with close follow-up in the OPT setting in 4 weeks.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) — intervention for acute severe AR from infective endocarditis or aortic dissection may include temporary afterload reduction, but surgery should not be delayed, especially with hypotension, pulmonary edema, or low flow. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is contraindicated in acute severe AR. Beta blockers, though often used for aortic dissection, should be used very cautiously, if at all, for other causes of acute AR because they can block compensatory tachycardia and precipitate a marked reduction in blood pressure.

### Ascending geometry after thoracic endovascular aortic repair for descending aortic dissection [^1155cMG7]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to assess geometry changes of the ascending aorta after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for descending aortic dissection and identify potential risk factors for diameter and length change.

Methods

Between April 2009 and July 2021, 102 patients were treated for acute descending aortic dissections (type B and non-A non-B) with TEVAR and were included in this analysis. Computed tomography angiographic scans were transferred to a dedicated imaging software and detailed aortic measurements (including length, diameter and area) were taken in multiplanar reconstruction postoperatively, after 6 months and annually thereafter.

Results

Sixty-five (58%) patients were male, with a mean age of 66 (± 11). Four (4%) patients were diagnosed with connective tissue disease. Before TEVAR, 79% of our patients were treated with a mean of 1.5 (± 1.2) different classes of antihypertensive medications. This number rose to 98% after TEVAR and 2.7 (± 1.0) different antihypertensive drugs. There was no significant change in length, diameter, cross-sectional area, or volume of the ascending aorta during the follow-up of 3 years after TEVAR. Body height was a negative predictor for mean ascending aortic diameter (P value = -0.013; B = -8.890) and mean aortic diameter at the level of the brachiocephalic trunk (P value = 0.039; B = -14.763).

Conclusions

Our data suggest no significant changes in the ascending aorta following TEVAR of the descending thoracic aorta during mid-term follow-up when under stringent blood pressure medication. Additionally, we did not find any modifiable risk factors for geometry parameter increase.

Hypertensive emergencies — burden and management principles: Patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. Common forms of acute hypertension-related target organ damage include acute heart failure/pulmonary edema, neurologic disorders (encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], acute ischemic stroke), and acute kidney injury (AKI), with aortic dissection the least common presentation. Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of blood pressure (BP) to prevent or limit further target organ damage, whereas patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy; reinstitution or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients.

Optimal postoperative management for patients recovering from ATAAD consists of blood pressure control and lifelong radiologic follow-up with cross-sectional imaging of the entire aorta. Medical therapy aimed at reducing blood pressure and aortic wall stress should be initiated and properly explained to ensure adherence; imaging tests should be scheduled at appropriate intervals and used to assess the aortic valve, ventricular function, and aortic remodeling. Patients' first‑degree relatives should be screened with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and, if certain clinical features are present, the patient should be offered genetic testing for an HTAD.

Missed diagnosis of type A dissection is associated with an approximate doubling of mortality (hazard ratio 2.14, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 5.13)and delayed surgery is associated with increased mortality (67% at 8–12 hours versus 20% at 0–4 hours after diagnosis). Blood pressure control using beta blockers is associated with an approximate halving of mortality in type B dissection.

NHS Resolution, an organisation of the UK Department of Health and Social Care that provides expertise on resolving healthcare based concerns and disputes, identified aortic disease, including dissection, as a common cause of fatality related negligence claims. A study of 135 medical practice litigations across the US involving aortic dissection cited failure to diagnose as the reason for litigation in 64%. A review by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch found that half of patients with acute aortic dissection die before reaching any specialist centre in the UKand a systematic review of 14 studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest identified that the 7% caused by aortic dissection had 100% mortality.

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) initial medical management — in patients presenting to the hospital with AAS, prompt treatment with anti-impulse therapy with invasive monitoring of BP with an arterial line in an ICU setting is recommended as initial treatment to decrease aortic wall stress. Patients with AAS should be treated to an SBP < 120 mm Hg or to lowest BP that maintains adequate end-organ perfusion, as well as to a target heart rate of 60 to 80 bpm. In patients with AAS, initial management should include intravenous beta blockers, except in patients with contraindications, and in those with contraindications or intolerance to beta blockers, initial management with an intravenous non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is reasonable for heart rate control. In patients with AAS, initial management should include intravenous vasodilators if the BP is not well controlled after initiation of intravenous beta-blocker therapy, and patients with AAS should be treated with pain control, as needed, to help with hemodynamic management.

Treatment

In general terms, descending aortic dissections are treated medically unless specific complications arise (rupture, organ malperfusion, impending rupture). This is called the 'complication-specific' approach(see table 1). For descending dissection, when surgical treatment is necessary, interventional techniques usually suffice.

Table 1
General treatment paradigms for acute aortic dissection (see text)

For acute ascending aortic dissection, treatment is surgical in all viable candidates, as the risk of death from rupture, cardiac tamponade, acute aortic insufficiency or organ ischaemia is great. Ascending aortic replacement, with or without aortic valve repair or replacement, is the procedure of choice. In patients who are not surgical candidates, because of stroke, malignancy, advanced age or profound comorbidities, so-called 'anti-impulse therapy' is instituted. This comprises a β-blocker to decrease the force of cardiac contraction and an afterload reducing agent (usually sodium nitroprusside) to lower the blood pressure (see figure 4). We usually drop the heart rate to 60 and the blood pressure to 100 mm Hg systolic (unless cerebral or renal hypoperfusion become manifest).

Figure 4
Pharmacological anti-impulse therapy. Diagram of aortic pressure curves under various conditions. The continuous line (B) represents the baseline state. Administration of a vasodilator agent such as nitroprusside is represented by the dashed curve (A). There is significant decrease in pressure levels and acceleration in heart rate, but this is accompanied by a steepest slope of the ascending portion of the curve (increased dp/dtmax). β-Blockade administration is represented by the dotted line (C). Although the degree of pressure lowering is usually smaller, the drug's negative inotropic and chronotropic effects result in decreased impulse and dp/dtmax. Reproduced with permission from Sanz et al.

For acute ascending aortic dissection, surgical therapy now produces survival rates of 85% or better, especially in specialised centres. Without surgery, it used to be said, outcome was uniformly lethal. Today, with careful intensive care unit management and anti-impulse therapy, over one-half of non-operative patients can be saved to survive the acute event.

In the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm, because the abdominal aorta is easily visualised by ECHO, a special opportunity is afforded by routine screening. It has been determined that a negative screen for abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 65 (Medicare age) assures that the screened patient will never die of ruptured aortic aneurysm during his remaining life expectancy.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm — beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in Marfan-associated disease: Prospective data on the positive effects of beta blockers in TAA are limited, with the most robust evidence derived from cohort studies of those with Marfan syndrome; in a small, open-label, randomized clinical trial of prophylactic propranolol (mean dose, 212 ± 68 mg/d) versus placebo in adolescents and adults with Marfan syndrome, beta-adrenergic blocking drugs slowed aortic root growth and reduced aortic complications, and in a study of 155 children < 12 years of age with Marfan syndrome, beta blockers decreased the rate of aortic root growth by 0.16 mm/y. In the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guideline, beta-blocker therapy is the recommended first-line antihypertensive drug therapy for patients with hypertension and TAD. A meta-analysis of 1,510 randomized patients evaluating the effect of ARBs on TAA associated with Marfan syndrome showed slower growth of the aortic root with the use of ARBs compared with placebo, no difference in aortic growth in a direct comparison with beta-blocker therapy, and slower aortic growth for the combination of beta blocker plus ARB than for beta blockers alone. The Jikei Heart Study reported valsartan use with a lower rate of adverse cardiovascular events and a reduction in the incidence of aortic dissection; however, this study was subsequently retracted and, consequently, the LOE for use of ARBs has been downgraded to C from B.

### Association of long-term use of antihypertensive medications with late outcomes among patients with aortic dissection [^111YDxsN]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between long-term medication therapy and late outcomes among patients with aortic dissection?

Findings

In this population-based cohort study of 6978 adults with aortic dissection, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower among patients prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and those prescribed a β-blocker than among those prescribed other antihypertension agents. The risk of all-cause mortality was lower in the ARB group than in the ACEI group in long-term follow-up.

Meaning

Compared with other antihypertension agents, β-blockers and ACEIs or ARBs may be associated with benefits in the long-term treatment of aortic dissection.

### Association of long-term use of antihypertensive medications with late outcomes among patients with aortic dissection [^114JzfGm]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

In aortic dissection (AD), long-term medical therapy is usually prescribed to decrease the stress on the aortic wall and prevent aortic expansion or rupture. Medication therapy for AD is still based on historical observational studies and expert opinion. Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, and Japanese Circulation Societyrecommend β-blockers for the initial management of acute AD. Observational studies show that the use of β-blockers may decrease the aortic dilatation rate in aortic disease.

Emerging evidence has linked the renin-angiotensin system to the development of aortic aneurysms (AAs). In genetic studies, polymorphisms of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) have been associated with AA. For patients with Marfan syndrome, treatment with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) appears to decrease the progress of aortic dilatation and its complications. Several animal studies have shown that treatment with an ACEI or ARB slows AA progression and prevents rupture. A randomized clinical trial assessing the use of irbesartan for Marfan syndrome showed that ARBs decreased aortic expansion. However, no randomized clinical trial has compared the effects of long-term treatment with β-blockers, ACEIs, or ARBs with those of other antihypertensive medications after AD. Therefore, the present nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare the long-term use of β-blockers, ACEIs, or ARBs with that of other antihypertensive medications and their association with late outcomes among patients with AD.

### Pharmacological treatment in patients with aortic dissection [^1141BXC6]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This population-based nationwide study of nearly 4000 AD patients during a 10-year period demonstrated that 96% of the patients were on antihypertensive treatment within a year from discharge. The use of statins was associated with higher long-term survival in patients managed medically, both in women and in men. The association between drug use and long-term survival for the various drugs differed between patients undergoing repair and those being managed only medically; ARBs and beta blockers were favourable in surgically managed patients, whereas ACE inhibitors and CCBs were favourable in medical management.

Aggressive lowering of systolic blood pressure has long been the mainstay in the acute management of AD. The best antihypertensive medication strategy and how to manage hypertension in patients with chronic AD, however, are still matters of debate. The ESVS guidelines recommend systolic blood pressure below 130 mm Hg and diastolic pressure below 85 mm Hg, with beta blockers as first-line treatment. The present study confirmed the wide use of antihypertensive medication in general and beta blockers in particular in AD patients, with 96% of the patients being on antihypertensive medication at discharge. In 90% of the cases a beta blocker was used, mostly combined with additional drugs. In the acute phase, resistant hypertension frequently requires multiple drugs, in contrast to the chronic stage of the disease, when the resistant hypertension tends to resolve. Nevertheless, within the first year, 46% of the patients were on ≥ 4 antihypertensives, which is in accordance with earlier reports.

### Aneurysmal degeneration of the thoracoabdominal aorta after medical management of type B aortic dissections [^1115zW5e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissections who are managed medically are at risk of aortic aneurysmal degeneration over time. However, the effect of improvement in antihypertensive medications and stricter blood pressure control is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the rate of aneurysmal degeneration in a contemporary cohort of patients with medically treated type B dissection.

Methods

Included were all patients with acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissection who were initially managed medically between March 1999 and March 2011 and had follow-up axial imaging studies. Maximum aortic growth was calculated by comparing the initial imaging study to the most current scan or imaging obtained just before any aortic-related intervention. An increase of ≥ 5 mm was the threshold considered as aortic growth. Predictors of aortic aneurysmal degeneration were determined using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

We identified 200 patients (61% men) with medically managed acute type B dissections receiving multiple imaging studies. Patients were an average age of 63.4 years, and 75.5% had a history of hypertension. Mean follow-up was 5.3 years (range, 0.1–14.7 years). Mean time between the initial and final imaging studies was 3.2 years (range, 0.1–12.9 years). At 5 years, only 51% were free from aortic growth. Fifty-six patients (28%) required operative intervention (50 open, 6 endovascular repair) for aneurysmal degeneration, and the actuarial 5-year freedom from intervention was 76%. After excluding five patients (2.5%) with early rapid degeneration requiring intervention within the first 2 weeks, the mean rate of aortic growth was 12.3 mm/y for the total aortic diameter, 3.8 mm/y for the true lumen diameter, and 8.6 mm/y for the false lumen diameter. Only aortic diameter at index presentation > 3.5 cm was a risk factor for future growth (odds ratio, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–4.81; P < .01). Complete thrombosis of the false lumen was protective against growth (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.42; P < .01).

Conclusions

Although medical management of uncomplicated acute, type B aortic dissections has been the standard of care, at 5 years, a significant number of patients will require operative intervention for aneurysmal degeneration. Further studies of early intervention (eg, thoracic endovascular aortic repair) for type B aortic dissection to prevent late aneurysm formation are needed.

### Beta blockers as primary and secondary prevention for aortic dissections in nonsyndromic patients with hypertension [^116MPFJa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when a tear in the aortic intima allows blood to flow in a dissection plane between the aortic wall layers. The Stanford classification distinguishes between AD type A (TAAD) involving the ascending aorta and AD type B (TBAD), which enters distally to the left subclavian artery without ascending aortic involvement.

In the newly released guidelines on aortic diseases, the recommendations toward secondary medical treatment after AD remain unchanged from earlier guidelines; In AD survivors, long‐term beta blocker treatment (unless contraindicated) is recommended as first‐choice therapy to control heart rate and blood pressure to reduce late aortic‐related adverse events. This recommendation relies mainly on expert opinion, historical observational studies, and smaller interventional studies performed in animal models and syndromic patients. Moreover, the updated guidelines underscore the importance of timely identification of patients at increased risk of AD, for example, through screening of first‐degree relatives of patients diagnosed with large aortic aneurysms, and several genes are involved in nonsyndromic hereditary thoracic aortic diseases. Hence, primary prophylactic long‐term treatment with beta blockers in nonsyndromic patients is anticipated to increase, though evidence‐based recommendations for antihypertensive preferences for this specific patient population remain to be established.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between long‐term use of beta blockers and AD in a source population of Danish citizens with hypertension before and after AD.

Pregnancy with aortopathy — medical therapy and imaging: Hypertension is a risk factor for aortic dissection in pregnancy, and for appropriate patients beta blockers are used throughout pregnancy and postpartum, recognizing that fetal growth may be impaired, with labetalol suggested as the beta blocker of choice for use in pregnant women with hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are contraindicated during pregnancy because of teratogenicity. In the absence of controlled trials, beta blockers are used in other aortopathic conditions, and continuation of such therapy during pregnancy is recommended unless contraindicated, with shared decision-making given that fetal growth and weight may be impaired when beta blockers are used in pregnancy; however, in ROPAC (Registry Of Pregnancy And Cardiac disease), there was no significant difference in birth weight in women treated with a beta blocker compared with untreated women. Imaging frequency during pregnancy is variable and is performed every trimester but may be performed more frequently depending on individual factors, and evaluation of the aorta several weeks postpartum is performed to determine aortic diameter and evaluate for aortic dilation. In patients with aortopathy that involves the aortic arch, descending or abdominal aorta or branches, cross-sectional imaging identifies aortic anatomy and diameters; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without gadolinium contrast is low-risk during pregnancy and is preferred over computed tomography (CT) for elective imaging to avoid the risks of ionizing radiation exposure to the developing fetus, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) can be performed during pregnancy, if required, to evaluate the descending aorta.

### Association of long-term use of antihypertensive medications with late outcomes among patients with aortic dissection [^112huPj6]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The associations between long-term treatment of aortic dissection with various medications and late patient outcomes are poorly understood.

Objective

To compare late outcomes after long-term use of β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or other antihypertensive medications (controls) among patients treated for aortic dissection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan included 6978 adult patients with a first-ever aortic dissection who survived to hospital discharge during the period between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2013, and who received during the first 90 days after discharge a prescription for an ACEI, ARB, β-blocker, or at least 1 other antihypertensive medication. Data analysis was conducted from July 2019 to June 2020.

Exposure

Long-term use of β-blockers, ACEIs, or ARBs, with use of other antihypertensive medications as a control.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, death due to aortic aneurism or dissection, later aortic operation, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, hospital readmission, and new-onset dialysis.

Results

Of 6978 total participants, 3492 received a β-blocker, 1729 received an ACEI or ARB, and 1757 received another antihypertension drug. Compared with patients in the other 2 groups, those in the β-blocker group were younger (mean [SD] age, 62.1 [13.9] years vs 68.7 [13.5] years for ACEIs or ARBs and 69.9 [13.8] years for controls) and comprised more male patients (2520 [72.2%] vs 1161 [67.1%] for ACEIs or ARBs and 1224 [69.7%] for controls). The prevalence of medicated hypertension was highest in the ACEI or ARB group (1039 patients [60.1%]), followed by the control group (896 patients [51.0%]), and was lowest in the β-blocker group (1577 patients [45.2%]). Patients who underwent surgery for type A aortic dissection were more likely to be prescribed β-blockers (1134 patients [32.5%]) than an ACEI or ARB (309 patients [17.9%]) or another antihypertension medication (376 patients [21.4%]). After adjusting for multiple propensity scores, there were no significant differences in any of the clinical characteristics among the 3 groups. No differences in the risks for all outcomes were observed between the ACEI or ARB and β-blocker groups. The risk of all-cause hospital readmission was significantly lower in the ACEI or ARB group (subdistribution hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84–0.997) and β-blocker group (subdistribution HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81–0.94) than in the control group. Moreover, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI or ARB group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71–0.89) and the β-blocker group (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.91) than in the control group. In addition, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower in the ARB group than in the ACEI group (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.95).

Conclusions and Relevance

The use of β-blockers, ACEIs, or ARBs was associated with benefits in the long-term treatment of aortic dissection.

### Patient information: aortic dissection… [^116JFutP]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Aortic dissections most commonly occur in the part of the aorta that connects to and travels upward from the heart. Ascending aortic dissections have a high risk of serious complications, including death. For example, they may cause reduced blood flow to the arteries supplying the heart, which leads to a heart attack. Or they may cause reduced blood flow to the brain, which leads to a stroke. Ascending aortic dissections can also cause problems with the aortic valve, which controls the direction of blood flow from the heart to the body. Aortic dissections occur in 5 to 10 per 100 000 people each year and are more common in males and older individuals. The most important risk factor is high blood pressure, which causes increased stress on the aortic wall.

Other risk factors include atherosclerosis; preexisting aortic aneurysm; bicuspid aortic valve; cocaine use; traumatic injury to the chest; certain genetic disorders; and certain connective tissue disorders. An aortic dissection can be diagnosed on an imaging test such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or echocardiogram. All patients with aortic dissection who have high blood pressure should be treated with medications to lower blood pressure. Patients with ascending aortic dissections typically need emergency surgery. Descending aortic dissections can often be treated with medications alone but may require surgery if they cause decreased blood flow to vital organs.

Open surgery involves surgical removal of the dissected portion of the aorta and replacement with a graft. For ascending aortic dissections, this involves opening the chest, and some patients also undergo aortic valve replacement. Endovascular aortic repair does not require opening the chest. Instead, an aortic graft is delivered by a catheter inserted into the groin and positioned within the dissected portion of the aorta. After treatment for aortic dissection, patients should be closely monitored to ensure their blood pressure is well controlled and should undergo regularly scheduled aortic imaging studies.

### First-line β-blockers versus other antihypertensive medications for chronic type B aortic dissection [^116tk6WD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a severe and often lethal complication in people with hypertension. Current practice in the treatment of chronic type B aortic dissections is the use of beta-blockers as first-line therapy to decrease aortic wall stress. Other antihypertensive medications, such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), have been suggested for the medical therapy of type B TAD.

Objectives

To assess the effects of first-line beta-blockers compared with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for treating chronic type B TAD.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) for related reviews. We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (1946 to 26 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to 24 January 2014), MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE (1974 to 24 January 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov (to 26 January 2014).

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different antihypertensive medications in the treatment of chronic type B TAD to be eligible for inclusion. Total mortality rate was the primary outcome of this review. Secondary outcomes included total non-fatal adverse events relating to TADs and number of people not requiring surgical treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (KC, PL) independently reviewed titles and abstracts and decided on studies to include based on the inclusion criteria. We resolved discrepancies between the two review authors by discussion.

Main Results

After a thorough review of the search results, we identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any RCTs that compared first-line beta-blockers with other first-line antihypertensive medications for the treatment of chronic type B TAD. Therefore, there is no RCT evidence to support the current guidelines recommending the use of beta-blockers. RCTs are required to assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers and other antihypertensive medications as first-line treatment of chronic type B TAD.

### Management of acute aortic syndromes from initial presentation to definitive treatment [^11773XGh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute aortic syndromes comprise a spectrum of diseases including aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers. Early diagnosis, rapid intervention, and multidisciplinary team care are vital to efficiently manage time-sensitive aortic emergencies, mobilize appropriate resources, and optimize clinical outcomes.

Objective

This comprehensive review outlines the multidisciplinary team approach from initial presentation to definitive interventional treatment and post-operative care.

Discussion

Acute aortic syndromes can be life-threatening and require prompt diagnosis and aggressive initiation of blood pressure and pain control to prevent subsequent complications. Early time to diagnosis and intervention are associated with improved outcomes.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary team can help promptly diagnose and manage aortic syndromes.

Initial medical therapy for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) should optimize stabilization with prompt control of blood pressure, pulse rate, and pain, and be directed at decreasing shear stress to reduce false lumen propagation; early β-blockade is used to target systolic blood pressure of 100 to 120 mm Hg and heart rate below 60 bpm, with intravenous propranolol, esmolol, labetalol, or metoprolol as exemplary agents, and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) as potential alternatives in patients unable to tolerate β-blockers, used with caution in severe AR; vasodilators should be used with caution only after chronotropic control with β-blockers is established, intravenous nicardipine can rapidly decrease blood pressure without reflex tachycardia or exaggerated depression of diastolic pressure, volume resuscitation in hypotension is reasonable to achieve systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg, and pain relief is recommended in patients with ATAAD.

### Beta blockers as primary and secondary prevention for aortic dissections in nonsyndromic patients with hypertension [^116kMdDS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recommendations for beta blockers in preventing aortic dissection (AD) and improving postdissection survival in nonsyndromic patients with hypertension are based on limited evidence.

Methods

This nationwide, population‐based study combined a nested case–control and historical cohort design. Using Danish health care registries, all hospitalized adult patients with AD from 1996 to 2016 were identified and validated. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves or connective tissue disorders were excluded. In the case–control analysis, 1657 validated AD cases were matched 1:10 (± 1) with 16 139 controls with hypertension based on age, sex, index date, and cumulative antihypertensive drug use. Long‐term beta blocker use was defined as ≥ 2000 defined daily doses (DDD). In the cohort analysis, 2120 validated survivors of AD were followed for 5 years to assess postdissection mortality stratified by beta blocker use.

Results

Long‐term beta blocker use was associated with increased odds of AD type A (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3–2.3]) and AD type B (aOR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.7–5.2]) compared with never‐users. A dose‐dependent risk increase was observed for AD type B (aOR, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.8–2.2] for DDD 100–199; aOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 1.6–9.8] for DDD ≥ 10 000). Beta blocker use was associated with higher 5‐year all‐cause mortality in survivors of AD type A (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.5 [95% CI, 0.99–2.23]) and AD type B (aHR, 1.5 [95%CI, 1.0–2.3]) compared with never‐users.

Conclusions

Beta blocker use did not reduce AD risk or improve outcomes in survivors of AD compared with other antihypertensive agents. Although clinically relevant data as aortic diameters and blood pressure were not available, these findings challenge current clinical practice and highlight the need for randomized trials.

### Association of long-term use of antihypertensive medications with late outcomes among patients with aortic dissection [^112pyYeJ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Compared with the control group, the use of β-blockers and ACEIs or ARBs was associated with lower risks of mortality and hospital readmission due to any cause. These data provide evidence that ACEI and ARB therapies may be alternatives to β-blocker use for the long-term treatment of AD.

Acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection — hemodynamic control and guideline stance: Level A recommendations. None specified. Level B recommendations. None specified. Level C recommendations. In adult patients with acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, decrease blood pressure and pulse if elevated. However, there are no specific targets that have demonstrated a reduction in morbidity and mortality. Study Selection: Fifty-five articles were identified, with Thirty-seven selected for further review and 1 study included. Historical proposals suggested lowering systolic blood pressure to 100 mm Hg to 120 mm Hg, and major specialty consensus guidelines present therapeutic targets of a heart rate of 60 beats/min and a systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg, though there is limited data to support specific targets in the acute setting. In a Class III study, 171 patients were followed for 27 months, with 32 meeting target heart rate control of less than 60 beats/min; heart rate was measured at 6 AM, noon, and 6 PM every day during the acute treatment with β-blockers, and the target heart rate was defined as an average of heart rate 3, 5, and 7 days after onset of treatment.

Optimal medical therapy (OMT) hemodynamic targets in TBAD emphasize strict control of blood pressure and heart rate; maintaining blood pressure ≤ 120/80 mm Hg and heart rate < 70 beats/min are optimal, α- and β-blockers are useful primary agents, and once heart rate control is established, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may also be useful.
