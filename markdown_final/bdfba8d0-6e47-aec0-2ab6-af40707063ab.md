## Question

How many positive common divisors do 10¹⁰⁰ and 10¹²¹+10⁸¹³+10 have?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many positive common divisors the numbers (10¹⁰⁰) and (10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10) have. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the prime factorization of (10¹⁰⁰). Then, I should simplify the second number and factor it into powers of 10. Next, I will compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and its prime factorization. Finally, I will apply the divisor-count formula to the GCD to get the number of positive common divisors.

> Let me first confirm the prime factorization of (10¹⁰⁰). Since (10 = 2 × 5), we have (10¹⁰⁰ = 2¹⁰⁰ × 5¹⁰⁰), which gives exponents 100 for both 2 and 5 [^notfound].

> Now, I need to simplify the second number, (10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10). Wait, let me verify the smallest exponent I can factor out. The smallest power of 10 in the sum is (10¹), so factoring (10) gives (10(10¹²⁰ + 10⁸¹² + 1)). Hold on, I should double-check that the remaining factor is indeed odd, because that will matter for the GCD with (10¹⁰⁰). Yes, (10¹²⁰) and (10⁸¹²) are even, so their sum is even, and adding 1 makes the parenthesis odd, meaning the entire expression is (2¹ × 5¹ × odd) [^notfound].

> Next, I should compute the GCD. Let me think about the powers of 2 and 5 separately. For the power of 2, the first number has (2¹⁰⁰) and the second has exactly (2¹), so the GCD gets (2¹). For the power of 5, the first number has (5¹⁰⁰) and the second has exactly (5¹), so the GCD gets (5¹). Therefore, (gcd(10¹⁰⁰, 10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10) = 2¹ × 5¹ = 10) [^notfound].

> I will now examine the divisor count. The number of positive divisors of a number (n = p₁^(a₁) p₂^(a₂) ⋯ pₖ^(aₖ)) is ((a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)⋯(aₖ + 1)). Applying this to 10, which is (2¹ × 5¹), gives ((1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 × 2 = 4) positive divisors [^notfound].

> Let me list them to be sure I'm not missing anything. The positive divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10, so there are indeed 4 positive common divisors of (10¹⁰⁰) and (10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10) [^notfound].

---

The number of positive common divisors of (10¹⁰⁰) and (10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10) is **4**. This is because the greatest common divisor is 10, which has the prime factorization (2¹ × 5¹), and the number of divisors is ((1+1)(1+1) = 4).

---

## Step 1: Prime factorization of (10¹⁰⁰)

The prime factorization of (10¹⁰⁰) is:

10¹⁰⁰ = (2 × 5)¹⁰⁰ = 2¹⁰⁰ × 5¹⁰⁰

Thus, any positive divisor of (10¹⁰⁰) must be of the form (2ᵃ × 5ᵇ), where (0 ≤ a ≤ 100) and (0 ≤ b ≤ 100).

---

## Step 2: Prime factorization of (10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10)

Factor out the smallest power of 10:

10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10 = 10(10¹²⁰ + 10⁸¹² + 1)

Now, analyze the term in parentheses. Since (10¹²⁰) and (10⁸¹²) are even, their sum is even, and adding 1 makes the sum odd. Therefore, (10¹²⁰ + 10⁸¹² + 1) is odd and not divisible by 2 or 5. Thus, the prime factorization of the second number is:

10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10 = 2¹ × 5¹ × (odd number not divisible by 5)

---

## Step 3: Greatest common divisor (GCD)

The GCD of (10¹⁰⁰) and (10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10) is determined by the minimum exponents of the common prime factors. From the factorizations:

- Both numbers share (2¹) and (5¹).
- The remaining factor of the second number is coprime to both 2 and 5.

Therefore, the GCD is:

gcd(10¹⁰⁰, 10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10) = 2¹ × 5¹ = 10

---

## Step 4: Number of positive divisors of the GCD

The number of positive divisors of a number is found by adding 1 to each exponent in its prime factorization and multiplying the results. For 10, which is (2¹ × 5¹), the number of divisors is:

(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 × 2 = 4

---

## Conclusion

The number of positive common divisors of (10¹⁰⁰) and (10¹²¹ + 10⁸¹³ + 10) is **4**.

### The distribution of common-variant effect sizes [^e354c84b]. Nature Genetics (2021). High credibility.

The genetic effect-size distribution of a disease describes the number of risk variants, the range of their effect sizes and sample sizes that will be required to discover them. Accurate estimation has been a challenge. Here I propose Fourier Mixture Regression (FMR), validating that it accurately estimates real and simulated effect-size distributions. Applied to summary statistics for ten diseases (average [Formula: see text]), FMR estimates that 100,000–1,000,000 cases will be required for genome-wide significant SNPs to explain 50% of SNP heritability. In such large studies, genome-wide significance becomes increasingly conservative, and less stringent thresholds achieve high true positive rates if confounding is controlled. Across traits, polygenicity varies, but the range of their effect sizes is similar. Compared with effect sizes in the top 10% of heritability, including most discovered thus far, those in the bottom 10–50% are orders of magnitude smaller and more numerous, spanning a large fraction of the genome.

### Lessons from applied large-scale pooling of 133, 816 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests [^6d8ac07a]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Pool Ct versus sample Ct calculation

PCR reaction roughly multiplies the amount of the targeted DNA in each cycle of operation. Because of this exponential growth, a pool of size n with a single positive sample should have a Ct that is log 2 (n) cycles greater than the positive sample's Ct. For example, when the pool size is 8, this will result in a three-cycle addition.

Statistical analysis

Calculation of P values for empirical efficiency was performed by comparing the empirical efficiency measured to the results of efficiency in 100,000 simulations. For each pool size, five and eight, we used the number of samples and prevalence rate measured for this pool size (Table 1) and simulated (according to the prevalence rate) a positive/negative result for each sample independently. Then, we randomly assigned each sample into a pool and considered a pool to be positive if it included one or more positive samples (assuming no false-negative pools). To conclude the simulation, we calculated the empirical efficiency by dividing the number of samples tested by the number of reactions needed to perform pooled testing. When comparing the pool Ct and the individual sample Ct (Fig. 2A), statistics were calculated using linear regression, forcing a predetermined slope of 1.

### Lessons from applied large-scale pooling of 133, 816 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests [^e4faa526]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between March and mid-September of 2020, we tested 133,816 samples in pools and 121,929 samples using individual tests (nonpooled) at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel. One challenge to the pooling scheme stemmed from the fluctuating rates of infection during the pandemic. The infection prevalence rate of pooled samples changed considerably, ranging from a weekly average of 0 to 7.8% [despite the fact that the vast majority (> 95%) was obtained from asymptomatic individuals; Fig. 1A], mandating a dynamic adaptation of the pooling scheme. In principle, at low prevalence, using fewer pools of larger pool sizes would lead to a gain in efficiency, as the majority of pools would test negative. However, as prevalence increases, using a larger number of smaller-size pools would be more efficient, as every positive individual would lead to retesting a smaller amount of samples (fig. S1A).

Fig. 1
Overall statistics of pool sizes of eight and five.

(A) Weekly average of eight-sample (blue) and five-sample (red) pools counts, together with the weekly average of the prevalence rate among pooled samples (black). (B and C) Pool results for eight-sample (B) and five-sample (C) pools, respectively. (D and E) Counts of positive pools aggregated by the number of positive samples identified within the pool, for eight-sample (D) and five-sample (E) pools.

This adaptation of pool size (n) according to the prevalence rate (p) requires the ability to predict p for pooled samples. The prevalence rate in the coming week can be predicted, among other options, according to the prevalence rate in the previous week in pooled or nonpooled samples. The comparison of the weekly average of p for pooled and unpooled samples over time suggests that the past week prevalence rate of pooled samples is the better predictor (fig. S1C). Thus, when the prevalence rate in pooled samples increased (from ~1 to ~6%), we switched from eight-sample pooling to five-sample pooling and used a dynamic approach thereafter (alternating the pool size between eight and five) to maintain optimal pooling efficiency (fig. S1, A and B).

Cell-free DNA screening — using fragments in maternal circulation — can start at about 9–10 weeks of pregnancy and, unlike analyte screening, can be sent until term; the fetal fraction comprises approximately 3–13% of total cell-free DNA and increases throughout gestation; depending on the laboratory it can be performed as early as 9 weeks, with higher fetal fractions at 10 weeks and beyond associated with lower test-failure rates; it is the most sensitive and specific screening test for common fetal aneuploidies but has potential for false-positive and false-negative results and is not equivalent to diagnostic testing.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Occupational radiation monitoring in cardiovascular x-ray fluoroscopy — badge-based effective dose estimation — uses collar and under-apron monitor readings. Effective dose can be roughly estimated from the reading of a single badge worn outside the apron at the collar (neck) or it can be more accurately estimated by combining measurements from the 2 badges, with the under-apron badge reading HU being < 5% of the collar badge reading for an 0.5-mm lead-equivalent protective apron and the collar badge reading represented by Hcoll. For a single-badged worker, E(estimate) = Hcoll/21, with the divisor of "21" consistent with protective garments intercepting approximately 95% of the incident radiation; other models developed for no thyroid collar shielding have divisors of 14. When 2 badges are worn, E(estimate) = 0.5 HU + 0.025 Hcoll, and these calculations assume the presence of a thyroid shield.

### Identification of grouped rare and common variants via penalized logistic regression [^019dcae1]. Genetic Epidemiology (2013). Low credibility.

Results

The different methods have their own strengths and weaknesses, as they have been tailored to perform well in different situations. For example, by design, C-alpha should be more likely to detect common causal variants than SKAT, and SKAT should be better at detecting rare variants than C-alpha. Thus, we expect the best performing method to depend on the type of data simulated.

We implemented each method over a range of P -value cutoff thresholds and penalty parameters and counted the number of true and false detections of genes at each cutoff. To our knowledge, Mendel v12.0 does not allow selection of the penalty parameter, but instead allows one to set the number of desired predictors, which we will use as a defined cutoff point. We calculated average per gene empirical true detection rates (power) and false positive detection rates (type I error) by summing the number of true and false positives for a given P -value/penalty parameter over all replicates. For all methods and each gene, we summed the number of gene detections at a given cutoff or penalty parameter value over all replicates to get a gene detection count. For the single marker test SM, we counted a gene detection for any gene containing a marker below the P -value threshold. To obtain power, we added the detection counts for all 10 causal genes, and divided this by the total number of possible true detections (1,000), i.e. the number of true positives (10) times the number of replicates (100). For type I error, we added detection counts for all noncausal genes, and divided this sum by the number of true negatives (3,590) times the number of replicates, i.e. by the total of 359,000 possible true negative detections (null genes). Figures 2 and 3 show the resulting power vs. false positive (FP) rates per gene for all methods considered, for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.

Evaluation metrics

AUROC

The Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for a binary classification model calculates the proportion of all positive-negative pairs that are correctly classified. The ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various thresholds. These rates are calculated as follows:where T P is the number of true positives, and F N is the number of false negatives.where F P is the number of false positives, and T N is the number of true negatives.

The AUROC can be interpreted as the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance. A higher AUROC value indicates better model performance, with 1 being a perfect classifier and 0.5 indicating a performance no better than random chance. We calculate the AUROC using the following formula:hereandrepresent the negative and positive classes and ∣ D 0 ∣ and ∣ D 1 ∣ the number of samples in each class.represents the indicator function

AUPRC

The precision-recall curve plots the recall on the x axis and Precision on the y-axis for different threshold values. It measures how well a classifier identifies positive cases. As a result, the baseline for this metric is not fixed and depends on the proportion of positive instances in the dataset. The Precision (P) corresponds to the ratio of true positive predictions versus the total number of positive predictions (both true positives and false positives), and it is given by the following formula:

In contrast, the Recall (R) corresponds to the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives in the data, calculated using:here T P is the number of true positives, F P is the number of false positives, and F N is the number of false negatives.

Finally, since we are in a discrete setting, the AUPRC is calculated by the following formula:where P n and R n are the Precision and Recall for a threshold with index n.

C-index

The C-index quantifies the correlation between observed survival times and predicted risk scores. A pair is defined as concordant if the patient with the shorter survival time also has a higher risk score. In this study, the C-index is calculated using:where i and j denote distinct patients, T i and T j represent their survival times, η i and η j are their corresponding model-predicted risk scores, andthe indicator function.

### A sequence-based global map of regulatory activity for deciphering human genetics [^7cb18fd4]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Sequence classes are under evolutionary constraints

Variants that alter the regulatory activities of sequences often disrupt gene regulation and are therefore expected to impact human health and disease. We tested this expectation by comparing human population genome variant allele frequencies (AFs)based on the sequence class in which each variant is located and the predicted variant effect on that class. Indeed, we found that variants localized in regulatory sequence classes (E, P and CTCF) have lower common variant frequency than variants in other sequence classes and showed higher overall negative selection constraint (Fig. 3a, x axis). More importantly, variants predicted to strongly perturb regulatory sequence classes are significantly less likely to be common variants than variants that weakly perturb these classes (measured by bidirectional variant effect constraint; Fig. 3a, y axis and Fig. 3b and Methods). Therefore, this is consistent with the hypothesis that disruption of regulatory sequence class activities has a major negative impact on fitness, which we refer to as a negative selection signature.

Fig. 3
Variants with strong regulatory sequence class effects show negative selection signatures.

a, Scatter plot for AF-based analysis of each sequence class. The x axis shows 1 − common variant frequency (AF > 0.01) across all 1000 Genomes variants per sequence class; the y axis shows the bidirectional variant effect constraint z -score, which was computed based on logistic regressions predicting a common variant (AF > 0.01) from the sequence class-level variant effect score for both positive and negative effects (Methods). Sequence classes with significant (Benjamini–Hochberg FDR < 0.05) bidirectional variant effect constraint are indicated with larger dots. L sequence classes are excluded due to lack of interpretation for their sequence class-level variant effect scores. b, Comparison of common variant frequencies for 1000 Genomes variants (n = 81,501,608) assigned to different sequence classes and variant effect bins.

### Secondary prevention of cervical cancer: ASCO resource-stratified clinical practice guideline | JCO global oncology… [^28ece38f]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Enhanced-Resource Setting Source guidelines and discussion. 44The extension to 10 years after negative tests is based on the von Karsa et al 5guideline. 21 was conducted from the perspective of Mexican health care institutions and compared the following four screening plus triage strategies: cytology alone, hrHPV with reflex cytology, hrHPV with molecular triage, and cotesting with molecular triage. The study found that when the base case was cytology alone, hrHPV with molecular triage had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. AARs for cervical cancer mortality were 14. 4 for VIA plus education compared with
19. 8 for education alone, with an incident rate ratio of 0.

### Lessons from applied large-scale pooling of 133, 816 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests [^7247b41c]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In total, we tested 14,697 eight- and 3248 five-sample pools, where 9.3 and 22.1% of the pools tested positive, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). As all samples in the positive pools were retested individually, we could evaluate the distribution of positive samples within positive pools. Whereas the majority (66 to 68%) of the positive pools contained only one positive sample, 28 to 29% of the positive pools contained two or more positive samples (Fig. 1, D and E). A small number of positive pools (3.9 to 5.3%) did not yield any positive samples when their samples were retested individually. The viral cycle threshold (Ct) values of these pools were usually higher, with a median Ct value of 36.8 and 34.2 for eight- and five-sample positive pools (respectively), whereas all other positive pools had median Ct values of 26.9 and 26.5, respectively. This low percentage of false-positive pools (3.9 to 5.3%) reflects our permissive threshold and the extra caution taken to maintain the sensitivity of pooled sample testing.

A dominant consideration in planning and evaluating the pooling approach is efficiency, defined as the expected number of samples tested using a single RT-PCR reaction. In theory, efficiency is mostly affected by the pool size and the prevalence rate (fig. S1A). We calculated our empirical efficiency (defined as the total number of tested samples divided by the total number of actual RT-PCR reactions performed) as 4.587 and 2.377 for the eight- and five-sample pools, respectively. These values are better than the expected optimal efficiency values for both the eight- and the five-sample pool sizes, under the observed prevalence rates of 1.7 and 5.7%, respectively (Table 1).

Table 1
Statistics and efficiency of pool sizes of eight and five.

NA, not applicable.

As the prevalence of infection changes, so does the pooling efficiency. We observed fluctuations in efficiency values over time, when the empirical efficiency was higher or lower than the theoretical efficiency (fig. S1B). Nevertheless, across time and pool sizes, we performed better than the theoretical efficiency estimations for Dorfman pooling. Overall, we tested 133,816 samples using 32,466 RT-PCR tests with a global efficiency of 4.121, saving 101,350 (76%) RT-PCR reactions.

### Lessons from applied large-scale pooling of 133, 816 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests [^eea0cc9e]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Pooling multiple swab samples before RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis has been proposed as a strategy to reduce costs and increase throughput of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests. However, reports on practical large-scale group testing for SARS-CoV-2 have been scant. Key open questions concern reduced sensitivity due to sample dilution, the rate of false positives, the actual efficiency (number of tests saved by pooling), and the impact of infection rate in the population on assay performance. Here, we report an analysis of 133,816 samples collected between April and September 2020 and tested by Dorfman pooling for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We spared 76% of RNA extraction and RT-PCR tests, despite the frequently changing prevalence (0.5 to 6%). We observed pooling efficiency and sensitivity that exceeded theoretical predictions, which resulted from the nonrandom distribution of positive samples in pools. Overall, our findings support the use of pooling for efficient large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.

### Revisiting the genome-wide significance threshold for common variant GWAS [^a59333a3]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

We applied the multiple testing procedures to HDL, LDL, TG, height, and BMI to assess their performances for different sample sizes and genetic structures.

P -value threshold

Applying various fixed P -value thresholds to the empirical GLGC and GIANT test sets, we observed as expected that the empirical false discovery rate (eFDR) generally increased as the P -value threshold increased (Tables 2 and 3). The lone exception (for HDL) likely reflected statistical noise due to the small number of identified loci.

Table 2
Empirical and simulation results for all traits and commonly used thresholds

Table 3
Empirical and simulation results for P -value thresholds

For height and BMI, we identified substantially more loci by relaxing the threshold from P = 5 × 10 −8 to P = 5 × 10 −7 with nearly all these new loci being true positives (Table 2 and Figure 1): 60 of 61 (98%) for height; 15 of 15 (100%) for BMI (Table 3). Further relaxing the threshold from P = 5 × 10 −7 to P = 5 × 10 −6 maintained high proportions of true positives among the additional loci: 95 of 96 (99%) for height, 18 of 19 (95%) for BMI. For the lipid traits in the GLGC test set, relaxing the threshold from P = 5 × 10 −8 to P = 5 × 10 −7 resulted in HDL, LDL, and TG gaining 2, 5, and 3 loci with 2, 2, and 2 (100%, 40%, and 67%) being true positives. Further relaxing the threshold from P = 5 × 10 −7 to P = 5 × 10 −6 resulted in ≤ 56% of the additional loci being true positives for the lipid traits.

### Consensus guidelines on the use of intravenous ketamine infusions for acute pain management from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists [^91e03529]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Consensus voting outcomes — committee and organizational approvals are summarized as follows: There was 100% consensus among the committee members (coauthors) for each recommendation, and Nine of the 13 organizations approved every recommendation, with one (SIS) dissenting on questions 10 (cut-off for designating a facet block as positive) and 11 (number of blocks that should be performed before RF ablation). Specifically, SIS believes the cut-off for a positive block should be 80% rather than 50%, and that two positive blocks should be strongly required in the absence of mitigating circumstances.

### COVID-19 testing [^9d8c48c0]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To illustrate how patient risk and clinical costs are driven by false-positive and false-negative results.

Methods

Molecular, antigen, and antibody testing are the mainstay to identify infected patients and fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To evaluate the test methods, sensitivity (percent positive agreement [PPA]) and specificity (percent negative agreement [PNA]) are the most common metrics utilized, followed by the positive and negative predictive value-the probability that a positive or negative test result represents a true positive or negative patient. The number, probability, and cost of false results are driven by combinations of prevalence, PPA, and PNA of the individual test selected by the laboratory.

Results

Molecular and antigen tests that detect the presence of the virus are relevant in the acute phase only. Serologic assays detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the recovering and recovered phase. Each testing methodology has its advantages and disadvantages.

Conclusions

We demonstrate the value of reporting probability of false-positive results, probability of false-negative results, and costs to patients and health care. These risk metrics can be calculated from the risk drivers of PPA and PNA combined with estimates of prevalence, cost, and Reff number (people infected by 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 carrier).

### Single-cell atlas of common variable immunodeficiency shows germinal center-associated epigenetic dysregulation in B-cell responses [^d4f1d1ba]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The plate-based single-cell ATAC-seq assay was performed as previously described. Briefly, naïve, US-mem and S-mem B cells were collected by FACS in MACS buffer, and cells were centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl tagmentation mix (33 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.8, 66 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 16% dimethylformamide, 0.01% digitonin and 5 μl of Tn5 from the Nextera kit from Illumina, Cat. No. FC-121-1030). The tagmentation reaction was done on a thermomixer at 800 rpm, 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was then stopped by adding equal volume (50 μl) of tagmentation stop buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and left on ice for 10 min. A volume of 200 μl MACS buffer with 0.5% BSA was added and the nuclei suspension was transferred to a FACS tube. DAPI was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/μl to stain the nuclei. DAPI-positive single nuclei were sorted into 96-well full-skirted Eppendorf plates chilled to 4 °C, prepared with 2 µl 2X lysis buffer (100 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 40 µg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion, AM2546, 20 mg/ml stock) and 0.4% SDS) and 2 µl of 10 µM S5xx/N7xx Nextera Index Primer Mix (5 µM each). Plates were immediately sealed, spun down at 300 × g at 4 °C for 1 min and stored at −80 °C.

### Oversimplifying quantum factoring [^9011a539]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Shor's quantum factoring algorithm exponentially outperforms known classical methods. Previous experimental implementations have used simplifications dependent on knowing the factors in advance. However, as we show here, all composite numbers admit simplification of the algorithm to a circuit equivalent to flipping coins. The difficulty of a particular experiment therefore depends on the level of simplification chosen, not the size of the number factored. Valid implementations should not make use of the answer sought.

### What does COVID-19 testing results really say? The real statistics concealed behind the accessible data [^1ae5c113]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Accurate and comprehensive testing is crucial for practitioners to portray the pandemic. Without testing there is no data; yet, the exact number of infected people cannot be determined due to the lack of comprehensive testing. The number of seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection is obviously relative to the extent of testing. However, the true number of infections might be still far higher than the reported values. To compare the countries based on the number of seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection is misleading, as there may not be enough tests being carried out to properly monitor the outbreak. In this paper, we closely look through the COVID-19 testing results. Herein, we try to draw conclusions based on the reported data: first, the presence of a possible relationship between COVID-19 transition and patients' age will be assessed. Then, the COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) is compared with the age-demographic data for different countries. Based on the results, a method for estimating a lower bound (minimum) for the number of actual positive cases will be developed and validated. Results of this study have shown that CFR is a metric reflecting the spread of the virus, but is a factor of the extent of testing and does not necessarily show the real size of the outbreak. Moreover, no large difference in susceptibility by age has been found. The results suggest the similarity between the age distribution of COVID-19 and the population age-demographic is improving over the course of the pandemic. In addition, countries with lower CFRs have a more similar COVID-19 age distribution, which is a result of more comprehensive testing. Finally, a method for estimation of the real number of infected people based on the age distributions, reported CFRs, and the extent of testing will be developed and validated.

### Digital measurement of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from 7 million contacts [^dd774ec9]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Empirical estimation of individuals' probability of testing positive from summary statistics

In general, each contact in our dataset had multiple exposure windows, each of which had a duration (anything up to 30 min) and a risk score. We summarized these data for each contact into metrics including the maximum risk score from any of the windows, the cumulative risk score over all windows and the cumulative duration over all windows. We binned (grouped) contacts by the value of their summary metrics and, within each bin, calculated the fraction of contacts reporting a positive test in the observation interval. Confidence intervals on this fraction were calculated through the associated binomial distribution (defined with the number of 'trials' equal to the group size and the number of 'successes' equal to the number of contacts reporting a positive test). We extrapolated our estimates to risk score 1 (that is, 2 m away from an index case with standard infectiousness for 15 min (indicated by a grey circle in Fig. 1) as a point of comparison) via a quadratic fit. In Figs. 2 and 4 the background risk estimate from the maximum-likelihood approach outlined below was subtracted from the result. In all figures the x coordinate for each bin corresponds to the mean of all scores within the bin.

Overall EBV Positivity Rates and Inferred Proportions of EBV-Positive B Cells in the CSF and Blood

EBV-positive B cells are rare, and it has been estimated that in the blood, between 1/10,000 and 1/100,000 B cells (mean 1/57,000) contain EBV DNA. We calculated the success rates with 2 methods: (1) considering each participant's ddPCR analysis as a separate event, either positive or negative (qualitative success rate), (2) comparing the estimated number of target-positive DNA molecules with all analyzed DNA in a binomial distribution setting (quantitative success rate). The qualitative success rates with the nonamplified CSF cellular DNA were 0.56 using 50 ng and 0.42 using 10 ng of DNA (Table 3). In the blood CD19 + cells, the qualitative success rate ranged from 0.70 to 0.80 with 50 ng and 0.35 to 0.75 with 10 ng of DNA (Table 3). We calculated the average (qualitative and quantitative) success rates and the inferred prevalence of EBV-positive B cells in the CSF and blood. These results suggest that EBV-positive B cells are more common than previously estimated. The quantitative prevalences were in the range of 10 −3 (1/1000)–10 −4 (1/10,000), as shown in Figure 4.

### The impact of cocirculating pathogens on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) / coronavirus disease 2019 surveillance: how concurrent epidemics may introduce bias and decrease the observed SARS-CoV-2 percentage positivity [^6fef09f5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

In our simulation study, the outbreak of virus 2 lasted for 1.5 months, with a peak reached after 2 weeks (Figure 3A). These first weeks of virus 2 circulation led to up to a 23% increase in the number of daily tests performed on symptomatic individuals (Figure 3B). The observed SARS-CoV-2 percentage positive among symptomatic tests decreased sharply in the first 2 weeks, underestimating the effective percentage positivity by up to 3% (23% relative decrease), and then progressively increased to converge to the effective percentage positivity when the outbreak was nearly extinct (Figure 3C). We determined that a testing frequency m of 0.1% (m = 0.001; ie, performing 1 multiplex tests for every 1000 symptomatic individuals), which most closely represents the realistic proportion of multiplex tests currently used in France to test for non–SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses, was sufficient to provide a correction that closely follows the effective percentage positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3C).

### Heterogeneity of false reactivity profiles of HIV assays while optimizing national HIV testing algorithms: findings from a multi-country analysis [^aece4af3]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study highlights the importance of verifying HIV testing algorithms to reduce the risk of misdiagnoses caused by common false reactivity. Between 2020 and 2023, WHO supported 14 countries to assess rates of false reactivity and shared false reactivity across HIV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) used in HIV testing services. The study involved 26,278 results from 22 different RDT products, with sample sizes ranging from 100 to 302 results per country. The number of RDT products assessed varied between 4 and 13 per country. False reactivity rates ranged from 0% to 3.32%, with one country reporting a high false reactivity rate of over 4% for one RDT. Five countries have no shared false reactivity between RDTs, while the remaining eight countries shared false reactivity across one to six pairs of RDT products. These findings were used to inform national policy, with more than 90% of countries introducing new RDT products into their HIV testing algorithm based on these results. The study concludes that rates of false reactivity and shared false reactivity between RDT products vary across countries. Therefore, conducting verification studies is crucial for updating national HIV testing algorithms and ensuring accurate diagnosis while also facilitating the market entry of new HIV testing products.

Overall, among 7, 381 cases, 63. 7% occurred in patients who had a central venous catheter,
80. 7% involved recent systemic antibiotic receipt, and 9. 0% occurred in patients who had a history of injection drug use. The percentage of cases with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the 90 days before or after the index date increased from 10. 4% in 2020 to
17. 7% in 2021. Minnesota, California, Oregon, New York, and New Mexico. The most common underlying condition was diabetes, with the frequency increasing from 32. 1% to
38. 0%. Frequencies of other underlying conditions were generally stable over time. Species Distribution and AFST The overall Candida spp. distribution remained stable across years. The most common species was C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis; 11. 1% of cases involved another Candida sp., and 1. 9% involved multiple species. C. auris was identified in 0. 4% of cases with no difference in prevalence across years or sites. C. albicans was the most frequent species at all but two surveillance sites; C. glabrata was the most frequent species in California and Maryland. Species distributions remained similar across years for each site except for New Mexico, where the percentage of C. glabrata isolates increased from 15. 4% to
48. 9%. Overall, C. albicans remained the most common Candida species, similar to previous findings. However, C. glabrata was the predominant species in California and Maryland, and the percentage of C. glabrata isolates identified in New Mexico approximately tripled during the surveillance period.

### Molecular benchmarks of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic [^4eba0d83]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To assess how long the viral concentration persists in individuals deemed recovered, we invited those who had tested positive and had finished mandatory isolation to be qRT-PCR tested again. A total of 1144 recovered individuals gave additional samples between 10 and 81 days after first testing positive (Fig. 3A). Of those who still tested positive on the second test, 263 had a third test at least 7 days after the second test. In total 1407 samples were tested of which 364 were positive (26%), 981 were negative (70%), and 62 undetermined (4%). Of the 1144 participants, 1136 had at least one determinable test result. The fraction of individuals who tested positive halved every 13.3 days (95% CI: 12.3–14.1 days, Fig. 3B). Including the undeterminable samples in the analysis had a minimal effect; the number of individuals not testing negative halves every 13.7 days (95% CI: 12.5–14.1 days, Supplementary Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Molecular traces of SARS-CoV-2 recovery.

A The number of days separating the initial positive sample and the sample collected after recovery. B The fraction of individuals that remained positive as a function of days from the initial positive test.

We sequenced viral RNA from 1782 out of 1813 SARS-CoV-2 cases in Iceland and of those 1507 have at least 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome covered by five or more reads. It may be assumed that the fraction of reads mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 reference increases with the amount of viral RNA in the sample and therefore the viral concentration. The fraction of mapped reads decreased with time during the epidemic (4.6%, 95% CI: 5.7%–3.5% per week; Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. 1). This is in an agreement with the qRT-PCR results as the decrease indicates that individuals sampled later in the epidemic had lower viral concentration. The fraction of mapped reads decreased faster in the population screened individuals (9.0%, 95% CI: 10.3–7.6% per week) than the ones targeted by the healthcare system (3.5%, 95% CI: 4.6–2.4% per week).

### Identifying schizophrenia stigma on twitter: a proof of principle model using service user supervised machine learning [^02445540]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Further evaluation metrics

Following the YPMHAG discussions, we report model accuracy, the area under the receiver‐operating characteristic curve metric (AUC), and the number of false positives, all common metrics in machine learning. Accuracy answers the question 'Overall, how often is the model correct?' (determined by summing the number of true positives and true negatives and dividing by the total number of responses), while AUC measures how well a model can differentiate between two classes; a score of 1 indicates perfect differentiation, and a score of 0 indicates no ability to differentiate. When the AUC is 0.5, it means a model has the ability to separate classes.

As we aim to distinguish between tweets that are stigmatising or not, we also report AUC score and accuracy because false positives (i.e. non-stigmatising tweets that are identified as stigmatising) were deemed more acceptable by the YPMHAG than false negatives (i.e. stigmatising tweets that are not identified).

Train/test split

There are no standardised ratios for separating data into training and test sets, however, the 80/20 split is commonly used in machine learningso this was adopted. We used a grid search method to find the best performing parameters for the models. This included:

Random forest and gradient boost: the number of trees in the forest were 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 and the maximum depth of each tree was 10, 20, 30, 50, and none.

K nearest neighbours: we iterated through a range of k = 1 through to 25.

SVM

We tested multiple kernels based on scikit-learns hyperparameter tuning tutorial; kernel coefficient (gamma) for 'poly' and 'sigmoid' were 0.001 and 0.0001; and for all three SVMs (linear, poly, and sigmoid), the regularisation parameter (C) tested were 1, 10, 100 and 1000.

Naive Bayesian classifier

Naïve Bayes model parameter various smoothing (var smoothing) were tested using a range from 1 to 0.000000001.

Bootstrapping/cross validation

To evaluate and overcome issues of overfitting, we carried out bootstrapping/cross-validation. No model modifications were made during each run of the bootstrapping.

### Is there a difference in regional read [F] flutemetamol amyloid patterns between end-of-life subjects and those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment? [^42f27a4e]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Amnestic MCI population

A descriptive analysis of the regions studied in the aMCI population is presented in Table 5. This population was on average 10 years younger, and showed a comparable pattern, with 87% of the patients showing positivity in all five regions and a further 5% showing positivity in four regions. Only 8 of 97 aMCI patients showed limited positivity in three, two or one region only. In the aMCI patients, 97–98% showed positivity in both the posterior cingulate and the striatum (the regions most commonly affected) with lower percentages showing positivity in the other regions (93% frontal and temporal, 91% temporoparietal). The aMCI patients were also subdivided into those with early and those with late MCI on the basis of logical memory scores (as described by Wolk et al.). Among 13 of the 97 patients showing positivity in only four or fewer regions there was little difference (even though the numbers were small) between seven patients with early MCI and six patients with later MCI. Comparing the EoL and aMCI populations, the posterior cingulate was the region most commonly positive in both populations, with 100% and 97% of patients showing positivity in this area.

Table 5
Combinations of regions positive (red) for [18 F]flutemetamol: aMCI study (97 + ve cases)

Comparative analysis of the EoL and aMCI populations

The aim of the analysis was to test if there was an association between patient population and the number of positive regions. The number of positive regions was considered an ordinal variable with an increased number of positive regions indicating more severe disease. The Mantel-Haenszel test indicated that there was no association between patient population and the number of positive regions (p = 0.7742). Therefore, there is not enough evidence to suggest that regional amyloid uptake was different between the patient populations.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) performance versus standard laboratory-based NAAT shows that three studies with 181 positive and 3,088 negative individuals informed the recommendation, with standard laboratory-based NAAT as the reference; the pooled sensitivity of rapid NAAT was 88% (95% CI: 81 to 92) and the pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI: 95 to 100). For asymptomatic individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 exposure, the IDSA panel considered 1%, 5%, and 10% prevalences, and across these prevalences the false-negative numbers ranged from 1 to 12 and the false-positive numbers from 9 to 10 per 1,000 persons tested. The certainty of the evidence was low due to concerns related to unexplained inconsistency in addition to the risk of bias.

### A systematic study of key elements underlying molecular property prediction [^21881191]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Classification metrics

In binary classification tasks, each molecule is assigned a probability of belonging to the positive (or active) class. When the predicted probability is greater than a threshold value (between 0 and 1), the molecule is classified as positive (or active), otherwise negative (or inactive). In total, there are four possible outcomes: true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false negative (FN). Based on the TP and FP rates across different probability thresholds, the receiver operating characteristic curve can be plotted with the area under the ROC curve as AUROC. Similarly, based on precision and recall, the precision-recall curve can be plotted to derive AUPRC. AUROC usually ranges from 0.5 (random classification) and 1 (perfect classification); if a classifier performs worse than random guessing, AUROC can be lower than 0.5. AUROC is more robust in the case of imbalanced datasets, but it may not be suitable when the minor class is of greater interest. In such cases, AUPRC is an alternative, with a baseline value as the fraction of the minor class.

Despite the usefulness of AUROC and AUPRC, these "collective" metrics may not be directly pertinent to virtual screening, a common application for molecular property prediction. In fact, the primary goal of early drug discovery is to rank molecules based on the predicted activity, thus avoiding the intractable number of false positives or false negatives in experimental assays. Given a set of predicted actives or inactives, depending on the screening goal, we argue that positive predictive value (PPV; Equation (1)) and negative predictive value (NPV; Equation (2)) are more relevant to virtual screening and drug design, as discussed in "Are the models properly evaluated?". Unlike AUROC and AUPRC, which are averaged across different probability thresholds, a threshold is determined first before deriving TP, FN, TN and FP, based on which PPV and NPV are calculated. When the datasets are balanced, the threshold is set as 0.5 whereas for imbalanced datasets, the threshold may be adjusted. In our study, we used Youden's J statistic, the vertical distance between ROC curve and a random chance line, to derive a threshold which maximizes the J statistic.

### A pooled testing strategy for identifying SARS-CoV-2 at low prevalence [^e1840411]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Suppressing infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will probably require the rapid identification and isolation of individuals infected with the virus on an ongoing basis. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, which makes the regular testing of every individual expensive. These costs are a challenge for all countries around the world, but particularly for low-to-middle-income countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups 1–7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, as sample dilution increases the likelihood of false-negative test results for individuals with a low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test 8. Similarly, minimizing the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimizing the time that testing takes, to reduce the spread of the infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof-of-concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (compared with 30-48-fold dilutions described in previous studies 9–11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by the frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor. At low prevalence, the costs decrease in rough proportion to the prevalence. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to monitor infection rates closely and continually in a population, along with the rapid and effective isolation of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, provides a promising pathway towards the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

### Transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.214 and alpha variants during 4 COVID-19 waves, kyoto, Japan, January 2020-June 2021 [^cf42c345]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Active epidemiologic investigation of 5,061 COVID-19 cases in Kyoto identified 13,562 close contacts during November 2020 – March 2021. The most common contact categories were household contacts (35.3%) and family living separately (10.4%), followed by workplace (staff 17.6% and user 8.2%), school (12.9%), and friend contacts (11.5%). Of close contacts, 11,813 (87.1%) had RT-PCR tests and 15.1% tested positive (Table 1). Test positivity was the highest among household contacts (24.9%) and friend contacts (16.4%). The test positivity rate among the general population during the same period was 5.9%.

Table 1
Reverse transcription PCR test positivity for close contacts of 5,061 COVID-19 case-patients, Kyoto, Japan, November 2020–March 2021

We assessed the association of COVID-19 cases with household transmission events and clusters during the third and fourth waves in Kyoto (Table 2). Compared with cases in the third wave, the mean number of cases per day was higher during the fourth wave (51.0 vs. 68.5), as was the percentage of household cases among all cases (26.7% vs. 28.9%). The percentage of cluster-associated cases among all cases was higher during the third wave than during the fourth wave (15.4% vs. 10.7%), as was the median number of cases associated with each cluster (11 vs. 7), but the mean number of clusters per day was higher during the fourth wave than the third wave (0.70 vs. 0.44). The most common settings for clusters during the third wave were welfare facilities (60.0%) and hospitals (25.0%), but during the fourth wave, offices (30.2%) and adult daycare and LTCFs (16.3%) were the most common settings (Appendix 2 Table).

### Evaluating molecular biomarkers for the early detection of lung cancer: when is a biomarker ready for clinical use? An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^1c6ced37]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Accuracy guidance for biomarker clinical validation — formulas specify minimal accuracy thresholds tied to action after positive versus negative results. The committee "agreed that it would be helpful to provide guidance about the minimal accuracy, as assessed in the clinical validation phase, that could lead to a positive clinical impact". For tests where "a positive biomarker result leads to an action where a negative biomarker result is associated with standard of care for the population", the threshold is "sensitivity/(1 − specificity) ≥ [(1 − prevalence)/prevalence] × harm/benefit", where harm/benefit is "the ratio of the net harm of a falsely positive test result to the net benefit of a true-positive test result". For tests where "a negative test leads to an action other than standard of care for the population", the threshold is "specificity/(1 − sensitivity) ≥ [prevalence/(1 − prevalence)] × harm/benefit", where harm/benefit is "the ratio of the net harm of a falsely negative test result to the net benefit of a true-negative test result". "Sensitivity/(1 − specificity) is known as the positive likelihood ratio, and specificity/(1 − sensitivity) is 1 divided by the negative likelihood ratio", and "Prevalence refers to the percentage of cases in the intended use population". The harm/benefit term "can be articulated in one of two ways: 1/N, where in the first scenario N is the maximum number of control subjects testing positive that is tolerated to benefit one case subject testing positive".

### Sparse matrix factorization robust to sample sharing across GWASs reveals interpretable genetic components [^28cd349f]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Model-selection procedure

GLEANR has three model hyperparameters: α and γ (which correspond to the degree of sparsity inand, respectively) and the number of factorsat which to initialize GLEANR. Although multiple approaches for model selection exist in the context of MF, we employ the Bayesian information criteria (BIC), due to its interpretability and computational efficiency. In high-dimensional problems, the BIC favors overly complex models, so we include an additional termto adjust for models with many covariates receiving a higher likelihood under the standard prior. We calculate the BIC aswhere(e.g. the number of non-zero elements in the matrix) is an unbiased estimate for the degrees of freedom of the lasso, andis a scaling term that controls the contribution of the added BIC extension term.is the total number of covariates under consideration in each model comparison (fororfor). This "extended" BIC yields more consistent results across GWAS cohorts than the traditional BIC in our tests (Figure S2).

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^5df765ef]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Oxaliplatin — diagnosis and skin testing show predominantly IgE-mediated hypersensitivity because skin testing using skin prick and intradermal testing has a high negative predictive value, ranging from 80% to 100%, and a positive predictive value of 66% to 80% when performed; typical testing uses skin prick testing with oxaliplatin at 1 to 5 mg/mL followed, if negative, by intradermal testing using 10-fold serial dilutions starting at 10−2 and 10−1 dilutions and undiluted, with skin irritation more common at higher intradermal strengths; when clinical history is suggestive but the skin test is negative, it may be appropriate to repeat testing after subsequent infusions, especially if there have been 8 or more previous lifetime exposures to oxaliplatin, and conversion to a positive skin test would deem such patients candidates for desensitization if continuing therapy is desired.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — observed versus unobserved self-collected specimens: Twelve studies informed this question, with eleven assessing observed self-collection and one assessing unobserved self-collection; across these, there were 1570 positive and 17 196 negative results based on nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), of which only 101 positives and 723 negatives were from the unobserved study. Pooled performance for observed self-collected specimens was sensitivity 72% (95% CI: 59% to 82%) and specificity 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), while in the single unobserved symptomatic study sensitivity was 63% (95% CI: 54% to 72%) with specificity 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%). SARS-CoV-2 prevalences of 5%, 10%, and 20% were used to assess the impact of these performance characteristics in different populations of patients.

### Group testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 to enable rapid scale-up of testing and real-time surveillance of incidence [^60100897]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

High-throughput molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be enabled by group testing in which pools of specimens are screened, and individual specimens tested only after a pool tests positive. Several laboratories have recently published examples of pooling strategies applied to SARS-CoV-2 specimens, but overall guidance on efficient pooling strategies is lacking. Therefore we developed a model of the efficiency and accuracy of specimen pooling algorithms based on available data on SAR-CoV-2 viral dynamics. For a fixed number of tests, we estimate that programs using group testing could screen 2–20 times as many specimens compared with individual testing, increase the total number of true positive infections identified, and improve the positive predictive value of results. We compare outcomes that may be expected in different testing situations and provide general recommendations for group testing implementation. A free, publicly-available Web calculator is provided to help inform laboratory decisions on SARS-CoV-2 pooling algorithms.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^ce1b189f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

65 (widely available) or 62 (epidemiological exposure) individuals would have a positive test result of which 40 and 30 would be false positives (PPVs of 38% and 52%, respectively), and
25 (widely available) and 18 (epidemiological exposure) people with negative test results would be falsely negative (NPVs 99.7% and 99.8%).

The confidence intervals for the average sensitivity estimates used in these calculations are relatively wide, such that the number of false negatives observed in practice could differ from these figures, as can be seen from the estimates derived from the confidence intervals. However, at very low prevalence of disease, as might be seen in a mass screening scenario, the effect on the absolute number of false negatives observed could be small (e.g. from 21 to 29 using the 95% CIs for the average sensitivity where testing was widely available). In contrast, although the 95% CIs for average specificities were only 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points wide the absolute numbers of false positives ranged between 20 and 50.

Increasing the prevalence of confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to 1% or 2% makes little difference to the absolute number of false positive results, but has a large relative effect when considered in relation to the total number of positive test results (true and false positives; PPVs increasing to 72% for widely available testing and 81% for testing contacts of confirmed cases at 2% prevalence; Table 1).

### Diagnostic tests: how to estimate the positive predictive value [^7ea4931e]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2015). Low credibility.

When a patient receives a positive test result from a diagnostic test they assume they have the disease. However, the positive predictive value (PPV), ie the probability that they have the disease given a positive test result, is rarely equal to one. To assist their patients, doctors must explain the chance that they do in fact have the disease. However, physicians frequently miscalculate the PPV as the sensitivity and/or misinterpret the PPV, which results in increased anxiety in patients and generates unnecessary tests and consultations. The reasons for this miscalculation as well as three ways to calculate the PPV are reviewed here.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^fe47f6c1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Derivation of δ 2 from the standard beta distribution

For continuous variables constrained between the interval [0, 1], the beta distribution is a flexible model capable of describing a wide array of distribution shapes, including bell-shaped, left-skewed, right-skewed and multi-modal (U-shaped) distributions (Fig. 2 i). The beta probability density function (pdf) is typically defined by two positive shape parameters, p and q both on the open interval (0, ∞), with the function indexed by continuous values of x constrained between the closed interval [0, 1]. The pdf for the beta distribution iswhere the two exponential functions, x p −1 (1− x) q −1, describe all distribution shapes modelled by the beta distribution (Fig. 2 i), Γ(.) is the gamma function, and Γ(p + q)/[Γ(p)Γ(q)] normalises the beta density function such that the area below the function is equal to 1. Notably, as p and q diverge from one another and their sum remains fixed (constant), the central tendency of the distribution shifts to the left (p < q) or to the right (p > q). To be exact, the mean (μ) and 1 − μ can be found withandwhere μ is constrained between the open interval (0, 1). The interval constraining μ is found with limits of the interval of p and q asand. Note μ = 0.5 when p = q. Meanwhile, as the sum of p and q decreases the dispersion of the distribution increases, irrespective of μ. Specifically, the dispersion can be described withwhere δ 2 is also constrained between the open interval (0, 1). The interval constraining δ 2 is found with limits of the interval of p and q asand. Note that δ 2 is equivalent to the shape parameter described by Damgaard and Irvine, which is better interpreted as dispersion and equivalent to the inverse of the precision parameter described by Ferrari and Cribari-Neto. It can, thus, be shown that the combination of μ and δ 2 are capable of describing all possible values of p and q, and by extension all possible beta distributions, whereand

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^90b8bbac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Small decreases (to 5%) or increases (to 20%) in prevalence make little difference to the absolute number of false positive results, but have a large relative effect when considered in relation to the number of positive test results (PPV ranging 85% to 97% for antigen tests and 83% to 95% for molecular assays). The NPV (percentage of negative test results that are truly negative) for the molecular assays is not affected by these prevalence changes in the same way because of the relatively high sensitivity and relatively low‐prevalence scenarios considered. Wider variation is observed for antigen tests (98% to 90%). This shows how even in a low‐prevalence setting, tests with poor sensitivity can have a considerable impact on the level of confidence that can be had in a negative test result. However, we emphasise that these numbers are not based on any evidence comparing antigen and molecular tests in the same samples.

We saw a similar pattern of results when applying summary results for individual tests with wide variations in sensitivity and only small differences in specificities (Table 1).

### Unifying linear prior-information-driven methods for accelerated image acquisition [^01e61f1d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

In the ongoing quest for faster imaging and higher spatial resolution, several methods have been developed to speed up data acquisition by incorporating prior information about the object being imaged. This study shows that many of these methods can be integrated into a single common equation. The unified framework provides a conceptual link that facilitates comparison among these methods to reveal their strengths and weaknesses. By considering the limitations of existing methods, a new member in this class of methods was developed. The broad-use linear acquisition speed-up technique (BLAST) uses the estimated amount of change within the FOV as prior information. BLAST has the flexibility of incorporating a variable amount of prior information to avoid the misleading appearance of "phantom features", which arise from overconstraining the reconstruction. Examples from dynamic imaging and MR thermometry are shown.

46 (overall) or 45 (week 1) people would have a positive test result, of which 9 or 5 would be false positives (positive predictive values (PPV) 81% and 89%, respectively), and
14 (overall) and 10 (week 1) people with negative test results would be falsely negative (negative predictive values (NPV) 98.6% and 99.0%).

Increasing the prevalence to 10% or 20%, increases PPV to 90% or more and slightly decreases NPV. As there is some heterogeneity in the estimates of sensitivity, the values observed in practice could vary slightly from these figures as shown by the estimates derived from the confidence intervals for the summary estimates (Table 1).

For antigen test evaluations in asymptomatic participants we used subgroup data according to whether testing was reported to be widely available to any asymptomatic person with no requirement to meet pre‐set criteria for testing (sensitivity 49.6%, 95% CI 42.1% to 57.1%, and specificity 99.6%, 95% CI 99.5% to 99.7%) and where testing was restricted to those reporting epidemiological exposure to COVID‐19 (sensitivity 64.3%, 95% CI 54.6% to 73.0%, and specificity 99.7%, 95% CI 99.5% to 99.8%).

Viral testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), particularly early in the COVID-19 pandemic, was limited by supply of reagents. We pooled nasopharyngeal samples from patients at low risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in groups of 3 for testing. Three weeks of testing using this strategy resulted in 530 patient tests in 179 cartridges; 4 positive test groups required the use of 11 additional cartridges with an overall positive rate of 0.8% in a low-risk population. This strategy resulted in the use of 340 fewer cartridges than if each test were performed on one patient sample. Pooled testing of low-risk populations allows for continued testing even when supplies are relatively scarce.

### Shape analysis, a field in need of careful validation [^3754a883]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

In the last two decades, the statistical analysis of shape has become an actively studied field and finds applications in a wide range of areas. In addition to algorithmic development, many researchers have distributed end-user orientated toolboxes, which further enable the utilization of the algorithms in an "off the shelf" fashion. However, there is little work on the evaluation and validation of these techniques, which poses a rather serious challenge when interpreting their results. To address this lack of validation, we design a validation framework and then use it to test some of the most widely used toolboxes. Our initial results show inconsistencies and disagreement among four different methods. We believe this type of analysis to be critical not only for the community of algorithm designers but also perhaps more importantly to researchers who use these tools without knowing the algorithm details and seek objective criteria for tool selection.

Methods

Data

We obtained 2019 projected state populations (N) from the 2010 U.S. Census and observed daily counts of tests (N tested) and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in each state from February 28 to April 18, 2020. Data were collected by the COVID Tracking Project, which assembles data on a regular basis primarily from state, district, and territory public health departments. National case counts from this source were comparable with those from the CDC on April 18 (COVID Tracking Project: 721,245; CDC: 720,630). State-level reporting of tests completed and the number of positive tests by date varied; COVID Tracking Project assigned each state a data quality grade based on whether (1) reporting positives reliably, (2) reporting negatives sometimes, (3) reporting negatives reliably, and (4) reporting all commercial tests. Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia met all of these criteria, 14 states met three criteria, and one state met only two criteria (Supplementary Table 3). We assumed that all test results included in this data source were done using polymerase chain reaction because during the study period, alternative tests (e.g. antibody tests) were not approved for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (such tests were only used for research purposes and are not likely to have been included in case counts). In addition, we assumed that the vast majority of samples collected were nasopharyngeal swabs, which were recommended by the CDC as the preferred choice of swab.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic exposed individuals — benefits and harms: The panel placed high value on minimizing the number of false-negative results, especially in higher-risk healthcare settings, and found no evidence that the use of Ag tests reduces transmission of SARS-CoV-2; furthermore, treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic persons. Users of rapid Ag tests may not understand the limits of a negative test; in 1 study, two-thirds of participants believed that they were noninfectious the day following a negative rapid Ag test. Sensitivity is linked to timing of exposure; a negative result may convert to positive within hours early in infection. At 1% prevalence, the number of true-positive Ag test results was small and approximated the number of false-negative results, quantified as 6 true positives and 4 false negatives per 1000 asymptomatic individuals tested.

### Biocatalysed synthesis planning using data-driven learning [^5d0962e8]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Data set

The enzymatic reaction data set with related EC (enzyme commission) numbers was created by merging entries extracted from Rhea (n = 8659), BRENDA (n = 11130), PathBank (n = 31047) and MetaNetX (n = 34485) –. This data set was then further processed by (1) removing products that occur as reactants in the same reaction, (2) removing known co-enzymes and common byproducts from the products in reactions that exceed one product (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), (3) removing molecules with a heavy atom count < 4 from the products and (4) removing reactions with > 1 or < 1 products or no reactants. The resulting data set contains 62,222 unique reaction–EC number combinations. The data set is available in 5 different token schemes: With no EC number (EC0, n = 55115), only EC-level 1 (EC1, n = 55707), EC-levels 1–2 (EC2, n = 56222), EC-levels 1–3 (EC3, n = 56579) and EC-levels 1–4 (EC4, n = 62222). The different token schemes result in different set sizes as the removal of EC-levels leads to duplication and removal of extended reaction SMILES. Given the low specificity of enzyme information in EC1 and EC2 tokens, and the insufficient sampling for EC4, which is often confined to one enzyme-substrate example only, the EC3 data set remained the only one containing sufficient variability in terms of enzyme-substrate examples across individual tokens. Figure 2 a shows the composition of the data set with token scheme EC3, containing 62,403 unique enzymatic reactions. At EC-level 1, which corresponds to enzyme classes, EC 2.x.x.x (transferases) account for 53.5% of total entries, EC 1.x.x.x (oxidoreductases) for 24.5%, EC 3.x.x.x (hydrolases) for 10.7%, EC 4.x.x.x (lyases) for 6.3%, EC 6.x.x.x (ligases) for 2.3%, EC 5.x.x.x (isomerases) for 2.2% and EC 7.x.x.x (translocases) for 0.4%. The high fraction of transferase-catalysed reactions is a consequence of the large number of non-primary lipid pathways stored in PathBank. Among transferases, the most common subclasses at EC-level 2 are EC 2.7.x.x (transferases transferring phosphorus-containing groups) at 24.5%, EC 2.3.x.x (acetyltransferases) at 16.8% and EC 2.1.x.x (transferases transferring one-carbon groups) 7.5%. The complete information on the distribution of samples across EC-levels 2 and 3 is provided in the supplementary information (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, with a breakdown of the data set by data source shown in Supplementary Fig. 2).

### The evolutionary history of 2, 658 cancers [^1f60f63d]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Timing of gains

We used three related approaches to calculate the timing of copy number gains (see Supplementary Information, section 2). In brief, the common feature is that the expected VAF of a mutation (E) is related to the underlying number of alleles carrying a mutation according to the formula: E [X] = nmfρ /[N (1 − ρ) + Cρ], in which X is the number of reads, n denotes the coverage of the locus, the mutation copy number m is the number of alleles carrying the mutation (which is usually inferred), f is the frequency of the clone carrying the given mutation (f = 1 for clonal mutations). N is the normal copy number (2 on autosomes, 1 or 2 for chromosome X and 0 or 1 for chromosome Y), C is the total copy number of the tumour, and ρ is the purity of the sample.

The number of mutations n m at each allelic copy number m then informs about the time when the gain has occurred. The basic formulae for timing each gain are, depending on the copy number configuration:in which 2 + 1 refers to major and minor copy number of 2 and 1, respectively. Methods differ slightly in how the number of mutations present on each allele are calculated and how uncertainty is handled (Supplementary Information).

Timing of mutations

The mutation copy number m and the clonal frequency f is calculated according to the principles indicated above. Details can be found in Supplementary Information, section 2. Mutations with f = 1 are denoted as 'clonal', and mutations with f < 1 as 'subclonal' Mutations with f = 1 and m > 1 are denoted as 'early clonal' (co-amplified). In cases with f = 1, m = 1 and C > 2, mutations were annotated as 'late clonal', if the minor copy number was 0, otherwise 'clonal' (unspecified).

### Association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive antibody test with risk of future infection [^ddf8b045]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can observational clinical data from commercial laboratories be used to evaluate the comparative risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for individuals who are antibody positive vs those who are antibody negative?

Finding

In this cohort study of more than 3.2 million US patients with a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, 0.3% of those indexed with positive test results had evidence of a positive nucleic acid amplification test beyond 90 days after index, compared with 3.0% indexed with negative antibody test results.

Meaning

Individuals who are seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 based on commercial assays may be at decreased future risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

GRADE summary for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) diagnostic accuracy — sensitivity and specificity with per-1,000 effects at pre-test probabilities of 10%, 25%, and 50% — reports sensitivity 0.75 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.85) and specificity 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99 to 1.00). Effect per 1,000 patients tested at a pre-test probability of 10% includes true positives 75 (55 to 95), false negatives 25 (5 to 45), true negatives 900 (891 to 909), and false positives 0 (0 to 9); at 25% pre-test probability true positives 188 (138 to 238), false negatives 62 (12 to 112), true negatives 750 (742 to 759), and false positives 0 (0 to 8); at 50% pre-test probability true positives 375 (275 to 475), false negatives 125 (25 to 225), true negatives 500 (495 to 500), and false positives 0 (0 to 5).

Asymptomatic antigen testing prior to large gatherings — evidence and guidance: No direct evidence compared antigen (Ag) testing with no testing before large gatherings, and therefore no recommendation for or against testing was made. Available data came from a single home Ag study in asymptomatic individuals with 86 positive and 601 negative nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results; rapid home Ag test sensitivity and specificity were 41% (95% CI: 25% to 61%) and 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%), respectively, considered alongside community prevalence scenarios of 1%, 5%, and 10%. Certainty of evidence was very low for sensitivity and low for specificity due to indirectness and imprecision. One-time Ag testing immediately before an event may potentially reduce transmission in settings of moderate to high community asymptomatic infection prevalence (ie, ≥ 10%) where distancing is not possible, attendees are unmasked, or ventilation is poor; however, there is no empirical evidence to date that Ag testing reduces the risk of transmission.

Results

During the 6-year study period, a total of 32,991 incident episodes of CDI (range by year 5,021–6,320) were identified among 29,577 persons. Of the 32,991 CDIs, 10,643 (32.3%) were classified as CA (32.9/100,000 population) and 22,348 (67.7%) as HA (69.1/100,000 population, 3.2/10,000 patient-days).

Of the 10,643 CA-CDIs, 3,166 (29.7%) were among patients whose positive C. difficile specimen date was < 2 days after admission. Of the 22,348 HA-CDIs, 16,319 (73.0%) were hospital onset (positive specimen date > 2 days after hospital admission) and 4,813 (21.5%) were community onset (positive specimen date < 4 weeks after hospital discharge). The remaining 1,216 (5.4%) HA-CDIs were in patients transferred from another healthcare institution. For hospital-onset HA-CDIs, median time from hospital admission to positive specimen date was 13 days (range 3−3,785 days), which was similar to that for community-onset HA-CDIs, for which median time from hospital discharge was 13 days (range 1−28 days). Of 4,813 community-onset HA-CDIs, 2,730 (56.7%) were among patients whose positive C. difficile specimen date was < 2 days after hospital admission.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) molecular COVID-19 diagnostic testing guideline — Because EUA submissions require analytical but not clinical performance data, the panel identified few studies reporting clinical performance and based most recommendations on diagnostic test accuracy. Accuracy metrics include sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are essential; calculating predictive values requires prevalence or pre-test probability, yet true community prevalence may be ill-defined or underestimated when testing is limited or results are not reported. Accordingly, the panel varied estimates of prevalence/pre-test probability and assay sensitivity and specificity in analyses using available literature and public dashboards to mirror what may be encountered in clinical practice.

### Cumulative probability of false-positive recall or biopsy recommendation after 10 years of screening mammography: a cohort study [^d000ee07]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

False-positive mammography results are common. Biennial screening may decrease the cumulative probability of false-positive results across many years of repeated screening but could also delay cancer diagnosis.

Objective

To compare the cumulative probability of false-positive results and the stage distribution of incident breast cancer after 10 years of annual or biennial screening mammography.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

7 mammography registries in the National Cancer Institute-funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.

Participants

169,456 women who underwent first screening mammography at age 40 to 59 years between 1994 and 2006 and 4492 women with incident invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1996 and 2006.

Measurements

False-positive recalls and biopsy recommendations stage distribution of incident breast cancer.

Results

False-positive recall probability was 16.3% at first and 9.6% at subsequent mammography. Probability of false-positive biopsy recommendation was 2.5% at first and 1.0% at subsequent examinations. Availability of comparison mammograms halved the odds of a false-positive recall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.56]). When screening began at age 40 years, the cumulative probability of a woman receiving at least 1 false-positive recall after 10 years was 61.3% (CI, 59.4% to 63.1%) with annual and 41.6% (CI, 40.6% to 42.5%) with biennial screening. Cumulative probability of false-positive biopsy recommendation was 7.0% (CI, 6.1% to 7.8%) with annual and 4.8% (CI, 4.4% to 5.2%) with biennial screening. Estimates were similar when screening began at age 50 years. A non-statistically significant increase in the proportion of late-stage cancers was observed with biennial compared with annual screening (absolute increases, 3.3 percentage points [CI, -1.1 to 7.8 percentage points] for women age 40 to 49 years and 2.3 percentage points [CI, -1.0 to 5.7 percentage points] for women age 50 to 59 years) among women with incident breast cancer.

Limitations

Few women underwent screening over the entire 10-year period. Radiologist characteristics influence recall rates and were unavailable. Most mammograms were film rather than digital. Incident cancer was analyzed in a small sample of women who developed cancer.

Conclusion

After 10 years of annual screening, more than half of women will receive at least 1 false-positive recall, and 7% to 9% will receive a false-positive biopsy recommendation. Biennial screening appears to reduce the cumulative probability of false-positive results after 10 years but may be associated with a small absolute increase in the probability of late-stage cancer diagnosis.

### A geometric approach to characterize the functional identity of single cells [^b512f4f1]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Formally, given a matrix Y representing the adjusted transcriptional profile of cells, we aim to construct an optimal setof k columns such that each selected column is an ideal representative of the cells that perform a given primary function. Let us assume that matrix Y can be decomposed as, whereis the selected column subspace of matrix Y, H is non-negative with column-sums equal to one, and N represents bounded noise, where. That is, we can selectcolumns from matrix Y to represent rest of the columns, with consideration for noise. A matrix satisfying this condition is called near-separable and is known as the near-separable non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) when Y is non-negative. For a matrix satisfying near-separability, there is an efficient algorithm, with provable performance guarantees, that can identify columns in. Furthermore, premultiplying matrix Y with a nonsingular matrix Q preserves its separability, but if chosen carefully, can enhance the conditioning of the problem and accuracy of results. To find the optimal preconditioning matrix Q, we use a theoretically grounded method based on identifying a minimum volume ellipsoid at the origin that contains all columns of Y (Supplementary Note 6).

### Dissection of genetic variation and evidence for pleiotropy in male pattern baldness [^24419880]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Our estimate of the proportion of phenotypic variance captured by common SNPs is comparable to other h 2 SNP estimates for traits such as heightand childhood intelligence. Our GREML-LDMS analysis on the autosomes showed that common SNPs (MAF > 0.01) essentially explained all h 2 SNP (fold-enrichment = 3.63, P = 3.6e-177), whereas rare SNPs (1.5e-5 < MAF ≤ 0.01) made a very minor contribution. There was also enrichment in lower LD regions (68%, fold-enrichment = 1.36, P = 8.7e-3) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 2). However, this analysis did not capture X-chromosome variants, which is relevant as the MPB-associated AR region is one of the highest LD regions on the X-chromosome. The enrichment for common autosomal variants in lower LD regions reflects a recent BayesS analysis on the UKBv1 dataset, which found a signature of negative selection among MPB-associated loci, with an S-parameter estimate of −0.346. The dominating contribution of common variants to MPB was also observed among the 624 conditionally-independent GWS SNPs (autosomes and X-chromosome). Altogether, these SNPs explained 25% (SE = 1%) of phenotypic variance (Fig. 2b) and 98% (n = 612) were common (MAF > 0.01) (Supplementary Data 4, Supplementary Data 5). Hence, even accounting for rare variants, the missing h 2 is ≈0.2, which may suggest environmental or non-additive inflation of the estimate.

### Extracting medicinal chemistry intuition via preference machine learning [^ba2f4606]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The lead optimization process in drug discovery campaigns is an arduous endeavour where the input of many medicinal chemists is weighed in order to reach a desired molecular property profile. Building the expertise to successfully drive such projects collaboratively is a very time-consuming process that typically spans many years within a chemist's career. In this work we aim to replicate this process by applying artificial intelligence learning-to-rank techniques on feedback that was obtained from 35 chemists at Novartis over the course of several months. We exemplify the usefulness of the learned proxies in routine tasks such as compound prioritization, motif rationalization, and biased de novo drug design. Annotated response data is provided, and developed models and code made available through a permissive open-source license.

### Estimating global, regional, and national daily and cumulative infections with SARS-CoV-2 through nov 14, 2021: a statistical analysis [^d1f68aa8]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

This empirical analysis has several important limitations. First, some seroprevalence surveys (such as the CDC monitoring of laboratory data) might be biased, but the direction of the bias is difficult to ascertain. Additionally, in reporting serosurveys, various corrections can be applied to produce estimates, including the use of sampling weights, correcting for manufacturing sensitivity and specificity, or, in some instances, full correction for waning detectability. Where possible, we attempted to standardise for this by extracting data that were adjusted for sampling frame and manufacturing sensitivity, but not more complex corrections. If this was not possible, we used the raw numerator and denominator as reported. In some instances, no metadata were provided to describe whether any correction had been applied. In all instances, these values were treated as equivalent. Second, we have assumed that one of the key covariates for the IDR is demonstrated testing capacity. By construction, this variable cannot decline as it is the maximum value of previously observed daily testing rates. In some countries, changes in guidance on who gets tested could lead to declines in effective testing and the IDR, and we may have missed these changes. The CDC guidance in spring, 2021, not to test vaccinated individuals who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic is an example of such a policy. Third, vaccination increases the proportion of the population who test positive on anti-spike antibody tests. We note in some locations, particularly in the UK, attempts to account for vaccination rates resulted in decreasing estimates of seroprevalence over time, suggesting that assumptions about the probability of vaccinated individuals being identified in serological surveys in those locations are incompatible with the data collected; in these instances, we excluded the seroprevalence data from the analysis. Fourth, matched seroprevalence surveys with reported cumulative cases, hospitalisations, and deaths provide an interval measure of the IDR, IHR, and IFR from the beginning of the pandemic to the period of the survey. We used these interval measures to derive relationships for the daily IDR, IHR, and IFR. This approach decreases our ability to identify drivers of shorter-term fluctuations in these key rates. Fifth, the availability of hospital admissions data in low-income and middle-income settings was generally low, minimising its effect on the estimation process in many countries. Sixth, we used estimates of total COVID-19 mortality based on the measurement or estimation of excess mortality multiplied by a statistical estimate of the proportion of excess mortality directly attributable to infection with SARS-CoV-2. This statistical estimation was based on removing the effect of a low IDR and reduced mobility that might be a proxy for deferred care and other health effects of isolation. This estimate of the proportion of excess mortality that is total COVID-19 has wide UIs. Eventually, better data will emerge on causes of death during the pandemic that will hopefully refine the estimate of total COVID-19 deaths. The wide uncertainty in the ratio of total COVID-19 to reported COVID-19 is reflected in the uncertainty analysis in this study. Seventh, our model permitted a maximum of two infections per individual — in the case where a person gets an ancestral or alpha variant infection, they might also be infected with a beta, gamma, or delta variant. There is evidence of waning naturally derived immunity, suggesting that an individual might become more broadly susceptible to reinfection sometime after exposure.

Our variance analyses confirmed that the X-chromosome disproportionally contributes to MPB, relative to its physical length and number of genes. The X-chromosome makes up around 5% of the human genome in length, and contains 800–900 of the 20,000–25,000 genes in humans (4.5% at most). Here, 624 conditionally independent GWS SNPs accounted for h 2 SNP, COJO = 0.252 (SE = 0.011), of which X-chromosome conditionally-independent GWS SNPs explained 0.029 (SE = 0.008), or 11.6% (0.029/0.252). In comparison, all common X-chromosome variants explained 8.8% (0.034/0.393) of h 2 SNP due to common variation (Supplementary Data 1). This suggests that MPB genetic architecture on the X-chromosome is less polygenic than on the autosomes, which is reflected by the large-effect X-chromosome loci (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Data 5). We discuss X-chromosome loci annotations further in Supplementary Note 1.

### Development and assessment of a new framework for disease surveillance, prediction, and risk adjustment: the diagnostic items classification system [^85c30805]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Results

We created 3223 DXIs: 2435 DXI_1 main effects, 772 DXI_2 modifiers, and 16 DXI_3 scaled variables. Full details of the mappings of ICD-10-CM codes into DXIs are available online at.

The 90% development sample included 59 297 201 enrollee-years. Mean (SD) total health care and plan paid spending were $6124 ($25 109) and $5281 ($24 585), respectively, with no meaningful differences between the development and estimation samples (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Mean (SD) total health care spending top-coded at $250 000 (the primary outcome) within the development sample was $5821 ($17 653); top-coding lowered mean total health care spending by 4.9%.

### Model for interpreting discordant SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test results [^21298150]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

We devised a model to interpret discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results. We estimate that, during March 2020-May 2022, a patient in the United States who received a positive rapid antigen test result followed by a negative nucleic acid test result had only a 15.4% (95% CI 0.6%-56.7%) chance of being infected.

### Assessment of an online tool to simulate the effect of pooled testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection in asymptomatic and symptomatic populations [^480c6370]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

Figure 1 shows the 74 preprocedural screening sample VCNs (median [interquartile range] VCN, 2.90 [2.26–6.11] log 10 RNA copies/mL) and 2910 outpatient diagnostic sample VCNs (median [interquartile range] VCN, 6.11 [4.05–7.62] log 10 RNA copies/mL) used to simulate asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2–positive patients in the tool. Figure 2 compares pooled testing with single-sample testing across positivity rates. Pooled testing increased the number of false-negative cases per 1000 patients and decreased the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection, especially for low-VCN samples and asymptomatic patients (Figure 2 A and B). For example, the mean (SD) sensitivity of 5-sample pooled testing for detection of asymptomatic patients with a 10% positivity rate in the population was 77.57% (4.40%) vs 92.83% (8.38%) for single-sample testing. Figure 2 C and D show that pooled testing decreased the number of tests needed to screen 1000 patients, but this effect was reduced by repeat testing to identify cases from positive pools for contract tracing, especially at high prevalence. Figure 2 E and F show that pooled testing identified more positive patients per 1000 tests performed by testing more patients, but repeat testing reduced this benefit.
