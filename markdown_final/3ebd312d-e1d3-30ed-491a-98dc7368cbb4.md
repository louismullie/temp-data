## Question

A 54-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C presents with progressive shortness of breath and platypnea (worsening dyspnea when upright). Pulse oximetry reveals an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, which improves to 94% with supplemental oxygen. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography confirms the diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient asks about medications or treatments that could improve his oxygenation or cure his condition.

Based on current guidelines, what pharmacologic therapies can you offer this patient to treat his hepatopulmonary syndrome, and what is the role of supplemental oxygen?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pharmacologic therapies and the role of supplemental oxygen in treating hepatopulmonary syndrome in a 54-year-old man with cirrhosis and confirmed HPS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of HPS. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about medical therapy versus supportive care. Next, I will examine the evidence for supplemental oxygen and how to titrate it. After that, I need to check whether any pharmacologic options have credible evidence or are only experimental or post-transplant rescue. Finally, I should consider disease-modifying therapy, namely liver transplantation, and outline a practical, guideline-concordant plan with monitoring and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. HPS is defined by the triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilations, and impaired arterial oxygenation; contrast-enhanced echocardiography confirms intrapulmonary shunting, and room air SpO2 around 88% indicates at least moderate hypoxemia, with severity typically graded by PaO2 on room air and A-a gradient, so I should obtain an ABG to quantify PaO2 and the shunt fraction to guide prognosis and transplant referral, especially if PaO2 is below 60 mmHg [^56104cc2] [^3cdbceb7] [^9a0dffa4].

> Wait, let me verify the core therapeutic principle before discussing drugs. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on the same message: there are no established, FDA-approved pharmacologic therapies for HPS, and management is supportive with supplemental oxygen while pursuing liver transplantation as the only definitive treatment; I should not overpromise medications that are not guideline-supported [^03c349e7] [^b0937385] [^fa375ff7] [^b7c0e034] [^4e9b61aa] [^b97eeeee].

> I will now examine supplemental oxygen, since that is the cornerstone. Guidelines recommend long-term oxygen therapy for HPS with significant hypoxemia, recognizing that while symptomatic and physiologic improvement is expected, high-quality evidence for hard outcomes is limited; oxygen should be titrated to maintain SpO2 at or above about 90% at rest, during exertion, and during sleep, with periodic reassessment of needs and adherence, and I should document objective improvement with ABGs when feasible [^4e9b61aa] [^345c74ca] [^7d761310] [^29bf24c0] [^59a7cc13].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pharmacotherapy. I initially thought inhaled nitric oxide might be a disease-modifying option, but wait, I should double-check the context. Inhaled nitric oxide and inhaled epoprostenol have been used as short-term rescue strategies for severe post-transplant hypoxemia in HPS, not as chronic outpatient therapy, and even then the evidence is largely case series and expert algorithms rather than randomized trials; methylene blue has similarly limited, inconsistent data and is not a routine outpatient therapy for HPS [^7dee4a69] [^39b66e9f] [^a8960c20] [^bdb56e24] [^01ffae7d].

> Let me consider other agents that sometimes come up. Pentoxifylline showed no improvement in oxygenation and poor tolerability in a small open-label study, so it should not be recommended. TIPS has insufficient evidence for HPS and is not guideline-endorsed for this indication. And although case reports describe embolization of dilated pulmonary vessels improving oxygenation in select non-transplant candidates, this remains investigational and is not standard care [^33979b23] [^fb37e3be] [^3ff0be35] [^98c97457].

> Next, I should review the definitive therapy. Liver transplantation is the only established cure for HPS, with reversal of gas-exchange abnormalities in the majority of survivors beyond 6 months; however, severe pre-transplant hypoxemia, particularly PaO2 less than 50 mmHg, is associated with higher post-transplant mortality and severe early hypoxemia, so patients with significant hypoxemia should be prioritized for transplant evaluation and MELD exception points when criteria are met [^f5c36928] [^496e1948] [^c215cfec] [^23d7a98e].

> I need to ensure the practical plan is explicit. I should confirm HPS severity with ABG, initiate long-term oxygen to keep SpO2≥ 90% during rest, exercise, and sleep, monitor for hypercapnia in those at risk, and refer urgently for liver transplantation evaluation with documentation to support MELD exception if PaO2 is below 60 mmHg; I should also counsel that oxygen improves symptoms and oxygen delivery but does not alter the underlying pulmonary vascular pathology, reinforcing the need for transplant [^3cdbceb7] [^4e9b61aa] [^23d7a98e] [^c215cfec].

> But wait, what if the patient asks about experimental or off-label drugs? I should explain that while small studies and case reports describe agents like inhaled iloprost, methylene blue, or NO pathway modulators, none have proven durable benefit or safety in HPS, and some interventions can worsen oxygenation in certain contexts; therefore, outside of a clinical trial or a specialized post-transplant rescue setting, these should not be used as disease-directed therapy [^48988bfe] [^382c66d7] [^4427c722].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis and severity, prescribe guideline-supported supplemental oxygen with structured monitoring, and expedite liver transplantation evaluation as the only curative option, while avoiding unproven pharmacologic therapies; this approach aligns with ILTS, EASL, and SCCM guidance and balances symptomatic relief with disease modification through transplant [^03c349e7] [^4e9b61aa] [^fa375ff7] [^f5c36928].

There are **no proven pharmacologic therapies** for hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) [^03c349e7]; current guidelines recommend only **supplemental oxygen** to relieve dyspnea and improve oxygenation while awaiting liver transplantation, which is the only definitive cure [^fa375ff7] [^496e1948]. Oxygen should be titrated to maintain SpO2≥ 90% at rest, during exercise, and during sleep [^notfound]. Experimental agents such as inhaled nitric oxide, methylene blue, and pentoxifylline have limited or inconsistent evidence and are not recommended for routine care [^33979b23] [^382c66d7]. TIPS is not recommended for HPS due to insufficient evidence and potential harm [^fb37e3be] [^3ff0be35]. Management should focus on supportive oxygen, early transplant evaluation, and MELD exception if hypoxemia is severe [^23d7a98e] [^c215cfec].

---

## Pharmacologic therapies

### Established pharmacologic therapies

There are **no established pharmacologic therapies** for HPS [^03c349e7]. The ILTS and EASL guidelines explicitly state that aside from supplemental oxygen, no medical therapies are definitively established or FDA-approved for HPS [^b0937385] [^b97eeeee].

---

### Experimental and investigational pharmacologic therapies

Several pharmacologic agents have been studied, but evidence is limited, inconsistent, or negative:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|-|
| Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) | Selective pulmonary vasodilator | - Small studies show transient improvement in oxygenation<br/> - Not sustained or curative<br/> - Limited to research or post-transplant rescue settings [^bdb56e24] [^7dee4a69] |
| Methylene blue | Guanylate cyclase inhibitor; vasoconstrictor | - Case reports suggest transient improvement<br/> - Not validated in RCTs<br/> - Potential harm in some contexts [^01ffae7d] [^382c66d7] |
| Pentoxifylline | TNF-α inhibitor; anti-inflammatory | - Small open-label trial showed no benefit<br/> - Poor tolerability<br/> - Not recommended [^33979b23] |
| Garlic (allicin) | Antioxidant; nitric oxide modulator | - Very limited evidence<br/> - Not recommended [^notfound] |

---

These agents are **not recommended** for routine clinical management of HPS due to insufficient evidence and potential risks [^b97eeeee].

---

## Role of supplemental oxygen therapy

Supplemental oxygen is the **cornerstone of supportive care** in HPS [^fa375ff7]. It improves oxygenation, relieves dyspnea, and enhances quality of life while patients await liver transplantation [^4e9b61aa].

---

### Indications for supplemental oxygen therapy

Oxygen therapy is indicated for patients with HPS who have **significant hypoxemia**, typically defined as:

- **SpO2< 90% on room air** at rest, during exercise, or during sleep [^notfound].
- **PaO2< 60 mmHg** on room air [^23d7a98e].

---

### Benefits of supplemental oxygen therapy

Supplemental oxygen provides several benefits, including:

- **Improved oxygenation**: Increases arterial oxygen saturation and partial pressure of oxygen [^notfound].
- **Symptom relief**: Reduces dyspnea and fatigue, improving exercise tolerance and quality of life [^notfound].
- **Bridge to transplantation**: Maintains adequate oxygenation until liver transplantation can be performed [^fa375ff7].

---

### Limitations of supplemental oxygen therapy

While supplemental oxygen improves symptoms and oxygenation, it **does not address the underlying pathophysiology** of HPS (intrapulmonary vasodilation and shunting) [^fa3bfa31]. Therefore, it is not curative and must be combined with definitive therapy (liver transplantation) when feasible [^496e1948].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major liver societies provide clear recommendations on HPS management:

- **ILTS 2016 guidelines**: Emphasize that aside from supplemental oxygen, no medical therapies are definitively established or FDA-approved for HPS [^b0937385].
- **EASL 2018 guidelines**: Recommend long-term oxygen therapy for patients with severe hypoxemia due to HPS, acknowledging insufficient evidence regarding its effectiveness, tolerance, cost-effectiveness, compliance, and survival impact [^4e9b61aa].
- **SCCM 2020 guidelines**: Recommend supportive care with supplemental oxygen pending possible liver transplantation [^fa375ff7].

---

## Definitive treatment: liver transplantation

Liver transplantation is the **only definitive treatment** for HPS, with resolution of hypoxemia in most patients post-transplant [^f5c36928]. Severe hypoxemia (PaO2< 60 mmHg) warrants expedited transplant evaluation and MELD exception points to facilitate timely transplantation [^23d7a98e] [^c215cfec].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Pharmacologic therapies**: No proven pharmacologic therapies exist for HPS [^03c349e7]. Experimental agents (e.g. inhaled nitric oxide, methylene blue, pentoxifylline) are not recommended for routine care [^b97eeeee].
- **Supplemental oxygen**: The mainstay of supportive care, improving oxygenation and symptoms while awaiting transplantation [^fa375ff7].
- **Definitive treatment**: Liver transplantation is the only cure for HPS [^496e1948].

---

There are **no proven pharmacologic therapies** for HPS; management centers on supplemental oxygen and early transplant evaluation, with oxygen titrated to maintain SpO2≥ 90% [^03c349e7] [^fa375ff7].

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of experimental and human hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and in the management of HPS, particularly regarding liver transplantation.

Recent Findings

Advances have been made in defining the pathophysiology of HPS in experimental models as well as in human disease, including the role of endothelin-1, pulmonary monocytes, and angiogenesis. Additionally, the implications of the presence of HPS as it relates to prioritizing patients for liver transplantation and posttransplant outcomes will also be reviewed.

Summary

Mechanisms of disease continue to be defined in HPS, providing potential targets for pharmacologic intervention. Outcomes after liver transplantation are also becoming clearer, including the management of HPS with severe hypoxemia.

Summary of recommendations—pulmonary vascular disease, oxygenation, and hypoxemia strategies in ALF or ACLF includes: We suggest treating portopulmonary hypertension with agents approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 35 mm Hg. We recommend supportive care with supplemental oxygen in the treatment of hepatopulmonary syndrome, pending possible liver transplantation. We recommend placing chest tube with an attempt to pleurodesis for hepatic hydrothorax in patients in whom transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is not an option or as a palliative intent. We suggest using high-flow nasal cannula over noninvasive ventilation in hypoxic critically ill patients with ALF or ACLF.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^7dee4a69]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined as the triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, and abnormal gas exchange, and is found in 10–32% of patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only known cure for HPS, but patients can develop severe posttransplant hypoxemia, defined as a need for 100% inspired oxygen to maintain a saturation of ≥85%. This complication is seen in 6–21% of patients and carries a 45% mortality. Its management requires the application of specific strategies targeting the underlying physiologic abnormalities in HPS, but awareness of these strategies and knowledge on their optimal use is limited. We reviewed existing literature to identify strategies that can be used for this complication, and developed a clinical management algorithm based on best evidence and expert opinion. Evidence was limited to case reports and case series, and we determined which treatments to include in the algorithm and their recommended sequence based on their relative likelihood of success, invasiveness, and risk. Recommended therapies include: Trendelenburg positioning, inhaled epoprostenol or nitric oxide, methylene blue, embolization of abnormal pulmonary vessels, and extracorporeal life support. Availability and use of this pragmatic algorithm may improve management of this complication, and will benefit from prospective validation.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^a8960c20]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Sequence of Therapies in Algorithm

We recommend maintaining any initially effective therapy and adding others sequentially thereafter for recurrent hypoxemia. Trendelenburg positioning is the first therapy in the algorithm because it carries low risk, and is the easiest to both implement and reverse. We followed this with inhaled vasodilators because they have been most widely studied in HPS, have a rapid onset, and are quickly reversible. Inhaled epoprostenol is recommended before iNO because it is just as effective as iNO in critically ill patients with refractory hypoxemia 49, is lower in cost, and may have a stronger synergistic effect with MB than iNO (as detailed above). If a positive effect is seen with combination therapy, we recommend attempting to wean the inhaled vasodilator to determine if the observed effect is due to MB alone or to the combination. If all other treatments have failed, we recommend embolization of abnormal pulmonary vessels or ECLS. Since these are invasive, non‐reversible treatments with a high risk of complications and very limited evidence, we recommend that patients have a SaO 2 <80% with evidence of end‐organ insufficiency in order to justify these risks.

Fig. 1 
Alterations of the pulmonary vascular bed in chronic liver disease: chronic liver disease promotes remodeling processes in the pulmonary vascular bed characterized by diffuse or localized telangiectasia (in HPS) or hyperplastic lesions in terminal pulmonary arterioles (PoPH). The diagnostic workup includes blood gases in the supine and upright posture and contrast-enhanced echocardiography. Evidence of secondary pulmonary hypertension or right-to-left shunting triggers further imaging. HPS and PoPH are associated with functional status, quality of life, and survival on the waiting list and outcome after LT with strong impact on listing for LT

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is present in 10–30% of patients with cirrhosis being evaluated for LT, but has also been reported in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and acute liver injury in the critically ill, e.g. in patients after shock events presenting signs of “hypoxic hepatitis”. As such, acute HPS as a consequence of acute and chronic heart failure, in particular failure of the right ventricle with hepatic congestion, can complicate the ICU course through induction of pulmonary shunting (i.e. HPS). This bi-directional cross talk of lung and liver can be viewed as a prominent example of organ–organ interactions that pave the way to multiple organ failure and death.

Supportive therapies with supplemental oxygen and liver transplantation remain the only therapies with proven benefit in cases of HPS associated with end-stage liver disease, and Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) exception can be granted to facilitate liver transplantation in various programs to reverse two potentially fatal organ dysfunctions. Patients with HPS are at increased risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation with a longer ICU length of stay compared to other liver transplant recipients. Most literature reports addressing management of these critical events reflect case reports or small case series, where inhaled vasodilators, most notably nitric oxide and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), have been applied as rescue strategies. Albeit inhaled NO might selectively dilate well-aerated alveoli, the use of vasodilators in HPS in general remains controversial and should be restricted to short-acting NO in exceptional cases and as compassionate use.

### New updates on hepatopulmonary syndrome: a comprehensive review [^541b1068]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious pulmonary vascular complication that causes arterial hypoxemia in the setting of liver disease. HPS has a progressive course and is associated with a two-fold increased risk of mortality relative to cirrhotic patients without HPS. It primarily affects patients with portal hypertension. The key pathological features of HPS include intrapulmonary angiogenesis and vascular dilations (IPVDs). The prevalence of HPS varies widely due to inconsistent diagnostic criteria and a lack of standardized protocols. Despite advances in understanding its pathophysiology, no effective curative treatments for HPS exist. Liver transplantation remains the only definitive treatment, improving survival and altering the disease natural course. This review explores the pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapeutic strategies for HPS, highlighting recent advances in the literature.

Results

Literature search

We retrieved 416 citations using the medical subject heading “hepatopulmonary syndrome,” and an additional 156 citations using the keyword “hepatopulmonary syndrome,” for a total of 572 citations. Of these, 18 definitely met, 149 possibly met, and 405 definitely did not meet inclusion criteria. Upon full manuscript review, of the 149 citations possibly meeting inclusion criteria, 15 met inclusion criteria. We identified an additional 23 citations of interest from the manual search of reference lists and from experts, nine of which met inclusion criteria upon full manuscript review, for a total of 42 manuscripts (7%) meeting inclusion criteria. Of these, 27 studies reported therapies that were included in the algorithm (Table 1). Given that this is an infrequent complication in a rare disease, evidence was limited to case reports and case series and could not be formally meta‐analyzed. A small number of patients have been reported for any one therapy, with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) being the best studied (19 patients), followed by methylene blue (MB) (10 patients), inhaled epoprostenol (four patients), embolization of abnormal pulmonary vessels (four patients), combined iNO and MB (two patients), ECLS (three patients), and Trendelenburg positioning (one patient). Mechanisms and time‐courses of action for these agents are summarized in Table 2. Therapies that were not included in our algorithm, along with their mechanisms of action and reasons for exclusion are summarized in Supplemental Table S1.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^5ed8727c]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Pretransplant Testing

Our review suggests that there is variability in responsiveness to various therapies (Table 1). This is likely due to variations in the timing, dose and duration of their administration, and unique patient factors related to HPS pathophysiology and any co‐existing lung disease. A previous report noted increased risk of severe posttransplant hypoxemia in patients with a baseline PaO 2 ≤50 mmHg and/or ≥20% anatomic shunting 10. In these “high‐risk” patients, preoperative testing for responsiveness to these approaches may be beneficial in predicting their relative effectiveness. These data could be used to tailor and adapt the algorithm to each patient, and positive results may be used to justify listing of candidates otherwise considered at too high a risk for this complication 6.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Increases in the ratio of plasma aromatic amino acids to branched-chain amino acids as a consequence of hepatic insufficiency also may contribute to encephalopathy. One meta-analysis suggested that mental recovery was consistently more rapid in patients whose treatment included a branched-chain amino acid infusion; three studies found lower mortality rates in patients who received this treatment, and two others suggested that the treatment increased mortality.

Portal Hypertension and Variceal Bleeding Regardless of the etiology of cirrhosis, the development of portal hypertension is nearly universal and results from an increased resistance to portal flow secondary to scarring, narrowing, and compression of the hepatic sinusoids. When the portal pressure exceeds a certain threshold, it results in the development of varices. Approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis develop varices, most commonly in the distal 2 to 5 cm of the esophagus. These guidelines also suggest that the most effective pharmacotherapy is propranolol at a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, increasing to 80 mg twice daily if necessary. 9If propranolol is contraindicated or not tolerated, isosorbide mononitrate at a dosage of 20 mg twice daily is the treatment of choice. 9Studies conducted since these guidelines have titrated the dosage of propranolol based on a reduction of the pulse rate by 25 percent. 15, 16.

9 This treatment option should be performed in medical centers with particular expertise. TIPS has been shown to reduce portal hypertension and can be effective in converting patients with diuretic-resistant ascites to diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. Evidence regarding whether or not TIPS improves survival is conflicting. 3 Compared with large-volume paracentesis plus albumin, TIPS improves survival without liver transplantation in patients with refractory or recidivant ascites.
17. 18 Risk factors for early rebleeding include age older than 60 years, renal failure, large varices, and severe initial bleeding.

18 A retrospective study showed that in-hospital mortality of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding decreased from 43 percent in 1980 to 15 percent in 2000, in concurrence with an early and combined use of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies and short-term antibiotic prophylaxis.
19. 20 It is characterized by sodium and water retention in patients with renal vasoconstriction, resulting in decreased renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary output, which contribute to azotemia. 20One prospective study of 229 patients with cirrhosis and ascites who did not have azotemia found an incidence of hepatorenal syndrome of 18 percent after one year and 39 percent after five years. 21The pathogenesis of hepatorenal syndrome is not completely understood, but it is likely the result of an extreme underfilling of the arterial circulation secondary to arterial vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome: role of nitric oxide and clinical aspects [^70cb2aac]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined by oxygenation impairment due to abnormal intrapulmonary vascular dilatations in patients with liver disease. The implication of enhanced pulmonary production of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations has been demonstrated both in murine models and in human hepatopulmonary syndrome. The diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome in chronic liver disease is of paramount importance, considering the fact that severe hypoxemia related to hepatopulmonary syndrome may occur in patients with well compensated liver disease and that survival is reduced in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome relative to non hepatopulmonary syndrome patients. Priority for liver transplantation, which is presently the only cure, has been recently increased in patients with advanced hepatopulmonary syndrome.

### Inhaled nitric oxide improves the hepatopulmonary syndrome: a physiologic analysis [^bdb56e24]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined by liver dysfunction, intrapulmonary vasodilatation and abnormal oxygenation. Hypoxaemia is progressive and liver transplant is the only effective treatment. Severe hypoxaemia is a life-threatening HPS complication, particularly after transplant. We evaluated gas-exchange and haemodynamic effects of invasive therapies in a consecutive sample of 26 pre-transplant patients. Inhaled nitric oxide significantly improved partial pressure of oxygen (12.4 mm Hg; p=0.001) without deleterious effects on cardiac output. Trendelenburg positioning resulted in a small improvement, and methylene blue did not, though individual responses were variable. Future studies should prospectively evaluate these strategies in severe post-transplant hypoxaemia.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^761df0d4]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Severe hypoxemia accounts for a majority of postoperative deaths in patients with HPS undergoing LT. We reviewed existing literature to develop a systematic management algorithm for this complication, informed by best evidence and expert opinion.

This complication tends to occur early in the postoperative period (usually within 24 h of LT). It is thought to be related to postoperative pulmonary vasoconstriction resulting from an abrupt change in the vascular mediators entering the lung from the hepatic effluent 10, 22. Due to possible remodeling and impaired vasoconstriction in dilated HPS vessels, normal (nondilated) pulmonary vessels may vasoconstrict disproportionately, resulting in further increases in flow through dilated HPS vessels, and consequently, a transient worsening in the underlying diffusion‐perfusion defect and ventilation‐perfusion (VQ) mismatch of HPS 10. Accordingly, selected therapies work through a variety of mechanisms to reduce flow through these dilated vessels (Table 2). The overall goal of therapy is to: (1) mitigate early mortality; and (2) maintain oxygenation for long enough such that the expected posttransplant reversal of HPS pathology (and hypoxemia) can begin to take place. The rationale for inclusion of each treatment in the algorithm and other considerations are summarized below.

### Inhaled iloprost for hepatopulmonary syndrome: improvement of hypoxemia [^48988bfe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is characterized by advanced liver disease, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary shunting. The only reported curative option is orthotopic liver transplantation. We describe here a beneficial effect of inhaled prostacyclin including a decrease in respiratory symptoms and improved oxygenation in this clinical situation, with no approved pharmacological long-term therapy. The prostanoid iloprost, approved for pulmonary and portopulmonary hypertension, caused an increase in oxygenation, relief of dyspnea, and increased exercise tolerance in a patient suffering from liver-cirrhosis-associated hepatopulmonary syndrome. After liver transplantation, restitution of hepatopulmonary syndrome did not occur immediately. Inhaling iloprost resulted in improved physical condition and better clinical rehabilitation potential until hypoxemia finally resolved 3 months after transplantation. Therefore, iloprost could improve quality of life in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome waiting for liver transplantation and post surgery until the resolution of the hypoxemia.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome: update on pathogenesis and clinical features [^fa3bfa31]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious vascular complication of liver disease that occurs in 5-32% of patients with cirrhosis. The presence of HPS markedly increases mortality. No effective medical therapies are currently available and liver transplantation is the only established treatment option for HPS. The definition and diagnosis of HPS are established by the presence of a triad of liver disease with intrapulmonary vascular dilation that causes abnormal arterial gas exchange. Experimental biliary cirrhosis induced by common bile duct ligation in the rat reproduces the pulmonary vascular and gas exchange abnormalities of human HPS and serves as a pertinent animal model. Pulmonary microvascular dilation and angiogenesis are two central pathogenic features that drive abnormal pulmonary gas exchange in experimental HPS, and thus might underlie HPS in humans. Defining the mechanisms involved in the microvascular alterations of HPS has the potential to lead to effective medical therapies. This Review focuses on the current understanding of the pathogenesis, clinical features and management of HPS.

### Portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome [^e31e59a9]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

The clinically and pathophysiologically distinct entities of portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome occur in a substantial proportion of patients who have advanced liver disease of different causes. These disorders are notoriously underdiagnosed, but they have a substantial impact on survival and require focused treatment. Abnormal intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, the hallmark of hepatopulmonary syndrome, can cause profound hypoxaemia that can be very difficult to treat. By contrast, portopulmonary hypertension results from excessive pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling that eventually leads to right-heart failure. Insights into the pathogeneses of these syndromes have led to novel therapeutic approaches. However, in severely affected patients, effective treatment remains a difficult task. In selected patients, liver transplantation represents the only treatment option, but the decision to do isolated liver transplantation is particularly challenging in patients who have severe pulmonary disease involvement. Data from several centres have contributed to provide criteria that allow improved prediction of which patients may, or may not, benefit from liver transplantation alone.

### Pregnancy exacerbating hepatopulmonary syndrome [^938f92ff]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is an uncommon complication of liver cirrhosis. The natural history of this condition and its optimal management during pregnancy are not yet known.

Case

We present the case of a 35-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis who developed severe dyspnea in the 25th week of gestation and was diagnosed as suffering from hepatopulmonary syndrome. She was managed conservatively until 35 weeks of gestation, when she was delivered by cesarean.

Conclusion

The natural history, in this case, indicates that pregnancy may induce hepatopulmonary syndrome in an otherwise asymptomatic cirrhotic patient. Oxygen supplementation was the cornerstone of treatment and resulted in a favorable outcome.

### Pulmonary vascular complications of liver disease [^28770030]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are two pulmonary vascular complications of liver disease. The pathophysiology underlying each disorder is distinct, but patients with either condition may be limited by dyspnea. A careful evaluation of concomitant symptoms, the physical examination, pulmonary function testing and arterial blood gas analysis, and echocardiographic, imaging, and hemodynamic studies is crucial to establishing (and distinguishing) these diagnoses. Our understanding of the pathobiology, natural history, and treatment of these disorders has advanced considerably over the past decade; however, the presence of either still increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with underlying liver disease. There is no effective medical treatment for hepatopulmonary syndrome. Although liver transplantation can resolve hepatopulmonary syndrome, there appears to be worse survival even with transplantation. Liver transplantation poses a very high risk of death in those with significant portopulmonary hypertension, where targeted medical therapies may improve functional status and allow successful transplantation in a small number of select patients.

### Balancing the risks and benefits of oxygen therapy in critically III adults [^4d0eaefb]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Oxygen therapy is an integral part of the treatment of critically ill patients. Maintenance of adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs often requires the administration of supplemental oxygen, sometimes at high concentrations. Although oxygen therapy is lifesaving, it may be associated with deleterious effects when administered for prolonged periods at high concentrations. Here, we review the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular responses to hypoxia and high levels of oxygen and review the current guidelines for oxygen therapy in critically ill patients.

Methods and Materials

Literature search

We searched MEDLINE (from inception to October 20, 2014) for English language studies involving human subjects with “hepatopulmonary syndrome” as a medical subject heading or keyword. We supplemented this with a manual search of reference lists from all retrieved articles and by consulting experts in the field. We included studies which described outcomes of strategies expected to rapidly (<72 h) reverse hypoxemia either posttransplant, or in a nontransplant context which could be applied posttransplant (in patients with HPS). Two reviewers (DN, SG) screened all abstracts and categorized them as definitely, possibly, or definitely not meeting inclusion criteria. We retrieved and reviewed full manuscripts for abstracts categorized as definitely or possibly meeting inclusion criteria by one or both reviewers, review articles, and reports of LT outcomes in HPS (adults and children).

Algorithm development

The treatment algorithm was developed iteratively by a multidisciplinary team from two quaternary care LT centers (the University Health Network, University of Toronto and Hôpital St‐Luc, Université de Montréal). Evidence suggests that protocol‐driven care can improve ICU care‐related outcomes 14, and that early involvement of multidisciplinary teams in the protocol development can foster a sense of ownership, autonomy, and increased adherence 15. Accordingly, we involved all relevant multidisciplinary stakeholders in the iterative development and approval of the algorithm. The team included five ICU physicians, one respirologist with an interest in HPS, two transplant hepatologists, and one ICU respiratory therapist. The algorithm was further reviewed and modified based on suggestions from ICU, transplant hepatology, liver transplant surgery, respiratory therapy, nursing, and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) team members.

We determined which treatments to include in the algorithm and their recommended sequence of use based on their relative likelihood of success, invasiveness, and risk, based on available evidence from our literature search. Where evidence was not available, we relied on common sense and our practical experience in using these strategies at our specialized HPS center, where reported mortality from this complication was 28.6%, versus 75% in other reports 10.

Rationale and Considerations for Included Therapies

Trendelenburg positioning

Dilated vessels are predominantly found at lung bases in HPS 23, and Trendelenburg positioning (−10°) aims to redistribute blood flow away from these basilar lung units. This was effective not only in HPS 13, but also in non‐HPS patients with orthodeoxia 24. Due to the increased risk of aspiration in Trendelenburg position, we recommend advance placement of a post‐pyloric feeding tube at the time of LT. Port suction for gastric decompression and a cuffed endotracheal tube may further mitigate this risk.

Inhaled nitric oxide

Nitric oxide has been theorized to be the primary vasodilator responsible for HPS 25. However, paradoxically, due to the regional nature of these dilatations 23, administration of exogenous iNO appears to have a beneficial effect in HPS. This was the most widely reported agent used for severe posttransplant hypoxemia, and the vast majority of reports noted a beneficial effect (Table 1). Inhaled NO likely acts by mitigating the postoperative pulmonary vasoconstriction of normal vessels described above. In addition, by preferentially vasodilating normal vessels in the mid and upper portions of the lung, it may effectively divert pulmonary blood flow away from the dilated basilar vessels which are responsible for hypoxemia. The reason for preferential dilatation of mid and upper zone vessels is two‐fold. Firstly, some of the pathologically dilated basilar vessels may already be maximally dilated through remodelling 26, and therefore not susceptible to any further vasodilatation by NO. Secondly, the inhaled route preferentially distributes the NO to the areas of the lung that are already well ventilated. Given that micro‐atelectasis with impaired ventilation is more prominent at lung bases 27, and that impaired hypoxic vasoconstriction has been well described in HPS 28, 29, 30, avoidance of poorly ventilated areas prevents any further dilatation of HPS vessels that are already relatively over‐dilated due to impaired hypoxic vasoconstriction. It is considered to be safe and highly selective for the pulmonary circulation, with no adverse effects, including no effect on systemic hemodynamics at doses that we have recommended 31, and rapid reversibility (111–130 millisecond half‐life) 32.

Inhaled epoprostenol

Inhaled epoprostenol likely acts through a mechanism similar to that of iNO 33, and is similarly fast‐ and short‐acting, with a half life of approximately 5 min 34. Although clinical experience with inhaled epoprostenol in HPS is limited (Table 1), it was used successfully in all four reported HPS patients posttransplant. Inhaled therapy is selective for the pulmonary circulation and has minimal adverse effects 35.

Intravenous methylene blue

Methylene blue is a potent vasoconstrictor which acts through inhibition of the cyclic GMP pathway. As noted, in cirrhosis, impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with corresponding VQ mismatch is likely most prevalent at lung bases 30, where the majority of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations (IPVDs) are found 23, and where micro‐atelectasis with resulting regional ventilation impairment is also more prominent 27. Methylene blue may induce vasoconstriction of these dilated basilar pulmonary arterioles 36 (non‐remodeled vessels may still be capable of vasoconstriction), thereby improving VQ matching. Although this vasoconstriction may also affect normal pulmonary vessels, dilated basilar pulmonary arterioles receive a higher proportion of pulmonary blood flow and therefore a higher total MB dose. Given its IV administration, we recommend that the patient be switched to a reverse Trendelenberg position to further favor basilar delivery by gravity. Given its systemic vasoconstrictive effects and corresponding possible reductions in cardiac output, hemodynamic monitoring is required to ensure that any drop in cardiac output is sufficiently offset by an improvement in oxygen saturation, for a net increase in tissue oxygen delivery.

Although gas exchange improved in seven patients with HPS given MB in a controlled, nontransplant setting, another case report noted a (reversible) deterioration in gas exchange with MB, and posttransplant experience is limited to a single (successful) use (Table 1). This inter‐patient variability in responsiveness to MB may be related to the relative contributions of reduced vascular tone and vascular remodeling in each patient's HPS pathophysiology 26. Specifically, patients with pulmonary vascular remodeling may be less likely to respond to agents attempting to increase vascular tone, given frank morphologic vascular enlargement as opposed to an imbalance of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors affecting vessel size 26.

Although little is known about the effects of large cumulative doses of MB, case reports suggest that the therapy is safe and effective at the doses that we have recommended. The drug was also shown to be safe post‐LT, where it has been used for its potential anti‐inflammatory effects 37.

Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS)—definition, prevalence, diagnostic confirmation, and severity: Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a condition in which intrapulmonary vascular dilations (IPVD) develop in the setting of portal systemic shunting and is present in 4 to 29% chronic liver disease patients of all ages. The diagnosis of HPS in children is confirmed by the presence of hypoxia and one of the following demonstrating the presence of IPVD: contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography; technetium-labeled macro-aggregated albumin lung perfusion scan demonstrating a shunt fraction of >6%; or cardiac catheterization demonstrating IPVD. Severe shunting of >20%, as determined by macro-aggregated albumin scan, is associated with increased posttransplantation morbidity and mortality in adults, and in adults with severe HPS (paO2 <50 mmHg) the median survival in the absence of LT is less than 12 months. Patients with HPS may benefit from supplemental oxygen during periods of increased physical activity, LT is appropriate for the treatment of HPS in children with cirrhotic liver disease and may be appropriate in some noncirrhotic patients with HPS, and alternative nontransplant approaches can include ligation of the shunt or endovascular occlusion by an interventional radiologist.

Treatment of hepatopulmonary syndrome

The medical options in the case of severe HPS-related hypoxaemia are limited. Patients with severe hypoxaemia at rest should receive continuous long-term low-flow oxygen therapy. The benefit provided by Trendelenbourg positioning, insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, embolisation or pharmacological treatments, including inhaled nitric oxide and nitric oxide inhibitors, have been reported but never confirmed in larger studies. Several studies have demonstrated that HPS-induced severe hypoxaemia can reverse after OLT. According to the 2004 European Respiratory Society recommendations, the indication of OLT is firm if PaO 2 is between 50 and 60 mmHg but is discussed on an individual basis if PaO 2 is below 50 mmHg. In our patient, hypervascularization within lower lobes was not anymore visible on lung CT performed 20 days after OLT, suggesting partial regression of HPS. Three months after OLT, the patient was definitively weaned from nasal O 2, suggesting total reversal of HPS in a delay similar to what has been previously reported.

Introduction

The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined as a triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, and abnormal gas exchange, and is found in 10–32% of patients with cirrhosis 1, 2, 3, 4. This disease is associated with progressive hypoxemia and a high mortality 3, 5. Although liver transplantation (LT) is curative in HPS, these patients have an elevated postoperative complication rate 6, 7, 8, 9. In particular, “severe posttransplant hypoxemia,” defined as a need for 100% inspired oxygen (FiO 2) to maintain a saturation of ≥85% (out of proportion to any other concurrent lung process) 10, has been identified as a major complication leading to prolonged ICU stay and death in this population 6, 9, 10, 11, 12. Although survivors have a complete normalization of gas exchange over time, severe posttransplant hypoxemia occurs in 6–21% of HPS patients, carries a mortality of 45%, and accounts for the majority of peri‐operative deaths in this population 10. A variety of strategies to attempt to manage this complication have been described in the literature, but these have never been reviewed and summarized and are used inconsistently, which has led to calls for a systematic approach 6, 9, 10, 13. We sought to review available evidence in order to develop a practical clinical management algorithm for severe posttransplant hypoxemia in HPS.

Combined intravenous MB and inhaled vasodilators

Although there are only two reports of use of MB in conjunction with inhaled vasodilators in HPS, we included this strategy due to its low risk (given that inhaled vasodilators are rapidly reversible) and the hypothesized synergistic effect of these therapies. As noted, inhaled vasodilators preferentially vasodilate vessels in regions with good ventilation, as they have limited access to poorly ventilated areas. With MB, we seek to preferentially induce vasoconstriction in these poorly ventilated areas, where HPS vessels are inappropriately dilated due to impaired hypoxic vasoconstriction. When used in combination, inhaled vasodilators may also mitigate any possible vasoconstrictive effect of MB on pulmonary vessels in well ventilated areas, and thereby maximize the desired heterogeneity of its vasoconstrictive effect. The goal of this strategy is to redistribute blood flow away from inappropriately dilated HPS vessels. Since inhaled epoprostenol mediates vasodilatation through cyclic AMP rather than cyclic GMP, it is less susceptible to blockade by MB, and may thus be superior to iNO in achieving this effect.

Embolization of lower lobar pulmonary vessels

Embolotherapy of diffuse IPVDs has been shown to improve oxygenation in HPS, likely also through a mechanism of pulmonary blood flow redistribution 38, 39, 40, 41. This is further supported by a large series reporting similar improvements in patients with the diffuse form of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, in which patients have diffuse, basilar‐predominant IPVDs which are morphologically similar to those seen in HPS 42. However, given the lack of a reliable way to predict a response, and the risks of transporting a severely hypoxemic patient to a fluoroscopic procedure suite, embolization has been included in the algorithm as a “last resort” approach, and access may be limited to specialized centers.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^5b72cff2]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Dyspnea in cirrhosis—palliative management emphasizes assessment, nonpharmacologic measures first, and cautious pharmacologic use aligned with patient goals. General principles state dyspnea should be approached by first assessing and addressing underlying causes, balanced with patient preferences; disease-directed therapies may be used as appropriate, and procedural options include paracentesis, thoracentesis, and TIPS. Indwelling abdominal drains may be used in some cases to address volume-related dyspnea when goals are comfort focused and have been associated with improved quality of life. Nonpharmacological treatments include supplemental oxygen (even in the absence of hypoxia) or a bedside fan, and self-care practices like relaxation, meditation, and guided imagery may decrease dyspnea. The mainstays of pharmacological management at the end of life are low-dose opioids and benzodiazepines; opioids or benzodiazepines should be used with caution, with careful discussion of risks and benefits, and because morphine is relatively contraindicated in advanced cirrhosis, clinicians should first consider hydromorphone or oxycodone. Guidance statements specify that patients should routinely be assessed for dyspnea and its impact on patient quality of life, function, and caregivers; nonpharmacological therapies should be used when possible (fan, supplemental oxygen, mindfulness); and pharmacological interventions may include opioids and anxiolytics with careful consideration of risks, goals, and prognosis.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^0bd97823]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Other Considerations

We recommend advance involvement of the surgical anesthesia team, as anaesthetic induction alone also worsens hypoxemia in patients with HPS 50, and use of the algorithm may be considered intra‐operatively. Hemodynamic monitoring aids may facilitate optimal use of the algorithm. Given that, by definition, patients in the algorithm have a saturation <85%, a high hemoglobin target can also help to preserve tissue oxygen delivery 9. Furthermore, impaired tissue oxygen delivery results in reduced mixed venous oxygen saturation, which may have a disproportionate effect on arterial hypoxemia in the presence of intrapulmonary shunting. Finally, allograft function requires particularly close monitoring in these patients. Although patients with HPS generally demonstrate good allograft function even in the context of severe posttransplant hypoxemia 10, 46, there is a theoretical risk that prolonged posttransplant hypoxemia will adversely impact allograft function. This could then delay the reversal of pulmonary vascular abnormalities, resulting in a vicious cycle of severe hypoxemia and poor allograft function. Along these lines, “extended‐criteria” allografts have been associated with increased graft dysfunction 51, and their use must be considered judiciously, on a case‐by‐case basis in HPS patients at high risk of developing severe posttransplant hypoxemia. However, given that the risk of severe posttransplant hypoxemia increases with the severity of baseline hypoxemia 10, and that hypoxemia is rapidly progressive in HPS 7, 9, this risk must be weighed against the benefit of reduced transplant wait times afforded by use of extended‐criteria organs. This is an area that requires further research.

### Coil embolization of pulmonary arteries as a palliative treatment of diffuse type I hepatopulmonary syndrome [^98c97457]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is a serious complication of liver disease. Type I hepatopulmonary syndrome is associated with diffuse dilatation of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to severe hypoxemia. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for this condition. There are limited options for those who are not candidates for liver transplantation. We present the case of a patient who presented with severe hypoxemia requiring FIO2 of 0.95 with PaO2 of 59 mm Hg. Workup revealed 33% intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt. A pulmonary angiogram showed diffuse dilatation of the pulmonary arteries, especially in the lower lobes. The patient was diagnosed with type I hepatopulmonary syndrome. He was not a candidate for liver transplantation. The patient underwent sequential coil embolizations of the lower lobe pulmonary arteries. He was discharged home on 2 L of supplemental oxygen. This case demonstrates that coil embolization of dilated pulmonary arteries is a potential palliative treatment for patients with diffuse type I hepatopulmonary syndrome.

### International Liver Transplantation Society practice guideline update on portopulmonary hypertension [^4e1170bb]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Portopulmonary hypertension (POPH), pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) that develops in the setting of portal hypertension, has long been of significant interest to the pulmonary, cardiology and hepatology communities. Optimal management of POPH has been challenging to define due to lack of evidence from clinical trials regarding PAH therapies and uncertainty regarding the role of liver transplantation (LT). Initially, the high risk of intraoperative and early post-transplant death in predominantly untreated patients with POPH tempered consideration of LT. More recently, the observation that POPH can improve, and sometimes even resolve, following LT, has led to reconsideration of the role of LT in selected patients. The first International Liver Transplantation Society (ILTS) POPH and hepatopulmonary syndrome practice guideline was a multidisciplinary consensus of expert opinions based on available evidence. Since that publication, hemodynamic definitions, management approaches and POPH Model for End Stage Liver Disease exception criteria have evolved and there have been new randomized controlled trials in POPH as well as studies regarding long-term outcomes. In order to ensure the guidelines remained current and reflected recent evidence, the original writing committee of the 2016 guidelines, leaders of the ILTS Cardiovascular Special Interest Group and colleagues active in POPH research were invited to participate in the writing committee. In this document, approved for publication by the ILTS executive council, we provide an update to the prior guidelines with expert recommendations to guide and advance POPH management. Recommendations in these guidelines are based on expert opinion and available evidence and were agreed upon by consensus.

### Mechanisms of pulmonary vascular complications of liver disease: hepatopulmonary syndrome [^ba03a2c9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary vascular abnormalities occurring in the setting of liver disease have been increasingly recognized as important clinical entities that influence survival and liver transplant candidacy in affected patients. The most common such abnormality, the hepatopulmonary syndrome, is found in 15% to 20% of patients with cirrhosis. These disorders have no effective medical therapies. Experimental models of hepatopulmonary syndrome have identified a sequence of hepatic and pulmonary endothelial alterations that lead to nitric oxide and carbon monoxide-mediated intrapulmonary vasodilatation. A key role for shear stress-mediated pulmonary endothelial endothelin B receptor overexpression and cholangiocyte ET-1 production and release has emerged as a mechanism for local nitric oxide production in the lung. How these alterations are influenced by bacterial translocation and the systemic hyperdynamic circulatory state and whether similar changes occur in human disease are areas of ongoing investigation.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^4b911e95]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The role of MELD exception points in reducing the incidence of this complication also deserves mention. Although select, highly specialized centers have demonstrated good posttransplant outcomes in very severely hypoxemic patients with HPS 9, 52, in addition to the increased risk of posttransplant hypoxemia 10, studies have demonstrated increased overall posttransplant mortality in patients with a pretransplant PaO 2 ≤50 mmHg 7, 11, 53. These data, along with the expected decline in PaO 2 of 5.2–13.5 mmHg per year in patients with HPS 7, 9 coupled with expected delays to transplantation, form the basis for the UNOS MELD exception threshold of PaO 2 <60 mmHg in HPS. In centers with transplant waiting times that routinely result in a drop in PaO 2 to ≤50 mmHg by the time of transplant in these patients (despite allocation of MELD exception points), even more aggressive prioritization approaches may be required to reduce the incidence of this complication. Future studies should also address whether the length of time from MELD exception to transplant is independently associated with posttransplant outcomes.

### An unusual cause of refractory hypoxemia in cirrhosis [^d23234ea]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities and refractory hypoxemia cause myriad difficulties in patients with chronic liver disease. In addition to intrinsic cardiopulmonary diseases and hepatopulmonary syndrome, some unusual pathophysiological mechanisms in patients with portosystemic collaterals might contribute to hypoxemia. We report the clinical presentation of an unusual portosystemic anatomic shunt that permits venous admixture with oxygenated blood, causing hypoxemia that is refractory to the administration of supplemental oxygen, and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. There has been no such report in the published literature. This case highlights the importance of keeping direct portopulmonary venous anastomosis in the differential diagnosis of oxygen-refractory hypoxemia and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis in the appropriate clinical context.

### Supplemental oxygen needs during sleep. who benefits? [^662b415f]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

The physiologic changes that occur in ventilation during sleep contribute to nocturnal oxygen desaturation in those with lung disease. Nocturnal supplemental oxygen is often used as therapy, although convincing data exist only for those who are hypoxemic both during sleep and wake. Ongoing trials may help address whether oxygen should be used in those with only desaturation during sleep. If used, oxygen should be dosed as needed, and patients should be monitored for hypercapnia. Because of its prevalence, obstructive sleep apnea may commonly overlap with lung disease in many patients and have important consequences. Patients with overlap syndromes may be good candidates for noninvasive ventilation during sleep.

The hepato-pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a relatively common complication of hepatic disease that leads to hypoxaemia and dyspnoea secondary to pulmonary shunting. A number of pharmacological therapies have been trialled, yet liver transplantation remains the only definitive treatment. The use of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to reduce portal hypertension and improve oxygenation remains controversial in HPS due to the lack of large clinical series or randomised controlled trials. We present a case of HPS successfully treated with TIPS and review the relevant literature.

### Pulmonary manifestations of chronic liver disease: a comprehensive review [^c16ee344]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and porto-pulmonary hypertension (PoPH) represent relatively common pulmonary vascular complications of advanced liver disease. Despite distinct differences in their pathogenetic background, both clinical states are characterized by impaired arterial oxygenation and limited functional status, and are associated with increased pre-transplantation mortality. Accumulation of ascitic fluid in the pleural cavity, known as hepatic hydrothorax (HH), is another frequent manifestation of decompensated cirrhosis, which may cause severe respiratory dysfunction, depending on the volume of the effusion, the rapidity of its development and its resistance to therapeutic measures. Orthotopic liver transplantation constitutes the only effective treatment able to resolve the pulmonary complications of liver disease. A prioritization policy for liver transplantation has evolved over the past years regarding advanced stages of HPS, yielding favorable outcomes regarding post-transplantation survival and HPS resolution. In contrast, severe PoPH is associated with poor post-transplantation survival. Hence, liver transplantation is recommended only for patients with PoPH and an acceptable reduction in pulmonary pressure values, after receiving PoPH-targeted vasodilating therapy. This review focuses on basic pathogenetic and diagnostic principles and discusses the current therapeutic approaches regarding HPS, PoPH, and HH.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^23d7a98e]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in liver transplantation (LT) candidates—screening, evaluation, and MELD exception policy are detailed as follows: Current Organ Procurement Transplant Network/UNOS policy assigns a MELD exception score of 22 for patients with portal hypertension, intrapulmonary shunting, and a room air PaO2 <60 mmHg, with a 10% mortality equivalent increase in points every 3 months if the PaO2 remains <60 mmHg. Screening of LT candidates by pulse oximetry is indicated to detect HPS patients with a PaO2 <70 mmHg, using a threshold value of SpO2 <96% at sea level to trigger complete evaluation, and preoperative evaluation should include room air arterial blood gas, transthoracic contrast echocardiography, and exclusion of alternate causes by chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, and chest computed tomography. Arterial response to administration of 100% oxygen may be used to gauge perioperative oxygenation ability but does not appear to influence outcome, and the guideline states that the presence of severe HPS is associated with increased mortality and affected individuals should undergo expedited LT evaluation (1-B).

Mechanical circulatory and pulmonary support, lung transplantation with concomitant repair of anatomic cardiovascular defects, and heart—lung transplantation have all been applied in patients with ACHD with Eisenmenger syndrome with deteriorating functional ability, but indications for such therapies are not standardized; comparative outcomes have not been tested, and to date successes have been limited.

### Deleterious effect of nitric oxide inhibition in chronic hepatopulmonary syndrome [^382c66d7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

On the basis of limited experimental and clinical studies, increased activity of the vasodilatory nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatopulmonary syndrome. We report a 46-year-old woman with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis and progressive dyspnoea for 12 months. Investigations revealed elevated circulating concentrations of nitric oxide metabolites and exhaled nitric oxide levels, an hyperdynamic circulation with low systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure, a large right to left intrapulmonary shunt fraction on radiolabelled macroaggregated albumin perfusion scanning, positive contrast-enhanced echocardiography, reduced diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide, hypoxaemia and orthodeoxyia, all in keeping with severe hepatopulmonary syndrome. Sequential inhibition of the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway using curcumin (diferuloylmethane), terlipressin and methylene blue was associated with substantial improvements in vascular tone and the hyperdynamic circulation. No improvement, however, in the intrapulmonary shunt was demonstrated. Both hypoxaemia and orthodeoxia were substantially, reproducibly and reversibly worsened with all three treatments. Our findings argue against the contention that intrapulmonary shunting and impairment in arterial oxygenation in hepatopulmonary syndrome are necessarily the consequence of on-going, nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-mediated vasodilatation, at least in the chronic stage, and, given the possibility of substantial worsening of pulmonary oxygen exchange, suggest that inhibition of the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway should be avoided in this setting.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to liver transplantation for acute respiratory distress syndrome-induced life-threatening hypoxaemia aggravated by hepatopulmonary syndrome [^24fd4a93]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has the capacity to support gas exchange as well as haemodynamics and is, therefore, a rescue therapeutic option for life-threatening respiratory and/or cardiac failure. ECMO has been tested in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and before and after lung transplantation. Another potential use of ECMO could be the management of life-threatening hypoxaemia in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), selected for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). HPS, a liver-induced vascular lung disorder, is characterized by diffuse or localized dilated pulmonary capillaries and, less commonly, pleural and pulmonary arteriovenous communications coexisting with normal alveolar ventilation. Hypoxaemia is usually responsive to oxygen therapy, but OLT appears as the only successful treatment. However, in the most severe forms of HPS (PaO 2 < 50 mmHg on room air), OLT is associated with increased respiratory morbidity/mortality due to frequent post-operative worsening of hypoxaemia. One case of successful use of ECMO in the management of life-threatening hypoxaemia following OLT for HPS has been reported but there are no data concerning its use in the pre-operative management.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of hepatopulmonary syndrome, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain macroaggregated albumin scan as a complementary tool to quantify the degree of shunting in patients with severe hypoxemia and coexistent intrinsic lung disease or to assess the prognosis in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome and very severe hypoxemia (PaO2 < 50 mmHg). Recognize that neither contrast echocardiography nor macroaggregated albumin scan can definitively differentiate discrete arteriovenous communications from diffuse precapillary and capillary dilatations or cardiac shunts.

### Bubble trouble in COVID-19 [^efe7555d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This study describes a high prevalence of intrapulmonary vasodilatation (or intracardiac shunting) in patients with COVID-19 that leads to detection of microbubbles in the cerebral circulation. Could this finding provide therapeutic insight into the management of COVID-19 pneumonia and associated hypoxemia? Archer and colleagues hypothesized that hypoxemia in COVID-19 is due to impaired hypoxic vasoconstriction and have suggested trials of medications that promote hypoxic vasoconstriction, such as almitrine, or medications that inhibit endogenous vasodilator pathways, such as indomethacin or methylene blue. These medications could potentially counteract hypoxemia related to intrapulmonary vasodilatation and impaired hypoxic vasoconstriction but have not yet been studied in COVID-19 pneumonia.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), a pulmonary complication of liver disease, is characterized by intrapulmonary vasodilatation and impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with resultant hypoxemia. Interestingly, despite severe hypoxemia in HPS due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, the response to 100% inspired oxygen can sometimes result in remarkably high Pa O 2 values (500–600 mm Hg), no doubt reflecting the lack of associated alveolar damage as seen in ARDS or COVID-19 pneumonia. There are no approved medical therapies for HPS, but prior studies could potentially provide insight into novel therapeutic options for COVID-19. In HPS, medications that target hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, such as almitrine, have been studied without consistent benefit. Other therapies, such as methylene blue, garlic, and inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, such as inhaled nitric oxide, have been associated with improved oxygenation in small studies or case series of patients with HPS. Inhaled nitric oxide is postulated to improve oxygenation in HPS by redistribution of pulmonary blood flow and improved/Q matching and is actively being studied as a treatment for COVID-19.

### Coexisting hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension: implications for liver transplantation [^3786cb25]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) represent pulmonary complications of liver disease and portal hypertension. The underlying pathophysiology behind these entities is complex and involves different effects of vasoactive substances on the pulmonary vasculature, among them endothelin-1 and nitric oxide (NO). Hepatopulmonary syndrome results from vasodilation, intrapulmonary shunting, and hypoxia. In contrast, portopulmonary hypertension is predominantly owing to generalized vasoconstriction that leads to remodeling and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, but is rarely associated with hypoxia. We present a case report in which these 2 processes with opposing pathologic mechanisms coexist in the same patient. We also conducted a literature search to identify other documented cases of coexisting hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension, common clinical features of these patients, and outcomes with or without treatment. Our case highlights the importance of recognizing the coexistence of these 2 disease processes, as they may occur simultaneously and affect the approach to treatment, including liver transplantation.

### Pilot study of pentoxifylline in hepatopulmonary syndrome [^33979b23]. Liver Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) results when chronic liver disease or portal hypertension causes intrapulmonary microvascular dilatation with hypoxemia. In experimental HPS, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) overproduction contributes to vasodilatation, which is improved by pentoxifylline, a TNF-alpha inhibitor. The effectiveness of pentoxifylline in humans is unknown. The aim of this open-label, single-arm clinical trial was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of pentoxifylline in patients with cirrhosis and advanced HPS undergoing liver transplantation evaluation. Nine adults with cirrhosis and moderate to severe HPS were enrolled. All patients had an initial 2-week titration to a target dose of pentoxifylline of 400 mg by mouth every 8 hours, which was continued for 6 weeks. Baseline and follow-up arterial blood gases and TNF-alpha levels were evaluated. Adverse effects and tolerability were assessed. The 9 patients had a mean age of 55 +/- 10 years, and 67% were female. The most common causes of cirrhosis were hepatitis C virus and alcohol (55%). The mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 11 (range, 6-19), and patients had advanced hypoxemia [mean partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) = 54 +/- 12 mm Hg, mean alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a PaO(2)) = 57 +/- 15 mm Hg]. Of the 9 patients enrolled, follow-up blood gases were done in 7. There was no significant change in PaO(2) (P = 0.3) or A-a PaO(2) (P = 0.3) with treatment. Pentoxifylline was poorly tolerated. Nausea (100%) and vomiting (56%) were the predominant side effects, and only a single patient was able to complete full-dose therapy. Treatment with pentoxifylline did not improve arterial oxygenation in advanced HPS, and tolerance was limited by gastrointestinal toxicity.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to liver transplantation for acute respiratory distress syndrome-induced life-threatening hypoxaemia aggravated by hepatopulmonary syndrome [^43577782]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Combined with massive lung aeration loss resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome, a liver-induced vascular lung disorder characterized by diffuse or localized dilated pulmonary capillaries, may induce hypoxaemia and death in patients with end-stage liver disease.

Methods

The case of such a patient presenting with both disorders and in whom an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used is described.

Results

A 51-year-old man with a five-year history of alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted for acute respiratory failure, platypnoea and severe hypoxaemia requiring emergency tracheal intubation. Following mechanical ventilation, hypoxaemia remained refractory to positive end-expiratory pressure, 100% of inspired oxygen and inhaled nitric oxide. Two-dimensional contrast-enhanced (agitated saline) transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a massive right-to-left extracardiac shunt, without patent foramen ovale. Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the thorax using quantitative analysis and colour encoding system established the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome aggravated by hepatopulmonary syndrome. According to the severity of the respiratory condition, a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was implemented and the patient was listed for emergency liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed at Day 13. At the end of the surgical procedure, the improvement in oxygenation allowed removal of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Day 5). The patient was discharged from hospital at Day 48. Three months after hospital discharge, the patient recovered a correct physical autonomy status without supplemental O2.

Conclusions

In a cirrhotic patient, acute respiratory distress syndrome was aggravated by hepatopulmonary syndrome causing life-threatening hypoxaemia not controlled by standard supportive measures. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, by controlling gas exchange, allowed the performing of a successful liver transplantation and final recovery.

### Effects of nebulized N (G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome [^4427c722]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Enhanced pulmonary production of nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). NO inhibition with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in both animals and humans with HPS has improved arterial hypoxemia. We assessed the role of enhanced NO production in the pathobiology of arterial deoxygenation in HPS and the potential therapeutic efficacy of selective pulmonary NO inhibition. We investigated the effects of nebulized L-NAME (162.0 mg) at 30 and 120 minutes on all intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary factors governing pulmonary gas exchange in 10 patients with HPS (60 +/- 7 [SD] yr; alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, range 19-76 mm Hg; arterial oxygen tension, range 37-89 mm Hg). Nebulized L-NAME maximally decreased exhaled NO (by -55%; P < .001), mixed venous nitrite/nitrate (by -12%; P = .02), and cardiac output (by -11%; P = .002) while increased systemic vascular resistance (by 11%; P = .008) and pulmonary vascular resistance (by 25%; P = .03). In contrast, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, intrapulmonary shunt and, in turn, arterial deoxygenation remained unchanged. In conclusion, gas exchange disturbances in HPS may be related to pulmonary vascular remodeling rather than to an ongoing vasodilator effect of enhanced NO production.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome: the anaesthetic considerations [^8757c6c5]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a pulmonary complication observed in patients with chronic liver disease and/or portal hypertension, attributable to an intrapulmonary vascular dilatation that induces severe hypoxaemia. Considering the favourable long-term survival of HPS patients as well as the reversal of the syndrome with a functional liver graft, HPS is now an indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Consequently, blood gas analysis and imaging techniques should be performed when cirrhotic patients present with shortness of breath as well as when OLT candidates are placed on the transplant waiting list. If the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is more than 10.7kPa when breathing room air, HPS can be excluded and no other investigation is needed. When the PaO2 when breathing room air is 10.7kPa or less, contrast-enhanced echocardiography should be performed to exclude pulmonary vascular dilatation. Lung function tests may also help detect additional pulmonary diseases that can contribute to impaired oxygenation. When contrast-enhanced echocardiography is negative, HPS is excluded and no follow-up is needed. When contrast-enhanced echocardiography is positive and PaO2 less than 8kPa, patients should obtain a severity score that provides them with a reasonable probability of being transplanted within 3 months. In mild-to-moderate HPS (PaO2 8 to 10.6kPa), periodic follow-up is recommended every 3 months to detect any further deterioration in PaO2. Although no intraoperative deaths have been directly attributed to HPS, oxygenation may worsen immediately following OLT due to volume overload and postoperative infections. Mechanical ventilation is often prolonged with an extended stay in the ICU. A high postoperative mortality (mostly within 6 months) is observed in this group of patients in comparison to non-HPS patients. However, the recovery of an adequate PaO2 within 12 months after OLT explains the similar outcome of HPS and non-HPS patients following OLT over a longer time period.

Supplemental oxygen at altitude and during air travel—patients with borderline oxygen saturations at sea level may require 3–4 L per minute of supplemental oxygen at high altitude or while traveling on commercial aircraft, and those already using supplemental oxygen at sea level should increase their oxygen flow rate under these conditions.
