## Question

If a patient has concerns because she scored very well on the MoCA exam and thinks this is because she is very educated how do I respond

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to respond when a highly educated patient worries that her high MoCA score might mask early cognitive impairment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the MoCA's known education bias and ceiling effects. Then, I should verify how to interpret a high score in the context of high premorbid ability. Next, I will consider what additional tools and norms can mitigate education effects. After that, I need to outline a practical, stepwise plan that includes informant input, functional assessment, and when to refer for neuropsychological testing. Finally, I should address prognosis, risk reduction, and how to communicate uncertainty while aligning with guideline-based care [^117Pu3XY] [^115V54en].

> Let me first confirm the core issue: the MoCA has documented education bias, particularly in those with fewer than 12 years of schooling, and it can show a ceiling effect in highly educated individuals, meaning a high score may not fully exclude subtle deficits that are disproportionate to the person's baseline ability [^111GSVxo].

> Wait, let me verify the implication for someone with high education. Because MoCA was designed to detect mild cognitive impairment and may be less sensitive in people with strong premorbid abilities, a high score in a highly educated patient could reflect preserved performance on screening items while still missing early, domain-specific decline; this is why psychologists are advised to estimate premorbid functioning and contextualize current performance against that baseline when interpreting results [^113rd7XN] [^1136AwhD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how to interpret her score. I need to check whether the score was adjusted for education and whether the norms used match her demographic background; if not, I should explain that a high raw score may undercall impairment in someone with high premorbid ability and that interpretation should be anchored to her educational and occupational history, ideally with collateral information and, when available, tests that estimate premorbid functioning such as word-reading measures [^113rd7XN] [^114ZVivG].

> Next, I should review which tools can reduce education bias and better detect subtle deficits. Let me consider alternatives with less education bias, such as the Mini-Cog and RUDAS, and the GPCOG, which includes an informant component; I should also confirm that adding an informant tool like AD8 or IQCODE can surface real-world changes that patients themselves may not notice or report reliably [^111GSVxo] [^11387NTw].

> I will now examine a stepwise plan. First, I should double-check for subjective cognitive complaints and ask for a knowledgeable informant to complete a brief tool such as AD8 or the informant portion of GPCOG; second, I should assess instrumental activities of daily living with a tool like the FAQ to see if there is functional impact; third, if concerns persist or if the informant or functional screen is positive, I should refer for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation that uses demographically appropriate norms and can profile strengths and weaknesses across domains [^11387NTw] [^113QAhq3].

> But wait, what if the patient has no informant available? I need to ensure I still screen for functional decline using patient-reported tools and consider repeating a complementary brief screen such as Mini-Cog or RUDAS to cross-check MoCA results; if discrepancies remain, I should maintain a low threshold for referral to neuropsychology, explaining that a more detailed assessment can detect subtle deficits that brief screens miss [^111GSVxo] [^113QAhq3].

> Let me think about prognosis and next steps if subtle impairment is confirmed. I should confirm that MCI is defined by cognitive decline greater than expected for age and education with preserved daily function, and that while some individuals revert to normal, progression risk is higher in amnestic subtypes; I should also discuss modifiable risk reduction such as vascular risk control, exercise, sleep optimization, and hearing correction, and align follow-up intervals with guideline-based monitoring of cognitive capacity over time [^117Pu3XY] [^11387NTw].

> I should double-check how to communicate uncertainty. I will explain that a high MoCA score is reassuring but not definitive in highly educated individuals, that screening tools are meant to trigger further evaluation rather than to diagnose, and that our plan is to gather more context and, if indicated, pursue a comprehensive assessment that accounts for her educational background and baseline abilities; this framing aligns with USPSTF principles that screening is not diagnostic and that abnormal screens warrant further evaluation [^115V54en].

> In summary, I need to ensure the patient understands that her concern is valid: high education can blunt the sensitivity of brief screens like MoCA, so a high score does not categorically rule out early change; the safest, evidence-aligned approach is to pair screening with informant input, functional assessment, and, when appropriate, a neuropsychological evaluation that uses education-adjusted norms and estimates of premorbid ability to clarify whether her current performance truly reflects her baseline or signals a decline that warrants closer follow-up and risk modification [^111GSVxo] [^113rd7XN] [^113QAhq3].

A high MoCA score in a highly educated patient can reflect **cognitive reserve** [^113rd7XN] masking early deficits, so a strong result does not exclude subtle impairment [^115tY9cN]. Explain that the MoCA has **education bias** [^111GSVxo] and may miss mild deficits in well-educated individuals [^111GSVxo]. If concerns persist, use **education-adjusted norms** [^114ZVivG], add an informant tool (e.g. AD8) [^11387NTw], and consider a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation [^113QAhq3] to detect subtle changes. Emphasize that a high score is reassuring but not definitive, and ongoing monitoring is reasonable if symptoms or risk factors are present [^113bxdhL].

## Understanding cognitive reserve and its impact on cognitive testing

Cognitive reserve refers to the brain's resilience to damage or decline, often built through education, occupational complexity, and enriched environments [^notfound]. Highly educated individuals typically have greater cognitive reserve, allowing them to maintain **apparently normal performance** on screening tests despite early neuropathological changes. This reserve can **mask early cognitive impairment**, making standard screening tools less sensitive in this population [^111GSVxo].

---

## Limitations of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)

The MoCA is a widely used screening tool for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia, but it has **known limitations**, particularly regarding educational bias:

- **Education bias**: The MoCA has documented education bias, particularly in individuals with lower educational attainment, but it can also underdetect impairment in highly educated individuals due to cognitive reserve [^111GSVxo].

- **Ceiling effect**: Highly educated individuals may score at or near the ceiling of the MoCA, potentially obscuring subtle deficits [^notfound].

- **Limited sensitivity**: The MoCA may not detect subtle deficits in specific cognitive domains, such as executive function or processing speed, which are often affected early in highly educated individuals [^116v6AHv].

---

## Recommended clinical approach

Given these limitations, a **comprehensive clinical approach** is recommended:

- **Education-adjusted norms**: Interpret the MoCA score within the context of the patient's educational background, using education-adjusted norms when available [^114ZVivG].

- **Additional screening tools**: Consider supplementary screening tools with less education bias, such as the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) or the Mini-Cog, which are designed to minimize educational and cultural bias [^111GSVxo] [^115ZW2YW].

- **Informant-based assessments**: Incorporate informant-based tools, such as the AD8 or IQCODE, to capture subjective cognitive decline or functional impacts that may not be evident in brief cognitive tests [^11387NTw].

- **Comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation**: If concerns persist, refer the patient for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, which can provide a detailed assessment of cognitive domains and detect subtle deficits that screening tools may miss [^113QAhq3].

---

## Clinical implications and patient counseling

It is essential to **counsel patients** regarding the following:

- **Cognitive reserve**: Explain that a high MoCA score in a highly educated individual may reflect cognitive reserve rather than absence of impairment, and that subtle deficits may still be present [^113rd7XN].

- **Importance of monitoring**: Emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and follow-up, particularly if the patient reports subjective cognitive decline or if there are risk factors for cognitive impairment (e.g. family history, cardiovascular risk factors) [^113H1vKi].

- **Reassurance and support**: Provide reassurance that a high MoCA score is still a positive indicator of cognitive health, but that further evaluation may be warranted if symptoms persist or evolve [^113bVwrV].

---

## Conclusion

A high MoCA score in a highly educated patient may reflect **cognitive reserve**, potentially masking early cognitive impairment. Clinicians should interpret MoCA results within the context of educational background, consider additional screening tools, and pursue comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation if concerns persist.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^113H1vKi]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 8 — standardized psychological and neuropsychological testing states that psychologists are aware that standardized psychological and neuropsychological tests are important tools in the assessment of dementia and age-related cognitive change. The rationale notes that the use of psychometric instruments may represent the most important and unique contribution of psychologists to the assessment of dementia and cognitive change, and that psychometric assessment provides objective information necessary for diagnosis while testing provides reliable information for tracking cognitive change over time or in response to interventions. In application, psychologists select appropriate measures to address the referral question and are encouraged to use standardized instruments, ensuring appropriate tests have normative data for the age range of the person being assessed and are suitable for the individual's gender, ethnicity, culture, language, and educational background. Psychologists strive to understand the differences between cognitive screening, cognitive testing, and neuropsychological testing and to carefully evaluate if they have the requisite competency to complete each type of evaluation prior to performing cognitive evaluations. Brief mental status examinations are used to screen for dementia and other cognitive impairments and track cognitive change in individuals with more severe impairment, with examples including the Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and brief cognitive screening tools should be standardized and have good positive predictive values.

Donanemab appropriate use — age and cognitive status thresholds from trial criteria and practice guidance indicate that patients in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 were between 60 and 85 years-old at enrollment, and physician judgment should be used for treating patients outside this age range. In most cases, baseline Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores will fall in the range of 20–30, similar to the MMSE of 20–28 used for trial inclusion; the upper limit was extended to 30, and the lower limit is roughly equivalent to a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 11–13 out of 30 points.

Poststroke cognitive screening — Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) versus Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): The Mini-Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment have been the most widely studied cognitive screening instruments, with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment generally being recommended over the Mini-Mental State Examination, particularly in subacute phases after stroke, because it has less of a ceiling effect and is more sensitive to mild cognitive impairment. However, several other cognitive screens show initial evidence for their utility in identifying cognitive impairment after stroke. The choice of the best screening tool to use for a given patient will vary according to the psychometric properties of the test; demographic (age, sex, educational attainment), cultural, and language characteristics of the patient; circumstances of test administration (eg, time, bedside/clinic/telehealth); and the presence of other stroke-related impairments. Unfortunately, most screening instruments were not developed to identify the heterogeneous presentation of poststroke cognitive deficit and might miss subtle (yet impactful) poststroke cognitive changes.

Brief cognitive assessment tools — key advantages, limitations, and administration times evaluated in multiple reviews and/or for use in the VA — are detailed as follows: General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG) lists Patient 2–5 and Informant 1–3 and is "Developed for and validated in primary care" with "Little or no education bias" and "Multiple languages accessible at www.gpcog.com.au", while limitations include "Patient component scoring has an indeterminate range that requires an informant score to assess as pass or fail" and "Informant component alone has low specificity". Mini-Cog requires 2–4 and is "Developed for and validated in primary care and multiple languages/cultures", has "Little or no education/language/race bias", and "Short administration time", but "Use of different word lists may affect failure rates", "Some study results [are] based on longer tests with the Mini-Cog elements reviewed independently", and it "Does not test executive function or visuospatial skills". Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) takes 7–10, is "Most widely used and studied worldwide" and "Often used as reference for comparative evaluations of other assessments", but has "Education/age/language/culture bias", a "Ceiling effect (highly educated impaired subjects pass)", is "Proprietary — unless used from memory, test needs to be purchased at www.parinc.com", and has "Best performance for at least moderate cognitive impairment". Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) takes 10–15, is "Designed to test for mild cognitive impairment", offers "Multiple languages accessible at www.mocatest.org" and "Tests many separate domains (7)", but "Lacks studies in general practice settings", has "Education bias (< 12 years)", and "Limited use and evidence due to published data relatively new (2005)". Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment (RUDAS) lists 10, is "Designed for multicultural populations" with "Little or no education/language bias", but was "Validated in Australian community", has "Limited use and evidence due to published data relatively new (2004)", and "Does not test memory". Time and Change (T&C) is ≤ 1 with "Very brief administration time" and "Little or no education bias", but "Strong language/cultural bias".

Wilson disease (WD) — cognitive evaluation and monitoring states that cognitive evaluation utilizing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or Folstein Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) "could be repeated every 3–6 months" when abnormal to monitor treatment response, and that "a comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation can be obtained at baseline and followed over time". Specialized neurological rating scales — the "Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS)" and "Global Assessment for Wilson's Disease" — were "developed for research purposes", "help in evaluating quantitatively disease progression and response to therapy", and "Elements of the UWDRS focused on the patient's symptoms along with the MoCA and/or MMSE may help with monitoring changes in cognition objectively".

Assessment of cognitive function in atrial fibrillation (AF) clinical practice — scope and tools. Despite increasing awareness about the relationship between AF and cognitive decline, clinical guidelines for the management of AF do not specifically include assessment of cognitive function in the diagnostic work-up. Given that the highest RR of cognitive decline is in AF patients > 70 years of age, healthcare professionals who treat AF patients should be able to diagnose, and assess risk factors for cognitive impairment appropriately. Assessment of cognitive function should be multifaceted, with numerous validated tools ranging from brief screening tools which take 1–8 min to complete among elderly patients to more complex time-consuming neuropsychological batteries. Brief screening tools may be most applicable when cognitive impairment is suspected among AF patients, with the choice also determined by time with the patient, setting, language, and purpose, and in practical terms any of the brief tests could be used, although the most common is the GPCOG. In research settings, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) have been commonly used, and informant questionnaires such as the second step of GPCOG or the IQCODE provide important additive information.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^116v6AHv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Central Nervous System Cancers — assessment and management of neurocognitive dysfunction reports that up to 90% of individuals with supratentorial brain tumors experience neurocognitive dysfunction, with severity influenced by tumor- and treatment-related factors including central nervous system (CNS) tumor size, grade, and location, and that treatments for brain tumors can negatively impact cognition. In glioma, IDH1 mutation confers a more favorable cognitive prognosis at the time of initial diagnosis and after surgery, and neurocognitive impairment is a sensitive indicator of tumor progression and a predictor of overall survival in glioma; deficits impair ability to work and instrumental activities of daily living or functional independence, directly hindering QOL. Screening tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MMSE and MoCA) are described as insensitive to changes in executive function, sustained attention, and processing speed, whereas neuropsychological evaluation is the gold standard for assessment of neurocognitive function and provides patient-specific recommendations including compensatory strategies, referral for psychotherapy or neurocognitive rehabilitation, and guidance on work or school accommodations. The guideline states there is increasing evidence that physical exercise can help preserve cognitive function and that patients should be encouraged to start an exercise routine at diagnosis, and that where available neuropsychological evaluation should be performed as needed based on physician assessment to monitor for neurocognitive decline and/or recovery and to determine patient-centered treatment recommendations; health maintenance is cross-referenced to the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mild cognitive impairment, more specifically with respect to screening tools, CCCDTD 2020 guidelines recommend to use a more comprehensive psychometric screening tool, such as the Modified Mini-Mental State examination, the Mini-Mental State Examination, or the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale, when indicated and if more time is allowed. Use the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in patients with suspected MCI or in cases where there is suspicion of cognitive impairment or concern about the patient's cognitive status and the Mini-Mental State Examination score is in the "normal" range (24+ out of 30).

Cognitive screening tools after aSAH have mixed predictive value: in a small comparative study (n = 32) with good functional outcomes at 3 months, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), MiniMental Status Examination (MMSE), and neuropsychological tests were administered and the MoCA was more sensitive than the MMSE for diagnosing cognitive impairments, with higher performance on MoCA domains such as animal naming and abstraction more closely associated with returning to work; however, in a single-center study including 180 patients, MoCA at 2 to 4 weeks did not predict functional outcomes at 1 year, and in a case-control study including 288 patients with aSAH and 80 controls, severe cognitive impairment was seen in 48.7% of aSAH survivors with good functional outcomes, with authors concluding that cognitive screening should be performed in all aSAH survivors, regardless of functional outcomes.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^113E1NQF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Cognitive impairment screening in older adults with diabetes can use brief widely used tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination or Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which may be suitable but require ∼10 minutes, and currently no strong evidence supports the choice of one particular test over another; self-administered cognitive screening tools are becoming available and might offer an efficient alternative. Performing an initial assessment at the time of diabetes diagnosis or when a patient enters a care program would be appropriate, screening could then be repeated annually or less frequently depending on perceived risk, and in patients without cognitive complaints screening should be repeated 2 to 3 years after an initial normal screening test result or 1 year after a borderline normal test result, with cognitive complaints always evaluated. Thus far, no evidence supports a benefit of intensive glycemic treatment to preserve cognitive function in patients with diabetes.

Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — risk assessment for stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)/cognitive decline uses a risk factor-based approach and targeted cognitive evaluation: a risk factor-based approach is recommended for stroke risk assessment in patients with AF; cognitive assessment should be performed in AF patients where there is suspicion of cognitive impairment; assessment of cognitive function may be multifaceted, and cognitive impairment screening by available tools is just one component; risk reduction of cognitive dysfunction and its comorbidities in AF may include risk assessment for vascular disease and/or Alzheimer's disease; general health measures may reduce the concomitant risks of AF and stroke, with a putative benefit on cognitive function; in terms of prevention of cognitive impairment in AF patients, there is evidence that early and effective use of oral anticoagulation in patients with stroke risk factors reduces the rate of cognitive decline and currently, this represents the most important preventive strategy; consequently, the main risk assessment for cognitive impairment in AF patients is the assessment of stroke risk factors, preferably by use of the CHA2DS2-VASc risk scheme; when cognitive impairment is suspected, brief screening tools such as General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) may be applicable, with more comprehensive assessments after referral to a psychiatrist, geriatrician, or neurologist.

Screening tests — scope and follow-up explain that many different brief screening tests for cognitive impairment are available and generally ask patients to perform a series of tasks that assess 1 or more domains of cognitive function. These tests are not intended to diagnose MCI or dementia, and a positive screening test result should lead to additional testing that can include blood tests, radiology examinations, and a medical and neuropsychological evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of dementia and determine its subtype.

Limitations and evidence gaps for brief cognitive assessment — There are limitations to these recommendations because they are based on an assessment of recommendations from review articles and on expert opinion, not on a comprehensive new review; sensitivity and specificity will vary depending on the study population's dementia prevalence, the tool(s) used, and the cut score selected; published research on screening tools is uneven in quantity and quality, and the literature is lacking in comparative validity in low-education or illiterate populations.

How evidence fits with biological understanding — etiology variability, current therapy limits, and potential role of screening. Dementia can be the result of varied and different pathophysiologic processes with many causal mechanisms unknown; Alzheimer disease is the most common cause in the United States and the target of all current US Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs for dementia; since current medical therapies do not appear to affect its long-term course, the potential benefit of screening may be in helping patients and caregivers prepare for managing symptoms and consequences.

Workgroup review results — brief cognitive assessment tools for primary care report that of the five publications focused on primary care brief cognitive assessments, all selected the Memory Impairment Screen (MIS), and four of these publications also selected the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG) and the Mini-Cog. Attributes cited as contributing to their selection for routine primary care use are that each requires 5 minutes or less to administer, is validated in a primary care or community setting, is easily administered by medical staff members who are not physicians, has good to excellent psychometric properties, is relatively free from educational, language, and/or culture bias, and can be used in a clinical setting without payment for copyrights. The report also notes copyright and fee considerations: the MMSE was first published in 1975 and its copyright is held by Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc, which charges a fee for each use, whereas the Mini-Cog and MIS are copyrighted but allow free use by clinicians as clinical tools with distribution restrictions for other entities, and the GPCOG has similar use rules.

### Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116rKrQX]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Accuracy of cognitive screening instruments — Across 50 studies evaluating 49 instruments, dementia prevalence ranged from 1% to 47% and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prevalence from 10% to 52%, with mean participant age 68 to 95 years and education means 5 to 16 years; most instruments were very brief (administration time ≤ 5 minutes) or brief (≤ 10 minutes). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was most evaluated (30 studies), is an 11-item, 30-point instrument, and in a pooled analysis of 14 studies (n = 9719) using cutoffs of 23 or less or 24 or less had sensitivity 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.92) and specificity 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93) to detect dementia. Other instruments were evaluated in 2 to 9 studies with sensitivity and specificity to detect dementia ranging from 0.43 to 1.0 and 0.54 to 1.0, and overall test accuracy was generally higher for detecting dementia than for MCI.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^111nXA46]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment — Mild cognitive impairment represents a variety of mild cognitive syndromes with a modest but detectable decline in cognitive function without an impact on daily functional status and is conceived as a transitional state between normal aging and dementia (particularly Alzheimer's disease) in which cognitive deficits are present but function is preserved; the population meeting criteria is inherently unstable with many progressing to dementia, precise boundaries are difficult to determine, and there is no consensus on the optimal definition. The most widely accepted definition requires: 1) subjective cognitive complaints, 2) evidence of objective deficits in cognitive function based on age- and education-adjusted norms on standardized neuropsychological tests, 3) intact daily functioning, 4) evidence of cognitive decline from a prior level, and 5) evidence of not meeting the criteria for dementia; mild cognitive impairment is sometimes divided into subtypes based on the most prominent symptoms.

Alzheimer's Association Medicare Annual Wellness Visit algorithm — assessment of cognition during the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) begins at the "Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (HCPCS codes G0438 or G0439)" by reviewing the health risk assessment (HRA) and querying the patient and informant; if "Signs/symptoms of cognitive impairment present" or if "Informant available to confirm", clinicians should "Conduct brief structured assessment". Patient tools are "GPCOG or Mini-Cog or MIS", and informant tools are "AD8 or GPCOG or Short IQCODE" (short Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly). Concern thresholds are stated as "Patient: GPCOG < 5 (5–8 score is indeterminate without informant) or Mini-Cog ≤ 3 or MIS ≤ 4" and for informants "AD8 ≥ 2 or GPCOG informant score ≤ 3 with patient score < 8 or Short IQCODE ≥ 3.38". If concerns are triggered, proceed to "Refer for full dementia evaluation or Conduct full dementia evaluation", with same‑day billing permitted "with CPT codes 99201–99215"; if no concerns and no informant, "Follow-up during subsequent AWV". The figure emphasizes that "No one tool is recognized as the best… ", and that alternate tools such as "MMSE, SLUMS, or MoCA" may be used at clinician discretion, with some providers using multiple brief tools before referral.

Potential barriers to effective heart failure (HF) self-care — example screening tools and interventions: Medical barriers include cognitive impairment screened with Mini-Cog, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with interventions such as home health aide, home meal deliveries, adult day care, geriatric psychiatry referral, and memory care support groups; depression screened with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II), and Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9), with psychotherapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and nurse-led support; substance use disorders screened with Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use (TAPS), with referral to social work services and community support partners or referral for addiction psychiatry consultation; and frailty identified by Fried frailty phenotype with cardiac rehabilitation and registered dietitian nutritionist evaluation for malnutrition. Social barriers include food insecurity with screening by Hunger Vital Sign, 2 items, and US Household Food Security Survey Module, 6 items, with interventions including determining eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), connecting with community partners such as food pantries/food banks, home meal deliveries, and registered dietitian nutritionist evaluation for potential malnutrition; limited English proficiency or other language barriers addressed by access to interpreter services covering a wide range of languages, ideally in person or, alternatively, via video platform, and printed educational materials in a range of appropriate languages; low health literacy screened with Short Assessment of Health Literacy (SAHL), Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine–Short Form (REALM–SF), and Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS), 3 items, with use of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit and written education tools provided at sixth grade reading level or below plus graphic educational documents; and transport limitations for which no validated tools currently available, with interventions including referral to social work services, determining eligibility for insurance or state-based transportation or reduced-cost public transportation, and maximizing opportunities for telehealth visits and remote monitoring.

### Summary of the updated American Geriatrics Society / British Geriatrics Society clinical practice guideline for prevention of falls in older persons [^117AwSe4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Older persons with cognitive impairment — risk and intervention evidence shows that older adults with cognitive impairment have an annual incidence of approximately 60% for falls and that cognitive impairment is an independent risk factor; however, at this time there is insufficient evidence to recommend, for or against, single or multifactorial interventions in community-living older adults with known cognitive impairment, and the only community study demonstrated a marked lack of efficacy. Physical activity evidence is limited, with a systematic review of 11 RCTs observing only limited effectiveness of physical training or exercise in reducing fall risk. In those presenting to the emergency department after a fall with cognitive impairment or dementia, a customized multicomponent intervention after multifactorial assessment showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in fall risk, although one multicomponent program reported education was associated with a significant intervention effect for those with higher Mini-Mental State Examination scores but not for those with lower scores.

### Optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric surgical patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program and the American Geriatrics Society [^1131GRBB]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

Assessing cognitive ability — For any patient older than age 65 without a known history of cognitive impairment or dementia, a history and cognitive assessment, such as the Mini-Cog, are essential; if possible, a knowledgeable informant, such as a spouse or a family member, should be interviewed about the evolution of any cognitive or functional decline; if the patient has experienced a decline, they should be referred for further evaluation to a primary care physician, geriatrician, or mental health specialist; postoperative cognitive dysfunction is common but difficult to quantify without documentation of the patient's baseline cognitive status; and the cognitive assessment should be performed early in the patient evaluation because any evidence of cognitive impairment or dementia may indicate that subsequent assessment of functional status and/or medication use may be unreliable.

### Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112HsUAL]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Current practice indicates that most evaluation or diagnosis occurs due to patient- or caregiver-reported concerns or clinician suspicion, yet as many as 29% to 76% of patients with dementia are unrecognized in the primary care setting; in 2011, Medicare added detection of cognitive impairment to its annual wellness visit, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recommend assessing cognitive function by direct observation, considering information and concerns from patients, family, and others, and, if deemed appropriate, using a brief validated, structured cognitive assessment tool.

Rationale and considerations for neuropsychological evaluation — use cases and planning: Neuropsychological evaluation may detect very mild but clinically important cognitive impairment that brief validated cognitive tests commonly used in primary care may not capture; it can assess a baseline, patient–centered profile of strengths and limitations, aid in distinguishing neuropsychiatric disorders from effects of comorbidities or confounding characteristics, should be considered when clarification of cognitive functional status or syndrome definition is needed or when complex confounding conditions exist, and the referring clinician should provide a consultation question to structure the evaluation.

### Quality improvement in neurology: mild cognitive impairment quality measurement set [^1142Zjat]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) evaluation quality measure — rather than rating the completeness of full cognitive workups, the workgroup deferred such measures and selected a measure focusing on common features all cognitive assessments must consider, specifically identification and treatment of factors potentially contributing to MCI symptoms. This measure is equally relevant to cognitive complaints less severe than MCI, and the workgroup believed a checklist has great value to help assure possible contributing factors are addressed and not overlooked.

### Transplantation-associated altered mentation and encephalopathy: a new classification for acute neurocognitive changes associated with hematopoietic cell transplantation from the ASTCT committee on practice guidelines [^117JDnY9]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Transplantation-associated altered mentation and encephalopathy (TAME) — pre-HCT nonpharmacologic strategies — The approach emphasizes recognizing risk factors, discussing TAME risk and mitigation with the patient and caregiver, and individualizing treatment plans, including a detailed evaluation to minimize or discontinue medications associated with altered mentation, such as those with high anticholinergic activity, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, and drugs with central nervous system activity; although no studies to date have investigated the impact of active deprescribing on HCT outcomes, a high rate of polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications has been reported in a cancer population. Between 20% and 50% of adults formally tested for cognitive changes prior to HCT have evidence of cognitive impairment, with rates up to almost 70% in those age > 60 years; therefore, before proceeding with HCT, we recommend screening for cognitive impairment with tools such as the Mini-Cog and/or the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration (BOMC) tests. The advantage of the BOMC is that it can be performed via phone and in patients with visual impairment; for those with a decrement in scoring (Mini-Cog score ≤ 2; BOMC score ≥ 8), this can be a marker of significant cognitive impairment, and thus we recommend further intervention, which may include referral to neurology or neuropsychology or administering the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a 30-point test. Although as-yet unstudied, patients with suspected cognitive impairment may benefit from referrals to cognitive therapy and testing for potentially reversible causes, such as depression, medications, vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid disease, and sleep apnea.

### Mild cognitive impairment [^117Pu3XY]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on mild cognitive impairment:

- **Definition**: MCI is defined as a cognitive decline greater than expected for an individual's age and education level, but that does not interfere notably with activities of daily life.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of MCI is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve both neurodegenerative and vascular factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of MCI increases with age, with reported prevalence rates of 6.7% in patients aged 60–64 years, 10.2% in patients aged 70–74 years, and up to 37.6% in patients aged ≥ 85 years.
- **Risk factors**: Common risk factors for MCI include age, family history of Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia, and certain genetic factors such as the presence of the APOE ε4 allele.
- Disease course: The clinical course of MCI is progressive, with individuals experiencing a decline in cognitive function over time. There are two main types of MCI: amnestic, primarily affecting memory, and non-amnestic, affecting other cognitive skills such as language, attention, and visuospatial skills.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of MCI is variable. While many individuals with MCI progress to dementia (more than half within 5 years), particularly Alzheimer's disease, others may remain stable or even revert to normal cognitive function. The amnestic subtype of MCI carries a high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease.

### Quality improvement in neurology: mild cognitive impairment quality measurement set [^117R85eU]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) measurement set — scope and priorities — The workgroup recognizes that these measures do not capture all aspects of providing high-quality care for patients with MCI and proposed quality care concepts addressing causation, cognitive and functional evaluation, diagnostic imaging and testing, disclosure of diagnosis, medications, neuropsychological testing, management, legal planning, care partner concerns, the role of exercise, enrollment in clinical trials, quality of life, and ongoing treatment and follow-up. The workgroup recognized the role of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) in encouraging the adoption of quality measures through value-based payments and the National Quality Forum standards for endorsement of such measures. For this first round, the workgroup chose to prioritize periodic cognitive health assessment, functional status assessment, diagnosis disclosure and education, assessment and treatment of contributing factors, avoidance of anticholinergic medications, and education to care partners; concepts on advance care planning, quality of life, and abuse and violence were not considered given measures on these topics already exist. Quality measures outlining the requirements for a cognitive evaluation sufficient to determine the causes of MCI are urgently needed, but were outside the scope of this measurement set; the approach to a diagnostic cognitive evaluation can be complex and depends upon the medical, psychiatric, and social context and the medical setting, and a diagnostic evaluation for MCI shares most components with evaluating dementias as described in the AANI guideline for etiologic diagnosis of dementia, currently under development.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^116FDYw5]. DoD/VA (2024). High credibility.

VA/DoD stroke rehabilitation — computer-based cognitive rehabilitation (CACR) outcomes report statistically significant gains on certain cognitive tests but limited functional benefit. Significant post-intervention improvements were observed in the CACR group (n = 165) on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), while the authors found no convincing effects on the Barthel Index (BI), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), or modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Within a systematic review, statistically significant improvements were observed for visual attention overall (n = 620 for short-term; n = 293 for long-term), sustained visual attention (n = 463 for short-term; n = 171 for long-term), and selective visual attention (n = 244 for short-term; n = 122 for long-term), with short-term follow-ups ranging from 10 days to 12 weeks and long-term follow-ups conducted between three and six months. Improvements at up to 18 weeks post-treatment were observed for immediate verbal memory span (n = 357) and immediate spatial memory span (n = 292). Although improvements in activities of daily living (ADLs) measured by FIM were observed, the change was below 22 points and did not meet the minimal clinically important difference (MCID); global cognitive performance measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) reached statistical but not clinical significance, and the authors found no convincing effects on measures of functional abilities.

### Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111PkXFs]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) — definitions and epidemiology: According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5), dementia is defined by a significant decline in 1 or more cognitive domains that interferes with a person's independence in daily activities, and the 6 cognitive domains are complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual motor function, and social cognition. Dementia affects an estimated 2.4 to 5.5 million persons in the United States and its prevalence increases with age, affecting 3.2% of persons aged 65 to 74 years, 9.9% of those aged 75 to 84 years, and 29.3% of those 85 years or older. MCI differs from dementia in that the impairment is not severe enough to interfere with independent daily functioning; one systematic review found that 32% of persons with MCI develop dementia over 5 years, studies have shown that between 10% and 40% of persons with MCI may return to normal cognition over approximately 4 to 5 years, and prevalence estimates range from 3% to 42% in adults 65 years or older.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^114JNM9G]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5 — psychologists are aware of cultural perspectives and of personal and societal biases and engage in nondiscriminatory practice — emphasizes culturally informed assessment. Psychologists assessing older adults from racial and ethnic minority groups use the best available tests with norms appropriate for each individual's background and consult with expert colleagues as needed regarding battery construction and interpretation, and when appropriate norms are unavailable for a particular client, the psychologist clearly documents the limitations of their assessment and diagnoses; for example, the most appropriate norms may be from Mayo's Older African American Normative Studies (MOAANS) instead of the more familiar Heaton norms. Psychologists are advised to carefully evaluate test quality and appropriateness for individual circumstances; for example, the noose item in the Boston Naming Test (BNT) may be culturally inflammatory for African Americans and has been suggested as inappropriate for continued inclusion in the BNT. Strive to contextualize neuropsychological findings and recommendations with as much sociocultural information as possible, and strive to control biases through reviewing relevant research, relying on evidence-based practice guidelines, and by seeking additional consultation or, in some cases, withdrawing from the evaluation; if the psychologist is unable to conduct the evaluation fairly, the ethical psychologist seeks to refer the individual to other psychologists capable of providing services. Strive for continued growth in cultural competence, defined as awareness of one's own assumptions and biases, understanding the worldview of culturally dissimilar clients, and the ability to develop culturally appropriate assessments or interventions, and note that performing culturally sensitive assessments requires a life-long process of self-reflection and analysis.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114pp5Ya]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Cognitive status and delirium in older adults undergoing coronary revascularization — recognition of baseline cognition can identify delirium risk, and delirium prevention and tailored procedural selection are emphasized. Recognition of baseline cognitive function can also identify those at risk for delirium, and delirium is described as often underdiagnosed, common and serious with increased risks in those with preexisting cognitive impairment; strategies to minimize delirium include maintaining orientation, avoiding unnecessary sedatives, optimizing pain control, encouraging early mobilization, and ensuring sensory aids are in use. Moderate dementia should not serve as a blanket exclusion for coronary revascularization, and while complex interventions with high stroke risk or prolonged intensive care may cause harm, symptom-driven procedures such as single-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention may meaningfully improve quality of life. Mental health disorders including anxiety and depression are common and can increase complications after invasive cardiac procedures. Routine cognitive screening in asymptomatic older adults remains under investigation; however, in high-risk populations targeted cognitive assessment may inform decision-making, with initial evaluation including a history from both patient and caregiver and attention to medication adherence, daily functioning, and care coordination. If concerns are detected, validated tools (eg, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination, St Louis University Mental Status Examination, Ascertain Dementia 8) may be used, with abnormal findings prompting laboratory tests and brain imaging for reversible causes and referral to a cognitive specialist, and digital platforms such as the GeriKit app may support this process. For those with life expectancy < 1 year, it may be appropriate not to pursue a procedure unless there is potential for immediate symptom relief and alignment with goals of care.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^116HE2eb]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Telepsychology and teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) assessments — access, resources, and cautions. Telepsychology and teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) are rapidly evolving, and these approaches to assessment will undoubtedly improve access to service, especially in underserved areas and for individuals who have difficulty leaving their homes, although there are also many challenges in implementing these services with older persons due to lack of access to reliable equipment and broadband service, limited experience and proficiency interacting with technology among some older individuals, and reliance on caregivers for those with more severe cognitive impairment. Psychologists are encouraged to use extra caution when administering measures and interpreting results of remote assessment, including but not limited to some of the commonly used instruments (e.g. TICS; telephone-MoCA) in lieu of formal, in-person assessments. Regarding telepsychology and TeleNP, psychologists aim to utilize the most up to date information provided in online resources prior to providing these services such as the APA Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology (2013a), APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (2017a), and the Interorganizational Practice Committee (IOPC)'s Tele-Neuropsychology Models and Tools (2020) that are available online at no cost.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^1179KKJN]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment — clinical characterization and risk: The diagnosis of MCI and/or mild neurocognitive disorder is described as a period prior to dementia in which one exhibits cognitive difficulties that are greater than expected based on demographically appropriate normative data, but not so severe as to warrant a diagnosis of dementia given relative sparing of everyday functioning. Although individuals with MCI often remain stable or revert to cognitively typical ranges, MCI classification does generally confer a greater risk for progression to dementia, and specific criteria for defining MCI in clinical and research settings vary. Subtypes of MCI (amnestic vs. non-amnestic; single vs. multiple domains) may provide additional information about disease severity and breadth of cognitive domains impacted that may be useful in determining etiology, brain regions/systems affected, likelihood of reversion to cognitively unimpaired, or risk of future progression to dementia.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^113rd7XN]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 9 — when evaluating for cognitive and behavioral changes, psychologists attempt to estimate premorbid abilities and use this to contextualize current performance. The diagnosis of dementia requires evidence of decline from a previously higher level of cognitive function, and ideally psychologists would have baseline test data from earlier years against which current performance could be compared; however, this information rarely exists, so psychologists must try to estimate premorbid abilities. Psychologists strive to use premorbid functioning estimating methods that are appropriate to each individual, are encouraged to be aware of the limits of various approaches to premorbid ability estimation and to appropriately qualify their clinical judgments about premorbid function, and commonly consider socioeconomic status, educational quality and attainment, occupational history, multilingualism, acculturation or immigration experience, and information from collateral informants; this demographic and historical information can be supplemented by contemporaneous tests such as tests of crystallized abilities or word reading ability, and tests of word reading ability are frequently used due to their expediency and ability to account for differences in test performance.

Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

Patient's decision-making capacity — legally relevant criteria and approaches to assessment are outlined across four domains: "Communicate a choice", "Understand the relevant information", "Appreciate the situation and its consequences", and "Reason about treatment options". Assessment actions include "Ask patient to indicate a treatment choice", "Encourage patient to paraphrase disclosed information regarding medical condition and treatment", "Ask patient to describe views of medical condition, proposed treatment, and likely outcomes", and "Ask patient to compare treatment options and consequences and to offer reasons for selection of option". Example clinical questions include "Have you decided whether to follow your doctor's [or my] recommendation for treatment?" and "Please tell me in your own words what your doctor [or I] told you about", as well as "What do you believe is wrong with your health now?" and "How did you decide to accept or reject the recommended treatment?" Comments note that "Frequent reversals of choice because of psychiatric or neurologic conditions may indicate lack of capacity", that "patients who do not acknowledge their illnesses (often referred to as 'lack of insight') cannot make valid decisions about treatment", that "Delusions or pathologic levels of distortion or denial are the most common causes of impairment", and that "This criterion focuses on the process by which a decision is reached, not the outcome of the patient's choice, since patients have the right to make 'unreasonable' choices". A footnote specifies that "Patients' responses to these questions need not be verbal".

Poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) assessment and referral — If the answer to "Do results from the cognitive screening test indicate possible cognitive impairment?" is yes, refer as stated: "Refer for neuropsychological evaluation". If screening does not indicate impairment, assess "Does patient or informant report cognitive decline?" and, if yes, "Refer for neuropsychological evaluation"; if no, assess "Is there evidence of limited awareness of cognitive deficits in the patient?" and if no, "Further cognitive evaluation is probably not warranted at this time". After neuropsychological evaluation, if "Is there evidence of cognitive impairment?" is yes, evaluate "Is there evidence of communication deficits?" and if yes, "Refer to appropriate health professional (eg, Speech Language Pathology)", and evaluate "Is there evidence that cognitive impairment impact daily functioning?" and if yes, "Refer to appropriate health professional (eg, Occupational Therapy)". The figure clarifies that "PSCI indicates poststroke cognitive impairment".

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^1136AwhD]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline 17 — Psychologists strive to develop skill at conducting and interpreting cognitive and functional ability evaluations with older adults, and psychologists may be asked to characterize an older adult's current cognitive or functional status and determine whether it represents a significant change from an earlier time. Assessments can range from a brief screening to in-depth diagnostic evaluation, and cognitive screening typically involves the use of brief screening instruments targeted at identifying global impairment with adequate sensitivity but with relatively low diagnostic specificity. These screening tools are typically short (less than ten minutes) and relatively simple to administer and score, and while there is currently no evidence-based treatment for reversing cognitive impairment associated with neurodegenerative disease, brief cognitive screening may still be appropriate for older adults who are at risk for dementia or have suspected cognitive impairment. Federal legislation provides for screening for cognitive impairment during annual wellness visits for Medicare beneficiaries, and differentiating factors contributing to cognitive impairment among older adults is much more challenging and often requires a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Such evaluations are often conducted by psychologists with relevant training, experience, and demonstrated competencies in neuropsychological assessment and include objective measurement of cognitive performance using standardized psychometric instruments that assess various cognitive domains, with results integrated with collateral and diagnostic information and compared with culturally and demographically appropriate normative data to determine whether the cognitive profile is consistent with those known to occur in later life or represents a significant deviation from the individual's baseline level of functioning.

### APA guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation [^114ZVivG]. APA (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 12 — Psychologists who conduct psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation seek to consider the unique issues that may arise when test instruments and assessment approaches designed for specific populations are used with diverse populations — states that psychological assessment instruments and interpretive methods are culture specific because they are developed from a specific sociocultural context, most often Western, and that this context is linked to the population used in the test standardization and may be less applicable to groups with other characteristics and cultures. It notes that assessment techniques and standardized instruments designed for a specific population have their validity and reliability tied to this normative group and cannot be readily made to apply to other groups even when they undergo adaptations and validity, reliability, and measurement equivalence have been tested across culturally diverse sample groups. Psychologists endeavor to use only properly up-to-date normed, standardized, and translated measures chosen specifically based on the client's ethnic group, acculturation level, language proficiency, education level, socioeconomic status, age, disability status, and other relevant demographic factors. For many areas of assessment, including cognitive function, it is important for psychologists to strive to use age-appropriate test norms; for example, slowed processing speed is a normal part of cognitive aging, and average scores for older adults on tests requiring fast performance, such as the Trail Making Test, would be interpreted as indicating impairment if norms for younger people were used. Psychologists are encouraged to recognize that a psychological test needs to have established research-based validity and reliability in the culture and language in which it was constructed before it can be considered appropriate for adaptation in other languages and cultures, which may be necessary for clients with less acculturation to the Western society and whose English is not the dominant language. When a test administration or protocol requires translation to match the language dominance of the examinee because a test version in the client's language and with appropriate cultural characteristics has not been developed, strict guidelines have been recommended by the International Test Commission (2017); translations can include trained professionals conducting forward and back translations focused on meaning including local and cultural context, and those translated tests or protocols, if not normed, may produce less meaningful results. Application emphasizes that although it is nearly impossible to match a test or assessment instrument to all the diverse characteristics of the client/patient/examinee, psychologists endeavor to familiarize themselves with the characteristics and cultural origin of their instruments in order to decide whether the test would be fairly assessed and fairly compared with the normative group.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) evaluation — cognitive function: Cognitive function should be assessed using validated tools to screen for prior disabling stroke, cognitive impairment or dementia, and depression; the Mini Mental State Examination identifies dementia with scores < 24 being abnormal. Although cognitive function post-TAVR is preserved in most, assessment establishes baseline cognitive reserve, and because depression confounds cognitive performance, a history followed by a validated tool such as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale is warranted.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

NIA-AA probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia — diagnosis can be made when the patient "Meets criteria for dementia syndrome" and has "An insidious onset: symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over hours or days", with "Clear-cut history of worsening of cognition", and initial prominent deficits in an amnestic presentation or specified non-amnestic presentations. The amnestic presentation "is the most common syndromic presentation of AD dementia" with "impairment in learning and recall of recently learned information" plus another domain deficit, while non-amnestic variants include "Language presentation", "Visuospatial presentation", and "Executive dysfunction", each with additional domain deficits. The diagnosis "should not be applied" when there is evidence of substantial concomitant cerebrovascular disease, core features of dementia with Lewy bodies, prominent behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, prominent semantic variant or non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, or another concurrent active disease/comorbidity/medication affecting cognition. "Biomarker evidence increases the certainty" that AD pathophysiology underlies the syndrome; if both amyloid-beta and neuronal injury biomarkers are present the "likelihood is high that dementia is due to AD", if either are absent it is "highly likely not due to AD", and if conflicting, likelihood is "intermediate".

### APA guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation [^111MBUD2]. APA (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 11 — psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation: Psychologists who conduct psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation endeavor to recognize the nature of and relationship among individual, gender, and group variability, emphasizing that assessment and interpretation of psychological tests involve understanding similarities and differences within the examinee, the cohort to which such examinee belongs, and the group norm samples used in test construction; some norm-referenced tests (using standard, scaled, percentile and T-scores) classify score deviation by comparison with normative data, and scores outside the broad range of average in a normal distribution may be classified as deviant; due to limitations in the diversity and variability of normative samples, characteristics of an individual examinee may be poorly represented or absent, increasing the chance of misinterpretation for those not appropriately represented (e.g., due to cultural, racial, age, and ethnic differences) because of different individual and cultural characteristics rather than poor performance.

### Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113qTgQi]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults — benefit evidence and decision-making outcomes show limited or no improvement, with constrained applicability to screen-detected populations. Analysis of 4 of the trials (n = 668) showed no improvement in caregiver depression measures. Two trials assessed planning/decision-making: in one trial (n = 113) caregivers in both the intervention and usual care groups reported significantly better planning, with no difference between groups; in the MIND care coordination trial (n = 303) evaluators assessed 19 common care needs for participants (71 items) and caregivers (15 items), and after 18 months there was no difference in reduction of total percentage of unmet needs vs usual care. Overall benefits evidence is limited by short trial duration — often ≤ 6 months for pharmacologic agents and ≤ 1 year for nonpharmacologic interventions — heterogeneity, and inconsistent outcomes; where improvements were reported, average effect sizes were small and of uncertain clinical importance, no trials specifically targeted a screen-detected population, and applicability to a screen-detected population is uncertain, particularly for persons with moderate dementia.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^1131grES]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Central auditory processing disorder (C)APD — test performance concepts and evidence grading are defined, including that the false positive rate is 1 minus the specificity (e.g., 1 − 80% specificity = 20% false positive rate), test efficiency combines specificity and sensitivity as the overall number of true positives and true negatives divided by the total tested, validity reflects whether evidence and theory support intended test score interpretations, and reliability refers to the stability of a test score and is essential to validity. The guideline uses a numerical level-of-evidence scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the strongest level of support and 5 the weakest; although the model rates group studies as superior to individual case studies, case and retrospective studies (classified as level 3 or 4 evidence) can often provide appropriate evidence for an individual profile. Clinicians should take a pragmatic approach to evaluating evidence, and the guideline focuses on four areas: 1) patient history and selection criteria, 2) diagnosis, 3) intervention, and 4) professional issues, education, and training.

### Lecanemab: appropriate use recommendations [^116ZBUqt]. The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). High credibility.

Lecanemab appropriate use — program setup, screening, and monitoring: "Most clinicians have limited experience with lecanemab or other monoclonal antibody therapies for AD". "These AURs are intended to help clinicians anticipate, plan, and implement the clinical practice and workflow alterations needed to accommodate lecanemab therapy". Key foundations include "Clinician education regarding AD, cognitive assessment, amyloid confirmation with PET or CSF, ARIA detection and management, infusion and infusion reactions, APOE genotyping, and patient communication are foundational for success in lecanemab treatment programs". It states, "Development of a protocol for management of severe and serious ARIA is recommended for clinicians and institutions implementing a therapy program with lecanemab". For patient identification and assessment, "Clinicians should serially assess the mental status of all patients in their practice with MCI or dementia due to AD like those included in the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials", and "Considering a patient for lecanemab therapy involves excluding non-AD causes of cognitive impairment, assessing a baseline or recent MRI for possible exclusionary factors, and confirming amyloid pathology with amyloid PET or CSF amyloid and tau assays". Safety monitoring specifies, "Safe use of lecanemab requires periodic MRI imaging and urgent MRI studies if patients develop symptoms consistent with ARIA", and communication systems: "Communication channels between patients and their caregivers and clinical staff must be established to allow rapid communication regarding any symptoms suggestive of ARIA, infusion reactions, or other side effects". Evidence of benefit in practice may include that "supportive evidence of effectiveness may include less-than-expected decline on standard rating instruments… or change of trajectory of cognitive decline observed by family members", and "Guidance for patient counseling is available in the PI (www.accessdata.fda.gov)".

Geriatric assessment and cognitive/functional predictors — In elderly patients, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) and dementia were more likely to develop postoperative complications (P = 0.041 and P = 0.0065), and all patients who developed delirium had low preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (P = 0.0003). Using multiple logistic regression, the best model for prediction of complications combined MMSE (P = 0.031) and the Barthel index (P = 0.04); in addition, longer operation time was significantly associated with complications, and the authors stressed the importance of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in addition to conventional cardiopulmonary functional assessment in elderly patients. The expert panel survey categorized functional status as one of the most important factors in risk assessment, and physician and patient sex might be important in estimating surgical risk, with one report noting that male physicians had larger changes in estimated surgical risk after reviewing a video interview.

### Approach to the patient… [^116ETVeN]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

13 Studies of these drugs have usually assessed effectiveness using one of several scales, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale for Cognition, the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living inventory, or the Severe Impairment Battery. In general, to be clinically significant, an increase should be at least 10 percent of the scale length. 12 Improvements in behavior and activities of daily living also have been noted in patients treated with one of these three agents; however, none of the medications has a large treatment effect, and the clinical significance of these effects is questionable.

Another systematic review concluded that, despite statistical significance, the improvement in patients with dementia taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors was clinically marginal. 21 Additional trials are needed to determine the benefits of long-term therapy and whether these agents are effective in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease. It is reasonable to discontinue treatment if there is no improvement within six to eight weeks. Therapy may be restarted if symptoms worsen after the medication is tapered, because acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be more effective for symptomatic control than previously recognized.
25. The effect on cognition was statistically significant in patients with mild to moderate dementia but is unlikely to have clinical significance. A small reduction in agitation was seen in patients taking memantine.

Seventeen patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease would need to be treated for six months to prevent one episode of agitation. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences in functioning, care needs, or quality of life between patients taking antipsychotics and those taking placebo. Some clinical symptoms improved, such as anger, aggression, and paranoia. Patients taking olanzapine experienced worsening functional ability at week 12 compared with those taking placebo. A small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate effectiveness of quetiapine or rivastigmine for treatment of agitation in patients with Alzheimer disease in care facilities after 26 weeks. 32 At six weeks, a statistically significant decline in cognition was noted in patients taking quetiapine compared with those taking placebo.

Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale This validated short cognitive screening instrument is designed to reduce the impact of language and cultural differences on the results of screened individuals. This paper tool is helpful for clinics that serve linguistically diverse populations that have varying education levels. Montreal Cognitive Assessment The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a quick and easy instrument that can be adapted for use in the clinical setting. It is easy to administer and score, and the results can be interpreted by the health provider with minimal training. Both an app and paper versions are available. A one-hour Training & Certification module supports MoCA's validity and was designed for busy medical professionals. It is free for specific participants.

AD8 Dementia Screening Interview This brief 3-minute test was originally designed as an informant screening tool but has also been validated as a direct questionnaire for the patient. The test consists of eight yes-or-no questions about changes in the person's thinking, memory, and behavior. In combination with the Mini-COG, the AD8 is effective for detecting early cognitive change. No formal training is needed to administer the test. Its use is granted by Washington University for clinical care purposes. Geriatric Depression Scale The Geriatric Depression Scale can be useful for patients who have mild-to-moderate symptoms of dementia. Score one point when the patient answer matches the test answer. A score of greater than five indicates further evaluation. Patient Health Questionnaire The PHQ-9 can be useful in clinical practice to assess depression severity and its symptoms. More information about PHQ-9 can be found here.

General Anxiety Disorder-7 This tool is a valid screening tool for gauging severity of generalized anxiety symptoms. Both anxiety and depression may affect cognitive assessment scores. Functional Activities Questionnaire The Functional Activities Questionnaire calculates the extent of the patient's ability to engage in instrumental activities of daily living. The questionnaire is useful to assess and monitor functional changes over time. It is answered by the patient, family, or caregiver to indicate the presence of cognitive impairment..
