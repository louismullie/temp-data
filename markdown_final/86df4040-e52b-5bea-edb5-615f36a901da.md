## Question

Guideline for sbp prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guidelines for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis in cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why prophylaxis matters. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and how guidelines frame recommendations. Next, I will categorize indications into secondary prophylaxis, primary prophylaxis in GI bleeding, and primary prophylaxis in non-bleeding advanced cirrhosis. After that, I should review antibiotic choices, dosing, and resistance considerations. Finally, I will integrate controversies, stewardship, and a practical decision framework with monitoring and stopping rules, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why prophylaxis is considered. SBP is a common and lethal complication of decompensated cirrhosis, with in-hospital mortality around 15–20% and 1-year mortality near 34–57%, and recurrence after a first episode is about 70% at 1 year, which is why prevention is prioritized in high-risk groups [^0d952e48] [^ea421a30] [^f35bc3c3].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before jumping to recommendations. The highest-quality synthesis, a 2020 Cochrane network meta-analysis, found very low certainty of evidence for mortality benefit and no clear superiority among prophylactic regimens, which tempers enthusiasm and underscores the need to individualize decisions and monitor for resistance [^66f3b2d1]. I should also note that contemporary cohorts suggest potential harm from secondary prophylaxis in some settings, reinforcing caution and the need for ongoing reassessment [^60ec37e6].

> I will now examine secondary prophylaxis, where the indication is strongest. Guidelines consistently recommend lifelong prophylaxis after a prior SBP episode, with norfloxacin 400 mg daily as first-line; ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily is an accepted alternative when norfloxacin is unavailable, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a reasonable option in selected patients, though evidence is weaker [^919fc926] [^e8a262bb] [^1da6d361]. Hold on, I should verify recurrence rates: landmark data show norfloxacin reduces 1-year recurrence to about 20% vs 68% with placebo, which is why this remains standard despite modern resistance concerns [^e8a262bb].

> Next, I should review primary prophylaxis in acute variceal bleeding. Short-course antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory for all patients with cirrhosis and upper GI hemorrhage to prevent SBP and other infections; IV ceftriaxone 1 g daily for up to 7 days is preferred given rising quinolone resistance, with alternatives guided by local epidemiology if ceftriaxone is contraindicated [^943fda4b] [^2b3f317a] [^bb9dd015]. Let me double-check the rationale: meta-analyses show reduced infections and improved survival with selective gut decontamination in this setting, supporting the strong recommendation [^2b3f317a].

> Now, I need to consider primary prophylaxis in non-bleeding advanced cirrhosis. Guidelines suggest considering norfloxacin in selected high-risk patients with low ascitic protein (< 1.5 g/dL) plus advanced liver failure (Child-Pugh > 9 with bilirubin > 3 mg/dL) or renal dysfunction (creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL, BUN > 25 mg/dL, or sodium < 130 mEq/L), after discussing uncertainties and risks; this is a weak recommendation given low-certainty evidence [^a4afede3] [^4816fb88] [^28258b84]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 1-year SBP risk in this group was uniformly 60%, but I should correct that: risk varies widely from about 20–60% depending on the exact risk profile, which is why shared decision-making is essential [^2b3f317a].

> Let me think about antibiotic choices and dosing outside of bleeding. Norfloxacin 400 mg daily is the most studied and guideline-endorsed agent for both primary and secondary prophylaxis; ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily is an alternative when norfloxacin is unavailable, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength daily is a reasonable option in some patients, though evidence is limited and resistance patterns should guide selection [^919fc926] [^e8a262bb] [^1da6d361]. I should confirm that rifaximin is not a substitute here; EASL notes insufficient evidence for rifaximin as SBP prophylaxis despite theoretical advantages, so it should not replace norfloxacin for this indication outside trials [^1afd21c0].

> Hold on, I should verify resistance and stewardship issues because they materially change risk-benefit. Quinolone resistance and MDRO colonization are increasingly prevalent and predict prophylaxis failure; in a prospective cohort, quinolone-resistant gram-negatives independently increased prophylaxis failure and death, and MDRO colonization at baseline was common, arguing for periodic reassessment and de-escalation when feasible [^399d87e0]. I need to ensure we also weigh population-level harms: long-term fluoroquinolone prophylaxis contributes to AMR and may select for gram-positive and MDRO SBP, which is why some experts call for a stewardship-driven, individualized approach rather than blanket prophylaxis [^6f276139] [^9a86cf44].

> But wait, what about rifaximin as an alternative strategy. Observational and small RCTs suggest rifaximin may reduce SBP recurrence compared with norfloxacin in some settings, yet EASL concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend rifaximin for SBP prophylaxis, and a recent randomized trial of rifaximin for primary prophylaxis failed to improve 12-month survival, so rifaximin should not be used as standard SBP prophylaxis outside research or specific scenarios like concurrent hepatic encephalopathy management [^1afd21c0] [^afebc180] [^64227d7b]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline positions; yes, current guidance does not endorse rifaximin for SBP prophylaxis routinely [^1afd21c0].

> Next, I should review practical implementation and monitoring. Before starting prophylaxis, confirm the indication, screen for prior MDRO colonization or infections, and document informed consent about uncertain benefits and resistance risks. Reassess at regular intervals for breakthrough infections, adverse effects, and whether the clinical trajectory still warrants prophylaxis, with a low threshold to stop if risks outweigh benefits or if resistance emerges [^4816fb88] [^399d87e0]. I need to ensure we also reinforce general infection-prevention measures: minimize PPIs unless clearly indicated, maintain vaccinations, and optimize ascites management to reduce infection risk [^b8ceff4e].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework, but I should confirm it aligns with guidelines. Secondary prophylaxis after a prior SBP episode is indicated for essentially all patients unless contraindicated. Primary prophylaxis is mandatory during acute variceal bleeding. Primary prophylaxis in non-bleeding patients should be reserved for those with low ascitic protein plus advanced liver failure or renal dysfunction, after shared decision-making and with ongoing reassessment for continued need and resistance risk [^919fc926] [^943fda4b] [^a4afede3]. I should emphasize that routine primary prophylaxis for all patients with low protein ascites is not recommended; the benefit is concentrated in the highest-risk phenotypes, and broad use risks resistance without proven survival benefit in lower-risk groups [^4816fb88].

> Finally, I should acknowledge controversies and future directions. Emerging data question the net benefit of secondary prophylaxis in some cohorts, highlighting the need for better risk stratification, resistance surveillance, and alternative strategies such as albumin-based interventions or targeted microbiome modulation. Until then, prophylaxis should be individualized, time-limited when possible, and integrated with robust antimicrobial stewardship and transplant evaluation for eligible patients [^60ec37e6] [^66f3b2d1] [^b8ceff4e].

SBP prophylaxis is indicated for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are at **high risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis** [^4816fb88]. The main indications are: **secondary prophylaxis after a prior SBP episode** [^919fc926] (norfloxacin 400 mg daily or ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily) [^e8a262bb]; **primary prophylaxis for acute variceal bleeding** (ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily for up to 7 days) [^943fda4b]; and **primary prophylaxis for low ascitic protein (< 1.5 g/dL) with advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction** (norfloxacin 400 mg daily) [^a4afede3] [^2b3f317a]. Rifaximin is **not recommended for SBP prophylaxis** due to insufficient evidence [^1afd21c0] [^64227d7b]. Prophylaxis should be individualized, with regular monitoring for resistance and adverse effects [^4816fb88] [^399d87e0].

## Indications for SBP prophylaxis

### Secondary prophylaxis

Secondary prophylaxis is indicated for all patients with cirrhosis and ascites who have recovered from a prior SBP episode, given the **high recurrence risk** (approximately 70% at 1 year) [^e8a262bb] [^f35bc3c3]. Norfloxacin 400 mg orally once daily is **first-line** [^919fc926]; ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily is an alternative if norfloxacin is unavailable [^e8a262bb] [^1da6d361].

---

### Primary prophylaxis

#### Acute variceal bleeding

All patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding should receive **short-term antibiotic prophylaxis** to prevent SBP and other infections [^943fda4b]. Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours for up to 7 days is **first-line** [^943fda4b]; fluoroquinolones are alternatives if ceftriaxone is contraindicated or unavailable [^889cc0f5].

---

#### Low ascitic protein with advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction

Patients with low ascitic protein (< 1.5 g/dL) and advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh score > 9 with bilirubin > 3 mg/dL) or renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL, BUN > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium < 130 mEq/L) should be considered for **primary prophylaxis** [^a4afede3] [^2b3f317a]. Norfloxacin 400 mg orally once daily is **recommended** [^2b3f317a].

---

## Antibiotic regimens for SBP prophylaxis

| **Indication** | **Recommended antibiotic regimen** |
|-|-|
| Secondary prophylaxis | Norfloxacin 400 mg orally once daily; ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily if norfloxacin unavailable [^919fc926] [^e8a262bb] |
| Acute variceal bleeding | Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours for up to 7 days [^943fda4b] |
| Low ascitic protein with advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction | Norfloxacin 400 mg orally once daily [^a4afede3] [^2b3f317a] |

---

## Duration of prophylaxis

Secondary prophylaxis should continue **indefinitely** or until liver transplantation, given the high recurrence risk [^e8a262bb]. Primary prophylaxis for acute variceal bleeding is **short-term**, typically 7 days [^943fda4b]. For low ascitic protein with advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction, prophylaxis is **long-term**, with regular reassessment of risk and benefit [^a4afede3].

---

## Risks and benefits of SBP prophylaxis

Benefits include **reduced SBP incidence**, improved survival, and delayed hepatorenal syndrome in selected patients [^e8a262bb] [^5816b21c]. Risks include **antibiotic resistance**, adverse drug reactions, and Clostridioides difficile infection; resistance is a growing concern, particularly with fluoroquinolones [^399d87e0] [^9a86cf44].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring should include assessment for breakthrough infections, **antibiotic resistance**, and adverse effects. Periodic reassessment of liver function, renal function, and ascitic protein is recommended to guide continued prophylaxis [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Rifaximin**: Not recommended for SBP prophylaxis due to insufficient evidence [^1afd21c0] [^64227d7b].
- **Alternatives**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be considered in patients intolerant to fluoroquinolones, though evidence is limited [^1da6d361].
- **Individualization**: Prophylaxis should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, local resistance patterns, and ongoing clinical assessment [^4816fb88].

---

SBP prophylaxis is indicated for patients with cirrhosis and ascites at high risk of SBP, including those with prior SBP, acute variceal bleeding, or low ascitic protein with advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction. Norfloxacin is the **preferred agent**, with ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone as alternatives depending on the indication. Prophylaxis should be individualized, with regular monitoring for resistance and adverse effects.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: benefit or risk? [^9a86cf44]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with risk of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Current guidelines recommend primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are at risk of a first episode and to prevent recurrence, respectively. Factors associated with prophylaxis failure leading to SBP, ACLF, and increased mortality are not well established. Gram-positive and multidrug-resistant organisms have become more frequently associated with SBP, particularly in the setting of ACLF. Efforts to understand how long-term antibiotic therapy may affect individual risk of SBP in this population will be critical to developing optimal preventive strategies.

### Rethinking antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis: first, Do No harm [^6f276139]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBPPr) in patients with cirrhosis has been considered the standard of care since the 1990s and is currently recommended by several major gastroenterological societies. However, the evidence that supports this practice is weak, and there is no clear mortality benefit. The unintended consequences of this strategy are not insignificant, both at the patient and population levels. Recent evidence suggests that SBPPr may even cause harm. Since the widespread implementation of SBPPr 3 decades ago, our overall approach to antibiotic use has shifted. We now recognize the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, the potential harms of antibiotics, and the vital role of antimicrobial stewardship. In light of recent developments and evidence, there is an urgent need for infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, and hepatology leaders to collaborate in development of an updated and cohesive approach to SBPPr.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^66f3b2d1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 2.5% of all hospitalisations in people with liver cirrhosis are for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is associated with significant short-term mortality; therefore, it is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it. Antibiotic prophylaxis forms the mainstay preventive method, but this has to be balanced against the development of drug-resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is difficult to treat, and other adverse events. Several different prophylactic antibiotic treatments are available; however, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy and optimal combination.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different prophylactic antibiotic treatments for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis using a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different prophylactic antibiotic treatments according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis at risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis undergoing prophylactic treatment to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation, or were receiving antibiotics for treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or other purposes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included 29 randomised clinical trials (3896 participants; nine antibiotic regimens (ciprofloxacin, neomycin, norfloxacin, norfloxacin plus neomycin, norfloxacin plus rifaximin, rifaximin, rufloxacin, sparfloxacin, sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim), and 'no active intervention' in the review. Twenty-three trials (2587 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, with or without other features of decompensation, having ascites with low protein or previous history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months. Many of the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Overall, approximately 10% of trial participants developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 15% of trial participants died. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of mortality (very low certainty) or number of serious adverse events (very low certainty). However, because of the wide CrIs, clinically important differences in these outcomes cannot be ruled out. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or the proportion of people with serious adverse events. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of proportion of people with 'any adverse events' (very low certainty), liver transplantation (very low certainty), or the proportion of people who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (very low certainty). The number of 'any' adverse events per participant was fewer with norfloxacin (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CrI 0.59 to 0.94; 4 trials, 546 participants; low certainty) and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (rate ratio 0.19, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.81; 1 trial, 60 participants; low certainty) versus no active intervention. There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of 'any' adverse events per participant (very low certainty). There were fewer other decompensation events with rifaximin versus no active intervention (rate ratio 0.61, 65% CrI 0.46 to 0.80; 3 trials, 575 participants; low certainty) and norfloxacin plus neomycin (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.33; 1 trial, 22 participants; low certainty). There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of decompensations events per participant (very low certainty). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or development of symptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One would expect some correlation between the above outcomes, with interventions demonstrating effectiveness across several outcomes. This was not the case. The possible reasons for this include sparse data and selective reporting bias, which makes the results unreliable. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions from these inconsistent differences based on sparse data. There was no evidence of any differences in the subgroup analyses (performed when possible) based on whether the prophylaxis was primary or secondary.

Funding

the source of funding for five trials were organisations who would benefit from the results of the study; six trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 18 trials was unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low-certainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial, and if beneficial, which antibiotic prophylaxis is most beneficial in people with cirrhosis and ascites with low protein or history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered, employ blinding, avoid postrandomisation dropouts (or perform intention-to-treat analysis), and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health-related quality of life, and decompensation events.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^4816fb88]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis—AASLD 2021 guidance states that evidence for primary prophylaxis with antibiotics is not strong and is restricted to patients with very advanced cirrhosis, and SBP prophylaxis should be individualized based on estimated risks and benefits. SBP should receive long-term prophylaxis with daily norfloxacin; in settings in which norfloxacin is unavailable, oral ciprofloxacin is acceptable. In patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, antibiotic prophylaxis for SBP should be instituted; IV ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours is the antibiotic of choice and should be used for a maximum of 7 days. In patients with cirrhosis and low protein (<1.5 g/dL) ascites, primary SBP prophylaxis can be considered in selected patients with renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level >1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level >25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level <130 mEq/L) or liver failure (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score >9 and bilirubin >3 mg/dL).

### Long-term prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis [^ffb35bcc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding long-term prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE (1967-September 2004) and bibliographic search of the English-language literature was conducted using the search terms spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, cirrhosis, antimicrobial, and prophylaxis.

Data Synthesis

Long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis has been shown to decrease recurrent SBP in cirrhotics with a prior episode. Prophylaxis in patients with low ascitic fluid protein has also been shown to reduce the incidence of SBP; however, studies are too in-homogeneous to identify subgroups that benefit the most.

Conclusions

Long-term antimicrobial therapy should be considered for secondary prophylaxis of SBP. Studies should be done to confirm this benefit and identify subsets of patients with low ascitic fluid protein who clearly benefit.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^2b3f317a]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) primary prophylaxis—In patients without a prior history of SBP, antibiotics should be used judiciously and sparingly and reserved only for those at the highest risk of infection. In cirrhosis with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, a meta-analysis found that short-term (5-7 days) selective intestinal decontamination (mostly oral norfloxacin) reduced the rate of infections, including SBP, and improved survival, and because the emergence of quinolone-resistant organisms has decreased the prophylactic efficacy of norfloxacin, IV ceftriaxone is currently the recommended antibiotic in patients with hemorrhage; alternative drugs are discouraged and SBP and other infections should be ruled out before starting the antibiotic. In patients without gastrointestinal hemorrhage and without a prior episode of SBP, antibiotic prophylaxis may be considered in selected high-risk patients, for example those with low (<1.5 g/dL) ascitic fluid protein; even with low ascites protein, the 1-year probability of SBP may vary between 20% and 60%. In a landmark trial, norfloxacin was associated with a significantly reduced 1-year probability of first SBP compared with placebo (60% vs. 7%) in patients with low protein ascites and advanced liver disease (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 points with serum bilirubin level > 3 mg/dL) or with impaired renal function defined by serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L.

PRISMA flow diagram.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of interventions

We included trials that studied long-term (>3 months) administration of rifaximin at any dose compared with norfloxacin for the purpose of primary or secondary prevention of SBP.

Types of participants

Studies that recruited patients with cirrhosis (irrespective of aetiology) and ascites were included in our analysis.

The indications for long term SBP prophylaxis included either primary (high risk patients with baseline ascitic fluid total protein <1.5 g/dL along with impaired renal function [serum creatinine ≥1.2 mg/dL, BUN ≥25 mg/dL or serum Na ≤130 mEq/L] or patients with liver failure [Child-Pugh score ≥9 and serum bilirubin ≥3 mg/dL]) or secondary prophylaxis (previous episode of SBP).

Patients with active or recent gastrointestinal bleed, known liver malignancy or hypersensitivity to the planned drugs were excluded.

Types of outcome measures

The primary outcome measure across all studies was the occurrence of SBP. We used the AASLD definition of SBP, that is, the diagnosis is made in the presence of an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMNL) count ≥250 cells/mm 3 without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection.The secondary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, defined as death due to any cause during the study period.

Study search and selection

We performed both computerised and manual searching of articles from digital dissertation databases, including Google Scholar, CINAHL, MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL Register for Controlled Trials from 1950 until January 2017. We limited our search to studies involving humans only and articles published in the English language using keywords and/or medical subject headings (MeSH) for ‘rifaximin’ and ‘norfloxacin’ and ‘spontaneous bacterial peritonitis’.

Reference lists of returned search articles were manually screened. Two authors independently reviewed all articles for inclusion. First, all titles and abstracts were assessed and irrelevant articles were rejected. Second, full-text articles were assessed and studies were selected based on meeting the inclusion criteria. After identifying relevant titles, all abstracts were read and eligible articles were selected.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure—spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis recommendations specify that in patients with cirrhosis with a history of SBP, we suggest use of antibiotics for secondary SBP prophylaxis to prevent recurrent SBP (low quality, conditional recommendation), and in patients with cirrhosis in need of primary SBP prophylaxis, we suggest daily prophylactic antibiotics, although no one specific regimen is superior to another, to prevent SBP (low quality, conditional recommendation).

### Clinical outcomes and care for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a national cohort study [^ea421a30]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) leads to high rates of acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatorenal syndrome, and mortality. Population-based studies on contemporary SBP epidemiology are needed to inform care. In a large, national cohort of patients diagnosed with SBP and confirmed by ascitic fluid criteria, we characterized ascitic fluid characteristics, in-hospital and 12-month mortality, AKI, and recurrent SBP.

Approach and Results

We investigated how individual and bundled quality measures for SBP associated with outcomes after multi-level adjustment for health-system, patient clinical factors, and quality measures. Individual and bundled quality metrics were inpatient antibiotics within 48 hours, i.v. albumin, repeat paracentesis within 48 hours, recognition of SBP, and prophylactic antibiotics upon discharge. Among 4330 patients with newly diagnosed SBP, in-hospital mortality was 15.5%, and 12-month mortality was 56.6%. The incidence of stage 1 AKI was 26.6%, 15.7% for stage 2, and 22.8% for stage 3. The cumulative incidence of recurrent SBP was 10.3%. Guideline-recommended albumin was the only individual metric associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59-0.91). Receipt of a higher number of metrics from the SBP bundle was associated with progressively lower 12-month post-discharge mortality: patients who received 3, 4, and 5 SBP bundle components had 20%, 38%, and 56% lower hazard of mortality, respectively, relative to those receiving 2 or fewer (all p <0.001). The SBP bundle was associated with a lower incidence of stage 3 versus stage 0-2 AKI (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.86).

Conclusions

Prospective implementation of evidence-based SBP bundles may improve care outcomes and mortality in SBP.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^e8a262bb]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) secondary prophylaxis—Patients with a prior episode of SBP are at a very high risk of SBP recurrence, and in a landmark multicenter randomized controlled trial, the 1-year probability of developing recurrent SBP was significantly lower with norfloxacin (20%) compared with placebo (68%). A reasonable alternative to norfloxacin is oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg/day), although direct evidence in support for this regimen is lacking. Limited comparative data indicate a single-center open-label randomized trial showed rifaximin had a lower 6-month incidence of recurrent SBP compared with norfloxacin (4% vs. 14%, respectively). Similarly, high-quality data in support of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for secondary prophylaxis are lacking, and to date, prevention of spontaneous bacteremia or SBE has not been studied.

### Role of fluoroquinolones in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: meta-analysis [^0ed88d8c]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The use of antibiotics in the primary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis is controversial. Our purpose was to determine the beneficial effect of fluoroquinolones as compared with placebo in primary prophylaxis of SBP in high-risk patients with cirrhosis by using meta-analysis.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched in all languages until August 2008 for randomized placebo-controlled studies evaluating the role of fluoroquinolones in primary prevention of SBP in patients with low protein ascites (total ascitic protein, <1.5 g/dL) and without history of SBP. Two investigators independently performed literature search and data extraction, and then another investigator independently reviewed whether the studies met prespecified criteria and rechecked data extraction. Odds ratios (Peto method) for the risk reduction with fluoroquinolones were calculated for each study and combined by using a random-effects model.

Results

Four randomized controlled studies met predefined criteria. The odds ratios for developing first episode of SBP, serious infections, and mortality with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis (n = 194) versus placebo (n = 190) were 0.18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.35), 0.18 (95% CI, 0.10-0.32), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.37-0.97), respectively. All studies were unidirectional in showing the beneficial effect of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. We were limited by finding few studies with relatively small sample sizes.

Conclusions

Daily oral fluoroquinolone prophylaxis reduces the risk of development of first episode of SBP and mortality in cirrhotic patients with low total protein in the ascitic fluid. Fluoroquinolones might be advisable for the primary prophylaxis of SBP in selected high-risk patients with cirrhosis.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^0dcfae4e]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that healthcare-associated and nosocomial spontaneous bacterial infections are more likely to harbor resistance to antibiotics. Administer piperacillin/tazobactam in areas with a low prevalence of multidrug resistance and carbapenem in areas with a high prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Combine carbapenem with glycopeptides or daptomycin or linezolid in areas with a high prevalence of Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria.

### Indications for medical antibiotic prophylaxis and potential targets for antimicrobial stewardship intervention: a narrative review [^7a45d883]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Most of the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) literature has focused on antimicrobial consumption for the treatment of infections, for the prophylaxis of surgical site infection and for the prevention of endocarditis. The role of AMS for medical antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) has not been adequately addressed.

Aims

To identify targets for AMS interventions for medical AP in adult patients.

Sources

Targeted searches were conducted in PubMed.

Content

The various indications for medical AP and relevant evidence from practice guidelines are outlined. The following were identified as potential targets for AMS interventions: (a) addressing under-utilization of antibiotic-sparing strategies (e.g. for recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent soft-tissue infections, recurrent exacerbations associated with bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), (b) reducing unnecessary AP beyond recommended indications (e.g. for acute pancreatitis, bite wounds, or urinary catheter manipulations), (c) reducing the use of AP with a broader spectrum than necessary, (d) reducing the use of AP for longer than the recommended duration (e.g. AP for prevention of osteomyelitis in open fractures or AP in high-risk neutropenia), (e) evaluating the role of antibiotic cycling to prevent the emergence of resistance during prolonged AP (e.g. in recurrent urinary tract infections or prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and (f) addressing research gaps regarding appropriate indications or antibiotic regimens for medical prophylaxis.

Implications

This review summarizes current trends in AP and proposes targets for AMS interventions.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients without gastrointestinal bleeding [^e6946c83]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review relevant studies for both primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis without gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data Sources

A search of PubMed (1980-July 2010) was conducted using the terms prophylaxis, SBP, and antibiotics. A manual review of bibliographies was conducted for inclusion of relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective studies and meta-analyses published in English were included.

Data Synthesis

Ten trials and 3 meta-analyses were included. Of the 10 trials, 2 examined the use of secondary prophylaxis for prevention of subsequent episodes of SBP, 4 examined the use of primary prophylaxis to prevent an initial SBP episode, and 4 examined the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in a mixed population. Seven trials evaluated the use of an antibiotic compared to placebo or no treatment. Only 1 trial evaluated norfloxacin versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Trial duration varied from 24 days to 12 months. In general, trials examining norfloxacin as secondary prophylaxis found significantly decreased occurrence of SBP but no significant difference in mortality rates. Primary prophylaxis studies found no significant difference in the incidence of infections, including SBP, with norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin treatment but significantly lower incidence of gram-negative infections. Mixed population studies found a significantly decreased incidence of SBP but no significant difference in mortality. In the 3 meta-analyses, a significant decrease in mortality and an overall decrease in SBP incidence in the treatment groups were noted.

Conclusions

Based on currently available data, the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy is warranted for the prevention of recurrent SBP in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In patients with low ascetic fluid protein and at least 1 more risk factor, primary prophylaxis may be considered. Further studies with improved methodology are needed to determine whether prophylactic antibiotic therapy has an impact on mortality.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites, without gastro-intestinal bleeding [^a1c3492c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is frequent among cirrhotic patients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Selective intestinal decontamination employing antibiotics is a proposed prophylactic measure. While data regarding this modality among cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding exist, there is insufficient data synthesis regarding cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

To assess whether antibiotic prophylaxis decreases spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality among cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding.

Search Strategy

We identified relevant randomised trials by searching trial registries of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group and The Cochrane Collaboration, medical literature search engines, and reviewing all literature we found on the topic until February 2009.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised clinical trials assessing prophylactic treatment among adult cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding, comparing antibiotic therapy with no intervention, placebo, or with another antibiotic regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three independent authors searched for and collected the trials and extracted relevant data. Four other independent authors validated the findings and assessed them. The studies were assessed for design, patient and intervention characteristics, and quality. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate measures of association between antibiotic prophylaxis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or mortality.

Main Results

Nine trials were included in the review. Seven trials, comparing antibiotics to placebo or no treatment, were meta-analysed. Systematic bias in design or publication is suggested by trial results. The randomisation results suggest that the probability that true randomisation took place in all trials is very small and the report of most trials regarding design was poor. The proportion of participants with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis varied between the trials from 15% to 50%. The calculated relative risks (95% confidence interval) of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality among patients treated with antibiotics compared with no treatment/placebo were 0.20 (0.11 to 0.37) and 0.61 (0.43 to 0.87). There were very few reports of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled estimates suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis might be prudent among cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding. However, poor trial methodology and report coupled with findings suggesting systematic bias in publication and design reflect the fragility of these findings. Potential hazard to society and the patients themselves from resistant pathogens should be considered when promoting long-lasting antibiotic prophylaxis. It seems that recommending antibiotic prophylaxis is still far from being a substantiated prevention strategy. Trials of better design, well reported, and of longer follow-up are greatly needed.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^b6015ea4]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Moderate-quality evidence (per the GRADE system) shows that the use of long-term rifaximin could be considered as a reasonable alternative to norfloxacin for patients with a qualifying indication for SBP prophylaxis in hepatitis C-related chronic liver disease. With the growing evidence of its use for hepatic encephalopathy,it may be an attractive choice to improve compliance in using a single antibiotic for dual purposes. Further high-quality, higher powered studies are required to firmly establish rifaximin as the first-line therapy for SBP prevention.

### Outcomes in patients with cirrhosis on primary compared to secondary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^e7c945b9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for prevention of the first episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP; primary prophylaxis 1°) and subsequent episodes (secondary prophylaxis 2°). We aimed to compare outcomes in cirrhotic inpatients on 1° vs 2° SBP prophylaxis.

Methods

Data from North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease were evaluated for cirrhosis details, reasons for admission/medications, inpatient course recorded, and outcomes over 90 days. Outcomes (intensive care units, acute kidney injury, inpatient/90-day mortality) were compared between the 2 groups after propensity-matching on admission model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and serum albumin.

Results

Among the 2,731 patients enrolled, 305 were on 1° and 187 on 2° SBP prophylaxis. After propensity-matching, 154 patients remained in each group. Patients on 1° prophylaxis were more likely to have admission systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = 0.02), with higher intensive care unit admissions (31% vs 21%; P = 0.05) and inpatient mortality (19% vs 9%; P = 0.01) than the 2° prophylaxis group. Patients on 2° prophylaxis had higher total (22% vs 10%; P = 0004), readmission (16% vs 9%; P = 0.03), and nosocomial (6% vs 0.5%; P = 0.01) SBP rates with predominant Gram-negative organisms compared to 1° prophylaxis patients. At 90 days, 1° prophylaxis patients had a higher mortality (35% vs 22%; P = 0.02) and acute kidney injury incidence (48% vs 30%; P = 0.04) compared to 2° prophylaxis patients.

Discussion

In this inpatient cirrhosis study, despite prophylaxis, a high proportion of patients developed SBP, which was associated with mortality. Cirrhotic inpatients on 1° prophylaxis had worse outcomes than those on 2° prophylaxis when propensity-matched for the MELD score and serum albumin during the index admission and 90-day follow-up.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Table 1—Recommendations on medications and prophylaxis for infection in cirrhosis state that in patients with cirrhosis with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), we suggest use of antibiotics for secondary SBP prophylaxis to prevent recurrent SBP. In patients with cirrhosis in need of primary SBP prophylaxis, we suggest daily prophylactic antibiotics, although no one specific regimen is superior to another, to prevent SBP. In patients with cirrhosis, we suggest avoiding proton pump inhibitor (PPI) unless there is a clear indication because PPI increases the risk of infection.

### Norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and rifaximin for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a network meta-analysis [^7a47c859]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

For the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended as a standard regimen. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of norfloxacin (N), ciprofloxacin (C), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (T-S), and rifaximin (R) in the prevention of SBP. We searched the electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science from inception till 1 August 2018. The randomized-controlled trials that compared N, C, T-S, R, and placebo (P) were identified. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was carried out using the software STATA 14.0 and Revman 5.3. We included 16 studies involving 1984 participants in the NMA for SBP prevention. The NMA results showed that, compared with those treated with P (reference), patients treated with C, N, or R had a lower incidence of SBP and mortality. Similarly, the incidences of SBP and mortality for R were lower than those for N. The probabilities of ranking results showed that R ranked first with respect to the outcomes of the incidence of SBP and mortality. According to our results, R seemed to be the optimal regimen for protecting against SBP in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. However, considering the limitations of our study, additional high-quality studies are required in this respect.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^be822d84]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in the prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as compared with norfloxacin.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases from inception to January 2017. Reference lists of articles as well as conference proceedings were manually screened. We included studies that recruited patients with cirrhosis and ascites who met the criteria for primary or secondary SBP prophylaxis as defined by the European Association for the Study of the Liver and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Two independent investigators reviewed the studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was occurrence of SBP. Secondary outcomes included mortality and adverse events with therapy.

Results

Of the 435 studies identified, a total of five were included for full-text review. Four studies were eligible for the systematic review, three of which were randomised controlled trials and one was a prospective observational study. The population examined in majority of studies was primarily hepatitis C cirrhosis. The results of individual studies indicated either superior efficacy of rifaximin or no statistical difference between rifaximin and norfloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.

Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence shows that long-term use of rifaximin appears to be a reasonable alternative to norfloxacin for SBP prevention in hepatitis C cirrhosis.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^8d018203]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Summary of all recommendations

Recommendations: primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 2) 
What is the best method for primary prophylaxis? We recommend non-cardioselective β blockers (NSBB) or variceal band ligation (VBL). We suggest pharmacological treatment with propranolol as first line. VBL is offered if there are contraindications to NSBB. The choice of VBL or NSBB should also take into account patient choice (level 1a, grade A). We suggest carvedilol or nadolol as alternatives to propranolol (level 1b, grade A). Dose: Propranolol: 40 mg twice daily. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once heart rate (HR) of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg (level 1a, grade A). Nadolol: 40 mg daily dose. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached a maximum dose of 240 mg (level 1a, grade A). Carvedilol: 6.25 mg once daily to increase to maintenance of 12.5 mg after a week if tolerated or once HR of <50–55 bpm is reached (level 1a, grade A). It is suggested that NSBB are discontinued at the time of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal impairment and hypotension (level 2b, grade B). In cases of contraindications or intolerance to NSBB, we recommend variceal band ligation (level 1a, grade A).
Who should have surveillance for variceal bleeding? We recommend all patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at the time of diagnosis (level 1a, grade A). There is no indication to repeat endoscopy in patients receiving NSBB.
How often should cirrhotic patients be endoscoped? If at the time of first endoscopy no varices are seen, we suggest that patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at 2–3-year intervals (level 2a, grade B). If grade I varices are diagnosed, we suggest that patients should be endoscoped at yearly intervals (level 2a, grade B). If there is clear evidence of disease progression we suggest that the intervals can be modified by the clinician. Endoscopy should also be offered at time of decompensation (level 2a, grade B).
Which patients with cirrhosis should have primary prophylaxis? If grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices are diagnosed, we recommend that patients have primary prophylaxis irrespective of the severity of the liver disease (level 1a, grade A).
Treatments not recommended: Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B). Isosorbide mononitrate monotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1b, grade A). There is insufficient evidence to recommend isosorbide mononitrate in combination with NSBB (level 1b, grade A). Shunt surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A). Sclerotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of NSBB in patients without varices, with focus on carvedilol. Role of NSBB in patients with small varices, with focus on carvedilol. Comparison of carvedilol versus propranolol in primary prophylaxis. Identification of, and trials assessing, new drugs for primary prophylaxis such as statins.
Quality indicator: Percentage of patients at diagnosis of cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy to screen for varices (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy either before or after diagnosis within 6 months. Denominator; patients newly diagnosed with cirrhosis. Percentage of patients receiving primary prophylaxis among those newly diagnosed with grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices. Numerator; patients who have grade 1 varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices receiving primary prophylaxis. Denominator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have grade I varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^f35bc3c3]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis, a major global health burden, accounts for ∼1 million deaths every year.Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the most serious and life-threatening complications of cirrhosis, now carrying an in-hospital mortality of 16–23% in the USA.The proposed mechanism for development of SBP is translocation of intestinal bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes and the ascitic fluid.On surviving an incident episode of SBP, the recurrence rate is ∼70% at 1 year.High recurrences coupled with substantial mortality warrant long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent SBP.Various oral antibiotics have been studied to reduce the risk of occurrence and recurrence of SBP by achieving ‘selective intestinal decontamination’.The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommend norfloxacin, a systemic antibiotic, as the first-line therapy for this purpose.

Rifaximin is a broad-spectrum ansamicin antibiotic that is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby reaches high levels in the gut lumen.Its role as an initial and add-on therapy for hepatic encephalopathy has been well established.Moreover, it has recently been evaluated as a prophylactic antibiotic to reduce the risk of recurrence of SBP. We conducted a systematic review to compare rifaximin to the standard of care (norfloxacin) for primary or secondary prevention of SBP.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^bb9dd015]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil >250/mm 3 count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count <1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium <125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of >5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of <5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^365b8109]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Preventing progression to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)—the first principle is the treatment or prevention of possible precipitating factors, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and bacterial infections, and avoiding LVP without albumin administration. For example, IV albumin, together with antibiotics, reduces the incidence of HRS-AKI and improves survival in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), whereas albumin in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections other than SBP neither prevents HRS-AKI nor improves survival.

### Ciprofloxacin in primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^37510101]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Low protein concentration in ascitic fluid has been identified as a risk factor for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Until now, primary prophylaxis has not been recommended in these patients. The aim was to investigate the efficacy of long-term administration of ciprofloxacin to prevent SBP.

Methods

One hundred cirrhotic patients with <1.5 g/dl of total protein in ascitic fluid were randomized prospectively, in a double blind fashion to receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg/day (n=50) or placebo (n=50) for 12 months.

Results

Baseline data were similar in both groups. In the ciprofloxacin group, SBP occurred almost four times less frequently than in the placebo group but it was not statistically significant. The probability of survival at 12 months was significantly higher in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (86% versus 66%) (p<0.04). SBP and sepsis were the most frequent causes of death in the placebo group whereas gastrointestinal bleeding was responsible for the most deaths in the ciprofloxacin group. The probability of remaining free of bacterial infections was higher in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (80% versus 55%) (p=0.05).

Conclusions

Patients with cirrhosis and low protein concentration in ascitic fluid are candidates to receive long-term prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infections and improve survival.

2Fever can be an important indicator and is often the only sign or symptom of infection, although clinicians should also be mindful that patients who are severely or profoundly neutropenic may present with suspected infection in an afebrile, or even hypothermic, state. Prevention and appropriate management of febrile neutropenia are important, because the rate of major complications in the context of febrile neutropenia is approximately 25% to 30%, and mortality may reach 11%. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is an intervention that can reduce the risk of infection in immunosuppressed patients. However, because of drug-related adverse effects as well as concerns with antimicrobial resistance, cost considerations, and the physiologic importance to the host of maintenance of equilibrium in the diversity and density of the host microbiome, the decision to administer prophylaxis requires a balance of benefits versus harms.

The previous version of this guideline recommended antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis for higher-risk patients and recommended that there was not a high enough baseline risk of febrile neutropenia and infection-related mortality in lower-risk patients to warrant routine administration of these agents. 6This version of the guideline includes updated meta-analyses of antimicrobial interventions for the prevention of febrile neutropenia. 6, 7ASCO methodology relies on analysis of strength and quality of evidence; IDSA employs the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation system to assess quality of evidence and to develop evidence-based recommendations. 8This guideline employs the ASCO methodology and grading system. This guideline cannot be considered a comprehensive resource for the prevention of infection in patients with cancer.

For guidance on outpatient management of febrile neutropenia, please consult the recently updated joint ASCO/IDSA guideline, Outpatient Management of Fever and Neutropenia in Adults Treated for Malignancy. 9For recommendations about the use of colony-stimulating factors in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma, please refer to the Recommendations for the Use of WBC Growth Factors: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline Update. 10For more specific guidelines about the prevention and treatment of infections in recipients of stem-cell transplantations, please consult the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation/IDSA guidelines. 11Additional information is available at www. asco. org/supportive-care-guidelines.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^c7efe9d9]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the role of albumin for improving outcomes in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is unclear. The trial data specific to this patient population are limited. The two largest RCTs failed to provide an explicit fluid resuscitation protocol for the patients randomized to no albumin, raising the concern for underresuscitation in the control arms of both studies. When similar albumin dosing strategies were used in trials examining patients with cirrhosis and extraperitoneal infections, no benefit was seen and concern for harm was expressed.The panel suggested the use of albumin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (conditional recommendation), but raised concerns regarding the dosing protocol used in two of the four trials and the risk of fluid overload (1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1.0 g/kg on day 3) and the lack of data suggesting this specific regimen is beneficial compared with alternative dosing (eg, lower dose daily for 3 days). The panel also considered the lack of clarity on whether albumin is necessary for all patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or whether it could be used selectively (ie, patients at high risk of kidney failure or death: serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dL or serum creatinine >1 mg/dL). Additional studies are necessary to address dosing, to address the benefit for patients with and without kidney impairment, and to clarify the risks of adverse events. The panel also noted that not all physicians currently adhere to the trial dosing strategy,, although it continues to be recommended in current guidelines. A careful assessment of the patient’s volume status, cardiovascular status, and degree of kidney impairment before transfusion is advised and the dose, frequency, or both being modified accordingly. In contrast, the RCTs find no support for the use of albumin in patients with cirrhosis and extraperitoneal infections.

Acute kidney injury prevention in cirrhosis—key measures emphasize that the use of albumin in addition to antibiotics is recommended in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) to prevent HRS-AKI and subsequent organ failures but not recommended in non-SBP infections, with additional strategies including judicious use of laxatives and diuretics, albumin infusions with large-volume paracentesis, prompt treatment of gastrointestinal bleeds with antibiotic prophylaxis in established gastrointestinal bleeds, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs or radiographic dye, and primary SBP prophylaxis in high-risk individuals with secondary prophylaxis after the first SBP episode; because repeated AKI episodes can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD predisposes to AKI, treating causes of CKD is important to break the AKI/CKD cycle.

The guideline states: “Remaining current with routine cirrhosis-related management prior to elective surgery, including hepatocellular carcinoma screening, optimization of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, variceal screening and/or bleeding prophylaxis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis when indicated, may mitigate operative risk.” It further specifies that “Patients with hepatic encephalopathy should have lactulose and/or rifaximin continued through the perioperative period, with close attention to serum sodium and minimization of medications that may exacerbate encephalopathy,” and that “Patients taking nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs, e.g., carvedilol) for CSPH or secondary prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding should continue these medications in the peri-operative period, provided that the systolic blood pressure is over 90 mm Hg.” For unclear variceal status, “upper endoscopy should be performed and NSBBs or band ligation should be pursued for large varices or medium varices with high-risk stigmata,” and “Hepatocellular carcinoma screening should be up-to-date, especially as diagnosis of liver cancer may affect surgical decision-making and transplant consideration in selected patients.”

### Quinolone and multidrug resistance predicts failure of antibiotic prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^399d87e0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) is unknown. We evaluated the effectiveness of fluoroquinolone-based SBP prophylaxis in an era and area of frequent antibiotic resistance.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study in patients with liver cirrhosis and an indication for fluoroquinolone-based prophylaxis of SBP. Patients were recruited and followed in a large German tertiary reference center with comprehensive microbiological and clinical monitoring performed at baseline and after 30, 60, 90, and 180 days of prophylaxis.

Results

Overall, 77 patients received antibiotic prophylaxis for an average of 93 days. Baseline prevalence of colonization with MDROs was high (N = 39, 50.6%). At least one de novo MDRO was detected in 27 patients (35.1%) during antibiotic prophylaxis; 33 patients (42.9%) developed secondary infections, including 14 cases (17.9%) of infections with MDROs, and 13 cases (16.9%) of de novo/recurrent SBP. Thirty patients (39.0%) died during follow-up. Significantly higher risks of SBP development during antibiotic prophylaxis were observed for patients with versus without any apparent MDROs (P = .009), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (P = .008), multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (P = .016), or quinolone-resistant gram-negative bacteria (QR-GNB) (P = .015). In competing risk analysis, QR-GNB were independently associated with prophylaxis failure (hazard ratio, 3.39; P = .045) and infections with QR-GNB were independently associated with death before SBP (subdistribution hazard risk, 6.47; P = .034).

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis of SBP appears to be less efficient in patients with known MDROs. Regular MDRO screening seems to be useful to tailor treatment of secondary infections and re-evaluate antibiotic prophylaxis in case of selection of quinolone resistance.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^0d952e48]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the development of bacterial infection of ascites in the absence of any intra-abdominal surgically treatable source of infection. The prevalence of SBP in outpatients is 1.5–3.5% and approximately 10% in hospitalised patients.A recent European study detected a prevalence of 11.3% among inpatients.When first described, mortality associated with SBP exceeded 90%, but, in-hospital mortality has been reduced to approximately 20% with early diagnosis and prompt treatment.In an observational study, each hour of delay in diagnostic paracentesis after admission was associated with a 3.3% increase of in-hospital mortality after adjusting for model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score.Long-term survival remains poor; 1-year survival after hospitalisation with SBP in a UK study was found to be 34%.Patients recovering from an episode of SBP should always be considered as potential candidates for liver transplantation if they have not already been assessed.

### Daily norfloxacin vs. weekly ciprofloxacin to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized controlled trial [^6286f700]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

For the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites, norfloxacin 400mg per day is recommended as a standard regimen. This study aims to investigate whether ciprofloxacin once weekly administration is not inferior to norfloxacin once daily administration for the prevention of SBP.

Methods

This is an investigator-initiated open-label randomized controlled trial conducted at seven tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Liver cirrhosis patients with ascites were screened, and enrolled in this randomized controlled trial if ascitic protein ≤1.5g/dL or the presence of history of SBP. Ascitic polymorphonucleated cell count needed to be <250/mm 3 . Patients were randomly assigned into norfloxacin daily or ciprofloxacin weekly group, and followed-up for 12 months. Primary endpoint was the prevention of SBP.

Results

One hundred twenty-four patients met enrollment criteria and were assigned into each group by 1:1 ratio (62:62). Seven patients in the norfloxacin group and five patients in the ciprofloxacin group were lost to follow-up. SBP developed in four patients (4/55) and in three patients (3/57) in each group, respectively (7.3% vs. 5.3%, P=0.712). The transplant-free survival rates at 1 year were comparable between the groups (72.7% vs. 73.7%, P=0.970). Incidence of infectious complication, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding rates were not significantly different (all P=ns). The factors related to survival were models representing underlying liver function.

Conclusion

Once weekly ciprofloxacin was as effective as daily norfloxacin for the prevention of SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

In 2015, Mostafa et al conducted a single-centre randomised trial and enrolled 70 patients at the National Liver Institute in Egypt who were previously diagnosed with SBP—the definition of which was any prior ascitic fluid with >250 PMNL, with or without positive culture, and an absence of other source of intraabdominal infection. The aetiology of cirrhosis in all patients was hepatitis C. Patients were excluded if they had hepatocellular carcinoma or active/recent gastrointestinal bleeding. Forty patients were assigned to the rifaximin group, receiving 800 mg per day, and 30 patients to the norfloxacin group, receiving 400 mg per day. Therapy was given for 6 months. Three months after initiation of therapy, there were five patients in the norfloxacin group (16.67%) who developed SBP compared with none in the rifaximin group. The study was designed specifically to measure outcomes of blood levels of liver function tests, cytokines and other markers of inflammation with time, thus no p value for the outcome of recurrent SBP was stated.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^bc9b4977]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin administration after large-volume paracentesis (LVP) (>5 L) and in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) has been recommended by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines, as is the use of albumin together with vasoconstrictors in the management of HRS-AKI. Other uses of albumin are controversial and require further research before they can be widely recommended. –

In a recent European surveycompleted by 101 hepatologists practicing at 86 centers (75% academic hospitals), the vast majority (93%–97%) of participants used i.v. albumin for guideline-recommended settings, specifically, after LVP for the prevention of post–paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PCD), prevention of renal failure after SBP, and diagnosis and management of HRS-AKI. However, up to a third of practitioners from tertiary and university hospitals admitted to using albumin in settings where albumin use is not recommended, specifically non-SBP infections, severe hyponatremia, HE, and long-term use for the treatment of ascites. Interestingly and inexplicably, half of the respondents would recommend i.v. albumin solely for hypoalbuminemia. In addition, even for recommended indications, doses used were not the ones recommended based on clinical trials. This mirrors the reality of clinical medicine when the label of the medication is broad and where costs and perceived benefits of a drug have an influence on practice, even in the absence of supportive evidence.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^377940d5]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Rifaximin has minimal systemic side effects and is a fairly well-tolerated medication.It has very low absorption in healthy volunteers; however, it is significantly increased in patients with advanced liver disease, although there are no definitive data whether to recommend or to avoid its use in this population.Fluoroquinolones, on the other hand, are readily absorbed and may have notable systemic side effects. Serious ones include tendinopathies and QTc prolongation, predisposing to life-threatening arrhythmias.These side effects are more common with ciprofloxacin than norfloxacin, owing to its higher systemic absorption.Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the other agent that has been used for SBP prophylaxis, has an unfavourable side-effect profile as well, with hyperkalaemia, hypersensitivity reactions and cytopenias being the limiting ones.The dual use of one single agent for prevention of both hepatic encephalopathy and SBP in the same patient makes rifaximin an ideal choice in this setting. Randomised trials and systematic reviews have clearly demonstrated its benefits in the treatment and prevention of hepatic encephalopathy.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis microbiology—spontaneous infections are typically monobacterial, with the most common (~60%) being gram-negative bacteria and with fungi representing less than 5% of infections; specific microorganisms are mostly enteric, with the most common being Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium; more recently, there has been a shift toward gram-positive and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), particularly in nosocomial and health care–associated SBP; infections by MDRO represent 35% of overall infections in patients with cirrhosis.

### A comparison of outcomes of standard weight-based and capped doses of albumin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^8ba3f7f4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin is recommended in the management of patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) to reduce rates of renal injury and mortality. Current guideline recommendations suggest an intravenous albumin dosing regimen of 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3, although a maximum dosing strategy is not well-defined.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in renal injury for patients with SBP treated with a capped dose less than or equal to 100 g vs a weight-based dose greater than 100 g.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted at a single academic medical center for patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis treated with albumin for SBP. The primary outcome examined rates of acute renal injury at 5 days between patients treated with capped dose vs weight-based doses of intravenous albumin. Secondary outcomes included resolution of SBP by day 5, death by day 5, death by day 30, and change in serum creatinine from day 0 to day 5.

Results

In total, 258 patient encounters were analyzed, with 154 included in this study. There were 70 encounters encompassing the capped dose and 84 in the non-capped. Acute renal injury at day 5 was observed in 10% (n = 7) of the capped dosed group and 6% (n = 5) of the non-capped group ( P = 0.381).

Conclusion and Relevance

This study did not show a significant difference in outcomes associated with a capped albumin dose at 100 g for SBP. Application of these data may aid in reducing health system and patient costs.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^f0c867dd]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis management—IV antibiotics should be started empirically (before obtaining culture results) in all patients with an ascites PMN count >250/mm^3; patients with a focal intraabdominal inflammatory entity (e.g., diverticulitis, cholecystitis) may have an ascites PMN count >250/mm^3 and should be treated not for SBP but for the specific condition per standard of care, including a surgical consult; traditionally, third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) were recommended in all patients with SBP, with resolution rates of approximately 90%, and currently they are recommended as the first-line antibiotics (e.g., IV cefotaxime 2 g every 12 hours) in settings where MDROs are not prevalent; inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy in patients admitted with septic shock increases the risk of death by 10 times.

### Randomized-controlled trial of rifaximin versus norfloxacin for secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^58d9d6ec]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis with a high recurrence rate and a marked increase in mortality. Norfloxacin is used widely for the secondary prophylaxis of SBP; however, its extensive long-term use has led to an increase in the incidence of quinolone-resistant and Gram-positive SBP. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antibiotic and does not appear to promote emergence of resistance. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of rifaximin versus norfloxacin for the secondary prevention of SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites.

Materials and Methods

Two hundred and sixty two cirrhotic patients with ascites and a previous episode of SBP were assigned randomly to receive either 1200mg rifaximin or 400mg of norfloxacin daily for 6 months. All patients were monitored clinically each month and with ascitic fluid examination at the end of 2 and 6 months if not clinically suspected of recurrence earlier.

Results

Recurrence of SBP was significantly lower in the rifaximin group (3.88 vs. 14.13%) compared with the norfloxacin group (P=0.04). The mortality rate was significantly decreased in the rifaximin group (13.74 vs. 24.43%) compared with the norfloxacin group (P=0.044). The causes of death between the two groups did not show a significant difference (P=0.377), but encephalopathy-related deaths were three folds higher in the norfloxacin group. There was a significant decrease in the side effects in the rifaximin group versus the norfloxacin group (P=0.033).

Conclusion

Rifaximin was more effective than norfloxacin in the secondary prevention of SBP. Encephalopathy-related mortality and side effects were fewer in the rifaximin group.

Bacterial infections in cirrhosis—epidemiology and acquisition categories indicate that bacterial infections are present in approximately one-third of patients with cirrhosis who are hospitalized, and spontaneous infections accounted for 36% of infections, followed by urinary tract infection (22%), pneumonia (19%), and skin/soft tissue infections (8%). Approximately half of infections were community acquired and present at or within the first 48 hours of admission with no prior contact with a health care facility for >90 days; a quarter was health care associated (diagnosed within 48 hours of admission in patients with contact with a health care facility <90 days), and the remaining 25% were nosocomial, defined as acquisition of the infection >48 hours after admission.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^60e5d09f]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Design

We conducted a cross-sectional study to develop a diagnostic model for the early and accurate diagnosis of SBP.

Study population

The retrospective study was conducted at Beijing You-An Hospital, Capital Medical University, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, and Beijing Ditan Hospital between January 2017 and December 2018. We continuously recruited 1618 patients with ascites who underwent abdominal paracentesis. Data related to the clinical features, history, demographic information, physical examination, and laboratory test results were collected. Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis was routinely performed in all cirrhotic ascites patients as well as those with suspicion of SBP. Cirrhosis was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria suggested by the 2019 guidelines for the management of cirrhosis. The study included patients aged 18–90 years with cirrhosis and ascites. We excluded patients with any factors that may affect the diagnosis of SBP, namely antibiotic use, use of SBP prophylaxis, ascites without cirrhosis (such as due to pancreatitis, peritoneal cancer, tuberculosis, heart failure, kidney disease, or intraabdominal bleeding), malignant tumors, hematological diseases, abdominal surgery within the past 3 months, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal diseases (such as gastritis, enteritis, or intestinal obstruction), chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the past 1 month, pregnancy, secondary peritonitis, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or contraceptives, bacterial infections other than SBP, recent bleeding, other causes of fever (such as HIV infection), other infections or diseases that may affect the blood, white blood cell (WBC) count or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (e.g. skin or chest infections), or other diseases that can cause elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (e.g. myocardial infarction or myositis). Patients underwent medical history, general examination, abdominal examination, abdominal ultrasound, laboratory tests, routine diagnostic abdominal paracentesis, and ascitic fluid analysis. Patients were divided into three groups: training, internal validation, and external validation. The training group included 70% of patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites (n = 757) from Beijing You-An Hospital and Beijing Ditan Hospital to develop the scoring system. The internal validation group included the remaining 30% of participants with liver cirrhosis and ascites (n = 324) to validate the diagnostic performance of this scoring system. The external validation group recruited patients (n = 367) from The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital to further validate the model.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^333a460d]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial infection is one of the most common complications leading to acute decompensation and death in cirrhosis. Despite the use of antibiotics, bacterial infections severely impact patient outcomes, increase hospital costs, and extend hospital stays. However, the accumulated mortality of patients with cirrhosis after infections is almost 43.5%. Therefore, bacterial infection can lead to worsened prognosis.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most common infection in decompensated cirrhosis patients, accounting for 40–70% of all infections. SBP is a recurring, fatal bacterial infection, with an incidence of 3.5% in symptom-free patients and 10–30% in hospitalized patients. SBP was first described in English medical literature in the 1960s as a syndrome with an exceedingly poor prognosis and in-hospital mortality rate of almost 100%. In recent years, the prognosis of SBP has improved considerably due to effective antibiotic treatment. However, due to immune dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis, the mortality rate remains as high as 30%. Delayed diagnosis of SBP leads to rapid disease progression and further deterioration of immune function, which leads to decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. At this stage, the liver function continues to deteriorate and the prognosis is poor despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Therefore, delayed diagnosis of SBP affects the outcome and prognosis of treatment, and consequently, the diagnosis should not be missed or delayed. Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with liver cirrhosis could result in an increase in infection due to resistant bacterial strains. Therefore, the early and accurate diagnosis of SBP is particularly important.

### Response-guided therapy with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized trial: a validation study of 2021 AASLD practice guidance for SBP [^ba7c169f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin were used as first-line agents. However, considering the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance, it is unclear which of these drugs can be initially recommended. This study aimed to compare the current efficacy of the 3 antibiotics, namely cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, for the treatment of SBP in patients with cirrhosis with ascites, when guided by therapeutic responses.

Methods

This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The inclusion criteria were 16- to 75-year-old patients with liver cirrhosis with ascites, having polymorphonuclear cell count of >250/mm 3 . We performed a follow-up paracentesis at 48 hours to decide continuing or changing the assigned antibiotics and then assessed the resolution rates at 120 and 168 hours of treatment.

Results

A total of 261 patients with cirrhosis who developed SBP were enrolled. Most of the patients were diagnosed as those with SBP within 48 hours of admission. The resolution rates at 120 hours, which is the primary endpoint, were 67.8%, 77.0%, and 73.6% in the cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively ( P = 0.388), by intension-to-treat analysis. The 1-month mortality was similar among the groups ( P = 0.770). The model for end-stage liver disease score and the SBP resolution were significant factors for survival.

Conclusion

The efficacy of empirical antibiotics, such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, against SBP was not significantly different. In addition, these antibiotics administered based on response-guided therapy were still efficacious as initial treatment for SBP, especially in those with community-acquired infections.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of... [^b8cf1ba0]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

In the general population aged ≥60 years, if pharmacologic treatment for high BP results in lower achieved SBP and treatment is well tolerated and without adverse effects on health or quality of life, treatment does not need to be adjusted. In the general population <60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at DBP ≥90 mm Hg and treat to a goal DBP <90 mm Hg. . In 2 of the trials that provide evidence supporting an SBP goal lower than 150 mm Hg, the average treated SBP was 143 to 144 mm Hg. 2, 3 Many participants in those studies achieved an SBP lower than 140 mm Hg with treatment that was generally well tolerated.

Two other trials9, 10 suggest there was no benefit for an SBP goal lower than 140 mm Hg, but the confidence intervals around the effect sizes were wide and did not exclude the possibility of a clinically important benefit. While all panel members agreed that the evidence supporting recommendation 1 is very strong, the panel was unable to reach unanimity on the recommendation of a goal SBP of lower than 150 mm Hg. Some members recommended continuing the JNC 7 SBP goal of lower than 140 mm Hg for individuals older than 60 years based on expert opinion. 12 These members concluded that the evidence was insufficient to raise the SBP target from lower than 140 to lower than 150 mm Hg in high-risk groups, such as black persons, those with CVD including stroke, and those with multiple risk factors. In the general population younger than 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher and treat to a goal SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg.

Recommendation 3 is based on expert opinion. While there is high-quality evidence to support a specific SBP threshold and goal for persons aged 60 years or older, the panel found insufficient evidence from good- or fair-quality RCTs to support a specific SBP threshold or goal for persons younger than 60 years. In the absence of such evidence, the panel recommends an SBP treatment threshold of 140 mm Hg or higher and an SBP treatment goal of lower than 140 mm Hg based on several factors.

### Primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis delays hepatorenal syndrome and improves survival in cirrhosis [^5816b21c]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Norfloxacin is highly effective in preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence in cirrhosis, but its role in the primary prevention of this complication is uncertain.

Methods

Patients with cirrhosis and low protein ascitic levels (<15 g/L) with advanced liver failure (Child-Pugh score > or = 9 points with serum bilirubin level > or = 3 mg/dL) or impaired renal function (serum creatinine level > or = 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > or = 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < or = 130 mEq/L) were included in a randomized controlled trial aimed at comparing norfloxacin (35 patients) vs placebo (33 patients) in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The main end points of the trial were 3-month and 1-year probability of survival. Secondary end points were 1-year probability of development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Results

Norfloxacin administration reduced the 1-year probability of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (7% vs 61%, P < .001) and hepatorenal syndrome (28% vs 41%, P = .02), and improved the 3-month (94% vs 62%, P = .003) and the 1-year (60% vs 48%, P = .05) probability of survival compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Primary prophylaxis with norfloxacin has a great impact in the clinical course of patients with advanced cirrhosis. It reduces the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, delays the development of hepatorenal syndrome, and improves survival.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^835422f7]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this systematic review is to compare the efficacy of rifaximin with the standard of care (norfloxacin) in the prevention of SBP. Our review is based on summarising evidence from three randomised controlled trials and 1 prospective observational study.In brief, the trial by Elfert et al was remarkable for significantly superior efficacy of rifaximin, while Shamseya and Madkour and Assem et al showed statistically insignificant difference between rifaximin and norfloxacin.Another trial by Mostafa et al showed a numerical difference in event rate favouring rifaximin for SBP prevention.It appears that rifaximin may have a role in prophylaxis of SBP in patients with cirrhosis. It may also be associated with a greater reduction in the risk of death in these patients, compared with norfloxacin. The clinical relevance of this review stems from the high mortality associated with SBP in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Hanouneh et al first studied rifaximin for prevention of SBP. They compared it with placebo in a group of 404 patients with cirrhotic ascites and found a 72% reduction in the occurrence rate of SBP for rifaximin as compared with placebo. Another study by Vlachogiannakos et al demonstrated significantly lower risks of variceal bleeds, SBP, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome in the rifaximin group compared with matched controls. Lutz et al conducted a study evaluating the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis with rifaximin versus ciprofloxacin for SBP prevention in 152 patients with cirrhotic ascites. They found the SBP prevention rate to be higher in the ciprofloxacin group, than both rifaximin and placebo groups. However, the follow-up duration was extremely short (4 weeks) and the patient population was small (17 patients in ciprofloxacin group). We limited our review to studies evaluating long-term SBP prophylaxis and excluded studies with follow-up periods <3 months.

Albumin in cirrhosis with infection and SBP indicates benefit and dosing: IV albumin improves survival in patients with cirrhosis and SBP, with those who most benefited having renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen >30 mg/dL or creatinine >1.0 mg/dL) or severe hepatic decompensation (bilirubin >5 mg/dL). In an infection other than SBP, IV albumin has been used in the same doses (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3); it has remained the standard recommendation. Alternatively, following the recommendations for the use of albumin in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) would also be appropriate.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^fb6bf4bf]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

The high cost might limit the use of rifaximin. A cost and outcome analysis of using rifaximin ± lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, in addition to norfloxacin for SBP prophylaxis, compared with using rifaximin ± lactulose alone would be of clinical interest. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that Assem et al proposed an alternating regimen of norfloxacin and rifaximin, which presumably has differing bioeffects on the body and had better efficacy than norfloxacin.

There are several limitations to our review. The number of studies and the patient groups in each study are independently small. Elfert et al presented data regarding SBP as per-protocol treatment analysis. However, lost to follow-up information was explicitly stated in the study, thus minimising the risk of bias. There is clinical heterogeneity among the individual studies, particularly in relation to the indication for SBP prophylaxis (primary vs secondary) and the aetiology of chronic liver disease. Our conclusion may only be applicable to a particular group of patients with ascites, notably that the vast majority of included patients had hepatitis C-related cirrhosis. There is some literature suggesting that alcoholic cirrhotics are at a higher risk of bacterial infections than patients with non-alcoholic cirrhosis.Whether a particular cause of cirrhosis leads to a higher risk of development of SBP is still largely unknown and requires further investigation.These studies are incidentally from the same geographic region and thus the results may not be applicable to the demographics and characteristics of cirrhotics in the Western world, where other aetiologies such as alcohol may be more prevalent.

### Higher rate of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence with secondary spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis compared with No prophylaxis in 2 national cirrhosis cohorts [^60ec37e6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) bacteriology has changed over time. Reappraisal of primary SBP prophylaxis showed an increased rate of resistance in patients on primary prophylaxis with resultant discontinuation of this prophylaxis throughout the Veterans Affairs (VA). We aimed to re-evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of secondary SBP prophylaxis (SecSBPPr).

Methods

Using validated International Classification of Diseases-9/10 codes, we used the VA Corporate Data Warehouse and the Non-VA National TriNetX database to identify patients in 2 different large US systems who survived their first SBP diagnosis (with chart review from 2 VA centers) between 2009 and 2019. We evaluated the prevalence of SecSBPPr and compared outcomes between those who started on SecSBPPr vs not.

Results

We identified 4,673 veterans who survived their index SBP episode; 54.3% of whom were prescribed SecSBPPr. Multivariable analysis showed higher SBP recurrence risk in those on vs off SecSBPPr (hazards ratio 1.63 [1.40-1.91], P < 0.001). This was accompanied by higher fluoroquinolone resistance odds in SecSBPPr patients (odds ratio = 4.32 [1.36-15.83], P = 0.03). In TriNetX, we identified 6,708 patients who survived their index SBP episode; 48.6% were on SecSBPPr. Multivariable analysis similarly showed SecSBPPr increased SBP recurrence risk (hazards ratio 1.68 [1.33-1.80], P < 0.001). Both data sets showed higher SBP recurrence trends over time in SecSBPPr patients. Results remained consistent at 6-month and 2-year timepoints.

Discussion

In 2 national data sets of >11,000 patients with SBP, we found that SecSBPPr was prescribed in roughly half of patients. When initiated, SecSBPPr, compared with no prophylaxis after SBP, increased the risk of SBP recurrence in multivariable analysis by 63%-68%, and this trend worsened over time. SecSBPPr should be reconsidered in cirrhosis.

### The role of rifaximin in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with liver cirrhosis [^1cdee459]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) may provide a survival advantage in cirrhotic patients with ascites and has become an integral part of clinical practice. Rifaximin is a poorly absorbable antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial action and has low risk of introducing bacterial resistance.

Aim

To determine whether rifaximin is associated with decreasing the risk of SBP and improving transplant-free survival in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

Methods

The medical records of all adult patients with liver cirrhosis and large ascites justifying paracentesis evaluated in our clinic (2003 to 2007) were reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups by the use of rifaximin. Patients were excluded if they had received another antibiotic for SBP prophylaxis or had a history of SBP before rifaximin therapy.

Results

A total of 404 patients were included, of whom 49 (12%) received rifaximin. The rifaximin and nonrifaximin groups were comparable with regards to age, sex, and race. The median follow-up time was 4.2 [1.0, 17.1] months. During this time period, 89% of patients on rifaximin remained SBP free compared with 68% of those not on rifaximin (P=0.002). After adjusting for Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh score, serum sodium, and ascitic fluid total protein, there was a 72% reduction in the rate of SBP in the rifaximin group (hazard ratio=0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.71; P=0.007). The group treated with rifaximin also demonstrated a transplant-free survival benefit compared with those not on rifaximin (72% vs. 57%, P=0.045).

Conclusions

Intestinal decontamination with rifaximin may prevent SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding.

### Effect of rifaximin in patients with severe cirrhosis and ascites: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^afebc180]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background&Aims

Evidence for primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is weak and the selection of quinolone-resistant bacteria is currently of concern. Here we present results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial to assess whether rifaximin (RFX) has a beneficial effect on 12-month survival in patients with severe cirrhosis and ascites.

Methods

In this trial conducted at 17 French centers, patients with severe cirrhosis and grade 2 or 3 ascites and ascites protein level <15 g/L were randomized 1:1 to receive RFX 550 mg or PBO BID for 12 months, as primary prophylaxis for SBP. The primary endpoint was 12-month survival. Secondary endpoints were 3- and 6-month survival, incidence of complications of cirrhosis, and safety of RFX.

Results

Between 2018 and 2022, 1957 cirrhotic patients with ascites were screened, 159 were randomized, and 152 (80/72 PBO/RFX) were analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population. RFX did not improve 12-month (PBO/RFX : 68.1% [95% CI 56.2-78.7] / 56.6% [95% CI 43.5-67.8], p=0.74), 6-month (71.1% [95% CI 59.5-80.0] / 76.4% [95% CI 64.3-84.8]) or 3-month survivals (75.4% [95% CI 64.1-83.5]/82.6% [95% CI 71.4-89.7]), or the incidence of liver complications (SBP, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding or hepatorenal syndrome). In the per-protocol population (127 patients adherent to the study drug), a lower 12-month cumulative incidence of liver-related events in the RFX group was observed. RFX was well tolerated throughout the study.

Conclusions

RFX had no beneficial effect in terms of 12-month survival or incidence of complications of liver cirrhosis in patients with severe cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels. Improving patient adherence could reduce liver complications of cirrhosis.

Impact and Implications

Selective gut decontamination using norfloxacin is the standard of care for secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Evidence for primary prophylaxis of SBP is weaker, and fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Rifaximin, a well-tolerated broad-spectrum antibiotic with a lower risk of AMR emergence, may be an alternative to norfloxacin. Our trial did not demonstrate an improvement in survival or liver complications (SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome) at 12 months with rifaximin as primary prophylaxis for SBP versus placebo. However, in the subgroup of patients who adhered to rifaximin, liver complications decreased. Our study highlights the importance of study drug adherence in clinical trials to adequately assess outcomes.

### Albumin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: care variation, disparities, and outcomes [^3ed0a300]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous albumin reduces mortality in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We sought to characterize albumin use for SBP over time and investigate patient-level and hospital-level factors associated with use.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study in the Veterans Health Administration between 2008 and 2021 evaluated trends and patient-level, practice-level, and facility-level factors associated with use among patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for SBP confirmed with ascitic fluid criteria.

Results

Among 3,871 veterans with SBP, 803 (20.7%) did not receive albumin, 1,119 (28.9%) received albumin but not per guidelines, and 1,949 (50.3%) received albumin per guidelines; use increased from 66% in 2008 to 88% in 2022. Veterans who identified as Black compared with White were less likely to receive guideline-recommended albumin (Odds ratio [OR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.98) in all analyses. Guideline-recommended albumin was more likely to be administered to veterans with Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17-1.64) and C (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.61-3.04) compared with Child-Turcotte-Pugh A; and acute kidney injury Stage 1 (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.22-1.79), Stage 2 (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.62-2.91), and Stage 3 (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.18-2.40) compared with no acute kidney injury. gastroenterology/hepatology consultation (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.29-1.99), nephrology consultation (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.23-2.07), and having both gastroenterology/hepatology and nephrology consultations (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.60-2.96) were associated with higher albumin administration. In exploratory analyses accounting for interactions between model for end-stage liver disease sodium and albumin, guideline-recommended albumin was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85-0.96).

Discussion

Future studies should investigate optimizing albumin use for SBP to reduce the variability and mitigate healthcare disparities.

### The use of rifaximin in patients with cirrhosis [^64227d7b]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Effects of Rifaximin on Bacterial Infections

Based on its pharmacological characteristics and the putative effects on pathogenetic mechanisms of cirrhosis, rifaximin is considered by many hepatologists to be the logical alternative to quinolones or other systemic antibiotics for the prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and potentially of non‐SBP bacterial infections, with the belief that rifaximin is active on a broader range of intestinal gram‐positive and gram‐negative bacteria, is safer, and carries a low risk of inducing resistance to antibiotics.

Unfortunately, after more than a decade of clinical research, a conclusive indication on the use of rifaximin in prevention of bacterial infections cannot currently be given. Almost all the published data are related to primary or secondary prophylaxis for SBP. In general, retrospective studies have shown that the use of rifaximin is associated with lower incidence of SBP and other complications of the disease. Conversely, prospective observational studies have yielded less consistent results. Only a few RCTs have been performed so far, in Egypt and South Arabia, comparing the efficacy of rifaximin versus norfloxacin; in these studies, an advantage was seen in favor of rifaximin given for primary or secondary SBP ; in the former study, rifaximin was also given alternated to norfloxacin and compared with norfloxacin alone. However, the strength of these positive results is undermined by some methodological drawbacks.

To overcome the limitations inherent to each single study, several systematic reviews and meta‐analysis assessing both the observational cohort studies and the RCTs have been performed. Again, results suggest that only low‐quality evidence supports the superiority of rifaximin over norfloxacin or other systemic antibiotics for either primary or secondary SBP prophylaxis. In all these studies, the high heterogeneity in terms of patient inclusion criteria, type and modalities of administration of the comparative prophylactic therapies, primary and secondary endpoints, and the moderate‐to‐high risk of methodological biases related to randomization, blinding, attrition, and intention‐to‐treat analysis preclude the possibility to reach solid conclusions.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications and treatment [^37f44eba]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Major complications of cirrhosis include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. Diagnostic studies on ascitic fluid should include a differential leukocyte count, total protein level, a serum-ascites albumin gradient, and fluid cultures. Therapy consists of sodium restriction, diuretics, and complete abstention from alcohol. Patients with ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of 250 cells per mm3 or greater should receive empiric prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with cefotaxime and albumin. Patients who survive an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should receive long-term prophylaxis with norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and cirrhosis should receive norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole twice daily for seven days. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is directed toward improving mental status levels with lactulose; protein restriction is no longer recommended. Patients with cirrhosis and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding should undergo upper endoscopy to evaluate for varices. Endoscopic banding is the standard treatment, but sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors (e.g., octreotide) also may be used. Prophylaxis with propranolol is recommended in patients with cirrhosis once varices have been identified. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been effective in reducing portal hypertension and improving symptoms of hepatorenal syndrome, and can reduce gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. When medical therapy for treatment of cirrhosis has failed, liver transplantation should be considered. Survival rates in transplant recipients have improved as a result of advances in immunosuppression and proper risk stratification using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring systems.

### Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence in patients with cirrhosis receiving secondary prophylaxis with norfloxacin [^5d5a4d83]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Few studies carried out more than 20 years ago have evaluated spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) recurrence in patients receiving secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. These studies reported a 1-year recurrence rate of 20-26%. Changes in the bacteriology of SBP over the last few years might have negative effects on secondary prophylaxis. Our primary aim was to estimate the incidence of SBP recurrence in patients with cirrhosis receiving secondary prophylaxis with norfloxacin and to explore the factors associated with SBP recurrence.

Patients and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving norfloxacin for the secondary prophylaxis of SBP from 1 March 2003 to 31 March 2016. Follow-up was performed for 365 days after secondary prophylaxis was started. A competing risk analysis approach was used.

Results

A total of 115 patients were included. The prevalence of quinolone-resistant and multiresistant bacteria in the first episode of SBP among patients with culture-positive SBP was 70.96% [95% confidence interval (CI): 51.96-85.77%] and 12.90% (95% CI: 3.63-29.83%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of SBP recurrence was 28.53% (95% CI: 20.15-37.45%) after 365 days. Male patients showed an estimated subhazard ratio of SBP recurrence of 2.52 (95% CI: 1.07-5.91, P=0.034). No other risk factors for SBP recurrence were identified. The overall cumulative incidence of death after 365 days was 21.57% (95% CI: 14.14-30.04%), without significant differences among patients with or without SBP recurrence.

Conclusion

Even though changes in the bacteriology of SBP occurred over time, its recurrence rate in patients receiving norfloxacin remains similar to what was reported in the initial studies.

### Norfloxacin primary prophylaxis of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a double-blind randomized trial [^3bd71773]. Journal of Hepatology (1998). Low credibility.

The study Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis was published by Grange JD and colleagues in 1998 in the journal J Hepatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the trial question was: what is the role of norfloxacin in patients with cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels (< 15 g/L)? In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the population was: 107 patients (39 female, 68 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels (< 15 g/L) who had no history of infection and no active infection since cirrhosis diagnosis. The key exclusion criteria were active gastrointestinal bleeding on admission, HCC or other life-threatening disease or failure to provide written informed consent. In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the interventions were: n=53 norfloxacin (400 mg/day for 6 months) n=54 placebo (matching placebo daily for 6 months). In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in gram-negative infection (0% vs. 11%; ARD -11, 95% CI -20.12 to -1.88). In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in severe infection (2% vs. 17%; ). In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in mortality. In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the conclusion was: in patients with cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels (< 15 g/L) who had no history of infection and no active infection since cirrhosis diagnosis, norfloxacin was superior to placebo with respect to a gram-negative infection.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^758406c7]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

There have been recent suggestions based on low-level evidence that NSBB may result in a poorer outcome in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.The ‘window hypothesis’ for β blockers in cirrhosis has also recently been described, suggesting that NSBB are helpful in the compensated and early decompensated cirrhotic period, but may not be helpful in very early cirrhosis, such as in a patient with no varices, and may be harmful in patients with end-stage cirrhosis with refractory ascites.However, recent large observational studies question the last hypothesis, with improved survival seen in patients with refractory ascites treated with NSBB,unless patients have an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.Therefore, until there are further prospective controlled studies, NSBB should be continued in patients with refractory ascites. The clinician must carefully monitor haemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure, and discontinue NSBB in patients with hypotension and renal impairment as can occur after an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Other potentially severe adverse events with NSBB include symptomatic bradycardia, asthma and cardiac failure. Less severe side effects such as fatigue, insomnia and sexual dysfunction may also result.

Isosorbide mononitrate

Interest in the use of vasodilators such as isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) developed after the demonstration that it reduces portal pressure as effectively as propranolol,but has subsequently waned. A trial comparing ISMN with propranolol showed no significant difference between these agents.Another randomised trial of ISMN versus placebo did show any difference in the two arms.Therefore, ISMN is not recommended as monotherapy in primary prophylaxis.

β Blocker and ISMN

The combination of nadolol and ISMN has been compared with nadolol in a RCT. The combination therapy reduced the frequency of bleeding significantly but no significant differences were detected in mortality.However, Garcia-Pagan et al in a double-blind RCT of propranolol plus ISMN versus propranolol plus placebo failed to show any differences between the two arms. Combination therapy is associated with more side effects.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^5ed51663]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevention of HRS

HRS-AKI is most often precipitated by a precipitating event.Identifying and preventing the precipitating event is the key to the prevention of HRS-AKI. Several well-established strategies are recommended by various academic associations. These include regular monitoring of renal function when patients are started on diuretics, avoidance of excessive diuretics use, start regular LVP when patients have developed refractory ascites, use of albumin with LVP of >5 l to prevent paracentesis-induced circulatory disturbances, prophylaxis against bacterial infection such as during an episode of gastrointestinal bleed or after an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), as well as avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

As bacterial infections are the most common cause of HRS-AKI,primary prophylactic against SBP in patients with advanced liver disease defined as Child–Pugh score of ⩾9, a serum bilirubin level ⩾5 mg/dl, a sCr level of ⩾1.2 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen level of ⩾42.6 mg/dl, and serum sodium of ⩽130 mmol/l has been shown to be associated with reduced incidence of HRS and overall mortality.However, a recent prospective study found that primary prophylaxis against SBP was associated with a higher incidence of AKI (48% versus 30%; p = 0.04), and higher 90-day mortality (35% versus 22%; p = 0.02) compared to patients who were on secondary SBP prophylaxis,possibly related to changed microbiota with continued antibiotic use. It has been suggested that a personalized approach to antibiotic prophylaxis, weighing out risks and benefits, is the most appropriate strategy.The results of a recent network meta-analysis have thrown considerable uncertainty about whether antibiotic prophylaxis against SBP is beneficial, and if beneficial, which antibiotic prophylaxis is most beneficial in people with cirrhosis and ascites with low protein or history of SBP.Therefore, further studies are needed to better define this evolving issue.

Finally, long-term weekly albumin infusion to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and non-refractory ascites compared to standard of care has been shown to reduce the incidence of HRS and improved overall survival in a large RCT.However, this does not appear to be the definitive answer to the chronic use of albumin in these patients,as two further RCTs among liver transplant listed outpatients using albumin and midodrine versus placebo, or among admitted patients with decompensated cirrhosis did not prevent the development of complications including HRS.

### ASCO updates guideline on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer (...) [^c9aa2428]. ASCO Daily News (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points:
- Results from a series of randomized, controlled trials have prompted an update to the ASCO guideline on VTE prophylaxis.
- Apixaban and rivaroxaban were added as options for extended thromboprophylaxis after cancer surgery, but this is a weak recommendation based on the available evidence.
- Apixaban was added as an option for the treatment of VTE. This is a strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence. Results from a series of randomized, controlled trials have prompted an update to the ASCO guideline on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer. The revised guideline, which had last been updated in 2019, is available from the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
1. Changes to the guideline relate to 2 clinical scenarios—extended prophylaxis after cancer surgery and treatment of VTE.

First, for patients with cancer undergoing surgery for malignant disease, the 2 oral direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, are now recommended for extended thromboprophylaxis after surgery, although this is considered a weak recommendation based on the strength of the evidence. The second major revision to the guideline involves the addition of apixaban as an option for patients requiring treatment for VTE; this is a strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence. Dr. Key commented that apixaban is commonly used in non–cancer-associated thrombosis and that “it was appropriate to update the guideline according to recent evidence reporting that it’s a perfectly good option in cancer-associated thrombosis. ”. The second major revision to the guideline involves the addition of apixaban as an option for patients requiring treatment for VTE; this is a strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence.

Next Steps Guideline cochairs noted that there is more work to be done related to both new recommendations. Dr. Key said that “more studies are needed to strengthen the evidence for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors as extended prophylaxis after surgery. ” Second, because the trials were conducted specifically in patients with colorectal and gynecologic cancers, the generalizability of the results is unclear. In particular, the role of these agents in patients undergoing surgery for primary brain tumors needs further evaluation, Dr. Key noted, adding that those patients “seem to be a different group in terms of potential thrombosis and bleeding risks. ”.

### Evaluating the role of antibiotics in patients admitted to hospital with decompensated cirrhosis: lessons from the ATTIRE trial [^6979a8d1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Infections in patients hospitalized with decompensated cirrhosis are common with a high mortality. Therefore, guidelines support early antibiotic prescription in suspected infection as mortality risk increases in (noncirrhotic) septic patients after delay in appropriate antibiotic therapy. Given this increased risk of infections, clinicians also prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics to patients hospitalized with cirrhosis without infection to prevent hospital-acquired infections (HAI) and subsequent sepsis, as we observed in the Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure (ATTIRE) trial with 50% receiving antibiotics at trial entry, although only 27% were diagnosed with infection.

Other approaches to prevent infection may potentially include use of rifaximin in outpatients, a nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antibiotic licensed for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (–), because this may prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). However, not all studies have shown benefit (–). Long-term antibiotics are also used in outpatients with ascites to prevent infection after an episode of SBP (–), supported by a 72% reduction in 3-month mortality, although a Cochrane systematic review concluded there was very low-certainty supportive evidence.

However, indiscriminate antibiotic use drives antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and quinolone prophylaxis has been associated with increased multidrug resistance and Gram-positive organisms cultured in SBP (–). Patients hospitalized with cirrhosis have a high incidence of AMR with 34% of cultures growing multidrug-resistant organisms in a global study which caused higher mortality than non-AMR infections. Therefore, prescribing antibiotics in the absence of infection, which may actually be harmful in the longer-term and judicious use of antibiotics, is a global priority. More evidence is needed to aid decision-making on the use of antibiotics to prevent infection in decompensated cirrhosis, in particular in hospitalized patients. We therefore estimated the risk of HAI and mortality in patients without active infection at hospitalization who were treated with antibiotics or rifaximin compared with those who were not treated, using data collected from our completed ATTIRE trial.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^e5d2f10a]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic neutrophil >250/mm 3 count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate, Recommendation: strong)
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong, Recommendation: strong)
Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count <1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

### Management of patients with cirrhosis in Southern California: results of a practitioner survey [^9cd341a7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis is an important medical and public health concern. A paucity of data exists on how patients with cirrhosis are managed. Our aims were to determine how cirrhosis is managed and whether current management practices follow established recommendations.

Methods

A questionnaire was mailed to Southern California Society of Gastroenterology members. Most had practiced for more than 15 years (67%) in a private practice setting (69%). Proportions of physicians who followed established guidelines versus those who had not were compared using chi test.

Results

Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcus vaccinations were recommended by most respondents. Ninety-one percent of respondents routinely screened patients for hepatocellular carcinoma. A significantly greater proportion of respondents screened for hepatocellular carcinoma using either alpha-fetoprotein or ultrasound every 6 months (P < 0.05). Seventy-six percent recommended antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with prior spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, whereas less than half recommended prophylaxis in patients with ascitic protein fluid <1 g/dL, current variceal bleed, and those on the liver transplant list. Sixty-seven percent of respondents performed screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy upon diagnosis of cirrhosis. Most respondents did not recommend repeating endoscopy in 1 to 2 years if a patient was found to have small varices (P < 0.05), and would repeat an endoscopy if large varices were found (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

The management of patients with cirrhosis in the community varied and did not always conform to established guidelines. These results should be confirmed in a larger group of physicians, and the rationales for physicians accepting or rejecting established guidelines should be further assessed.

### Addition of probiotics to norfloxacin does not improve efficacy in the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized-controlled trial [^7e41022f]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) may occur despite antibiotic prophylaxis. We investigated whether the addition of probiotics to norfloxacin enhances its efficacy in the prevention of SBP.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized-controlled trial was conducted among consecutive cirrhotic patients who had either recovered from SBP (secondary prophylaxis) or who were at a high risk for the development of SBP (low ascitic fluid protein or serum bilirubin ≥ 2.5 mg/dl; primary prophylaxis). Norfloxacin 400 mg/day with probiotics capsules (Enterococcus faecalis JPC 30 million, Clostridium butyricum 2 million, Bacillus mesentericus JPC 1 million, Bacillus coagulans 50 million spores) at a dose of two capsules three times daily (group 1) or norfloxacin with a placebo (group 2) was given and the occurrence of SBP within a period of 6 months (primary endpoint) or side-effects of therapy and mortality (secondary endpoints) were recorded.

Results

From April 2005 through August 2007, 110 patients were randomized to group 1 (n=55) or group 2 (n=55) and 45 (82%) and 43 (78%) of them completed the trial, respectively. The baseline characteristics were comparable. On intention-to-treat analysis, the cumulative probability of treatment failures was similar in both the groups [19/55 (34%) in group 1 vs. 20/55 (36%) in group 2, P=0.840]. The cumulative probability of mortality was also similar [13/45 (29%) in group 1 vs. 14/43 (32%) in group 2, P=0.834]. The frequency of side-effects was also comparable. In subgroup analyses, the frequencies of SBP and deaths were similar in the two groups in the subgroups of primary and secondary prophylaxes. The presence of encephalopathy and serum bilirubin of greater than 3.65 mg/dl were found to predict mortality independently.

Conclusion

The addition of probiotics to norfloxacin does not improve its efficacy in primary or secondary prophylaxis of SBP or in reducing the mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
