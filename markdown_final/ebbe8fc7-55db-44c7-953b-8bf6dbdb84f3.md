## Question

Do patient need a LTBI treatment if quantiferon test is positive but xray is normal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with a positive QuantiFERON (IGRA) and a normal chest X-ray needs treatment for latent TB infection, specifically whether this constitutes latent TB infection and who should be treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming that this presentation fits the definition of LTBI and that active TB has been reasonably excluded. Then, I should verify the patient's risk of progression to active TB and determine who clearly benefits from treatment versus where shared decision-making is appropriate. Next, I will review recommended preventive regimens, key drug–drug interactions, and monitoring. After that, I should consider special populations like those starting biologics or living with HIV. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and ensure nuances like false positives and the role of CT are addressed [^112LjwLh] [^113imv8J].

> Let me first confirm the definition. A positive immunologic test such as QuantiFERON in an asymptomatic person with a normal chest radiograph, and no examination findings of disease, is consistent with latent tuberculosis infection rather than active TB disease, which is non-infectious but carries a future risk of reactivation [^112LjwLh] [^1179xdXi] [^112GLSMg].

> Wait, let me verify that active TB is sufficiently ruled out with a normal CXR. A normal chest radiograph plus a negative symptom screen makes active pulmonary TB unlikely in immunocompetent individuals, but I need to remember that imaging alone is not definitive, and in immunocompromised hosts or those with extrapulmonary concerns, a low threshold for further microbiologic evaluation is warranted before labeling LTBI and starting treatment [^111XhvVT] [^114dsQmt] [^112LjwLh].

> I should confirm the baseline risk of progression to put benefits and harms in context. Approximately 5–10% of immunocompetent people with LTBI will develop active TB over a lifetime, with highest risk in the first two years after infection, and about 5% of the US population — up to 13 million people — has LTBI, underscoring the public health rationale for targeted testing and treatment [^113cAjfU] [^113imv8J].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that everyone with a positive IGRA must be treated. Treatment is strongly recommended in high-risk groups because their risk of progression is substantially higher — this includes people living with HIV, those starting or using anti–TNF-α or other potent immunosuppressants, transplant candidates/recipients, persons on dialysis, those with silicosis, recent close contacts, and recent converters — per WHO preventive treatment guidance, and this is aligned with targeted screening recommendations from USPSTF [^113qfKJb] [^112LjwLh] [^112GLSMg].

> Let me consider low-risk scenarios more carefully. For immunocompetent adults with no recent exposure, no immunosuppression, and no epidemiologic risk factors, treatment can still reduce personal future TB risk, but the absolute benefit may be modest, so shared decision-making that weighs hepatotoxicity and drug interactions against the individual's progression risk is appropriate, consistent with the USPSTF "B" recommendation for screening and treating persons at increased risk rather than indiscriminate treatment of all positives [^113imv8J] [^112GLSMg] [^113cAjfU].

> Next, I should review appropriate regimens. Short-course rifamycin-based options such as once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine for 3 months (3HP) or daily isoniazid plus rifampin for 3 months (3HR), and longer isoniazid monotherapy for 6 or 9 months, are all acceptable WHO-recommended preventive treatments; shorter regimens generally have better completion, but rifamycins have important drug–drug interactions that must be checked, and baseline plus periodic liver monitoring should be considered in those at hepatotoxicity risk [^117PZEfw] [^112LjwLh].

> I need to check special populations where my threshold for treatment is lowest. Before initiating TNF-α inhibitors or certain JAK inhibitors, preventive therapy for latent TB should be started if LTBI is identified, given the high reactivation risk; this requirement is explicit in drug labels such as abrocitinib and reflected in WHO high-priority groups for preventive treatment [^115kAJjj] [^113qfKJb]. For people with HIV, preventive therapy substantially reduces incident TB and is strongly recommended once active disease is excluded, with meta-analyses showing protective effects across regimens [^116kbqCa] [^116W53mD].

> But wait, what if the IGRA is a false positive or borderline in a very low-risk person. I should double-check pretest probability, recognize that IGRA specificity is high and unaffected by prior BCG compared with TST, and consider repeating a borderline or unexpected positive in a very low-risk individual, particularly if immunologic fluctuation is suspected; guidance and empirical data support high specificity of IGRAs and highlight the interpretive limits of single low-level positives in low-prevalence populations [^116mwske] [^114rYSDH] [^1162b4rt].

> I will now examine imaging nuances. Although chest CT is more sensitive than plain radiography for detecting prior granulomatous changes, routine CT is not required to diagnose LTBI once active disease is excluded clinically and by CXR; CT may be reserved for special circumstances such as transplant evaluation or if subtle disease is suspected despite a normal CXR, but a normal CXR is generally sufficient for LTBI management decisions [^113HU3Vo] [^114zR2U2].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic algorithm. First, confirm absence of TB symptoms and a normal CXR; if either is concerning, obtain microbiologic testing before preventive therapy. Second, define this as LTBI in the asymptomatic, CXR-normal patient with a positive IGRA. Third, stratify risk: initiate preventive treatment in high-risk groups such as HIV, biologics or transplant candidates, dialysis, silicosis, recent contacts or converters; consider treatment with shared decision-making in lower-risk individuals. Fourth, if treating, select a WHO-endorsed regimen mindful of drug interactions and monitor for hepatotoxicity; if deferring, provide education, symptom surveillance, and re-evaluate if risks change [^112LjwLh] [^113qfKJb] [^113imv8J].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost stated that a normal CXR alone excludes active TB in all settings; I should correct that and emphasize again that in immunocompromised patients or those with extrapulmonary symptoms, a normal CXR does not fully rule out disease, and further testing is warranted before starting LTBI therapy, which is consistent with screening test limitations and WHO diagnostic pathways [^111XhvVT] [^114dsQmt] [^112LjwLh].

> Bottom line, I should confirm that most patients with a positive QuantiFERON and a normal chest X-ray meet criteria for LTBI and, after ruling out active disease, should generally be offered preventive treatment when their risk of progression is non-trivial, with strong recommendations to treat in high-risk groups and individualized decisions in truly low-risk individuals, aligning with WHO preventive-treatment priorities and USPSTF targeted screening guidance [^112LjwLh] [^113qfKJb] [^112GLSMg].

---

In general, patients with a positive QuantiFERON test and a normal chest X-ray should receive LTBI treatment if they are at **increased risk of progression to active TB** [^113imv8J], such as those with HIV, immunosuppression [^112LjwLh], recent exposure, or planned immunosuppressive therapy [^113qfKJb]. LTBI treatment is **not routinely recommended for low-risk individuals** without risk factors, but clinical judgment and patient preference should guide decisions [^113imv8J]. Always exclude active TB with symptom review and, if indicated, sputum testing before starting LTBI therapy [^112LjwLh].

---

## Clinical significance of a positive quantiferon test with normal chest x-ray

A positive QuantiFERON test with a normal chest X-ray **indicates LTBI**, reflecting infection with M. tuberculosis without radiographic evidence of active disease [^1179xdXi]. LTBI is asymptomatic and noninfectious [^113imv8J]; about 5–10% of immunocompetent individuals will progress to active TB over their lifetime [^113cAjfU], most often within the first 2 years after infection [^114mnVks].

---

## Risk factors for progression from LTBI to active TB

The decision to treat LTBI **depends on the risk of progression** to active TB [^113cAjfU]. Key risk factors include:

- **HIV infection**: Strongly increases progression risk [^112LjwLh].

- **Immunosuppression**: Includes corticosteroids, biologics (e.g. anti-TNF), chemotherapy, or organ transplantation [^113qfKJb].

- **Recent exposure**: Close contact with active TB cases [^113imv8J].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, silicosis [^112LjwLh].

- **Age**: Children under 5 years [^112LjwLh].

- **Recent conversion**: Recent IGRA or TST conversion [^113cAjfU].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations for LTBI treatment

### WHO guidelines (2020)

The WHO recommends **LTBI treatment** for individuals with a positive IGRA or TST who are at increased risk of progression, including [^112LjwLh]:

- **HIV-positive individuals**: Strong recommendation [^112LjwLh].

- **Immunosuppressed patients**: Including those initiating anti-TNF therapy, dialysis, organ or hematological transplant candidates, or with silicosis [^113qfKJb].

- **Close contacts**: Of active TB cases [^113imv8J].

Recommended **regimens** include:

- **Isoniazid**: 6 or 9 months [^117PZEfw].

- **Isoniazid plus rifapentine**: Weekly for 3 months.

- **Isoniazid plus rifampin**: Daily for 3 months

---

### USPSTF guidelines (2023)

The USPSTF recommends LTBI screening and treatment for asymptomatic adults at **increased risk**, including [^113imv8J]:

- **Born in or former residents**: Of countries with high TB prevalence.

- **High-risk congregate settings**: Homeless shelters, correctional facilities [^112GLSMg].

- **Immunosuppressed individuals**: Including HIV-positive patients

---

## Clinical scenarios where LTBI treatment is recommended

LTBI treatment is **recommended** in the following scenarios [^112LjwLh]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| HIV-positive individuals | Strongly recommended |
| Immunosuppressed patients (e.g. anti-TNF therapy, organ transplant, dialysis) | Strongly recommended |
| Close contacts of active TB cases | Strongly recommended |
| Recent converters (IGRA or TST) | Recommended |
| Children under 5 years | Recommended |

---

## Clinical scenarios where LTBI treatment may not be necessary

LTBI treatment **may not be necessary** in select situations, such as low-risk individuals without progression risk factors, those who have previously completed adequate LTBI therapy or curative treatment for active TB, and patients with severe contraindications to LTBI regimens (e.g. severe liver disease) [^113imv8J].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of LTBI treatment

### Benefits

LTBI therapy **reduces progression to active TB** [^113cAjfU], providing individual protection and reducing transmission at the population level. In high-risk populations, these benefits are cost-effective [^116PHYq2].

---

### Risks

Potential harms include **adverse effects** (e.g. hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity) and challenges with adherence to longer regimens [^112LjwLh]. False-positive test results can lead to overtreatment [^114L6nAw].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients receiving LTBI treatment **should be monitored for adverse effects**, particularly hepatotoxicity, and for adherence [^112LjwLh]. Ongoing assessment for symptoms or signs of progression to active TB is necessary. Regular clinical follow-up and patient education are essential for successful outcomes.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Patients with a positive QuantiFERON test and a normal chest X-ray have LTBI [^113imv8J]. Treatment is **recommended for those at increased risk of progression** — including HIV-positive individuals, immunosuppressed patients, close contacts of active TB cases, recent converters, and children under 5 years [^112LjwLh]. For low-risk individuals, treatment may not be necessary; clinical judgment and patient preference should guide decisions [^113cAjfU]. Always exclude active TB before starting LTBI therapy [^111XhvVT].

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113imv8J]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

In the US, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the US is difficult to determine; however, estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons. Incidence of tuberculosis varies by geography and living accommodations, suggesting an association with social determinants of health.

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on LTBI screening and treatment in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, as well as the accuracy of LTBI screening tests.

- **Population**: Asymptomatic adults 18 years or older at increased risk for tuberculosis.

- **Evidence assessment**: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit in preventing active tuberculosis disease by screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis infection.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk (B recommendation).

### Inclusion of latent tuberculosis infection as a separate entity into the international classification of diseases [^112zfyQN]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

The 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) proposed by the WHO is currently in the consultation phase. In common with previous versions of the ICD, this revised version does not contain a code for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), contrasting with the inclusion of a large number of codes for various manifestations of active tuberculosis (TB). Inclusion of a separate code for LTBI into ICD-11 is critically important for epidemiological, clinical, and research purposes. On behalf of the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials group, we encourage colleagues worldwide who are caring for TB patients or are involved in TB research to join us in supporting the case for a long overdue ICD code for LTBI.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^115tnj3n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the strengths of the review, the certainty of evidence remained very low for the summary sensitivity estimates of all index tests, except for chest X-ray (CXR) abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis, for which the certainty of evidence was low. Serious inconsistency contributed to a very low certainty of evidence, as the range in point estimates was wide to very wide. Furthermore, the very serious risk of bias in the Reference Standard domain reduced the certainty of evidence, as more than half of the studies did not require all participants to undergo microbiological testing but classified participants as tuberculosis-negative based on the results of CXR and symptoms, indicating incorporation bias. Additionally, in the Flow and Timing domain, the risk of bias was high for over half of the studies, mostly due to the extent of missing test results for participants who required microbiological testing based on the protocol.

Our sensitivity analyses confirmed the direction of this bias, as restricting analyses to studies with low risk of bias in these QUADAS-2 domains resulted in considerably lower summary sensitivity estimates. The high sensitivity of the parallel combination of CXR and symptom questions should be interpreted with even greater caution, as in most of these studies, sensitivity was close to 100%. Sensitivity was 100% by definition because participants without CXR abnormalities and without symptoms were defined by this parallel combination as 'not having tuberculosis' and were ineligible for further evaluation.

### Chest roentgenography is complementary to interferon-gamma release assay in latent tuberculosis infection screening of rheumatic patients [^1112jjn6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), chest roentgenography (CXR) is included in the Taiwan latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) risk management plan for biologics. Guidelines regarding the use of chest radiography in LTBI screening offer mixed recommendations. Some suggest conducting a chest radiograph following a positive IGRA, while others recommend chest radiography regardless of the result of the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or tuberculin skin test (TST). A universally accepted standard of care in this issue has not yet been established. Furthermore, studies on the correlation between CXR and IGRA reveal different results across various populations, such as TB-exposed individuals or healthcare workers; studies specifically focusing on rheumatic patients are limited. Additionally, the LTBI burden estimated by CXR, besides IGRA, remains unclear in areas with intermediate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) risk, although healed but untreated fibrotic lesions visible in CXR are associated with a risk for progression to active TB. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study to investigate CXR findings in LTBI screening. We also explored the correlations between CXR and IGRA and reported the results of isoniazid prophylaxis.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: An international Delphi consensus exercise [^115t2f6N]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The active-latent paradigm of tuberculosis largely neglects the documented spectrum of disease. Inconsistency with regard to definitions, terminology, and diagnostic criteria for different tuberculosis states has limited progress in research and product development needed to achieve tuberculosis elimination. We aimed to develop a new framework of classification for tuberculosis that accommodates key disease states but is sufficiently simple to support pragmatic research and implementation.

Through an international Delphi exercise that involved 71 participants representing a wide range of disciplines, sectors, income settings, and geographies, consensus was reached on a set of conceptual states, related terminology, and research gaps. The International Consensus for Early TB (ICE-TB) framework distinguishes disease from infection by the presence of macroscopic pathology and defines two subclinical and two clinical tuberculosis states based on reported symptoms or signs of tuberculosis, further differentiated by likely infectiousness. The presence of viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis and an associated host response are prerequisites for all states of infection and disease.

Our framework provides a clear direction for tuberculosis research, which will, in time, improve tuberculosis clinical care and elimination policies.

### Comparison of three tests for latent tuberculosis infection in high-risk people in the United States: an observational cohort study [^112SXEpK]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection is an important strategy to prevent tuberculosis disease. In the United States, three tests are used to identify latent tuberculosis infection: the tuberculin skin test (TST), and two IFN-γ release assays (T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON). To our knowledge, few large studies have compared all three tests among people at high risk of latent tuberculosis infection or progression to tuberculosis disease. We aimed to assess test agreement between IFN-γ release assays and TST to provide guidance on their use in important risk groups.

- **Methods**: In this observational cohort study, we enrolled participants at high risk of latent tuberculosis infection or progression to tuberculosis disease at ten US sites with 18 affiliated clinics. This included close contacts of infectious tuberculosis cases, people born in countries whose populations in the United States have high (≥ 100 cases per 100,000 people) or moderate (10–99 cases per 100,000 people) tuberculosis incidence, and people with HIV. Participants were interviewed about demographics and medical risk factors, and all three tests were administered to each participant. The primary endpoints for this study were the proportions of positive test results by test type stratified by risk group, and test concordance by risk group for participants with valid results for all three test types. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01622140.

- **Findings**: Between July 12, 2012, and May 5, 2017, 26,292 people were approached, and 22,131 (84.2%) were enrolled in the study. Data from 21,846 (98.7%) participants were available.

### Cibinqo [^115kAJjj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to initiating treatment with Cibinqo, it is essential to conduct the following tests and evaluations:

- **Tuberculosis (TB) infection evaluation**: Initiation of Cibinqo is not recommended for patients with active TB. For patients with latent TB or those at high risk for TB who have a negative latent TB test, preventive therapy for latent TB should be commenced prior to initiating treatment with Cibinqo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Viral hepatitis screening in accordance with clinical guidelines**: Cibinqo should not be initiated in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Cibinqo is not recommended for patients with a platelet count < 150,000/mm³, an absolute lymphocyte count < 500/mm³, an absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm³, or a hemoglobin value < 8 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- Complete any necessary immunizations, including herpes zoster vaccinations, in agreement with immunization guidelines prior to Cibinqo initiation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

The recommended dosage for Cibinqo is 100 mg once daily. If an adequate response is not achieved with this dosage, consider increasing to 200 mg once daily. If there is still no adequate response with 200 mg, discontinue use. It is advised to use the lowest efficacious dose to maintain the response.

Cibinqo can be administered with or without topical corticosteroids. In the event a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible unless it is close to the time of the next dose.

### The impact, effectiveness and outcomes of targeted screening thresholds for programmatic latent tuberculosis infection testing in HIV [^113ccmEp]. AIDS (2022). Low credibility.

In our prospective screening study, we used QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFN-GIT) with a gradual switch to QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) between May 2016 and January 2017. Results were positive, negative, or indeterminate, dependent on manufacturers' criteria; indeterminate results were included in the denominator.

The majority of people with HIV (PWH) with CD4+ cell counts of at least 200 cells/μl received a single IGRA test. Those with CD4+ cell counts below 200 cells/μl generally received two tests (T-SPOT.TB plus a QuantiFERON-TB test), in most cases performed on the same day. If this was not possible, dual results were included if tests were taken within 14 days. PWH taking two tests were classified as IGRA positive if either test returned a positive result.

The most recent previous CD4+ cell count to an IGRA test was used as the CD4+ cell count classification at the time of the test. Individuals who had CD4+ cell counts performed more than a year prior to the planned time of IGRA testing had testing withheld until a more recent CD4+ cell count became available.

Individuals with positive IGRA tests were recalled for chest radiography and further clinical assessment to exclude active TB. We defined latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) as PWH with a positive IGRA and normal chest radiography in the absence of any clinical features suggesting active disease. PWH diagnosed with LTBI were offered chemoprophylaxis, typically 6 months of isoniazid, in accordance with UK guidelines, although individual clinicians made the final decision based on clinician and patient preference.

### Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in HIV infected persons [^116kbqCa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Individuals with HIV infection are at an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis. It is known that treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), also referred to as preventive therapy or chemoprophylaxis, helps to prevent progression to active disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative populations. However, the extent and magnitude of protection, if any, associated with preventive therapy in those infected with HIV should be quantified.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of tuberculosis preventive therapy in reducing the risk of active tuberculosis and death in persons infected with HIV.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, AIDSTRIALS, and AIDSDRUGS. We also scanned reference lists of articles and contacted authors and other researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies in which HIV positive individuals were randomly allocated to preventive therapy for TB and placebo, or to alternative TB preventive therapy regimens. Participants could be tuberculin skin test positive or negative, but without active tuberculosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently applied study selection criteria, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Effects were assessed using relative risk for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data.

- **Main results**: Eleven trials were included with a total of 8,130 randomized participants. Preventive therapy (any anti-TB drug) versus placebo was associated with a lower incidence of active tuberculosis.

### Identification of false-positive QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube assays by repeat testing in HIV-infected patients at low risk for tuberculosis [^112BvAhi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT) is increasingly being used for latent tuberculosis screening in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. This retrospective analysis investigates the strategy of repeating positive QFT assays to identify false-positive results in HIV-infected patients at low risk for tuberculosis.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111XhvVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Systematic screening in high-burden settings is recommended as a strategy for early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis disease, reducing mortality, morbidity, and transmission, and improving equity in access to care. Questioning for symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) have historically been the most widely available tools to screen for tuberculosis disease. Their accuracy is important for the design of tuberculosis screening programmes and determines, in combination with the accuracy of confirmatory diagnostic tests, the yield of a screening programme and the burden on individuals and the health service.

- **Objectives**: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of questioning for the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms or symptom combinations, CXR, and combinations of these as screening tools for detecting bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis disease in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status who are considered eligible for systematic screening for tuberculosis disease. Second, to investigate sources of heterogeneity, especially in relation to regional, epidemiological, and demographic characteristics of the study populations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) databases using pre-specified search terms and consulted experts for unpublished reports, for the period 1992 to 2018. The search date was 10 December 2018. This search was repeated on 2 July 2021.

### Incidence of active tuberculosis in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection in rural China: follow-up results of a population-based, multicentre, prospective cohort study [^116yuRV4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The management of latent *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection is a new priority action for the WHO End Tuberculosis (TB) Strategy. However, national guidelines on latent tuberculosis infection testing and treatment have not yet been developed in China. Here, we present the results from the 2-year follow-up of a study that aimed to track the development of active disease in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection, identify priority populations for latent infection management, and explore the most suitable latent infection diagnostic approach.

- **Methods**: A population-based multicentre prospective study was conducted in four sites in rural China between 2013 and 2015. The baseline survey in 2013 measured the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) and tuberculin skin test (TST) in eligible participants. During the follow-up phase between 2014–2015, we assessed individuals who had tuberculosis infection at baseline (QFT positivity or TST tuberculin reaction size [induration] of ≥ 10 mm) for the development of active disease through active case finding. Eligible participants in the follow-up survey were born before June 1, 2008 (5 years or older in 2013) and had continuous residence at the study site for 6 months or longer in the past year. Participants with active tuberculosis at the baseline survey were excluded.

- **Findings**: Between Sept 1, 2013, and Aug 31, 2015, 7505 eligible participants (aged 5 years or older) were included in tuberculosis infection test positive cohorts (4455 were QFT positive, 6404 had TST).

### Cost-effectiveness of the NICE guidelines for screening for latent tuberculosis infection: The QuantiFERON-TB GOLD IGRA alone is more cost-effective for immigrants from high burden countries [^116PHYq2]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines for new entrant tuberculosis (TB) screening recommend a chest X-ray (CXR) for immigrants from countries with a TB incidence of more than 40 per 100,000 and a tuberculin skin test (TST) for individuals with normal CXR from very high TB prevalence countries. A revised screening policy using first-line QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) in high-risk immigrants was piloted in 2007. Initially, TST was offered to immigrants from countries with a TB incidence of 200–339 per 100,000, and QFT to those from countries with an incidence greater than 340 per 100,000.

When increased resources became available, all immigrants from countries with a TB incidence of more than 200 per 100,000 had QFT. Those with positive QFT results were invited for CXR. Out of the 1,336 immigrants invited for screening, there was a 32% attendance rate. Among the 280 patients who underwent QFT, 38% tested positive, with less than 2% being indeterminate.

Using the NICE approach, the cost of screening these 280 immigrants would be £13,346.75 (£47.67 per immigrant), identifying 83 cases of latent TB infection (LTBI). By using first-line QFT followed by CXR, the cost was reduced to £9,781.82 (£34.94 per immigrant), identifying 105 cases of LTBI. The cost to identify one case of LTBI following NICE guidelines was £160.81, whereas using the present protocol, it was £93.16. For immigrants from high-risk countries, QFT blood testing followed by CXR is feasible for TB screening, cheaper than screening using the NICE guidelines, and identifies more cases of LTBI.

### Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in HIV infected persons [^116W53mD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). It is known that treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI), also referred to as TB preventive therapy or chemoprophylaxis, helps to prevent progression to active disease in HIV-negative populations. However, the extent and magnitude of protection, if any, associated with preventive therapy in those infected with HIV should be quantified. This present study is an update of the original review.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of TB preventive therapy in reducing the risk of active tuberculosis and death in HIV-infected persons.

- **Search strategy**: This review was updated using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, AIDSTRIALS, AIDSearch, NLM Gateway, and AIDSDRUGS for publications dated from 01 July 2002 to 04 April 2008. Reference lists of articles were scanned, and authors and other researchers in the field were contacted in an attempt to identify additional studies that may be eligible for inclusion in this review.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials in which HIV-positive individuals were randomly allocated to TB preventive therapy or placebo, or to alternative TB preventive therapy regimens. Participants could be tuberculin skin test positive or negative, but without active tuberculosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently applied the study selection criteria, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Effects were assessed using relative risk for…

### Optimizing the design of latent tuberculosis treatment trials: Insights from mathematical modeling [^115DdCWR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Noninferiority trials for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) treatment pose challenges due to the imperfections in LTBI diagnostic tests. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of different enrollment strategies on study outcomes for a noninferiority trial of LTBI treatment.

The study employed mathematical simulations of a two-arm randomized clinical trial of LTBI, in which the experimental therapy demonstrated 50% efficacy and the control treatment exhibited 80% efficacy, with an absolute 0.75% noninferiority margin. Five enrollment strategies were evaluated:

1. Enroll based on no LTBI diagnostic test.
2. Enroll based on a positive tuberculin skin test (TST).
3. Enroll based on a positive IFN-γ release assay (IGRA).
4. Enroll based on either a positive TST or IGRA.
5. Enroll regardless of test result, assuming 70% of participants had negative TSTs, 20% had positive TSTs, and 10% had unknown results.

The key findings were as follows: Under most LTBI prevalence assumptions, enrolling based on a positive IGRA was least likely to result in falsely declaring noninferiority of the experimental regimen. Enrolling without any test or regardless of the test result led to false declarations of noninferiority unless the underlying LTBI prevalence was higher than 45%. Enrolling based on a combination of TST and IGRA substantially reduced the likelihood of falsely declaring noninferiority compared to enrolling based on TST alone, even if up to 70% of participants were enrolled based on positive TST results. The conclusion is that noninferiority trials of LTBI should enroll participants based on the most specific diagnostic tests available, such as IGRAs, to avoid misinterpretation of the trial outcomes.

### New diagnostics to infer risk in tuberculosis: Is the term "latent tuberculosis infection" obsolete [^115sUjiE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It was challenging to apply the broad concept and diagnosis definition of LTBI to the study subjects with "remote" or persistent QFT(+) reactivity and the ones with "recent" QFT(+) reactivity. In this regard, we suggest changing the term "LTBI" to "TB infection reactivity", which can be applied to both postinfection immune reactivity and different stages of asymptomatic TB infection. The categories of low, high, or indeterminate risk can be added to the term "TB infection reactivity" to provide an assessment or interpretation of TB progression risk for both the available tests and the newly developed host-related TB diagnostics in the absence of a gold standard test to directly measure host bacillary burden in asymptomatic Mtb infections. This proposed terminology will enable a more individualized and risk-based diagnosis for the optimal management of the different stages of asymptomatic Mtb infection, including low-risk TB infection, high-risk or incipient TB infection, and posttreatment immune reactivity, and differentiation from subclinical TB and clinical TB.

### Latent tuberculosis infection in rural China: baseline results of a population-based, multicentre, prospective cohort study [^1151wdDA]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Prophylactic treatment of individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is an essential component of tuberculosis control in some settings. In China, the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection, and preventive interventions against this disease, have not been systematically studied. We aimed to assess the prevalence of latent tuberculosis and its associated risk factors in rural populations in China.

- **Methods**: Between July 1 and September 30, 2013, we undertook a baseline survey of a population-based, multicentre, prospective cohort study of registered residents (≥ 5 years old) at four study sites in rural China. Eligible participants were identified by door-to-door survey with a household sampling design. We screened participants for active tuberculosis and history of tuberculosis, then used a tuberculin skin test and an interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON [QFT]) to test for latent infection. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were used to assess variables associated with positivity of QFT and tuberculin skin tests.

- **Findings**: Of the 23,483 eligible participants, 21,022 (90%) completed a baseline survey. Age-standardised and sex-standardised rates of skin-test positivity (≥ 10 mm) ranged from 15% to 42%, and QFT positivity rates ranged from 13% to 20%. Rates of positivity for the tuberculin skin test and the QFT test were low in study participants younger than 20 years and gradually increased with age (p for trend < 0·0001). Rates of latent tuberculosis infection were higher for men than women (p < 0·0001). There was overall agreement between the tuberculin skin test and the QFT test.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^114dsQmt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

In a tuberculosis (TB) screening programme, the screening test(s) are offered as part of a diagnostic algorithm that also includes one or more confirmatory tests. Individuals with a positive screen are offered further confirmatory testing to establish a TB diagnosis. **True screen positives** are people rightfully referred for confirmatory testing as they have TB disease, while **false screen positives** are people who are referred for confirmatory testing but do not have TB disease. Individuals with a positive screen but negative confirmatory test would not necessarily be declared disease-free; they may be advised on further examination or follow-up if warranted by the findings on screening (e.g. severity of symptoms or CXR findings [Okada 2012]). People with a negative screen would not be further evaluated. This group includes both **true screen negatives**, who do not have TB, and **false screen negatives**, who will not be evaluated further despite having TB. The confirmatory test may be a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) such as the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), sputum smear microscopy, and, in more resourced settings, mycobacterial culture, either liquid or solid. These are also the reference standards for the purpose of this review. People who have a negative confirmatory test result may be started on TB treatment after further clinical evaluation and a trial of broad-spectrum antibiotics, or CXR, or both.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^114iqCuP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

In the guidelines on tuberculosis screening developed by WHO and partners, systematic screening for tuberculosis disease is defined as "the systematic identification of people with presumed tuberculosis disease, in a predetermined target group, using tests, examinations, or other procedures which can be applied rapidly" (WHO 2013). Screening tests sort out apparently well people who probably have a disease from people who probably do not, and are not intended to be diagnostic. People with positive or suspicious findings must be referred for diagnosis and necessary treatment.

Screening is offered systematically to predetermined groups, and not only in response to a specific request or complaint by an individual seeking care. While it often refers to screening outside of health facilities, it can be offered to those who seek health care (with or without signs and symptoms compatible with tuberculosis) and those who do not. The two main goals of systematic screening for tuberculosis disease are:

- **Better health outcomes for people with tuberculosis**: This is achieved through earlier detection and treatment.
- **More effective reduction of tuberculosis transmission and incidence**: This is done through shortening the average duration of tuberculosis infectiousness.

This review focused on symptom and chest radiography (CXR) screening. For symptom screening, individuals are questioned about the presence of one or more symptoms considered suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis, which are respiratory symptoms.

### The meta-analysis for ideal cytokines to distinguish the latent and active TB infection [^112zr83R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

One-fourth of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), though 90% of them have asymptomatic latent infections. These do not present any symptoms but result in a positive outcome in the IFN-γ release assay. There is a lack of an ideal strategy to distinguish active tuberculosis (TB) from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Some scientists have investigated a set of cytokines, in addition to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), as biomarkers to differentiate active TB from LTBI, but the results have shown considerable variance. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the overall discriminative ability of potential immune molecules in distinguishing between active TB and LTBI.

- **Methods**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies assessing the diagnostic roles of cytokines for distinguishing active TB and LTBI, published up to August 2018. The quality of enrolled studies was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of each cytokine were calculated using Meta-DiSc software. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to summarize the overall diagnostic performance of each biomarker.

- **Results**: Fourteen studies with 982 subjects met the inclusion criteria, comprising 526 active TB and 456 LTBI patients. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for discriminating between active TB and LTBI were analyzed for IL-2 (0.87, 0.61, and 0.9093), IP-10 (0.77, 0.73, and 0.8609), IL-5 (0.64, 0.75, and 0.8533), IL-13 (0.75, 0.71, and 0.8491), and IFN-γ (0.67, 0.75, and 0.8031).

### Comparing quantiFERON-TB GOLD plus with other tests to diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^1162b4rt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

The fourth-generation QuantiFERON test for tuberculosis infection, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), has replaced the earlier version, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT). A clinical need exists for information about agreement between QFT-Plus and other tests. We conducted this study to assess the agreement of test results for QFT-Plus with those of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT), T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT), and the tuberculin skin test (TST).

Persons at high risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and/or progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease were enrolled at the 10 sites of the Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium from October 2016 through May 2017; each participant received all four tests. Cohen's kappa (κ) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared qualitative and quantitative results of QFT-Plus with the other tests.

Test results for 506 participants showed 94% agreement between QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT, with 19% positive and 75% negative results. When the tests disagreed, it was most often in the direction of QFT-GIT negative/QFT-Plus positive. QFT-Plus had similar concordance as QFT-GIT with TST (77% and 77%, respectively) and T-SPOT (92% and 91%, respectively). The study showed high agreement between QFT-GIT and QFT-Plus in a direct comparison. Both tests had similar agreement with TST and T-SPOT.

### New diagnostics to infer risk in tuberculosis: Is the term "latent tuberculosis infection" obsolete [^114mnVks]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and estimation of risk in latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) remain a major clinical and global health challenge. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection reflects a continuum between LTBI and active tuberculosis (TB). LTBI is the most common form of Mtb infection, affecting one-quarter of the world's population and resulting in approximately 2,000,000 deaths annually. Immunocompetent individuals with LTBI have a 5–10% risk of developing active TB during their lifetime, most commonly within the first two years after exposure. Treatment of LTBI effectively reduces the risk of developing subsequent active TB disease. However, identifying patients most at risk of developing active TB and ensuring successful LTBI treatment remain significant challenges.

Available laboratory tests for detecting LTBI have serious diagnostic limitations, including a poor predictive value (< 5%) for identifying subjects with LTBI who will develop active TB. Tuberculin skin testing and IFN-γ release assays can detect cell-mediated immune reactivity in Mtb infection. However, none of these tests can differentiate LTBI from active TB. They also cannot distinguish between those who achieve subsequent bacterial clearance and/or effective infection containment from others who have silent and persistent infection at high risk of developing TB. Therefore, improvements in TB diagnostics are urgently needed to improve both sensitivity and specificity of Mtb infection detection and to determine more accurately the risk of progression or reactivation into active TB.

### Is passive diagnosis enough? The impact of subclinical disease on diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis [^116f5988]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by different phases: a subclinical phase where symptoms are absent or not considered abnormal, a prediagnostic phase where symptoms are noticed but not pursued for diagnosis, and a clinical phase where care is actively sought. Diagnostic capacity during these phases is limited.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the population-level impact of TB case-finding strategies in the presence of subclinical and prediagnostic disease.

- **Methods**: We created a mathematical epidemic model of TB, calibrated to global incidence. We introduced three prototypical diagnostic interventions: increased sensitivity of diagnosis in the clinical phase by 20% ("passive"); early diagnosis during the prediagnostic phase at a rate of 10% per year ("enhanced"); and population-based diagnosis of 5% of undiagnosed prevalent cases per year ("active").

- **Measurements and main results**: If the subclinical phase was ignored, as in most models, the passive strategy was projected to reduce TB incidence by 18% (90% uncertainty range [UR], 11–32%) by year 10, compared to 23% (90% UR, 14–35%) for the enhanced strategy and 18% (90% UR, 11–28%) for the active strategy. Incorporating a subclinical phase into the model, consistent with population-based prevalence surveys, showed that the active strategy still reduced 10-year TB incidence by 16% (90% UR, 11–28%). However, the impact of the passive and enhanced strategies was attenuated to 11% (90% UR, 8–25%) and 6% (90% UR, 4–13%), respectively. The degree of attenuation depended strongly on the transmission rate during the subclinical phase.

### Effect of isoniazid therapy for latent TB infection on QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube responses in adults with positive tuberculin skin test results in a high TB incidence area: a controlled study [^1161xUUX]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

T-cell interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are used in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and could be useful biomarkers of response to treatment of latent TB infection for clinical trials, infection control units, and TB programs.

- **Methods**: This investigation was a prospective, controlled substudy of IGRA responses in 82 healthy South African adults with HIV seronegative and positive tuberculin skin test results. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with 6 months of daily isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) or observation before Bacillus Calmette-Guérin revaccination in a clinical trial. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay was used to measure interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response to mycobacterial antigens at baseline and after IPT or observation.

- **Results**: IFN-γ levels declined between baseline and the end of IPT (signed rank test P ≤ .0001) and between baseline and a similar period of observation without IPT (signed rank test P = .03). The rate of decrease in IFN-γ responses over time did not differ between the groups (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test P = .31). QFT-GIT test results in two subjects (5%) in the IPT group and two subjects (5%) in the observation group reverted from positive to negative during follow-up. No significant difference was found between the groups with respect to baseline positivity or the proportion of patients whose tests reverted to negative.

- **Conclusions**: IPT had no effect on changes in QFT-GIT readouts during short-term follow-up of adults with positive tuberculin skin tests in a high TB incidence setting. QFT-GIT is unlikely to be a reliable marker for monitoring IPT efficacy in such environments.

### Is chemoprophylaxis necessary for all latent tuberculosis infection patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors? A cohort study [^113EUcLN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The tuberculosis (TB) burden is high in China, with a 32% prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in Beijing. Screening for LTBI and the chemoprophylaxis of positive patients are recommended prior to biologic therapy. This study evaluates the TB-related safety of secukinumab (SEC) in a cohort of plaque psoriasis patients with LTBI receiving different treatments.

- **Patient screening**: Plaque psoriasis patients eligible for SEC treatment were screened for TB. LTBI patients (QuantiFERON-TB test positive, QFT+) receiving SEC were closely monitored by chest radiograph, ESR or hs-CRP, and blood counts every 12 to 20 weeks for active TB infection. QFT_patients receiving SEC treatment were screened for LTBI every 6 to 12 months.

- **Patient outcomes**: Of 42 patients treated with SEC, 19 were QFT+ (45.24%). A QFT_patient became QFT+ after 6 months of treatment. Two patients started SEC treatment from 2015 to 2016 and were followed up 268 and 216 weeks later, respectively. Three patients received chemoprophylaxis, while 17 did not due to safety concerns or inability to complete the process. During the 16- to 268-week follow-up, no signs of TB reactivation were observed in the 20 LTBI patients receiving SEC.

This research suggests that plaque psoriasis patients with LTBI who received no chemoprophylaxis could be safely treated with SEC.

### Serial quantiferon-TB GOLD test results in 279 patients with psoriasis receiving biologic therapy [^1148A8W5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of active tuberculosis is still a concern in patients receiving biologics. To determine the risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation by Quantiferon-TB Gold (QFT) assay in psoriatic patients treated with biologics over 11 years' follow-up, along with any chest radiography alterations, this retrospective study was conducted. It included 279 patients with plaque-type, pustular, or nail psoriasis who were treated with biologics and had results for two or more LTBI tests.

QFT outcomes were defined according to the baseline and follow-up QFT results. Seroconversion was identified as a change from negative to positive, seroreversion as a change from positive to negative, persistently seronegative as consistently negative, persistently seropositive as consistently positive, and any other result as indeterminate. Demographic features and the presence and type of any chest X-ray abnormalities were noted during the follow-up.

Of the 279 baseline QFT tests, the vast majority were negative (n = 193; 69%), with a smaller number positive (n = 86; 31%). After starting biologic therapy, 10 (5.2%) of the 193 patients converted from negative to positive QFT status during the 11 years' follow-up (P < 0.001). Although these 10 patients exhibited seroconversion of QFT from negative to positive, only one patient was diagnosed with active TB. There was no statistically significant difference among biologics regarding QFT seroconversion risk (P = 0.09).

This study showed that 5.2% of patients experienced seroconversion. Annual QFT testing remains a necessary and mandatory tool to prevent further TB reactivation in psoriasis patients taking biologics.

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: Concordance, discordance or confusion [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in the diagnosis of active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations.

The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed:

- **Two-step approach**: Tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals), or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals).
- **Either TST or IGRA** but not both.
- **IGRA and TST together** to increase sensitivity.
- **IGRA only**, replacing the TST.

Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended, but most of the guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interest. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

### Latent tuberculosis: Two centuries of confusion [^113ADM8H]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Shifting definitions of latent tuberculosis**: Both pathology and microbiology positivity were ascertained postmortem, while immunologic testing is done antemortem. ATS refers to the American Thoracic Society.

- **Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection from different vantages**: Tuberculous reactivity starts later than infection due to the time required to mount a measurable immune response. This is presented as earlier to become negative, representing waning responses with severe infection. *NS denotes nonspecific. IGRA represents IFN-γ release assay; TST stands for tuberculin skin test.

The distinction between tuberculous immunoreactivity and tuberculous infection offers advantages in TB treatment, research, and public health. Under the definition of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), immunoreactive individuals who have cleared the bacteria meet the definition of "infection". Conversely, people who fail to meet the immunological definition of "infection" include patients with culture-confirmed TB and individuals with noncanonical immune responses. Recognizing the imperfection of tests allows for translational research to identify better biomarkers of tuberculous infection. Such markers could prioritize patients for preventive therapy and spare uninfected individuals from unnecessary treatments. Currently, candidate biomarkers are evaluated in TST/IGRA-based categories, where poor test performance might simply reflect an imperfect comparator.

### Simple estimates for local prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection, United States, 2011–2015 [^111KWMSB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) represents an asymptomatic equilibrium between the host's immune response and the infectious process. Although not infectious, LTBI can be activated years later as infectious tuberculosis (TB). This potential for activation underlines why diagnosing and treating LTBI in high-risk populations is a key component of the World Health Organization End TB Strategy.

Most countries have established systems for surveillance of active TB. Public health interventions for TB control include timely detection and treatment of active cases as well as prompt investigations of individuals who have had recent contact with someone with infectious TB. However, few jurisdictions have estimates of local LTBI prevalence. Having such estimates could help direct TB prevention efforts towards individuals at the highest risk for infection, progression to TB, and benefit from treatment to prevent progression. We describe a simple method that uses genotyping results from active TB cases to derive a population estimate of untreated LTBI prevalence for any jurisdiction.

### CT and F-FDG PET abnormalities in contacts with recent tuberculosis infections but negative chest X-ray [^114zR2U2]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

LTBI treatment is initiated for close contacts based on the result of TST and/or IGRA positivity. The positive predictive values of TST and IGRA for developing active TB are limited to an average of 2.7% and 1.5% over a 2-year period after TB infection, respectively, suggesting that narrower criteria are needed to identify contacts at high risk for developing TB. Recently introduced whole-blood transcriptional signatures are a promising tool to improve prediction, but their positive predictive values were 6.8–9.4% over 2 years and 11.2–14.4% over 3 months based on a pre-test probability of 2%. The 2-year positive predictive values did not meet the World Health Organization (WHO) target for predicting progression from TB infection to active disease, although the 3-month result exceeded the minimum of the WHO target.

Currently, radiographically negative asymptomatic cases with incipient TB receive LTBI treatment, as they are classified as having latent TB due to normal X-ray findings. In a small series of HIV-infected contacts, TB progression exclusively occurred in contacts with minimal CT or PET abnormalities. Greater bacterial burdens place patients at a higher risk for progression, and the size and metabolic uptake of abnormalities can reflect the quantity of bacilli and associated inflammatory burden. Taken together, close contacts with minimal CT or PET abnormalities may have a higher risk for TB progression than those without such abnormalities.

Treatment initiation for incipient TB with a low bacillary burden may be a potential way to improve the treatment outcomes.

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionized LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

- **Objectives**: With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence-base in recent years, limitations and uncertainties in clinical interpretation have come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis, these include:
	1. Prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying risk of progression to active disease.
	2. False-negative rates in immunocompromised patients.
	3. Clinical meaning of IGRA reversion.
	4. Significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting the use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

- **Methodological approach**: Ongoing large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of these uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

- **Conclusions and impact**: Planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence-base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of IGRAs in the near future.

### Multicytokine detection improves latent tuberculosis diagnosis in health care workers [^115tssmB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

In a low-incidence setting, health care workers (HCW) are at a higher risk of tuberculosis than the general population. The suboptimal sensitivity of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) test remains a critical issue when identifying occupational latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in HCW. The aim of this study was to identify additional biomarkers in order to overcome the limits of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs) and improve the performance of LTBI diagnosis within this population.

Seventy Bacille Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated HCWs regularly exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis were grouped according to QFT results into an LTBI-positive group (positive QFT, n = 8), an LTBI-negative group (normal QFT and negative tuberculin skin test [TST], n = 21), and an undetermined group (subpositive QFT and/or positive TST, n = 41). The secretion of 22 cytokines in response to QFT-specific stimulation was quantified using a multiparameter-based immunoassay. As a result, thresholds discriminating LTBI-positive from LTBI-negative HCW were established by comparing areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-15, IFN-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and the monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG), which are biomarkers differentially secreted by the two groups. The combination of IL-15 and MIG provided a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94.1% in distinguishing LTBI-positive from LTBI-negative HCW. When using IL-15 and MIG among the undetermined group, 6/45 HCW could be classified in the LTBI-positive group.

### Latent tuberculosis: Two centuries of confusion [^115FvKPB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The 21st-century definition of latent TB refers to a host who is TB immunoreactive in the absence of TB disease. It is on this historical backdrop that, at the tail end of the 20th century, latent TB acquired yet another new definition. This modern definition circles back to the host. However, in contrast to the 19th-century postmortem pathological diagnosis, it is now an antemortem immunological diagnosis. This new diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI) requires a pertinent positive — TB immunoreactivity — and a pertinent negative — the absence of clinical manifestations. Each of these presents diagnostic quandaries.

The TB immunoreactivity tests (tuberculin skin test (TST) and, more recently, interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)) are neither 100% specific nor sensitive. A positive TST/IGRA cannot distinguish between present infection and present disease, nor can it differentiate present from past infection. Several lines of evidence suggest that the majority of individuals thought to have LTBI have actually cleared their TB infection. Conversely, a negative TST/IGRA test is observed in 10–40% of HIV-negative individuals with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, and an even higher percentage of patients with miliary TB.

Moreover, a new concept has emerged that recognizes people who have epidemiological evidence of exposure but lack demonstrable T-cell–mediated immune responses to mycobacterial antigens. Such individuals would test negative. For these "resisters", there is evidence through alternative assays that infection has occurred despite the subject being unresponsive to traditional tests.

### Beyond latent and active tuberculosis: a scoping review of conceptual frameworks [^111Vb2Xs]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

While TB continued to be largely managed in sanatoria, microbiological, radiological, and other diagnostic tools to assess the state of the disease were becoming increasingly available, and the need for a standardized approach to disease classification was recognized to aid statistical comparisons and clinical communication. In particular, it was considered important to have a consistent approach to classifying the condition of the patient at entry into the sanatoria (reflecting prognosis) and the condition during follow-up and at discharge (reflecting the degree of cure/healing and likelihood of relapse).

Soon after the inception of the National Tuberculosis Association in 1904, a Committee on Clinical Nomenclature was formed. Discussions, surveys, and consensus-building for over a decade led to the development of the first Diagnostic Standards and Classification of Tuberculosis in 1917. Here, the classification of pulmonary TB in adults consisted of three dimensions, each clearly defined: (i) the extent of pulmonary lesions initially categorized as incipient, moderately advanced, and far advanced; (ii) symptoms categorized as slight/none, moderate; (iii) clinical/treatment status — initially suspicious case, definite case, arrested/apparently arrested case.

Over subsequent iterations, details were added, clinical status became more nuanced, bacteriology was increasingly emphasized, and there were changes to terminology. However, the broad classification approach remained similar with a focus on stratification by disease extent and clinical status.

The availability of antibiotics from the 1950s for TB treatment marked a significant shift in managing the disease.

### Chest roentgenography is complementary to interferon-gamma release assay in latent tuberculosis infection screening of rheumatic patients [^114fpfDC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with RA, AS, or PsA, who received their first LTBI screening as candidates for biologics or users between January 2013 and April 2014 in a tertiary-care hospital, were included in this retrospective study. All patients received a CXR with tuberculosis IGRA test (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, Cellestis, Australia). This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (IRB-105066-E). The medical records of all patients were reviewed until one year after the screening, and a history of previous MTB infection and close contact with patients with MTB was also identified.

According to the Taiwan Rheumatology Association Recommendations, candidates for biologic therapy should receive initial IGRA and CXR screening. Users should receive yearly IGRA screening and CXR every six months. Nine months of daily isoniazid 300 mg therapy (9H) is recommended for LTBI chemoprevention. Patients with LTBI are defined as those with a positive IGRA but without CXR or other evidence of active MTB. If IGRA tests are negative or indeterminate, LTBI diagnosis depends on clinical conditions and CXR findings. If patients with LTBI are unwilling to take or intolerant to isoniazid, they can receive CXR follow-up every three months by tuberculosis specialists or pulmonologists.

Two pulmonologists reviewed the CXR taken within three months of the IGRA screening. Apical pleural thickening, interstitial granuloma calcification, thin-wall cysts, pericardial calcifications, and fibrotic lesions were seen as irregularities.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111Ld5UW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is an important infectious cause of morbidity and mortality among adults worldwide. In 2019, there were an estimated 10 million new cases of tuberculosis disease, with 1.2 million tuberculosis deaths among HIV‐negative people and an additional 208,000 deaths among people living with HIV infection. An estimated one‐quarter of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the microorganism that causes tuberculosis. In humans, M. tuberculosis infection typically affects the lungs (although it can affect other sites) and spreads by airborne transmission. Patients with infectious tuberculosis spread bacilli, most commonly through coughing. After initial infection, approximately 5% to 10% of infected people develop tuberculosis disease, also called active tuberculosis. Between 90% to 95% of infected people develop a tuberculosis infection, which may reactivate at a later stage, especially in the presence of conditions that affect immunity, including HIV infection, undernutrition, and old age. It can take months to years for people to develop symptomatic and bacteriologically detectable tuberculosis. Tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis disease are increasingly seen as two ends of a continuous spectrum. Between these are early disease states that may be described as incipient tuberculosis and subclinical tuberculosis. In the absence of diagnosis and treatment, people with tuberculosis disease may be infectious for prolonged periods.

### Detection of interleukin-2 is not useful for distinguishing between latent and active tuberculosis in clinical practice: A prospective cohort study [^115jUW9d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Previous reports have identified interleukin-2 (IL-2), quantified in the supernatants of QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-tube (QFT) after 72 hours of incubation, as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between latent and active tuberculosis (TB). However, its validity has not been tested in an appropriate clinical cohort.

A multicentre study involved 161 consecutive adult patients undergoing evaluation for active TB at eight TB units in Spain. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-2 were assessed in the supernatant of QFT after 16–24 hours and 72 hours of incubation. The accuracy of IL-2 for indicating latent TB infection (LTBI) was assessed by receiving operating characteristic curves.

Twenty-eight participants were not infected, 43 had LTBI, 69 had TB, and 21 were not classifiable. Median (interquartile range) IL-2 concentrations after 72 hours of incubation were 0.0 pg/mL (0.0–0.0) in uninfected individuals, 261.0 pg/mL (81.0–853.0) in LTBI individuals, 166.5 pg/mL (33.5–551.5) in patients with extrapulmonary TB, 95.0 pg/mL (26.0–283.0) in patients with smear-negative pulmonary TB, and 38.5 pg/mL (7.5–178.0) in patients with smear-positive pulmonary TB (p < 0.0001). The area under the curve of the receiving operating characteristic curve (95% CI) of IL-2 after 72 hours of incubation for the diagnosis of LTBI was 0.63 (0.53–0.74) when all TB cases were considered as a single group, ranging from 0.59 (0.47–0.71) to 0.72 (0.58–0.85) when only extrapulmonary and smear-positive pulmonary TB cases respectively were considered.

Quantification of IL-2 in the supernatant does not distinguish effectively between latent and active tuberculosis in clinical practice.

### Meta-analysis: New tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: Areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^116mwske]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, the tuberculin skin test was the only test for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, but two ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are now commercially licensed.

- **Purpose**: To estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of IGRAs (commercial or research versions of QuantiFERON [QFT] and Elispot) for diagnosing latent TB infection in healthy and immune-suppressed persons.

- **Data sources**: The authors searched MEDLINE and reviewed citations of all original articles and reviews for studies published in English.

- **Study selection**: Studies had evaluated IGRAs using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (RD1 antigens) and overnight (16- to 24-h) incubation times. Reference standards had to be clearly defined without knowledge of test results.

- **Data extraction and quality assessment**: Specific criteria for quality assessment were developed for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

- **Data synthesis**: When newly diagnosed active TB was used as a surrogate for latent TB infection, the sensitivity of all tests was suboptimal, although it was higher with Elispot. No test distinguishes active TB from latent TB. Sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and IGRAs was similar in persons who were categorized into clinical gradients of exposure. Pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) and 92.5% (CI, 86% to 99%) for QFT and for Elispot, respectively. Both assays were more specific than the tuberculin skin test in samples vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. Elispot was more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in three studies.

### Chest computed tomography is more likely to show latent tuberculosis foci than simple chest radiography in liver transplant candidates [^113HU3Vo]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Although the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis infections (LTBIs) in transplant candidates are essential, diagnostic methods for LTBIs are limited, especially in immunocompromised subjects. Pre-transplant chest computed tomography (CT) may reveal more LTBI foci and thus predict the development of post-transplant tuberculosis (TB) more efficiently; however, this hypothesis has not yet been investigated. Thirty-six liver transplantation (LT) recipients who developed TB (the TB group) and 144 LT recipients who did not develop TB (the control group) were retrospectively enrolled into a study with a nested case-control design, and their clinical characteristics and radiological findings were compared. Tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) were not performed, and none of these patients had been treated for LTBIs. Thirty-six of 2549 LT recipients (1.4%) were diagnosed with TB after LT (median = 10 months, range = 1–80 months). Twenty-eight patients (77.8%) successfully completed the treatment.

There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics of the two groups. Abnormal CT findings (40.0% versus 17.3%, P = 0.018) and chest X-ray (CXR) findings (25.0% versus 11.8%, P = 0.044) suggestive of healed TB were significantly more frequent in the TB group versus the control group. Of the 10 patients who underwent chest CT and developed TB, 5 (50%) showed abnormal findings only on chest CT scans, whereas their CXR results were normal.

In conclusion, a pre-transplant chest CT scan is more likely to show an LTBI than a CXR in those with post-LT TB.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cAjfU]. BMJ (2020). High credibility.

Testing people for latent tuberculosis infection and providing effective treatment is critical to the elimination of the disease. Deciding to test for latent infection depends on both the probability of infection and the risk for progression to active disease. As part of the assessment for latent tuberculosis infection, the tuberculin skin test (TST) or commercially available interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; T-SPOT.TB or QuantiFERON-TB (QFT)), or both, are commonly used.

The TST and IGRA rely on an adaptive immune response to tuberculosis antigens. The TST involves an injection of non-specific tuberculosis antigens, which induces a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that can be measured in infected individuals, whereas IGRAs are blood tests that measure interferon γ produced by lymphocytes in whole blood in the presence of tuberculosis-specific antigens.

In the presence of a positive test result for latent infection, treatment depends on a careful consideration of the benefits and risks. These primarily include the benefit of reducing an individual's probability of developing tuberculosis and the risk of treatment-related side effects, which are substantial with treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: an international Delphi consensus exercise [^117AHSRh]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The active/latent paradigm of tuberculosis (TB) largely neglects the documented spectrum of disease. Lack of consistency on definitions, terminology, and diagnostic criteria for different TB states constrains progress in research and product development required to achieve TB elimination.

We reached consensus on a set of conceptual states, related terminology, and research gaps through a Delphi process involving 64 experts representing a wide range of disciplines, sectors, income settings, and geographies.

The resulting International Consensus for Early TB (ICE-TB) framework distinguishes disease from infection by the presence of macroscopic pathology. It defines two subclinical and two clinical tuberculosis states based on reported symptoms or signs of TB, further differentiated by likely infectiousness. The presence of viable M. tuberculosis and an associated host response are prerequisites for all infection and disease states.

Our framework provides a clear direction for TB research, which, in time with scientific progress, will improve TB clinical care and elimination policies.

### Latent tuberculosis infection-associated immunodiagnostic test responses as biomarkers of incipient tuberculosis: Fruitful or futile [^111BEYz9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Another broader issue raised by this study is the ambiguous and confusing interpretation of IGRA readouts. On the one hand, positive IGRA responses are often interpreted as a marker of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and hence "protection", given that approximately 95% never progress to active disease, and serial IGRA responses often decrease during the course of successful TB treatment. In contrast, the work of Gupta and others suggests that IGRAs are a biomarker of incipient TB, and hence TB risk. Which is it, protection or risk? The answer is both, depending on the clinical context.

Thus, the conundrum can be resolved by recognizing that TB is a spectrum of infection, which is a dynamic interplay between host and pathogen at the level of the granuloma. This may change over time, reflecting time point-specific host immunity and mycobacterial disease burden, and hence changing levels of TB-specific effector T cells in blood. A temporal compartment-specific effect may also influence interpretation as a result of translocation of antigen-specific T cells from the blood to the disease site (e.g. the lung). Thus, serial measurements may often be required to determine whether IGRA responses are stable, increase in magnitude over time (conversion), or reduce in magnitude over time (reversion), possibly suggesting clearance of infection. This concept has been well outlined in a recent review.

Thus, IGRA readouts can be a marker of protection or susceptibility depending on the context. This will explain why patients with stable, persistently positive IGRA responses remain asymptomatic and do not progress to active disease.

### Evaluation of QuantiFERON-TB GOLD-Plus in health care workers in a low-incidence setting [^112tG3q5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Although launched in 2015, little is known about the accuracy of QuantiFERON-TB Gold-Plus (QFT-Plus) for diagnosis of latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Unlike its predecessor, QFT-Plus utilizes two antigen tubes to elicit an immune response from CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. We conducted a cross-sectional study in low-risk health care workers (HCWs) at a single U.S. center to compare QFT-Plus to QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube (QFT). A total of 989 HCWs were tested with both QFT and QFT-Plus. Risk factors for LTBI were obtained from a questionnaire. QFT-Plus was considered positive if either antigen tube 1 (TB1) or TB2 tested positive, per the manufacturer's recommendations, or if both TB1 and TB2 tested positive using a conservative definition. Results were compared using Cohen's kappa and linear regression, respectively. Agreement of QFT with QFT-Plus was high, at 95.6% (95% confidence interval, 94.3 to 96.9; kappa, 0.57). The majority of discordant results between QFT and QFT-Plus TB1 (84.8%) and QFT and QFT-Plus TB2 (88.6%) fell within the range of 0.2 to 0.7 IU/ml. The positivity rate in 626 HCWs with no identifiable risk factors and no self-reported history of positive LTBI tests was 2.1% (CI, 1.0 to 3.2) and 3.0% (CI, 1.7 to 4.3) with QFT and QFT-Plus, respectively. A conservative definition of a QFT-Plus-positive result yielded a positivity rate of 1.0% (CI, 0.2 to 1.7; P value of 0.0002 versus QFT-Plus and 0.07 versus QFT). On follow-up testing of 11 HCWs with discordant QFT-Plus results, 90.9% (10/11) had a negative QFT result. The QFT-Plus assay showed…

### Evaluating latent tuberculosis infection diagnostics using latent class analysis [^114L6nAw]. Thorax (2018). Low credibility.

The lack of a gold standard for latent TB infection has precluded the direct measurement of test characteristics of the tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assays (QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB).

- **Objective**: We estimated test sensitivity/specificity and latent TB infection prevalence in a prospective, US-based cohort of 10,740 participants at high risk for latent infection.

- **Methods**: Bayesian latent class analysis was used to estimate test sensitivity/specificity and latent TB infection prevalence among subgroups based on age, foreign birth outside the United States, and HIV infection.

- **Results**: Latent TB infection prevalence varied from 4.0% among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged < 5 years to 34.0% among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥ 5 years. Test sensitivity ranged from 45.8% for the T-SPOT.TB among foreign-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged ≥ 5 years to 80.7% for the tuberculin skin test among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥ 5 years. The skin test was less specific than either interferon-γ release assay, particularly among foreign-born populations; for example, the skin test had 70.0% specificity among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥ 5 years versus 98.5% and 99.3% specificity for the QuantiFERON and T-SPOT.TB, respectively. The tuberculin skin test's positive predictive value ranged from 10.0% among foreign-born children aged < 5 years to 69.2% among foreign-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged ≥ 5 years. The positive predictive values of the QuantiFERON (41.4%) and T-SPOT.TB (77.5%) were also low among US-born, HIV-seropositive individuals.

### Chest roentgenography is complementary to interferon-gamma release assay in latent tuberculosis infection screening of rheumatic patients [^113C5srW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Taiwan recommendations for LTBI screening and prophylaxis suggest that patients with positive IGRA tests receive isoniazid prophylaxis following a comprehensive evaluation of clinical conditions and the exclusion of active MTB. Those with negative IGRA but CXR findings of possible MTB sequelae might receive prophylactic treatment or cautious follow-up by a tuberculosis specialist or pulmonologist.

Among 46 patients with positive IGRA, six did not receive prophylaxis, including two who postponed TNFi therapy after evaluation, two who were followed by pulmonologists instead of receiving isoniazid prophylaxis, and two with previous complete MTB treatment. The other 40 patients underwent isoniazid prophylaxis. IGRA-non-positive patients with old TB-suggestive CXR comprised 13.4% (32/238) of all our rheumatic patients. They were asymptomatic, and none received chemoprophylaxis.

### Time for a change? Updated guidelines using interferon gamma release assays for detection of latent tuberculosis infection in the office setting [^112SqSxk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). High credibility.

Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and other systemic medications increases the risk of reactivating a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Therefore, screening for latent TB infection is important in dermatology patients eligible for treatment with these medications. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) has its limitations, it has been the standard choice for diagnosis of latent TB infection. Since the development of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), the role of the TST has been re-evaluated, and IGRAs have increasingly been incorporated into national guidelines.

- **Use of tests**: Although there are situations when either test may be performed, in individuals who have received a BCG vaccination and in those who are unlikely to return for a TST reading, IGRAs may be particularly helpful in distinguishing patients at risk for TB. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both the TST and the IGRA and presents a summary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 guidelines for using IGRAs.

### Optimal testing choice and diagnostic strategies for latent tuberculosis infection among US-born people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [^1136d4Wi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The increased risk of progression from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to tuberculosis (TB) disease among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH) makes them a priority for LTBI testing and treatment. However, studies comparing the performance of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) and the tuberculin skin test (TST) among PLWH are lacking.

- **Methods**: We used Bayesian latent class analysis to estimate the prevalence of LTBI and diagnostic characteristics of the TST, QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube (QFT), and T.SPOT-TB (TSPOT) among a prospective, multicenter cohort of US-born PLWH aged ≥ 5 years with valid results for all three LTBI tests, using standard US cutoffs (≥ 5 mm TST, ≥ 0.35 IU/mL QFT, ≥ 8 spots TSPOT). Additionally, we explored the performance of varying LTBI test cutoffs.

- **Results**: Among 1510 PLWH (median CD4+ count 532 cells/mm³), the estimated LTBI prevalence was 4.7%. TSPOT was significantly more specific (99.7%) and had a significantly higher positive predictive value (90.0%, PPV) than QFT (96.5% specificity, 50.7% PPV) and TST (96.8% specificity, 45.4% PPV). QFT was significantly more sensitive (72.2%) than TST (54.2%) and TSPOT (51.9%); the negative predictive value of all tests was high (TST 97.7%, QFT 98.6%, TSPOT 97.6%). Even at the highest cutoffs evaluated (15 mm TST, ≥ 1.00 IU/mL QFT, ≥ 8 spots TSPOT), TST and QFT specificity were significantly lower than TSPOT.

- **Conclusions**: LTBI prevalence among this cohort of US-born PLWH was low compared to non-US born persons. TSPOT's higher PPV may make it preferable for testing US-born PLWH at low risk for TB exposure.

### Use in routine clinical practice of two commercial blood tests for diagnosis of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a prospective study [^114qb9YL]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Two commercial blood assays for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection — T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold — have been separately compared with the tuberculin skin test; our aim was to compare the efficacy of all three tests in the same population sample.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective study in 393 consecutively enrolled patients who were tested simultaneously with T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold due to suspected latent or active tuberculosis. In addition, 318 patients had results available for a tuberculin skin test.

- **Findings**: Overall agreement with the skin test was similar (T-SPOT.TB kappa = 0.508, QuantiFERON-TB Gold kappa = 0.460). However, fewer BCG-vaccinated individuals were identified as positive by the two blood assays than by the tuberculin skin test (p = 0.003 for T-SPOT.TB and p < 0.0001 for QuantiFERON-TB Gold). Indeterminate results were significantly more frequent with QuantiFERON-TB Gold (11%, 43 of 383) than with T-SPOT.TB (3%, 12 of 383; p < 0.0001) and were associated with immunosuppressive treatments for both tests. Age younger than 5 years was significantly associated with indeterminate results with QuantiFERON-TB Gold (p = 0.003), but not with T-SPOT.TB. Overall, T-SPOT.TB yielded significantly more positive results (38%, n = 144, vs. 26%, n = 100, with QuantiFERON-TB Gold; p < 0.0001), and close contacts of patients with active tuberculosis were more likely to test positive with T-SPOT.TB than with QuantiFERON-TB Gold (p = 0.0010).

- **Interpretation**: T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold have higher specificity than the tuberculin skin test.
