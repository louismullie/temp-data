angioedema

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about angioedema, specifically how to approach its evaluation and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate airway and stabilization priorities. Then, I should classify the angioedema phenotype by mediator and presence or absence of urticaria. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and key mimics. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic workup, including when to order C4, C1-INH antigen and function, and C1q. Then, I will detail acute management by mechanism, including ACE inhibitor–induced disease, HAE, and histaminergic angioedema. Finally, I should address disposition, follow-up, and special populations, and close with a concise decision algorithm that ties these steps together.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation come first, and I need to check for stridor, dysphonia, dysphagia, or rapidly progressive oropharyngeal swelling that signals impending airway compromise. If present, I should not delay definitive airway management, because laryngeal angioedema can deteriorate quickly and carries substantial mortality risk in HAE and other bradykinin-mediated forms, so I should secure the airway early rather than wait for complete obstruction [^116qLh9s] [^114vFQ7m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I classify the phenotype. I need to check whether there are urticaria or wheals, because angioedema with urticaria suggests a mast cell–mediated process, whereas angioedema without urticaria points toward bradykinin-mediated disease such as HAE, acquired C1-INH deficiency, or ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema. This distinction is foundational because it determines whether antihistamines and corticosteroids will help or be ineffective [^116iW7Tq] [^114wMHQN] [^111T2q6G].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis systematically. Let me consider histaminergic causes including allergic reactions, acute and chronic urticaria, and drug-induced cases, then bradykinin-mediated causes including HAE types I and II, acquired C1-INH deficiency, and ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema, and finally idiopathic nonhistaminergic forms. I should double-check for mimics such as cellulitis, deep venous thrombosis, mucosal infections, and mass effect lesions, because misclassification here leads to inappropriate therapy and delays in correct treatment [^113Ym3Ep] [^114E7WZ2] [^111vW4Mi].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup. Wait, let me verify the first-line screen for suspected bradykinin-mediated disease — C4 is the best initial test because it is typically low during attacks in C1-INH deficiency, and if C4 is abnormal I should proceed to C1-INH antigen and function, adding C1q if acquired C1-INH deficiency is suspected. I need to ensure I also obtain a careful medication history, especially ACE inhibitors, and a family history, since up to a quarter of HAE cases are de novo and may lack a known family history [^114fWdpN] [^111NxVdr] [^1155t7pd] [^112vpt7T].

> Let me think about ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema specifically. I should confirm exposure and immediately discontinue the ACE inhibitor, because continued use increases recurrence risk, and I need to remember that onset can be delayed from hours to years after initiation. Critically, there is no high-quality evidence supporting specific drug therapy for ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema, so management is supportive with airway protection as needed, and I should avoid giving antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine unless the presentation suggests concomitant allergic features or anaphylaxis, in which case those therapies are appropriate for the allergic component [^116qLh9s] [^1118cMUi].

> For hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency, I should confirm that antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine are ineffective and avoid delaying definitive therapy. On-demand HAE-specific agents include plasma-derived or recombinant C1-INH, the kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide, and the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant, and I need to ensure early administration because faster treatment improves outcomes. Patients with known HAE may carry their own medication, so I should ask and facilitate self-administration when appropriate [^115E1nd1] [^115mHBMw] [^114kaCZH].

> But wait, what if this is histaminergic angioedema? I should treat with second-generation H1 antihistamines as first-line, escalate dosing up to fourfold if needed, add a brief course of corticosteroids for severe or refractory attacks, and use intramuscular epinephrine promptly if there are features of anaphylaxis or significant airway involvement. I need to ensure trigger identification and avoidance counseling as part of discharge planning [^117Btbxz] [^114BMBpo] [^117FCcej].

> I need to check for special anatomic sites and complications. Abdominal angioedema can mimic an acute surgical abdomen, so if pain is severe or the diagnosis is uncertain, contrast-enhanced CT may show bowel wall edema, ascites, and mesenteric changes and help avoid unnecessary surgery. Similarly, head and neck imaging can assist in assessing airway compromise and excluding alternative causes when the clinical picture is unclear or the patient is unstable for full examination [^111cRHuN] [^117U61UN] [^112fTbZk].

> Next, I should review disposition and follow-up. All patients with suspected or confirmed bradykinin-mediated angioedema warrant specialty referral, and those with HAE need access to comprehensive, integrated care and an on-demand treatment plan. I should confirm that patients leave with clear return precautions for airway symptoms, medication instructions, and, for HAE, an action plan and access to HAE-specific therapy. For ACE inhibitor–associated cases, I must document counseling to avoid future ACE inhibitor exposure and coordinate alternative antihypertensive management [^1162EBJo] [^116qLh9s].

> Let me reconsider pediatric and adolescent patients. HAE often presents in childhood, and median diagnostic delay is long, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion for recurrent nonpruritic swelling or unexplained abdominal pain, screen with C4 when HAE is suspected, and ensure age-appropriate access to on-demand therapies and prophylaxis plans, recognizing that pediatric evidence is more limited and expert guidance is essential [^115FsHh1] [^112nT3db] [^113mobCS].

> Finally, I should double-check that my decision algorithm is coherent: assess airway and stabilize first. Classify as with or without urticaria. If with urticaria, treat as histaminergic with antihistamines and epinephrine for anaphylaxis. If without urticaria, suspect bradykinin-mediated disease, stop ACE inhibitors if relevant, order C4 with C1-INH antigen and function and C1q as indicated, treat HAE with on-demand HAE-specific agents, and arrange specialty follow-up. Throughout, I must actively exclude mimics to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy [^111yKS4p] [^114fWdpN] [^1155t7pd] [^1162EBJo].

Angioedema is **rapid, non-pitting swelling** of the deep dermis and submucosa, often involving the face, lips, tongue, and airway, and can be life-threatening if it compromises respiration [^11147Rxy]. It is classified as **mast cell–mediated (histaminergic), bradykinin-mediated, or idiopathic**; mast cell–mediated forms respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine, whereas bradykinin-mediated forms (HAE, ACE inhibitor–induced) do not and require targeted therapies such as C1-inhibitor replacement, icatibant, or ecallantide [^114wMHQN] [^114kaCZH]. Immediate priorities are **airway assessment and protection**, with early intubation if there is any concern for obstruction [^116qLh9s]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features and, for bradykinin-mediated disease, C4, C1-INH antigen and function, and C1q; management is tailored to the underlying mechanism, with ACE inhibitors stopped in drug-induced cases and specialist referral for HAE or acquired C1-INH deficiency [^114fWdpN] [^111GuFZU].

---

## Pathophysiology

Angioedema results from **increased vascular permeability** and fluid extravasation into subcutaneous and submucosal tissues, driven by different mediators [^117SH7Yk]:

- **Mast cell–mediated (histaminergic)**: IgE-mediated or non–IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation releases histamine, causing vasodilation and increased permeability; often associated with urticaria and anaphylaxis [^111pLSh7].

- **Bradykinin-mediated**: Excess bradykinin from dysregulated kallikrein–kinin system; includes hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1-INH deficiency, acquired C1-INH deficiency, and ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema [^117SH7Yk].

- **Idiopathic**: No identifiable cause; may be spontaneous or triggered by unknown factors [^116p1pY1].

---

## Clinical presentation

Angioedema presents with **localized, non-pitting edema** of the deep dermis and submucosa, typically involving the face, lips, tongue, and extremities [^11147Rxy]. Airway involvement (larynx, oropharynx) can cause life-threatening obstruction [^116qLh9s]. Abdominal angioedema causes severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, often mimicking acute abdomen [^114oYE1a]. Pruritus is common in histaminergic forms, whereas bradykinin-mediated angioedema is typically non-pruritic and may be accompanied by a prodrome (erythema marginatum, tingling) [^111xReXL].

---

## Classification

Angioedema is classified by **mechanism and etiology**:

| **Category** | **Subtypes** | **Characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Mast cell–mediated | - Allergic <br/> - Idiopathic histaminergic <br/> - Autoimmune | - Urticaria common <br/> - Responds to antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine [^117FCcej] |
| Bradykinin-mediated | - Hereditary angioedema (HAE) <br/> - Acquired C1-INH deficiency <br/> - ACE inhibitor–induced | - No urticaria <br/> - Does not respond to antihistamines <br/> - Requires targeted therapies [^114kaCZH] |
| Idiopathic | - Unknown mechanism | - Recurrent attacks <br/> - No identifiable cause [^114fWdpN] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, supported by history, examination, and targeted testing [^114Npm4r]:

- **History**: Onset, duration, triggers, family history, medication use (especially ACE inhibitors) [^111GuFZU].

- **Laboratory tests**: C4, C1-INH antigen and function, C1q; complement studies differentiate bradykinin-mediated forms [^1155t7pd].

- **Imaging**: Limited role; CT/MRI may assess airway or abdominal involvement when diagnosis is uncertain [^111cRHuN].

---

## Management

### General principles

Immediate priorities are **airway assessment and protection**, with early intubation if there is any concern for obstruction [^116qLh9s]. Identify and discontinue triggers — especially ACE inhibitors — and initiate mechanism-specific therapy [^111GuFZU]. Provide patient education on recognition, avoidance, and emergency action plans [^114vFQ7m].

---

### Specific treatments

#### Mast cell–mediated angioedema

Treat with **antihistamines** (H1 blockers) as first-line therapy, adding corticosteroids for severe or refractory cases and epinephrine for anaphylaxis or airway compromise [^117Btbxz].

---

#### Bradykinin-mediated angioedema

- **C1-INH replacement**: Plasma-derived or recombinant C1-INH for acute attacks and prophylaxis [^111Ee6uP].

- **Bradykinin pathway inhibition**: Icatibant (B2 receptor antagonist) or ecallantide (kallikrein inhibitor) for acute attacks [^114kaCZH].

- **Supportive care**: Airway management, fluids, analgesia; antihistamines and corticosteroids are ineffective [^1171pLGQ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **cause and severity**; HAE and ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema can be recurrent and life-threatening [^116nT3hk]. Complications include airway obstruction, asphyxiation, and significant morbidity from abdominal and laryngeal attacks [^11685w3u].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventive strategies include **trigger avoidance** — especially ACE inhibitors and known allergens — and long-term prophylaxis with C1-INH replacement, attenuated androgens, or antifibrinolytics for frequent or severe HAE [^1162EBJo]. Patient education on early recognition, self-treatment, and emergency plans is essential [^115mHBMw].

---

Angioedema is a **localized swelling of deep dermal and submucosal tissues** with diverse causes; rapid recognition, mechanism-specific treatment, and airway protection are critical to management.

### Angioedema as a predominant symptom ofinfection [^113Jv6uh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Bordetella pertussis is a Gram-negative bacterium, and is the pathogen of the highly contagious pertussis known as 'whooping cough'. Since 2011, the increasing incidence of pertussis despite high vaccination coverage has given rise to discussion across the world. Suggested reasons for the resurgence of pertussis include higher awareness, improved diagnostic tests, emergence of new B. pertussis strains with greater virulence or resistance to vaccination, and rapidly waning immunity after vaccination.

Pertussis is primarily dangerous for infants; 16 of 26 reported pertussis-related deaths in Europe in 2016 and all deaths in 2017 occurred in children younger than 3 months. Therefore, the focus must be placed on disease prevention, especially to reduce the risk of transmission to infants.

Pertussis infection is known to proceed through three typical stages: first, catarrhal, second, paroxysmal with classic paroxysms of coughing and an inspiratory 'whoop' noise, and third, the convalescent stage. Adults and vaccinated patients may, however, present with mild or atypical symptoms. Here, we describe the case of an unvaccinated adult who presented with angioedema as a rare atypical symptom of B. pertussis infection.

### Pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema: the role of the bradykinin-forming cascade [^1124Yfh4]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal-dominant disorder owing to mutations in the C1 inhibitor gene. Type I is characterized by a low C1 inhibitor protein level and diminished functional activity, whereas type II has a normal (or elevated) protein level but diminished function. When functional levels drop beyond 40% of normal, attacks of swelling are likely to occur due to overproduction of bradykinin. Angioedema can be peripheral, abdominal, or laryngeal. The typical duration of episodes is 3 days. Therapies include C1 inhibitor replacement for prophylaxis or acute therapy, whereas inhibition of kallikrein or blockade at the bradykinin receptor level can interrupt acute episodes of swelling.

### Hereditary angioedema [^116hveyo]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by a C1-inhibitor deficiency. It is characterized by potentially life-threatening recurrent episodes of angioedema of the skin and mucosa. Several recent studies have further elucidated the immunology of HAE implicating bradykinin, the key mediator of the contact system. This article reviews the pathophysiology, subtypes, and clinical features of HAE. Therapeutic approaches for various clinical situations (emergency and prophylactic regimens) are also discussed.

Introduction

Angioedema (AE) with C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-AE) belongs to the group of bradykinin (BK)-mediated AEs. These AEs are rare, potentially life-threatening, and characterized by recurrent angioedema episodes. They can be further divided into hereditary and acquired AEs. Hereditary AE with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

Acquired AE with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-AAE) is mostly developed due to an underlying disease (mostly lymphomas) where a consumption of the C1-INH protein and/or formation of anti-C1-INH autoantibodies cause decreased C1-INH quantity and function. Clinical manifestations of C1-INH-AE might be easily misdiagnosed, resulting in a diagnosis delay of years, or even decades.

### Chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema: clues to the mimics [^113Ym3Ep]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Urticaria and angioedema are experienced by up to 1 in 5 people, usually the result of common allergen or medication triggers and infections. Similarly, the majority of recurrent angioedema has an exogenous trigger, for example, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or is hereditary (type 1 and 2 hereditary angioedema); chronic spontaneous urticaria are most often autoimmune or autoallergic in routine clinical practice. There are, however, several skin and systemic conditions that can imitate the clinical appearance of either angioedema or urticaria, whereas there are several uncommon conditions that have chronic urticaria and/or recurrent angioedema as part of their disease manifestations. Correct diagnosis is paramount to ensuring subsequent tailored therapy for many of these conditions, and in many instances, diagnostic delay can be several years with morbid consequence. In this grand rounds article, we present 2 illustrative clinical cases as the backdrop to discussing a practical diagnostic approach for clinicians to recognize copycat phenotypes and "red flags" that should prompt further investigation of several uncommon mimics. We highlight key diagnostic features, epidemiology, and management for mimics where treatment is distinct from the common phenotypes of recurrent angioedema and chronic urticarias.

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to patients with acquired angioedema, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to diagnose acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency based on the following features:

- reduced C1 inhibitor function

- activation of complement

- reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1).

### The clinical evaluation of angioedema [^114Npm4r]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical evaluation of angioedema is reliant on obtaining a thorough patient and family history with an assessment of risk factors and presenting symptoms unique to each subtype. It is important to distinguish between angioedema with and without urticaria as a primary step in the evaluation; thereafter, laboratory parameters and investigations allow for subsequent stratification. There is a significant disease burden associated with angioedema and thus it is essential for health care practitioners to establish a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and a comprehensive care plan that addresses the patient's physical and mental well-being alike.

### An unusual presentation of ACE inhibitor-induced visceral angioedema [^114xwRjZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

ACE inhibitors (ACEi) are common anti-hypertensive drugs that can cause angioedema. Though classic, or facial angioedema is rare, visceral angioedema is even less common. When angioedema occurs, it typically presents early, within 30 days of initiating therapy. Visceral angioedema most commonly presents with nausea, emesis, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, and thus is often mistaken for an episode of gastroenteritis. When a CT scan is obtained, it typically shows characteristic findings, including ascetic fluid, mild mesenteric oedema and thickening of the small bowel. In this case report, we present a patient who did not experience her first episode of visceral angioedema until after she had been on ACEi therapy for 5–7years. In addition, she experienced recurrent episodes of visceral angioedema that were separated by approximately 4years at a time. Both of these features make for a particularly unique presentation.

### Angioedema as a systemic disease [^113mR272]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is a clinical entity defined as self-limiting edema localized in the deeper layers of the skin and mucosa and lasting for several days. Angioedema can be provoked by bradykinin and/or mast cell mediators, including histamine. Four types of acquired and three types of hereditary angioedema have been identified. The most obvious form of angioedema associated with other systemic disease is acquired angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency. It is characterized by acquired consumption of C1 inhibitor and various underlying disorders, such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rectal carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Suspected cases need an accurate differential diagnosis to exclude all other types of acquired and hereditary angioedema.

### Hereditary angioedema… [^11147Rxy]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Angioedema is an intense, usually disfiguring, temporary swelling of a localized body area. It most commonly occurs as part of an allergic response to exogenous substances and conditions. Such substances may be dietary in origin, eg, shellfish and other seafood, or may be environmental, as is the case with temperature-related angioedema. All types of HAE have identical symptoms characterized by edema of 1 or several organ systems. The skin, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract are most commonly involved. Cutaneous angioedema involves deeper layers such as the inner dermis and subcutaneous tissue, unlike urticaria, which is common in angioedema from other causes and involves the epidermis and upper dermis. The absence of pruritus, and the often-present associated visceral symptoms, makes angioedema distinguishable from urticaria. Typically, acute HAE manifests as marked diffuse edema involving all skin layers and layers of the walls of hollow visceral organs and solid organs.

Most visceral organs are susceptible and can be affected singly or in any combination. Typical attacks of angioedema last approximately 2 to 5 days before resolving spontaneously. Skin edema is nonpitting, with ill-defined margins, and most commonly affects areas of the face, extremities, and genitals. This binding activates C1s, which acquires esterase activity and cleaves C4, thereby initiating a cascade of events that generates a complex of complement fragments termed the membrane attack complex. This complex is responsible for the cell membrane damage that results in lysis of cells targeted by the specific immunoglobulins. During this cascade, C3a, C4a, and C5a are generated, cause increased capillary permeability, and contribute to edema and swelling of skin and organs that may be seen with massive complement activation, as occurs during an attack of HAE.

The large quantity of bradykinin released during acute attacks of HAE or AAE is thought to be responsible for most symptoms by directly causing increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, and contraction of nonvascular smooth muscle. By increasing capillary permeability, C3a, C4a, and C5a may also contribute to local edema of skin and visceral organs, ascites, and intravascular volume depletion.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1171hJDv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria — diagnosis and management algorithm begins when a "Patient presents with possible acute urticaria and/or angioedema", prompting "DETAILED HISTORY INCLUDING REVIEW OF SYSTEMS" (including "Drug or biologic agent exposure(s)?" and "Physical triggers – evaluate with visual analog scale and itch severity scale") and "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION" (e.g., "Extent and characteristics of the urticaria/angioedema lesions" and "Presence of dermatographism"). When "Is the general evaluation listed in Box 2 suggestive of an underlying cause?" the next step is "SPECIFIC EVALUATION focused on the evaluation results of Box 2", followed by "Is specific evaluation suggestive of an underlying etiology?" and, if "Management of specific condition improves urticaria?", then "Follow up in 2–6 weeks, as symptoms and treatment response dictate: Modify (step down or discontinue) based on clinical response". If the general evaluation is not suggestive, the pathway states "MAY CONSIDER LIMITED NON-SPECIFIC EVALUATION" with labs that "May include CBC with diff, ESR, TSH, renal and liver profiles" and notes "Additional testing may be necessary depending on physician evaluation and patient circumstances", then proceed to "Initial Treatment" to "Remove/Avoid factors that may induce urticaria/angioedema", give "Antihistamines", consider "For moderate to severe cases oral glucocorticosteroids", and use "Epinephrine if potential for anaphylaxis".

### Hereditary angioedema: imaging manifestations and clinical management [^116JYSTx]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a genetic disorder typically related to insufficient or dysfunctional C1-esterase inhibitor. Patients present with episodic swelling of various body parts, such as the face, neck, bowel, genitals, and extremities. Acute or severe symptoms can lead to patients presenting to the emergency room, particularly when the neck and abdominopelvic regions are affected, which is often accompanied by radiologic imaging evaluation. Patients with hereditary angioedema can pose a diagnostic challenge for emergency department physicians and radiologists at initial presentation, and the correct diagnosis may be missed or delayed, due to lack of clinical awareness of the disease or lack of its consideration in the radiologic differential diagnosis. Timely diagnosis of hereditary angioedema and rapid initiation of appropriate therapy can avoid potentially life-threatening complications. This article focuses on the spectrum of common and characteristic acute imaging manifestations of hereditary angioedema and provides an update on important recent developments in its clinical management and treatment.

### Angioedema. pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^117WxrqK]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a constellation of syndromes that present a great challenge to the clinician. The term "angioedema" describes the localized, transient, episodic edema of the deeper layers of the skin or of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. Although angioedema may affect any part of the body, the skin and gastrointestinal tract are involved most commonly by far. Episodic abdominal pain arising from angioedema affecting any intra-abdominal organ may occur without skin angioedema; therefore, angioedema must be included in the differential diagnosis of intermittent, unexplained abdominal pain. Angioedema is caused by extravasation of plasma in the affected areas, which at times is accompanied by nonspecific, minimal cellular infiltrate. The most commonly identified causes of angioedema are medications, allergens, and physical agents, but most angioedema is idiopathic. Rare forms of angioedema associated with either hereditary or acquired faulty activation of the complement and kallikrein-kinin systems have been extensively described. Taking a comprehensive personal and family history, performing a physical examination, and compulsively monitoring the response to therapy are the most rewarding and cost-effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Diligent and knowledgeable follow-up by the attending physician spares patients costly and unnecessary tests as well as harmful treatment. The most effective treatment depends on the identification of the causative mechanism and — especially when the mechanism is not identified — on the clinician's knowledge and experience with innovative therapeutic regimens.

### How we manage persons with hereditary angioedema [^114DtjHT]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous and mucosal swelling that can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Several novel therapies introduced since 2008 have dramatically transformed the approach to management. In this review we will discuss the current understanding of the pathophysiology of HAE, diagnostic evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria, and the therapeutic approach to HAE. We advocate taking an integrative approach to care in order to normalize the lives of affected patients.

### Diagnosing angioedema [^112rwqW1]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Angioedema usually occurs within the setting of allergic diseases or urticaria, but situations occur in which angioedema itself represents a disease, such as in hereditary angioedema. Evaluation of patients for recurrent angioedema without wheals must take into account both specific clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory testing.

### A consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema in the emergency department [^111yKS4p]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite its relatively common occurrence and life-threatening potential, the management of angioedema in the emergency department (ED) is lacking in terms of a structured approach. It is paramount to distinguish the different etiologies of angioedema from one another and more specifically differentiate histaminergic-mediated angioedema from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, especially in lieu of the more novel treatments that have recently become available for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. With this background in mind, this consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema attempts to provide a working framework for emergency physicians (EPs) in approaching the patient with angioedema in terms of diagnosis and management in the ED. This consensus parameter was developed from a collaborative effort among a group of EPs and leading allergists with expertise in angioedema. After rigorous debate, review of the literature, and expert opinion, the following consensus guideline document was created. The document has been endorsed by the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM).

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to patients with ACEi-associated angioedema, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that ACEis are associated with angioedema in approximately 0.1–0.7% of patients and ARBs have been associated with angioedema less commonly.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^112vpt7T]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) inheritance and onset — HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, and most patients with HAE have a positive family history of angioedema (A). Each child of an affected patient has a 50% chance of having HAE, and although approximately 75% report an affected parent, the remaining 25% presumably have a de novo mutation. Onset of swelling most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty (C); Fifty percent of patients with HAE begin swelling at less than 10 years of age, although some do not show evidence until their late teens or early adulthood, rare patients never experience angioedema, and some continue to experience HAE attacks throughout their lives.

Diagnostic Algorithm for Diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH

The diagnosis of HAE should be considered in all patients with recurrent angioedema without hives. Proper diagnosis utilizes four modes of investigation: (1) clinical presentation (phenotype), (2) pathomechanism, (3) biomarkers, and (4) genetics. The diagnostic process is complicated by the reality that in clinical practice, many angioedema patients will have an unknown pathomechanism while validated biomarkers and genetic studies are either unavailable or uninformative. Thus, a combination of all the above parameters is highly desired but often not attainable. In the absence of helpful laboratory data, clinicians must assess the patients' responses over time to empiric treatment with medications targeting potential pathogenic pathways. This strategy can also be challenging as it requires prolonged patient engagement in a systematic stepwise treatment approach and may lack robust objective methods to assess efficacy. The algorithm below and Fig. 1 summarize the recommended approach for evaluating these patients. This approach may need to be further adapted according to the available expertise, testing facilities and resources. Patients presenting to an emergency department with an angioedema attack of unknown cause should be referred to a physician familiar with angioedema who can undertake this evaluation.

Step 1. Is the Diagnosis Tenable?

Confirm a clinical history of documented recurrent angioedema without hives. Photos and laryngoscopic and imaging evidence of angioedema are essential to differentiate true angioedema from factitious angioedema or patients who mistakenly believe they have angioedema based on non-angioedematous symptoms, both of which are common in patients (mis)diagnosed with HAE-nC1INH (Table 4). In the case of predominant gastrointestinal attacks, obtaining abdominal imaging during an attack can be useful to evaluate for bowel wall edema and intraperitoneal fluid. A detailed family history and medication history should be obtained in all patients with recurrent angioedema.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of angioedema and angioedema mimics

Step 2. Exclude C1INH Deficiency

Measure C4, C1INH antigen, and C1INH function (if available), even if the patient is taking a medication that may cause angioedema. If acquired C1INH deficiency is suspected based on age of symptom onset, C1q level and anti-C1INH antibodies should be measured. Sequencing of SERPING1 is not routinely required, but can be helpful to distinguish acquired C1INH deficiency from HAE-C1INH, especially in patients aged > 40 years.

Chronic urticaria — evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria should prioritize excluding complement-mediated and drug-associated causes before labeling idiopathic; specifically, patients "should be evaluated for hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, or ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema before a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema is made", and when C1-inhibitor deficiency is suspected, "measurement of the C4 level is recommended as the best initial screening test", with "A normal C4 level during an episode of angioedema" strongly suggesting C1-inhibitor deficiency is unlikely; in contrast, for typical CU, "obtaining routine testing for C4 levels, C1-inhibitor levels, or functional assays is not appropriate".

### Hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency: clinical presentation and quality of life of 193 French patients [^114GdTMM]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease. New specific treatments are available.

Objective

To identify patients' features and patients' best therapeutic option.

Methods

A 1-year, multicenter, retrospective study was performed. The primary objective was to examine the clinical presentation of HAE. Secondary objectives included patient characteristics, management of HAE over 12 months, and health-related quality of life using the SF-36v2 questionnaire.

Results

One hundred ninety-three patients were included, and 69.4% were women. In the 12-month period, the mean number of HAE attacks was 7.6. Among the 568 reported attacks, localizations were the abdomen (57.1%), peripheral limbs (42.5%), upper airway (7.9%), and face (6.9%); 31.6% of attacks were severe and occurred statistically more often in women (P < .02). Compared with a population of allergic patients, all age- and sex-adjusted scores were significantly lower in patients with HAE (P < .05) except for the physical component summary. Health-related quality of life negatively correlated with the annual number of attacks and was markedly altered for patients having more than 5 attacks per year (P < .05 for all dimensions).

Conclusion

HAE is a severe disease that places a heavy burden on quality of life.

Current Controversies in BK-Mediated Angioedema

During the more than 130-year-long period that has elapsed since hereditary angioedema was first described, many details of its pathomechanism have been elucidated. However, the "pieces of the puzzle" have not yet come together. Many questions and contradictions remain unanswered, and there are phenomena that appear controversial due to the lack of sufficient information.

### Diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema: an emergency medicine perspective [^11685w3u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and often debilitating condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the absence of appropriate intervention. An underlying deficiency in functional C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) protein induces a vulnerability to unchecked activation of the complement, contact, and coagulation/fibrinolytic systems. The clinical consequence is a pattern of recurring attacks of non-pitting, non-pruritic edema, the urgency of which varies by the affected site. Laryngeal edema can escalate rapidly to asphyxiation, and severe cases of abdominal swelling can lead to hypovolemic shock.

Objectives

This report reviews the emergency diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema and the impact of recently introduced treatments on treatment in the United States.

Discussion

Until recently, emergency physicians in the United States were hindered by the lack of rapidly effective treatment options for HAE attacks. In this article, general clinical and laboratory diagnostic procedures are reviewed against the backdrop of two case studies: one patient presenting with a known history of HAE and one with previously undiagnosed HAE. In many countries outside the United States, plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate has for decades been the first-line treatment for acute attacks. The end of 2009 ushered in a new era in the pharmacologic management of HAE attacks in the United States with the approval of two new treatment options for acute treatment: a plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate and a kallikrein inhibitor.

Conclusion

With access to targeted and effective treatments, emergency physicians are now better equipped for successful and rapid intervention in urgent HAE cases.

### Angioedema [^114cEXHw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Although first described more than 130 years ago, the pathophysiology, origin, and management of the several types of angioedema are poorly understood by most dermatologists. Although clinically similar, angioedema can be caused by either mast cell degranulation or activation of kinin formation. In the former category, allergic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced angioedema are frequently accompanied by urticaria. Idiopathic chronic angioedema is also usually accompanied by urticaria, but can occur without hives. In either case, an autoimmune process leading to dermal mast cell degranulation occurs in some patients. In these patients, histamine-releasing IgG anti-FcepsilonR1 autoantibodies are believed to be the cause of the disease, removal or suppression by immunomodulation being followed by remission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema is unaccompanied by hives, and is caused by the inhibition of enzymatic degradation of tissue bradykinin. Hereditary angioedema, caused by unchecked tissue bradykinin formation, is recognized biochemically by a low plasma C'4 and low quantitative or functional C'1 inhibitor. Progress has now been made in understanding the molecular genetic basis of the two isoforms of this dominantly inherited disease. Recently, a third type of hereditary angioedema has been defined by several groups. Occurring exclusively in women, it is not associated with detectable abnormalities of the complement system. Angioedema caused by a C'1 esterase inhibitor deficiency can also be acquired in several clinical settings, including lymphoma and autoimmune connective tissue disease. It can also occur as a consequence of specific anti-C'1 esterase autoantibodies in some patients. We have reviewed the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of these different subtypes of angioedema.

Learning Objective

After completing this learning activity, participants should be aware of the classification, causes, and differential diagnosis of angioedema, the molecular basis of hereditary and non-hereditary forms of angioedema, and be able to formulate a pathophysiology-based treatment strategy for each of the subtypes of angioedema.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112fTbZk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Patients with undiagnosed HAE with GI symptoms are likely to present across many care settings, including both primary care and specialist clinics. Inclusion of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained severe and often recurrent abdominal pain, with or without skin manifestations, may improve the diagnosis rate of HAE. Careful history-taking and a physical examination along with selected imaging studies and laboratory testing are vital to making the diagnosis. By including HAE in the differential diagnosis, providers can make the appropriate referral to a physician experienced in managing HAE, thus shortening the time to diagnosis and effective treatment and reducing the burden of disease.

### An update on the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema with abnormal C1 inhibitor [^111Ee6uP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease caused by a deficiency in functional C1-esterase inhibitor characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema in the absence of associated urticaria. Subcutaneous swellings are experienced by virtually all patients with HAE, and dermatologists are likely to encounter this manifestation, requiring that they be knowledgeable about diagnosis and treatment options. Diagnosis of HAE is often delayed because several of the symptoms can mimic other disease states. Delays in diagnosis can lead to increased inappropriate treatment and decreased patient quality of life. Once a proper diagnosis is made, treatment needs to be targeted to the individual patient and includes on-demand therapy and an option for short- and long-term prophylaxis. On-demand therapy is required for all patients who are diagnosed with HAE and effective options include plasma-derived and recombinant C1 inhibitors, kallikrein inhibitors, and bradykinin B2-receptor antagonists. Options available for prophylaxis include plasma-derived C1 inhibitors, attenuated androgens, and antifibrinolytic agents, although the latter 2 options are associated with significant adverse events. This article reviews the diagnosis and options for effective management of patients with HAE.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute attack characteristics — The typical HAE attack tends to progressively worsen for 24 hours and then slowly remit over the following 48 to 72 hours; attacks can occasionally last longer if the swelling moves from site to site. Attacks involving the extremities and abdomen are the most common, each representing almost 50% of all attacks, and over a lifetime almost 100% of patients with HAE experience both extremity and abdominal attacks. The most dangerous attacks occur in the oropharynx and threaten laryngeal patency, and more than 50% of patients with HAE experience at least 1 laryngeal attack during their lifetimes.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced bowel angioedema: clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and recovery predictors from survival analysis: a systematic review of current reported cases [^114oYE1a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are commonly prescribed medications for cardiovascular diseases, used by at least 40 million people globally, and comprise at least one third of the anti-hypertensive drugs in the USA. While generally well-tolerated, ACEi can cause angioedema, a serious side effect characterized by swelling of the deep layers of skin and mucosal tissue due to increased vascular permeability. The incidence of ACEi-induced angioedema is estimated to be between 0.1% and 0.7%, although the true incidence may be higher as a result of underdiagnosis. The most well-known presentation is angioedema of the face and oropharynx, contributing to 20–40% of angioedema presentations in the emergency room.

However, ACEi can also induce angioedema of the intestines, a less common and often overlooked complication. ACEi-induced intestinal angioedema poses a diagnostic challenge, as it presents with non-specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, often mimicking other gastrointestinal conditions. This often results in delayed diagnosis, misdiagnosis, unnecessary invasive procedures and inappropriate treatments.

The scarcity of information regarding the factors associated with ACEi bowel-induced angioedema (ACEi-IAE) and the duration of recovery creates a complication for the diagnosis and treatment of this patient group. Therefore, we conducted a systematic case review to investigate all reported cases of ACEi-IAE and factors that may impact the duration of recovery, in order to better understand the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges and management of the condition.

### Classification, diagnosis, and pathology of angioedema without hives [^116iW7Tq]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

A clear disease classification schema coupled with an understanding of the specific mechanisms involved in the different types of angioedema without hives informs the diagnostic assessment. The recommended approach involves several key steps. Foremost is the recognizing of the clinical clues which allow for the differentiation of mast cell-mediated disorders from bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Enhanced vascular permeability related to bradykinin is of critical importance to identify given the implications for disease morbidity and risk of mortality. The ability to efficiently categorize and diagnose all forms of angioedema results in improved patient outcomes.

### Radiologic manifestations of angioedema [^1115urAz]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The major role of imaging of angioedema in the head and neck is to evaluate for the presence of upper airway obstruction and exclusion of other causes. Glossomegaly with low attenuation is commonly present in head and neck angioedema. Angioedema may involve the gastrointestinal tracts and more rarely the genitourinary system. Angioedema of the visceral organs is often accompanied by adjacent fluid, and the involvement may be multifocal or asymmetric (may not always be diffuse or concentric). As the clinical presentation can mimic surgical and inflammatory causes of abdominal pain, the exclusion of these aetiologies is an important role in the imaging evaluation for visceral organ involvements in patients who present with angioedema in any organ system.

### Angioedema with normal complement studies: what Do we know? [^111pLSh7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is generally readily recognizable clinically and is characterized by localized nonpitting edema involving subcutaneous, submucosal, or deep dermal tissue caused by increased vascular permeability and extravasation of intravascular fluid. It can occur via a variety of mechanisms. A number of clinical conditions (masqueraders) are occasionally mistaken for angioedema. Clinical classification of the various angioedema forms begins with noting the presence or absence of concurrent urticaria or wheals. Pathogenesis can be considered through two broad categories: mast cell-mediated with release of vasoactive mediators causing angioedema usually associated with urticaria or in the context of an anaphylactic reaction; and bradykinin (BK)-driven, in which increased vascular permeability is mediated by BK. BK-mediated angioedema does not occur with urticaria, nor does it respond to antiallergic medications. The various forms of hereditary angioedema are included in this category, requiring specific tests of C4 and C1 inhibitor level and function to confirm the diagnosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which impair the degradation of BK, account for up to a third of all patients with angioedema presenting to the emergency department. Finally, angioedema may occur by yet unknown mechanisms; under this circumstance, it is difficult to manage.

### Recognition and differential diagnosis of hereditary angioedema in the emergency department [^114kaCZH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Angioedema (AE) is a clinical syndrome marked by localized swelling of the subcutaneous layer of the skin or the submucosal layer of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. While AE is commonly mediated by histamine (allergic AE), some types result from excessive bradykinin activity, including hereditary AE (HAE), acquired AE, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced AE. These are less common but important to consider given different treatment requirements and potentially serious outcomes, including death from laryngeal swelling.

Objective

This review describes the pathophysiology and clinical features of AE as well as the diagnosis and treatment of AE in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

Bradykinin-mediated AE does not respond to antihistamines and corticosteroids. By contrast, several targeted, effective therapies are available, including C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrates, which replace the missing protein activity underlying some bradykinin-mediated AE, and medications that directly lessen bradykinin activity (eg, ecallantide and icatibant). Urticaria is generally absent in bradykinin-mediated AE and serves as a primary differentiating factor in the clinical diagnosis. Relevant laboratory assessments may include C1-INH levels, C1-INH function, and C4 complement. Patients with HAE or a family member can communicate their known diagnosis when presenting to the ED, and some may even bring their own medication(s) with them. Patients newly diagnosed with HAE in the ED should be referred for specialized outpatient care upon ED discharge.

Conclusions

There is a great need for ED clinicians to be aware of HAE, its differential diagnosis, and appropriate treatment to ensure that patients receive optimal and timely treatment.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^113mobCS]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder; most cases are characterized by low plasma levels of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). Clinical manifestations of HAE due to C1-INH deficiency include unpredictable, acute, recurrent episodes of nonpruritic swelling that can affect the face, trunk, limbs, and the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Attacks can be disfiguring, disabling, painful, and even life-threatening if laryngeal swelling occurs. Symptoms of HAE generally manifest in childhood. Effective medications are available and approved to treat HAE in children. However, evidence informing use of these medications in pediatric clinical practice is limited. Hereditary angioedema management plans are critical to optimize outcomes and should address on-demand treatment for acute attacks and plans to prevent potentially fatal laryngeal attacks. The plan should also comprise a holistic approach to address nonclinical aspects of HAE, including quality of life (QoL) and psychological issues. This article provides an overview of HAE management principles that health care providers can apply to treat pediatric patients to improve their QoL.

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: an updated international consensus paper on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^114jVHuG]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) has been recognized for almost 150 years. The newest form of HAE, where C1 inhibitor levels are normal (HAE-nC1INH), was first described in 2000. Over the last two decades, new types of apparent non-mast cell-mediated angioedema with normal quantity and activity of C1INH have been described, in some cases with proven genetic pathogenic variants that co-segregate with angioedema expression within families. Like HAE due to C1INH deficiency, HAE-nC1INH patients are at risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Therefore, proactive management and treatment of HAE-nC1INH patients after an expert physician diagnosis is critically important. The underlying pathophysiology responsible for the angioedema has also been clarified in some of the HAE-nC1INH types. While several clinical guidelines and practice parameters including HAE-nC1INH have been published, we have made substantial progress in our understanding encompassing diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes. HAE International (HAEi) and the US HAE Association (HAEA) convened a symposium of global HAE-nC1INH experts to synthesize our current knowledge in the area. Given the paucity of high-level evidence in HAE-nC1INH, all recommendations are based on expert opinion. This review and expert opinion on the best practice approach to diagnosing and treating HAE-nC1INH will support physicians to better manage patients with HAE-nC1INH.

### Clinical practice statement: what is the emergency department management of patients with angioedema secondary to an ACE-inhibitor? [^116qLh9s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Angioedema is a complication that has been reported in up to 1.0% of individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). Importantly, the onset of angioedema can occur anywhere from hours to several years after initiation of therapy with ACE-Is. Although most cases of ACE-I-induced angioedema (ACE-I-AE) are self-limiting, a major clinical concern is development of airway compromise, which can potentially require emergent airway management. The underlying pathophysiology of ACE-I-AE is incompletely understood, but is considered to be due in large part to excess bradykinin. Numerous medications have been proposed for the treatment of ACE-I-AE. This article is an update to the 2011 Clinical Practice Committee (CPC) statement from the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.

Methods

A literature search in PubMed was performed with search terms angioedema and ACE inhibitors from August 1, 2012 to May 13, 2019. Following CPC guidelines, articles written in English were identified and then underwent a structured review for evaluation.

Results

The search parameters resulted in 323 articles. The abstracts of these articles were assessed independently by the reviewers, who determined there were 63 articles that were specific to ACE-I-AE, of which 46 were deemed appropriate for grading in the final focused review.

Conclusions

The primary focus for the treatment of ACE-I-AE is airway management. In the absence of high-quality evidence, no specific medication therapy is recommended for its treatment. If, however, the treating physician feels the patient's presentation is more typical of an acute allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, it may be appropriate to treat for those conditions. Any patient with suspected ACE-I-AE should immediately discontinue that medication.

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^1173m7ES]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only 1 medication is approved for treatment of children < 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for treatment of young children in the United States. The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attack characteristics — HAE is characterized by relatively prolonged attacks of angioedema involving the extremities, genitourinary tract, abdomen, face, oropharynx, or larynx (C). Patients typically present with discrete episodes of nonpruritic, nonpitting angioedema at these sites; HAE attacks are usually distinguished from allergic or idiopathic angioedema by their longer duration and lack of response to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. The typical HAE attack tends to progressively worsen for 24 hours and then slowly remit over the following 48 to 72 hours, although attacks can occasionally last longer, particularly if the swelling moves from site to site.

### Urticaria and angioedema across the ages [^113U2be5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) and angioedema can occur at any age. Although most CU with or without angioedema occurs in adults, it can also present in children or the elderly and can complicate pregnancy and breast-feeding. The presentations of CU and angioedema are different in children, middle-aged adults, and older patients as are the differential diagnoses. Therefore, the management of CU and angioedema in these different age groups and special populations needs to take into account the age-specific features of urticaria and angioedema. Here, we describe the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of CU and angioedema in children, middle-aged adults, and older patients. This review focuses on CU with or without angioedema and does not discuss acute urticaria or bradykinin-mediated angioedema.

### Acute urticaria and angioedema: diagnostic and treatment considerations [^111gQ16F]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Urticaria is defined as wheals consisting of three features: (i) central swelling of various sizes, with or without surrounding erythema; (ii) pruritus or occasional burning sensations; and (iii) the skin returning to normal appearance, usually within 1–24 hours. Angioedema is defined as: (i) abrupt swelling of the lower dermis and subcutis; (ii) occasional pain instead of pruritus; (iii) commonly involving the mucous membranes; and (iv) skin returning to normal appearance, usually within 72 hours. Acute urticaria and angioedema is defined by its duration (< 6 weeks) compared with chronic urticaria and angioedema. The most common causes are infections, medications, and foods. The best tools in the evaluation of these patients are a comprehensive history and physical examination. There are a variety of skin conditions that may mimic acute urticaria and angioedema and the various reaction patterns associated with different drugs. Oral antihistamines are first-line treatment. In the event of a life-threatening reaction involving urticaria with angioedema, epinephrine may be needed to stabilize the patient. This review focuses on the value of a comprehensive clinical evaluation at the onset of symptoms. It underscores the importance of coordination of care among physicians, and the development of an action plan for evidence-based investigations, diagnosis, and therapy.

### Hereditary angioedema: a clinical review for the otolaryngologist [^113EQFtx]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare genetic disorder that is usually characterized by either low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) or the presence of dysfunctional C1-INH. It can present with relatively mild and self-limiting symptoms, but it is also potentially fatal; the most common cause of death is asphyxiation secondary to edema of the upper airway. The diagnosis of HAE, especially in the emergency situation, is not straightforward. HAE must be distinguished from several other types of angioedema that require different management approaches. Management approaches include trigger avoidance and pharmacologic therapy; the latter has traditionally involved the administration of attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytics. Recently, a new class of agent-C1-INH-has been introduced in the United States. This article provides an update on the pathophysiology, clinical picture, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and acute treatment of HAE. We must keep HAE in mind as a possible diagnosis whenever we are faced with a case of unexplained angioedema if we are to take advantage of the effective and more specific therapies that are becoming available.

### Recognition, evaluation, and management of pediatric hereditary angioedema [^112nT3db]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, often underrecognized genetic disorder caused by either a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (type 1) or mutation (type 2). This leads to overproduction of bradykinin resulting in vasodilation, vascular leakage, and transient nonpitting angioedema occurring most frequently in the face, neck, upper airway, abdomen, and/or extremities. Involvement of the tongue and laryngopharynx has been associated with asphyxiation and death. Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal-dominant condition; therefore, there is a 50% chance an offspring will inherit this disorder. Any patient presenting with isolated angioedema should be screened with a C4 measurement, as 25% of cases have no family history of HAE. All patients with HAE will have a functional deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor. Contributors that delay the diagnosis of HAE include recognition delay by clinicians who confuse this condition with histaminergic angioedema, the disease's varied presentations, and limitations to timely testing. Pediatric emergency clinicians should be knowledgeable about how to distinguish between bradykinin- and histamine-mediated angioedema, as there are significant differences in the diagnostic testing, treatment, and clinical response between these 2 different conditions. Evidence indicates that early diagnosis and treatment of HAE reduces morbidity and mortality. Clinician recognition of the mechanistically different problems will ensure patients are appropriately referred to an expert for outpatient management.

### Angioedema [^114inCd4]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Urticarial wheals and angioedema are 2 different clinical symptoms. Both belong to various disease entities, and may occur in combination or be isolated. Increased vasodilation and vasopermeability is a common feature. Histamine and bradykinin are well-known mediators. For clinical purposes, 3 groups of diseases can be differentiated: diseases with urticaria and angioedema, diseases with angioedema alone, and diseases with urticarial lesions without angioedema. The article presents an overview of these groups and the role of the main mediators, and the clinical features of urticaria and angioedema.

Objectives

Reading this article will remind the reader that some patients presenting with complaints of urticaria and angioedema may not have urticaria or angioedema at all, but may have other causes, often unusual, sometimes treatable. It will also increase the reader's ability to recognize masqueraders of angioedema, urticaria, and facial swelling thought to be angioedema.

Data Sources

Data for this article come mainly from the authors' personal experiences and selected references to illustrate points made in the article.

Study Selection

The criteria used are patients and articles from the authors' experiences that illustrate the point of this article that patients presenting with urticaria and angioedema may have other diseases and some of these are treatable.

Results

The objectives will be met by patient presentations plus pertinent literature review.

Conclusions

Some patients presenting as angioedema and urticaria have swelling and skin lesions attributable to other causes. Although they are uncommon, they are sometimes treatable. Not all patients referred to an allergist for angioedema have angioedema.

### Hereditary angioedema: diagnosis and management-a perspective for the dermatologist [^1149KeUP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare, but potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by marked, diffuse mucosal edema that, in extreme cases, can affect the airway leading to asphyxiation. The clinical picture is similar to that of other forms of angioedema; therefore, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. HAE is caused by a deficiency in, or a dysfunction of, C1 esterase inhibitor, which has a wide variety of physiologic functions, of which regulation of the contact (kallikrein-kinin) system is most relevant to this condition. Effective management of HAE must consider routine/long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis (in advance of predicted trauma, eg, surgical or dental procedures), and treatment of acute attacks. Historically, treatment options have been limited to controlling symptoms, but progress in understanding the pathophysiology of HAE has facilitated development of treatments, such as C1 inhibitor therapy, or drugs targeted at the bradykinin pathway, which address the underlying pathologic process.

Differences and Similarities In Clinical Features of Diseases That Manifest with MCM-AE and BK-AE

Prodromal Signs and Symptoms

AE prodromes are unique to BK-AE, specifically C1-INH-HAE. In up to 80% of patients with C1-INH-HAE, angioedema attacks are often, but not always, heralded by prodromal signs or symptoms. Common prodromal signs and symptoms include typical erythema marginatum pain, fatigue, or nausea. Prodromes occur mostly within 6 h before an attack and must be strictly differentiated from the symptoms of the emerging actual attack. Prodromes have not been commonly described in other forms of AE, with the exception of unspecific prodromes in a small number of patients with FXII-HAE.

Introduction

Angioedema was first described by J.L. Milton in 1876. First named angioneurotic oedema by Quinckein 1882, it is sometimes referred to as Quincke's oedema. There are various causes of angioedema. The incidence of angioedema varies with its causes. For example, the estimated incidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is 0.1 to 1.0% and that of hereditary angioedema (HAE) ranges from 0.002 to 0.01%. It is clinically characterised as episodic localised and transient oedematous swelling, most commonly affecting superficial regions such as the face, genitals, and extremities. If angioedema only affected the superficial regions, imaging evaluation would not be necessary. Angioedema, however, may affect any part of the body, and intra-abdominal involvement can even occur without cutaneous involvement. Angioedema can also present with life-threatening respiratory distress when the upper airway is involved. Angioedema involving the gastrointestinal tract may present as an acute abdominal pain resulting in unnecessary laparotomy. Although the diagnosis of angioedema is clinical, awareness of this entity and its characteristic imaging findings by radiologists will aid in raising the suspicion for angioedema, which may warrant further clinical workup and prevent unnecessary surgery. Additionally, for patients with known previous history of angioedema who have abdominal pain, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the study of choice to evaluate for possible visceral involvement as well as to rule out other pathology.

The purpose of this pictorial review is to present imaging findings of angioedema involving the various organs. Differential diagnoses and complications of angioedema are discussed.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117Btbxz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### Angioedema [^116AGAwm]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening occurrence that is encountered by critical care providers. The mechanistic understanding of angioedema syndromes has improved in recent years, and novel medications are available that improve outcomes from these syndromes. This clinically focused review will describe the underlying genetics, pathophysiology, classification and treatment of angioedema syndromes, with an emphasis on the novel pharmacologic agents that have recently become available for acute treatment.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted with the MeSH terms angioedema, acquired angioedema, hereditary angioedema type III, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema.

Study Selection

Selected publications describing angioedema, clinical trials, diagnosis, management, and genetics were retrieved (reviews, guidelines, clinical trials, case series), and their bibliographies were also reviewed to identify relevant publications.

Data Extraction

Data from the relevant publications were reviewed, summarized and the information synthesized.

Data Synthesis

The data obtained were used to describe the current state of diagnosis and management of various angioedema syndromes.

Conclusions

Angioedema is a life-threatening syndrome with multiple subtypes, each with a distinct pathophysiology. We present an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and suggested management of various subtypes of angioedema. Securing the airway remains the most important intervention, followed by administration of both established and more novel pharmacologic interventions based on disease pathology.

### Chronic urticaria and angioedema: masqueraders and misdiagnoses [^114dcFNb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a common condition presenting with intensely pruritic wheals. Although individual lesions resolve within 24 hours, by definition, chronic urticaria lasts for a duration of at least 6 weeks. Both spontaneous and inducible forms exist. In the spontaneous variant, chronic urticaria occurs in the absence of clearly identifiable triggers. In chronic inducible urticaria, specific triggers may include dermatographism, cholinergic (heat), cold, exercise, delayed pressure, and solar. Extensive laboratory evaluation for chronic spontaneous urticaria is not required unless indicated by clinical history or physical examination. Angioedema describes sudden onset of localized edema involving the deep layers of the skin and submucosal tissues. It can be seen in isolation or in conjunction with chronic urticaria. Angioedema typically resolves slower than wheals, taking up to 72 hours or longer. Histamine- and bradykinin-mediated forms exist. Both chronic urticaria and angioedema have many mimics, and a broad range of differential diagnoses should be considered. Importantly, an incorrect diagnosis may have significant implications for the additional investigation, treatment, and prognosis of the affected patient. The aim of this article is to discuss the characteristics of chronic urticaria and angioedema, and an approach to the investigation and diagnosis of their mimics.

### Non-histaminergic angioedema: focus on bradykinin-mediated angioedema [^117SH7Yk]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a result of increased vascular permeability, with subsequent extravasation of intravascular fluid into the surrounding tissues. Angioedema may be mediated by histamine, bradykinin or other mediators. Histaminergic angioedema generally presents with urticaria and/or pruritus and will respond to conventional treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids or epinephrine. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which includes hereditary angioedema (HAE types I, II and III), acquired C1-INH deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema does not typically present with urticaria/weals and does not respond to conventional agents such as antihistamines or corticosteroids. In recent years, several agents that prevent the generation or activity of bradykinin have been developed for the treatment of HAE types I and II and are also being evaluated in other types of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. These agents have the potential to improve outcomes for patients with different forms of bradykinin-mediated angioedema.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^114BMBpo]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria/angioedema is "acute" if it spans less than 6 weeks in duration, and in generalized cases a patient might merit administration of immediate emergency treatment (eg, epinephrine) to manage laryngeal obstruction. A comprehensive history and physical examination should be performed to identify a cause, documenting potential triggers and their timing, and a comprehensive review of systems should be carried out to assess for related disorders; physical examination should focus on lesion extent and dermatographia and include examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system. Findings from history and examination might serve to focus evaluation on a clear trigger for acute urticaria/angioedema, and a limited laboratory diagnostic evaluation might include CBC with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, TSH, and renal and liver profiles. Initial treatment is to remove or avoid factors that induce urticaria/angioedema, and once identifiable triggers have been eliminated, evidence supports the use of antihistamines as first-line therapy for persistent symptoms. Second-generation antihistamines are designed through chemical modifications.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) clinical phenotype and attack course are characterized by episodic swelling with variable severity and potential mortality: Disease severity in patients with HAE is highly variable and characterized by episodic rather than continuous swelling; a precipitating cause for most episodes is unknown, although stress and trauma have been recognized; attacks generally involve the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, or larynx and follow a stereotypical pattern in which swelling worsens over 24 hours, peaks, and then slowly resolves over the following 48 hours; attacks might be preceded by a prodrome; HAE attacks are associated with significant potential morbidity and potential mortality.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) treatment structure — The treatment of HAE can be classified into 2 approaches: treatment of acute attacks and prophylactic treatment (short-term and long-term). All patients with HAE, irrespective of their past history, are at risk for severe angioedema attacks, and patients with HAE should have an established plan in place regarding how to respond to a severe attack. Historical surveys suggest a mortality rate in patients with HAE caused by laryngeal angioedema of approximately 30% or higher.

### Pediatric angioedema [^117JPk1d]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a self-limited nonpitting edema generally affecting the deeper layers of the skin and mucous membranes. It is the result of increased vascular permeability causing the leakage of fluid into the skin in response to potent vasodilators released by immunologic mediators. Two main pathways are thought to be implicated in angioedema. The mast cell pathway in which preformed mediators, such as histamine, rapidly formed mediators, leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are released from mast cells through IgE or direct activation. This is the most common pathway among children, with food, medications, and infections commonly implicated. The second pathway is the kinin pathway, most notably affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and hereditary forms of angioedema, which ultimately results in the formation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Angioedema is being encountered with increasing frequency, particularly among children and is important to recognize and treat for its life-threatening associated manifestations such as anaphylaxis and airway obstruction. Although angioedema is still not fully understood, we have broadened our understanding of the possible causes and clinical course of angioedema. An understanding of these potential causes and mechanisms by which angioedema can occur may guide the clinician in determining the need for diagnostic testing and the extent of treatment.

### -associated angioedema [^114mD6nC]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema (AE) is a self-limiting and benign condition, but may present as a medical emergency due to upper airway obstruction. Different pathological processes involving proinflammatory mediators cause several distinct subtypes of AE. To our knowledge, we here report the first case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae -associated AE in a child. Recognition of this clinical entity prevents extensive diagnostic testing and avoids restriction of possibly causative drugs.

Angioedema triage by urticaria phenotype — when to evaluate for C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency: The pattern of swelling, particularly whether angioedema occurs with or without urticaria, is diagnostically important, urticaria is not a feature of HAE, patients with recurrent angioedema without coexisting urticaria merit evaluation for C1INH deficiency, and most cases of recurrent angioedema with concomitant urticaria or pruritis are responsive to antihistamines, are histamine mediated, and are best considered within the spectrum of chronic urticaria, with episodes lacking a consistent temporal association possibly considered a separate condition.

### Classification and treatment of angioedema without wheals: a Spanish Delphi consensus [^115je9FU]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema frequently occurs in the context of an urticaria, which is characterized by two symptoms: wheals (edema of the superficial layers) and/or angioedema (edema of the deep layers of the dermis with subtle erythema), which can appear isolated or in combination. Given the great diagnostic and therapeutic challenge posed by angioedema without wheals (or isolated angioedema), we focused this article on this type of angioedema. Although mast cell-mediated angioedema can be considered as a subtype of urticaria, there is a lack of evidence to support this concept. Isolated angioedema with no hives does not show some specific features commonly present in chronic urticaria, such as no female predominance, less basopenia and no role of anti-IgE receptor antibodies in the pathogenesis.

Angioedema without wheals can be difficult to precisely diagnose and manage. On the one hand, the term angioedema is used to refer to both the nosological entity and the underlying lesion. One of the proposed definitions states that angioedema is produced by a vascular reaction of the deep dermis or submucosal or subcutaneous tissues that consists of a temporary increase in the permeability of blood vessels. This increase in permeability, secondary to the release of vasoactive mediators, such as histamine or bradykinin, produces localized and self-limited edema.

On the other hand, there is no commonly agreed classification and nomenclature for angioedema without wheals, which generates confusion in the terms used in the clinical guidelines; to date, there are different classification proposals based on the pathogenic mechanism (histaminergic or bradykinergic), endotype (due to bradykinin excess, mast cell/basophil degranulation, and idiopathic), or phenotype and genotype (acquired or hereditary, with or without C1 inhibitor [C1-INH] deficiency).

### Creating a comprehensive treatment plan for hereditary angioedema [^115mHBMw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has changed dramatically in recent years because of the availability of several HAE-specific medications. This paradigm shift in therapy provides the opportunity to dramatically improve the care of HAE patients, but has increased the complexity of treatment. Patient education and communication with health care providers is crucial. Early treatment of HAE attacks has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of rapid and reliable treatment. This review summarizes the current evidence for best practices in HAE management, and suggests practical steps toward developing a comprehensive treatment plan.

### Pediatric hereditary angioedema: onset, diagnostic delay, and disease severity [^115FsHh1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) typically presents in childhood. Large gaps remain in our understanding of the natural history of HAE during childhood. We examined age of onset, delay in diagnosis, androgen exposure, and their influence on ultimate disease severity in a large cohort of patients with HAE. Median age of first swelling was 11 years with a median age at diagnosis of 19 years. Earlier onset of symptoms correlated with longer delays in diagnosis (P < .001) and predicted a more severe disease course, including increased number of attacks per year (P = 0.0009) and hospital admissions (P = 0.009). Earlier age of onset also significantly correlated with increased perceived HAE severity (P = 0.0002), negative overall life impact (P < .0001), and use of anabolic androgen. Our observations highlight the importance of early HAE diagnosis and suggest the necessity of a disease management plan once the diagnosis has been made.

### Hereditary angioedema [^112vRaBu]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usual results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH and clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

### Genetic variants leading to urticaria and angioedema and associated biomarkers [^117TYQFa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Advances in next generation sequencing technologies, as well as their expanded accessibility and clinical use over the past 2 decades, have led to an exponential increase in the number of identified single gene disorders. Among these are primary atopic disorders-inborn errors of immunity resulting in severe allergic phenotypes as a primary presenting feature. Two cardinal aspects of type I immediate hypersensitivity allergic reactions are hives and angioedema. Mast cells (MCs) are frequent primary drivers of these symptoms, but other cells have also been implicated. Even where MC degranulation is believed to be the cause, mediator-induced symptoms may greatly vary among individuals. Angioedema-particularly in the absence of hives-may also be caused by hereditary angioedema conditions resulting from aberrant regulation of contact system activation and excessive bradykinin generation or impairment of vascular integrity. In these patients, swelling can affect unpredictable locations and fail to respond to MC-directed therapies. Genetic variants have helped delineate key pathways in the etiology of urticaria and nonatopic angioedema and led to the development of targeted therapies. Herein, we describe the currently known inherited and acquired genetic causes for these conditions, highlight specific features in their clinical presentations, and discuss the benefits and limitations of biomarkers that can help distinguish them.

### Radiologic manifestations of angioedema [^117U61UN]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this pictorial review is to present imaging findings of angioedema involving the various organs.

Conclusion

The role of imaging for patients with angioedema includes the evaluation of the upper airway for obstruction and the exclusion of other possible aetiologies, such as neoplastic or infectious processes. Glossomegaly is a common finding of head and neck angioedema. Angioedema may involve organ systems beyond the superficial regions and the head and neck including the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Angioedema of the visceral organs is often accompanied by adjacent fluid, and it is commonly diffuse or concentric but can also be multifocal and asymmetric.

Teaching Points

- The evaluation of the upper airway obstruction is important for head and neck angioedema.
- Glossomegaly with decreased attenuation is common in head and neck angioedema.
- Angioedema of the visceral organs can be multifocal and asymmetric.
- Angioedema of the visceral organs is often accompanied by adjacent fluid.
- It is important to include clinical and laboratory findings for the diagnosis of angioedema.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- disease severity is highly variable, as characterized by episodic rather than continuous swelling

- a precipitating cause for most attacks is unknown

- stress and trauma are recognized as precipitants

- HAE is characterized by relatively prolonged attacks

- attacks of swelling generally involve the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, or larynx and follow a stereotypical pattern in which the swelling worsens over 24 hours, peaks, and then slowly resolves over the following 48–72 hours

- attacks can be preceded by a prodrome

- onset of swelling in patients with HAE most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty

- HAE attacks are associated with significant potential morbidity and potential mortality.

### Angioedema phenotypes: disease expression and classification [^116p1pY1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Due to marked heterogeneity of clinical presentations, comprehensive knowledge of angioedema phenotypes is crucial for correct diagnosis and choosing the appropriate therapeutic approach. One of the ways to a meaningful clinical distinction can be made between forms of angioedema occurring "with or without wheals". Angioedema with wheals (rash) is a hallmark of urticaria, either acute or chronic, spontaneous or inducible. Angioedema without wheals may still be manifested in about 10% of patients with urticaria, but it may also occur as a separate entity. Several classifications of angioedema as part of urticaria were published over time, while a latest one, released in 2014 (HAWK group consensus, see below), provided a classification of all forms of "angioedema without wheals" distinct from urticaria, which will be the focus of the present review. At this time, the HAWK consensus classification is the best in terms of covering the pathophysiology, mediators involved, angioedema triggers, and clinical expression. According to this classification, three types of hereditary angioedema (genetic C1-INH deficiency, normal C1-INH with factor XII mutations, and unknown origin) and four types of acquired angioedema (C1-INH deficiency, related to ACE inhibitors intake, idiopathic histaminergic, and idiopathic non-histaminergic) are presented. We will review the distinctive clinical features of each phenotype in details.

### Differences and similarities in the mechanisms and clinical expression of bradykinin-mediated vs. mast cell-mediated angioedema [^114wMHQN]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Angioedema (AE), transient localized swelling due to extravasated fluid, is commonly classified as mast cell mediator-induced, bradykinin-mediated or of unknown cause. AE often occurs more than once, and it is these recurrent forms of AE that are challenging for patients and physicians, and they are the ones we focus on and refer to as AE in this review. Since effective treatment depends on the causative mediator, reliable and early diagnosis is essential. Although their clinical presentations bear similarities, many forms of angioedema exhibit specific patterns of clinical appearance or disease history that may aid in diagnosis. Here, we describe the most common differences and similarities in the mechanisms and clinical features of bradykinin-mediated and mast cell mediator-induced types of angioedema. We first provide an overview of the diseases that manifest with mast cell mediator-induced versus bradykinin-mediated angioedema as well as their respective underlying pathogenesis. We then compare these diseases for key clinical features, including angioedema location, course and duration of swelling, attack frequency, prevalence and relevance of prodromal signs and symptoms, triggers of angioedema attacks, and other signs and symptoms including wheals, age of onset, and duration. Our review and comparison of the clinical profiles of different types of angioedema incorporate our own clinical experience as well as published information. Our aim is to highlight that mast cell mediator-induced and bradykinin-mediated angioedema types share common features but are different in many aspects. Knowledge of the differences in underlying pathomechanisms and clinical profiles between different types of angioedema can help with the diagnostic approach in affected patients and facilitate targeted and effective treatment.

### Angioedema masqueraders [^114E7WZ2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is a common reason for referral to immunology and allergy specialists. Not all cases are in fact angioedema. There are many conditions that may mimic its appearance, resulting in misdiagnosis. This may happen when a clinician is unfamiliar with conditions resembling angioedema or when there is a low index of clinical suspicion. In this article, we explore a list of differential diagnoses based on body parts, including the lips, the limbs, periorbital tissues, the face, epiglottis and uvula, as well as the genitalia, that may pose as a masquerader even to an experienced eye.

### Histaminergic angioedema [^117FCcej]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Angioedema is frequently categorized into histamine- or bradykinin-mediated disease. It is critical to determine the underlying mediator of symptoms as it directs treatment. Histaminergic angioedema is the most frequent cause of angioedema. It is classified as either acute (lasting < 6 weeks) or chronic (symptoms > 6 weeks). It is further classified into angioedema presenting with or without urticaria. Some patients with acute angioedema may have disease that becomes chronic. Mast cells and basophils are central to the underlying pathophysiology of histamine-mediated angioedema. The underlying treatments of histamine-mediated angioedema are antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^11332Y1D]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The median time from symptom onset to HAE diagnosis is estimated at 8.5 years. Diagnosis is often delayed, even among those with a family history of HAE. Diagnostic delays in pediatric patients may be due to the fact that HAE is a rare disorder and that many HAE symptoms can mimic those of more common conditions. Furthermore, 25% of patients have no family history of angioedema. Delays in diagnosis can defer effective treatment and result in inappropriate treatment or unnecessary surgical interventions.

Effective medications are available and approved to treat HAE in children. However, evidence informing use of these medications in pediatric clinical practice is limited because clinical trials of these agents have focused mostly on adults and have underrepresented pediatric patients.

Management plans are critical to optimize outcomes and should address treatment, on-demand treatment for acute attacks, and forestall potentially fatal laryngeal attacks. The plan should also comprise a holistic approach to address nonclinical aspects of HAE, including QoL and psychological issues.

The objective of this article is to provide an overview of HAE management principles that health care providers can apply to treat pediatric patients to improve their QoL.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111CGBHE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, and if urticaria of less than 6 weeks' duration has features suggesting it might progress, patients should be periodically re-evaluated until a diagnosis is clarified. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and although many cases are infectious, extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism, and skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases though it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines are rapidly acting but can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills compared with second-generation agents, patients should be warned about drowsiness or impaired performance, and in poor responders a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating triggers and forming an effective plan.

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: an updated international consensus paper on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^111WnBGW]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema is defined as intermittent, localized, and self-limited swelling of the subcutaneous and/or submucosal tissue. Multiple sites may be involved. It may occur in isolation, accompanied by hives (also known as wheals) or as part of a systemic allergic reaction. Angioedema may occur at any age developing spontaneously or in response to a triggering factor. Symptoms may persist for a few hours or may last days, resolving spontaneously or after treatment. All types of angioedema present with relatively similar signs and symptoms although there are differences between the various forms.

The proximate cause of all angioedema is attributed to increased vascular endothelial permeability. The underlying mechanisms, while heterogeneous and complex, ultimately result in enhanced vascular permeability leading to tissue swelling. Angioedema may result from mediators associated with mast cell activity; excess production of bradykinin due to either activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) or direct cleavage of kininogens by non- contact system proteases; reduced catabolism of bradykinin, as in some types of drug-induced angioedema; or intrinsic dysfunction of the vascular endothelium.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) has been recognized for almost 150 years. In 1963, Donaldson reported that HAE patients were characterized by decreased plasma levels of C1INH, a type of HAE now known as HAE-C1INH. Over the last two decades, new types of apparent non-mast cell mediated angioedema with normal quantity and activity of C1INH were described, in some cases with proven genetic pathogenic variants co-segregating with family and individual angioedema expression. While several clinical guidelines and practice parameters regarding this new type of HAE have been published, substantial progress has been made encompassing diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes.

In the summer of 2023, HAE International (HAEi) and the US HAE Association (HAEA) enlisted 31 HAE with normal C1INH (HAE-nC1INH) global experts to synthesize our current knowledge in the area in order to present a best practice approach to the diagnosis and management of HAE-nC1INH. Preliminary drafts of the findings were presented and discussed in a symposium held on September 1, 2023 in Munich, Germany. The current manuscript reflects four rounds of revisions of these original drafts. Given the paucity of high-level evidence, all recommendations in this paper are based on expert opinion.

### Pediatric angioedema… [^1179jHUq]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measures Sex, age, site, symptoms at initial examination, cause, therapeutic management, and clinical outcome. Results. Today we regard angioedema as an immunologically mediated, anatomically limited, nonpitting edema that up to 10% of the American population may experience during their lifetime. 2 Angioedema is distinguished from the more common urticaria by the location of the edema and by the accompanying symptoms. Angioedema manifests in the subcutaneous tissues, sometimes with prodromal tingling, paresthesias, or pruritus. Urticaria is a local reaction that manifests in the deep dermis and is always pruritic. Angioedema affects men and women equally, usually during the third or fourth decade of life. Most angioedema manifests in the head and neck, usually on the face, lips, tongue, or larynx. 3–5 Angioedema is caused by a kinin- and complement-mediated increase in vascular permeability.

Most often, angioedema is due to trauma, food, and medications. In rare cases, the unchecked propagation of the complement cascade results from a qualitative or quantitative defect in C1-INH. This disorder is termed hereditary angioedema. Hereditary angioedema usually manifests during childhood. 6 Hereditary angioedema usually is transmitted in an autosomal codominant mode by an alteration in chromosome 11, 7 although a spontaneous mutation rate up to 20% has been reported.
8. Care of the patient with angioedema must heed airway and systemic signs. The possibility of central nervous system, abdominal, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal edema may require computed tomographic scanning with contrast for diagnosis, 9 intravenous fluid for intravascular volume repletion, and diuresis or ventilatory support for treatment of pulmonary edema.

10 Corticosteroid therapy using intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate or hydrocortisone remains the main treatment for angioedema. Food was the principal cause of angioedema, followed by upper respiratory infection and insect bites. Antibiotics were responsible for only 1 episode of angioedema in our sample. Four children had allergic and immunologic disorders: eczema, reactive airways disease, multiple food allergies, and a previous episode of angioedema due to the ingestion of nuts, all of which indicate a predisposition to systemic immunologic disorders.

### Differential diagnosis of angioedema [^111vW4Mi]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

There are many conditions that may present with swelling that mimics angioedema. When swelling persists for greater than a few days or is unresponsive to treatment for urticaria/angioedema, other etiologies should be considered. In most instances, a thorough history and physical examination will define other etiologies. However, for more persistent conditions, further laboratory evaluation and a biopsy may be required to define the diagnosis. Rarely is a more aggressive approach required to make the diagnosis. Clinicians should remember that if the swelling does not act like angioedema, it more than likely is not angioedema.

Are there biomarkers of activity in CSU?

The severity of CSU should be evaluated based on the intensity of its clinical symptoms. Several biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein and D-dimers, metalloproteinase-9 and complement C3 and C4, have shown distinctive patterns in CSU patients, but these molecules have still not been validated as useful biomarkers.

Key point: Although several substances may show specific levels in CSU patients, they have not yet been validated as CSU biomarkers.

Does isolated angioedema have clinical, therapeutic and/or prognostic implications?

Isolated angioedema with no hives that responds to antihistamines should be explored and phenotyped. Most guidelines – include isolated angioedema as a subtype of CSU. However, this condition does not share the typical features of chronic urticaria, such as being more frequent in women or having an autoimmune profile. In certain cases, typical CSU starts with isolated angioedema that evolves into cutaneous wheals. On the other hand, histaminergic angioedema is clearly different from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which does not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids, has a different physiopathology – and requires a different treatment approach. The differential diagnosis for isolated angioedema is shown in Table 5.

Table 5
Differential diagnosis of isolated angioedema

Key point: Isolated angioedema does not share the typical features of CSU.

How should the diagnosis of CSU in children be approached?

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is less frequent in children, but in general, it shares the underlying causes and physiopathology of CSU in adults. Therefore, the diagnostic approach in children and adults is the same. However, it should be noted that infants are more prone to develop acute urticaria secondary to an infection.

Key point: The diagnostic approach to CSU in children should be the same as that in adults.

### Classification, diagnosis, and approach to treatment for angioedema: consensus report from the hereditary angioedema international working group [^111bTV7t]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Angioedema is defined as localized and self-limiting edema of the subcutaneous and submucosal tissue, due to a temporary increase in vascular permeability caused by the release of vasoactive mediator(s). When angioedema recurs without significant wheals, the patient should be diagnosed to have angioedema as a distinct disease. In the absence of accepted classification, different types of angioedema are not uniquely identified. For this reason, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology gave its patronage to a consensus conference aimed at classifying angioedema. Four types of acquired and three types of hereditary angioedema were identified as separate forms from the analysis of the literature and were presented in detail at the meeting. Here, we summarize the analysis of the data and the resulting classification of angioedema.

Hereditary angioedema attack pattern and sites — "Summary Statement 12: Attacks of swelling in patients with HAE generally involve the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, or larynx and follow a stereotypical pattern in which the swelling worsens over 24 hours, peaks, and then slowly resolves over the following 48 to 72 hours. (A)" Location burden is high: extremity and abdominal attacks are "the most common, each representing almost 50% of all attacks", "Over a lifetime, almost 100% of patients with HAE experience both extremity and abdominal attacks", and "more than 50% of patients with HAE experience at least 1 laryngeal attack during their lifetime". All patients are cautioned that "all patients with HAE must be considered at risk for a potential oropharyngeal attack, irrespective of their disease severity or whether they have ever had a facial or oropharyngeal attack in the past".

Hereditary angioedema prodrome — "Summary Statement 13: Attacks of HAE can be preceded by a prodrome. (C)" Prodromal features may occur "several hours or up to a day before the onset of an attack", with common symptoms including "an erythematous nonurticarial rash (erythema marginatum), localized tingling, or a sense of skin tightness", and "Up to 50% of patients report prodromes before their attacks".

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^116qPbPk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — clinical features and natural history — has relatively prolonged attacks involving the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, larynx, or combinations, with disease severity highly variable and episodic rather than continuous; onset most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty, and HAE is an autosomal dominant disease with most patients having a positive family history of angioedema. Attacks generally follow a stereotypical pattern in which swelling worsens over 24 hours and resolves over the following 48 hours, might be preceded by a prodrome, and are associated with significant potential morbidity and mortality; precipitants are often unknown, though stress and trauma are recognized.

### Biomarkers in hereditary angioedema [^112rsS9f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

In daily practice, clinicians taking care of patients with HAE are faced with several challenges, such as (i) large inter- and intra-familial heterogeneity in the clinical manifestations of the disease; (ii) early diagnosis of unpredictable oncoming angioedema attacks; (iii) a differential diagnosis of HAE subtypes; and (iv) objective assessment of disease severity, which may guide therapeutic decisions. These challenges are the driving force behind the current efforts to identify measurable biomarkers of HAE. Finding such biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis and prediction of an upcoming attack, as well as help to monitor disease activity, discriminate between high and low responders to a specific drug, or select the best candidates for a given treatment.

This review represents a clinician's perspective and constitutes an attempt to answer the question: to what extent biomarker discovery can help overcome the above challenges? In the broadest sense, any measurable parameter may serve as a biomarker, including clinical features or radiographic findings, but the scope of this review is to discuss only potential laboratory biomarkers that involve essential biological processes, from nucleic DNA to mediators of effector mechanisms.

### The spectrum and treatment of angioedema [^111SAmKh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Angioedema manifests as episodes of localized swelling in the dermis and submucosa. The key to successful management is detection and avoidance of triggers, early recognition of attacks, and aggressive airway management when warranted. Review of a patient's medication list may identify drugs that include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers as the cause. Initial treatment in a patient presenting with most forms of angioedema includes antihistamines and glucocorticoids if required. Epinephrine should be administered if there is concern for laryngeal edema. Patients who have a known history of hereditary angioedema should receive C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate or fresh-frozen plasma.

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to patients with acquired angioedema, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency:

- results from enhanced catabolism of C1 inhibitor

- might be associated with C1 inhibitor autoantibodies with or without an underlying condition such as lymphoma

- has clinical characteristics similar to those in HAE attacks.

### Angioedema due to bradykinin dysregulation [^1157HdBt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Angioedema is an acute swelling of the deeper layers of the skin or mucosa resulting from a transient increase in vascular permeability. Angioedema can occur in the absence or presence of hives, be hereditary or acquired, and be caused by various potential mediators, including histamine and bradykinin. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema can be difficult to diagnose but is responsible for a disproportionate percentage of the serious morbidity and mortality associated with angioedema. Our understanding of the basic biology of angioedema has dramatically expanded over recent years. The classification of angioedema has correspondently undergone major changes. Optimal management of patients with angioedema requires that an accurate diagnosis be established and that treatment be tailored to the patient's specific form of angioedema. In this article, we review the biology of bradykinin-mediated angioedema as well as the clinical approach to the evaluation of angioedema with a focus on bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Recognizing how the underlying pathophysiology and mechanisms of bradykinin dysregulation contribute to angioedema can help guide the clinical approach to the patient.

Hereditary angioedema disease variability and frequency — "Summary Statement 10: Disease severity in patients with HAE is highly variable, as characterized by episodic rather than continuous swelling. (D)" In those not using prophylaxis, attacks can occur "every 10 to 20 days, with each attack lasting 2 to 5 days", and "A relatively small number of patients with HAE swell very frequently, up to twice per week".
