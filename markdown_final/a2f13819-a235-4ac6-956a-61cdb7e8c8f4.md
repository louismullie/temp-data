## Question

What is Botox protective against?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Botox is protective against, in other words, which conditions and outcomes are prevented by onabotulinumtoxinA and which are not supported by evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and major guideline endorsements. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria that define the target population. Next, I will review pivotal randomized trials for efficacy signals and dosing. After that, I should examine quality-of-life and disability outcomes and check real-world corroboration. I must also clarify conditions where Botox is not protective. Finally, I will consider mechanism, safety, and synthesize a precise answer with references.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory and guideline position, because that frames what "protective" legitimately means here. The FDA label specifies Botox for the prophylaxis of headaches in adults with chronic migraine, which establishes that Botox is protective against chronic migraine headaches in adults, not against episodic migraine or other headache phenotypes by default [^116Hv7MD]. I should double-check guideline alignment, and yes, primary care guidance and neurology recommendations endorse onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine prevention in adults, including in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse, reinforcing its role as a preventive therapy in that defined population [^1172jfad] [^114Rqq2o].

> Hold on, I should verify exactly who counts as having chronic migraine, because protection is population-specific. Using ICHD-3 criteria adopted in trials and reviews, chronic migraine is defined as headache occurring on at least 15 days per month for at least 3 months, with migraine features on at least 8 days per month and each headache lasting 4 or more continuous hours, which is the basis for all major efficacy data and labeling language [^111kfF2o].

> Next, I will examine pivotal randomized evidence to ensure that "protective" translates into clinically meaningful reductions. In PREEMPT 2, onabotulinumtoxinA 155–195 units every 12 weeks reduced headache days by about 9.0 per 28 days from baseline versus 6.7 with placebo, reaching statistical significance and confirming prevention of headache days as the primary endpoint, with consistent benefits across key secondary measures and good tolerability in adults with chronic migraine [^116e828w]. Let me verify that the FDA's integrated review matches this, and indeed both PREEMPT trials demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements across headache frequency outcomes under the 155–195 unit regimen administered every 12 weeks, supporting that Botox is protective against the burden of chronic migraine at labeled doses [^116Hv7MD] [^115k6CGM] [^113rfbqo].

> I will now examine disability and quality-of-life outcomes, because "protection" should include real-world impact. Pooled PREEMPT analyses showed significant improvements in HIT-6 and MSQ domains at 24 weeks versus placebo, indicating protection against migraine-related disability and quality-of-life impairment, with benefits persisting through 56 weeks in the open-label extensions, although between-group differences attenuate late as both arms receive active therapy, which is expected [^116KXQd6] [^115j4Se6] [^112cb99y].

> Wait, let me verify that these RCT signals are reflected in real-world practice. A 10-year meta-analysis of observational studies shows sustained reductions in headache days of about 10 days per month by 24–52 weeks, with substantial improvements in acute medication days, HIT-6, and MSQ, broadly mirroring PREEMPT and confirming that Botox is protective against long-term disease burden in chronic migraine in clinically heterogeneous populations [^116WaAWj] [^1124Sxwd] [^117NQvsN]. Hold on, I should confirm durability and responder metrics, and yes, responder rates near 40–50% for at least 50% reduction in migraine days at 24 weeks have been observed in pooled real-world analyses, supporting clinically meaningful protection in practice [^116WaAWj].

> But wait, what if we apply Botox outside of chronic migraine. I need to ensure we do not overgeneralize. For chronic tension-type headache, guidelines recommend against botulinum toxin for prophylaxis, so it is not protective there [^111bz2h6]. For episodic migraine, a large placebo-controlled study failed to show superiority, so Botox is not protective for episodic migraine prevention based on available evidence [^113oXkAf]. I should also confirm age limitations, and the FDA notes that safety and effectiveness for chronic migraine prophylaxis are not established in patients under 18 years, with an adolescent RCT failing to demonstrate efficacy, so Botox is not established as protective in pediatric chronic migraine [^1171rSDk].

> Let me consider mechanism, because "protection" in chronic migraine is better understood as antinociceptive modulation rather than simple muscle relaxation. OnabotulinumtoxinA inhibits vesicular release from peripheral trigeminal nociceptors, including CGRP and substance P, and reduces trafficking and signaling of TRPV1/TRPA1, thereby decreasing peripheral and central sensitization, which plausibly underlies protection against headache chronification without systemic effects typical of oral preventives [^116HLqeG] [^116SBYwT]. Hmm, wait a minute, does this contradict its neuromuscular mechanism; no, it complements it by emphasizing a sensory neuronal SNAP-25–dependent effect relevant to migraine biology, not just cholinergic blockade in muscle [^116SBYwT].

> I should confirm safety and administration details that condition the risk–benefit profile of this preventive protection. The labeled chronic migraine dose is 155 units IM every 12 weeks with potential "follow-the-pain" up to 195 units per cycle, and across pooled analyses the treatment is generally well tolerated, with common adverse effects including neck pain and localized weakness, and low discontinuation rates; boxed warnings about possible distant spread of toxin effect exist, though serious distant spread has not been definitively reported at labeled chronic migraine doses in postmarketing summaries, which still warrants counseling and vigilance [^113rfbqo] [^117P6csH] [^112hi3NB].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing is missing. Botox is protective against chronic migraine headaches in adults, reducing headache days, acute medication use, and migraine-related disability and improving quality of life, with sustained benefits over repeated cycles and supportive real-world data; it also has a role in chronic migraine with medication overuse per European neurology guidance, although detoxification and comprehensive management remain essential, whereas Botox is not protective for episodic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, or pediatric chronic migraine based on current evidence and labeling [^116Hv7MD] [^113MLHMZ] [^116e828w] [^116KXQd6] [^116WaAWj] [^111bz2h6] [^113oXkAf] [^1171rSDk].

---

Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) provides prophylaxis for **chronic migraine** [^116Hv7MD], reducing headache frequency, severity, and disability [^111kfF2o] and improving quality of life [^1136QrYx]. It also helps prevent **medication-overuse headache** relapses [^114Rqq2o] when used continuously [^113MLHMZ] in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse [^117ULDez]. Botox is not effective for prophylaxis in episodic migraine [^113oXkAf], tension-type headache [^111bz2h6], or other headache disorders.

---

## Chronic migraine prophylaxis

Botox is **FDA-approved for chronic migraine** [^116Hv7MD], defined as ≥ 15 headache days/month for ≥ 3 months, with ≥ 8 days/month having migraine features [^111kfF2o]. It significantly reduces headache frequency and severity [^116e828w], lessens disability [^111kfF2o], and improves quality of life [^1136QrYx].

---

### Clinical evidence

Two large, randomized, placebo-controlled **PREEMPT trials** [^115k6CGM] demonstrated significant reductions in headache days [^116e828w] and improvements in quality of life with Botox [^1136QrYx]. Real-world data from observational studies [^1124Sxwd] also confirm **effectiveness and safety in routine practice** [^116WaAWj].

---

### Mechanism of action

Botox **inhibits acetylcholine release** at neuromuscular junctions [^117P6csH], reducing muscle contractions and tension that trigger migraines. It also modulates sensory neurons [^115v3BK6], decreasing neuropeptide release (e.g. CGRP) and peripheral sensitization.

---

## Medication-overuse headache (MOH)

Botox is **protective against MOH relapses** for patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse. EAN guidelines recommend continuous Botox to prevent MOH relapses [^114Rqq2o] [^113MLHMZ].

---

### Clinical evidence

PREEMPT subgroup analysis found that Botox reduced **headache frequency and severity** [^117ULDez] in chronic migraine patients with medication overuse. The **EAN guidelines** also recommend Botox for chronic migraine with medication overuse [^114Rqq2o] to prevent relapses [^113MLHMZ].

---

## Conditions not protective

Botox is not effective for prophylaxis in **episodic migraine** [^113oXkAf] or **tension-type headache** [^111bz2h6]; it shows no significant benefit over placebo in episodic migraine and is not recommended for prophylactic therapy in tension-type headache.

---

## Safety and tolerability

Botox is **generally well tolerated** [^117P6csH]; common adverse events include neck pain, muscle weakness, and injection-site pain. Serious adverse events are rare [^111kfF2o].

---

In summary, Botox is **protective against chronic migraine and MOH relapses**, but not against episodic migraine or tension-type headache. It is effective, safe, and well tolerated for chronic migraine prophylaxis [^116WaAWj].

### Botox [^116Hv7MD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Botox was evaluated in two randomized, multi-center, 24-week, two-injection cycle, placebo-controlled double-blind studies. These studies, referred to as Study 1 and Study 2, included adults suffering from chronic migraine who were not using any concurrent headache prophylaxis. During a 28-day baseline period, participants experienced more than 15 headache days lasting 4 hours or more, with over 50% of these being classified as migraine or probable migraine. In both studies, patients were randomized to receive either a placebo or Botox injections (ranging from 155 Units to 195 Units) every 12 weeks for the two-cycle, double-blind phase. Patients were permitted to use acute headache treatments throughout the study. Botox treatment demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to the placebo for key efficacy variables (see Table 31).

- **Efficacy results**: In Study 1, patients treated with Botox had a significantly greater mean decrease from baseline in the frequency of headache days at most time points from Week 4 to Week 24 (Figure 11), compared to placebo-treated patients. Study 2 showed a similar trend with Botox-treated patients experiencing significantly greater mean decreases in headache frequency across all timepoints from Week 4 to Week 24 (Figure 12).

### Pooled analysis of the safety and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of chronic migraine [^111kfF2o]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, according to the third beta edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders revised (ICHD-3 beta) criteria, chronic migraine (CM) is characterized by a headache occurring on ≥ 15 days per month for at least 3 months, with features of a migraine headache on at least 8 days per month. CM is a complex and debilitating neurological disorder, with a prevalence of 1.4%–2.2%. At present, prophylactic treatment options are limited; only onabotulinumtoxinA and topiramate have been evaluated in CM patients, and only onabotulinumtoxinA is specifically indicated for the prophylaxis of headache in patients with CM.

Results from two exploratory phase 2 studies in patients with chronic daily headache suggested the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA within the CM subgroup, which represented the predominant population enrolled in these studies. In the phase 2 studies, onabotulinumtoxinA was shown to be safe and well-tolerated in doses ranging from 75 to 260 U, repeated at approximately 12-week intervals for up to three cycles. More recently, two large-scale, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (PREEMPT: Phase 3 Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy) found onabotulinumtoxinA to be effective in the prophylaxis of CM. These studies demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements compared with placebo in headache day frequency and multiple other headache symptom measures. OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment also significantly reduced headache-related disability and improved functioning, vitality, and overall health.

### A multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of multiple treatments of botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine headaches [^113oXkAf]. Cephalalgia (2007). Low credibility.

Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA; BOTOX) for the prophylaxis of episodic migraines. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized to receive 225, 150, or 75 units of BoNTA or a placebo following a 30-day placebo run-in period for three 90-day treatment cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean reduction from baseline in the frequency of migraine episodes at day 180 in the placebo non-responder stratum.

All groups (N = 495) showed improvement, with no significant differences observed. At day 180, the frequency of migraine episodes was reduced from baseline means of 4.3, 4.7, 4.7, and 4.4 by 1.6, 1.7, 1.5, and 1.4 for BoNTA 225 U, 150 U, 75 U, and placebo, respectively. The primary endpoint was not met. Treatment-related adverse events were transient and mild to moderate. BoNTA treatment was safe and well tolerated but did not result in a significantly greater improvement than the placebo in this study. Several factors may have confounded the results.

### European Academy of Neurology guideline on the management of medication-overuse headache [^113MLHMZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of medication-overuse headache, particularly in the context of headache prophylaxis, the EAN 2020 guidelines recommend offering topiramate, onabotulinum toxin A, or an anti-CGRP or anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody as preventive medical therapy for patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse. However, it is advised not to use topiramate in female patients of childbearing potential.

### Per cent of patients with chronic migraine who responded per onabotulinumtoxinA treatment cycle: PREEMPT [^111mt1Mx]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The Phase III Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) clinical program is a combination of the two largest clinical trials of the chronic migraine (CM) population. These well-designed, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that onabotulinumtoxinA was effective, safe, and well-tolerated in treating headaches among patients with CM. Across the 56-week trial, patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA showed better outcomes compared to those treated with a placebo. However, it is unclear whether patients who fail to respond to the first onabotulinumtoxinA treatment cycle will respond to subsequent treatment cycles.

In this context, the definitions of response and responder rates are crucial. In many headache studies, the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥ 50% reduction in a headache outcome measure relative to baseline is often used. This ≥ 50% responder rate has traditionally been considered clinically meaningful in episodic migraine (EM). A ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in headache symptom measures has been suggested to be clinically meaningful in studies of CM due to the greater severity and complexity of CM relative to EM. Farrar et al. identified a 30% change on the pain scale as a clinically meaningful change. In the present report, we evaluated ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% responder rates using a number of endpoint measures.

Using ≥ 50% responder rates as our primary outcome of interest, we examined response rates to the first treatment cycle on measures of headache days, moderate to severe headache days, and hours of headache on headache days, as well as a change in these measures.

### A new treatment regimen for rosacea: OnabotulinumtoxinA [^114FFwiK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a cutaneous condition with several clinical subtypes that are commonly encountered in daily medical practice. Numerous treatment modalities exist for addressing the various physical findings associated with this disease, each with varying results. As the use of onabotulinumtoxinA increases, its benefit in treating a growing number of medical diseases is becoming more apparent. There is anecdotal evidence from authors regarding patients with rosacea who experienced improved symptoms of erythema and flushing following treatment with intradermal microdroplets of onabotulinumtoxinA. Notably, no adverse events were reported for any of these treatments. The mechanism of action likely involves a neurogenic component relating to vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and hypersebaceous activity.

### Pooled analysis of the safety and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of chronic migraine [^117P6csH]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

This pooled analysis supports the safety and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA for headache prophylaxis in adult patients with chronic migraine (CM). Multiple onabotulinumtoxinA treatments were safe and well tolerated, with low adverse event (AE)-related discontinuation rates. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) phase, the overall AE rate for onabotulinumtoxinA-treated patients was lower in the PREEMPT population (62.4%) compared with the pooled CM safety population (71.4%).

Individual AE rates for onabotulinumtoxinA-treated patients, such as neck pain (9% vs. 14%), muscle weakness (4% vs. 9%), headache (5% vs. 8%), and facial paresis (2% vs. 8%), were also lower in the PREEMPT clinical program compared with the pooled CM safety population, respectively. This reduction in AE incidence probably reflects the optimized dosing regimen, injection paradigm, experience of the injectors in the trial, and modified injection sites used in PREEMPT.

Focally administered onabotulinumtoxinA inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and has been used therapeutically in disorders characterized by muscle hyperactivity. Muscular weakness, eyelid ptosis, and facial paresis are thus expected side effects of onabotulinumtoxinA due to its action on muscle activity and were among the most frequently reported AEs. Most of the muscular weakness was local to the head, neck, or shoulder/upper arm regions, involving either the injected muscles or adjacent muscles. Weakness of nearby muscles may also occur due to local diffusion; however, distant effects were not reported.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^116dAG25]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for botulism, specifically with respect to antitoxin therapy, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend administering botulinum antitoxin in patients with suspected botulism as early as possible in the course of illness, recognizing that the greatest benefit accrues within the first two days of illness onset. It is advised to administer botulinum antitoxin in symptomatic patients with suspected botulism based on clinical findings. Laboratory confirmation should not be awaited because results might take several days and can be negative in patients with botulism.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA improves quality of life and reduces impact of chronic migraine over one year of treatment: Pooled results from the PREEMPT randomized clinical trial program [^115j4Se6]. Cephalalgia (2016). High credibility.

Chronic migraine (CM), characterized by ≥ 15 headache days per month, is highly debilitating and associated with significant personal, social, and economic burden. Individuals with CM experience greater headache impact and disability, reduced productivity at work, home, and school, decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and increased comorbid medical conditions, including obesity, vascular disease, and psychiatric disorders compared with those with episodic migraine (EM; < 15 headache days/month). In addition, those affected by CM make more visits to health care providers than those with EM, and the direct and indirect costs of CM are more than four times higher than those associated with EM.

The clinical safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA as headache prophylaxis in adults with CM were demonstrated in the Phase III REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) clinical trials program. In the pivotal trials, PREEMPT 1 and PREEMPT 2, eligible patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo for 24 weeks, followed by open-label treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA for 32 weeks, for a total treatment duration of up to 56 weeks. In addition to evaluating the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA vs. placebo on headache-related variables, the PREEMPT trials also evaluated treatment effects on headache impact using the 6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and on HRQoL using the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ), version 2.1. Primary results from the 24-week, double-blind phase have been published.

### Botox [^1171rSDk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Prophylaxis of headaches in chronic migraine

Safety and effectiveness in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. In a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 123 adolescent patients (ages 12 to below 18 years) with chronic migraine were randomized to receive BOTOX 74 Units, BOTOX 155 Units, or placebo, for one injection cycle. This trial did not establish the efficacy of BOTOX, compared with placebo, for the prophylaxis of headaches in adolescents with chronic migraine.

- **Spasticity**: Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX have been established by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of BOTOX in patients 2 to 17 years of age with upper and lower limb spasticity. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Axillary hyperhidrosis**: Safety and effectiveness in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.

- **Cervical dystonia**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been established.

- **Blepharospasm and strabismus**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.

- **Juvenile animal data**: In a study in which juvenile rats received intramuscular injection of BOTOX (0, 8, 16, or 24 Units/kg) every other week from postnatal d

### OnabotulinumtoxinA improves quality of life and reduces impact of chronic migraine over one year of treatment: Pooled results from the PREEMPT randomized clinical trial program [^116qJ4Yn]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Throughout the double-blind phase, the percentage of patients with a clinically meaningful individual response on the HIT-6 (i.e. ≥ 5-point decrease in total score) was significantly greater in the onabotulinumtoxinA group than in the placebo group. During the open-label phase, more than 50% of patients in both groups had clinically meaningful individual responses at all time points after receiving onabotulinumtoxinA. The between-group difference at week 36 (57.3% [CI 53.6–61.0] versus 50.6% [CI 46.9–54.3], p = 0.013) was the only contemporaneous comparison to reach statistical significance.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA improves quality of life and reduces impact of chronic migraine [^116KXQd6]. Neurology (2011). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan, Inc, Irvine, CA) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and headache impact in adults with chronic migraine (CM).

- **Methods**: The Phase III Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) clinical program, consisting of PREEMPT 1 and 2, included a 24-week double-blind phase (divided into two 12-week cycles) followed by a 32-week open-label phase (three cycles). Thirty-one injections of 5U each (155 U of onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo) were administered to fixed sites with the possibility of an additional 40 U administered "following the pain". Prespecified analyses of headache impact using the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and HRQoL using the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire v2.1 (MSQ) assessments were performed. Due to the similar design and outcome of the studies, pooled results are presented here.

- **Results**: A total of 1,384 subjects were included in the pooled analyses (onabotulinumtoxinA, n = 688; placebo, n = 696). Baseline mean total HIT-6 and MSQ v2.1 scores were comparable between groups; 93.1% of participants were severely impacted, as indicated by HIT-6 scores ≥ 60. At 24 weeks, onabotulinumtoxinA treatment, compared with placebo, significantly reduced HIT-6 scores and the proportion of patients with HIT-6 scores in the severe range at all time points, including week 24 (p < 0.001). OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment significantly improved all domains of the MSQ v2.1 at 24 weeks (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Treatment of CM with onabotulinumtoxinA is associated with significant and clinically meaningful reductions in headache impact and improvements in HRQoL.

### A critical review of botulinum toxin type A in the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine in adults [^1133wpXY]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Migraine is a severe, disabling condition, ranked by the World Health Organization as the sixth highest cause of disability worldwide. It greatly affects patients' quality of life, functionality, and physical and mental health. The financial burden of migraine on the UK economy is conservatively estimated at £3.42 billion per year.

- **Objectives**: The authors sought to perform an evidence-based literature review of the safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (onaBoNTA) in the prophylactic treatment of adult patients suffering with chronic migraine (CM) compared to placebo. After the best evidence is identified, it will be utilized to formulate a protocol for doctors managing CM in their aesthetic clinic.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of the literature on the topic was performed using the PubMed MEDLINE electronic database on March 1, 2018. All articles up to and including this date were included. Articles were limited to human studies and those in the English language. In vitro and animal studies were excluded.

- **Results**: A total of 260 articles were identified. Of these, the excellent-quality, high-strength (level 1A) trials were shortlisted to answer the research question.

- **Conclusions**: There is high-quality, level 1A evidence to support that onaBoNTA treatment in adults with CM is well-tolerated and considered safe. However, it is associated with an increased risk of adverse events, and some uncertainty still exists regarding the degree to which onaBoNTA improves outcome measures compared to placebo. These data have been used to formulate the London Aesthetic protocol.

### Utilization and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine from an observational study in Europe [^117Dntdx]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine treatment utilization patterns and the safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine in routine clinical practice. Clinical trials have supported onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylaxis of headache in patients with chronic migraine, but real-world data remain limited.

A prospective, observational, post-authorization study was conducted involving adult patients with chronic migraine treated with onabotulinumtoxinA. Data were collected at the first study injection and approximately every three months for up to 52 weeks for utilization, and up to 64 weeks for safety data. The findings were summarized using descriptive statistics.

A total of 85 physicians, of whom 81% were neurologists, across 58 practices in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Sweden, participated in the study. They recruited 1160 patients (84.2% female, median age 46.6 years). At baseline, 85.8% of patients had physician diagnoses of chronic migraine/transformed migraine and reported an average of 11.3 severe headache days per 28 days (SD = 6.9); 50.6% had previously used onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine. Over the course of the study, 4017 treatments were observed. The median number of injection sites (n = 31) and total dose (155 U) were consistent across all treatment sessions, with a median of 13.7 weeks observed between sessions.

At least one treatment-related adverse event was reported by 291 patients (25.1%); the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event was neck pain (4.4%). Most patients (74.4%) expressed satisfaction or extreme satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA treatment.

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^117NQvsN]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

The meta-analysis considered the key endpoints examined in the onabotulinumtoxinA PREEMPT RCT program in patients with chronic migraine. Both PREEMPT 1 and 2 comprised a 24-week, randomized, double-blind phase followed by a 32-week, open-label phase. The two PREEMPT RCTs were identical in design regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization, visits, double-blind phase, open-label phase, safety assessments, and treatment. Eligible patients in both studies were randomized (1:1) to receive onabotulinumtoxinA (155–195 U) or placebo injections every 12 weeks and were assessed every four weeks.

The primary study endpoint of both RCTs was the Week 24 change from baseline (CFB) in the number of headache days per month (a headache day was defined as any headache lasting at least 30 minutes; a month was defined as a 28-day period). Secondary efficacy variables included:

- **Change from baseline in number of migraine days per month**: Moderate/severe headache days per month.
- **Number of cumulative hours of headache on days when headache was experienced**: Proportion of patients scoring severe (≥ 60 points) on the Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6.
- **Number of headaches per month**: Number of migraine attacks (meeting ICHD-2 criteria 1.1 migraine without aura or 1.2 migraine with aura according to the patient's diary) per month.
- **Number of days of acute headache pain medication intake per month**: Defined by a patient-reported headache/migraine with a start and end time indicating that the pain lasted four or more continuous hours.

### Botox [^112yxgtY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In one Phase 3 study and the open-label extension study involving patients with pediatric lower limb spasticity, neutralizing antibodies developed in 2 of 264 patients (0.8%) treated with Botox for up to five treatment cycles. Both patients continued to experience clinical benefit following subsequent Botox treatments.

In the group of overactive bladder patients, analyzed specimens from two Phase 3 studies and an open-label extension study showed that neutralizing antibodies developed in 0 of 954 patients (0.0%) while receiving Botox 100 Unit doses and 3 of 260 patients (1.2%) after subsequently receiving at least one 150 Unit dose. The response to subsequent Botox treatment was not different following seroconversion in these three patients.

In patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition, analyzable specimens in the adult drug development program (including the open-label extension study) showed that neutralizing antibodies developed in 3 of 300 patients (1.0%) after receiving only Botox 200 Unit doses and in 5 of 258 patients (1.9%) after receiving at least one 300 Unit dose. Following the development of neutralizing antibodies in these eight patients, four continued to experience clinical benefit, two did not experience clinical benefit, and the effect on the response to Botox in the remaining two patients is not known. In 99 pediatric patients who had a negative baseline result for binding antibodies or neutralizing antibodies and had at least one evaluable post-baseline value from one randomized double-blind study and one double-blind extension study, no patients developed neutralizing antibodies.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of chronic migraine: results from the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase of the PREEMPT 2 trial [^116e828w]. Cephalalgia (2010). High credibility.

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX) for the prophylaxis of headaches in adults with chronic migraine. PREEMPT 2 was a phase 3 study, with a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, followed by a 32-week, open-label phase. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (155U-195U; n = 347) or placebo (n = 358) every 12 weeks for two cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in headache days per 28 days from baseline to weeks 21–24 post-treatment.

OnabotulinumtoxinA was statistically significantly superior to placebo for the primary endpoint, reducing the frequency of headache days per 28 days relative to baseline (-9.0 for onabotulinumtoxinA vs. -6.7 for placebo, p < .001). It was significantly favored in all secondary endpoint comparisons and was safe and well tolerated, with few treatment-related adverse events. Few patients (3.5% onabotulinumtoxinA/1.4% placebo) discontinued due to adverse events.

The results of PREEMPT 2 demonstrate that onabotulinumtoxinA is effective for the prophylaxis of headache in adults with chronic migraine. Repeated treatments were safe and well tolerated.

### Per cent of patients with chronic migraine who responded per onabotulinumtoxinA treatment cycle: PREEMPT [^116pRNKC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The resolution of central and peripheral sensitization is time-dependent and involves the reversal of a potentiated state. Repeat dosing may be required to ensure sufficient time for decreased peripheral inputs to enable the resolution of individual cellular and related biological system changes associated with sensitization.

Clinicians who treat patients with CM are advised to discuss expectations of efficacy when starting onabotulinumtoxinA treatment. It is recommended that patients maintain a diary to track their response to treatment. As with many prophylactic agents, sustained exposure to the drug for several months (e.g. six months) is often required to fully evaluate the response to the treatment. Owing to the unique delivery and mechanism of action of onabotulinumtoxinA, this may be achieved with up to three repeated treatments, as demonstrated in this study. At least two or three treatments with onabotulinumtoxinA are recommended to determine responsiveness.

### Cost-effectiveness of long-term, targeted onabotulinumtoxinA versus peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery for the treatment of refractory migraine headaches [^112QFH8S]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic migraines affect approximately 2 percent of the U.S. population and cost an estimated $17 billion per year. OnabotulinumtoxinA (botulinum toxin type A) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved prophylactic medication for chronic migraine headaches and is best injected in a targeted fashion into specific trigger sites. The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of long-term, targeted botulinum toxin type A versus peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery for the treatment of migraine headaches.

- **Methods**: A Markov model was constructed to examine long-term, targeted botulinum toxin type A versus peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery. Costs, utilities, and other model inputs were identified from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio under $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year was considered cost-effective.

- **Results**: The mean cost of peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery was $10,303, with an effectiveness of 7.06, whereas the mean cost of long-term, targeted botulinum toxin type A was $36,071, with an effectiveness of 6.34. Trigger site deactivation surgery is more effective and less costly over the time horizon of the model. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that surgery is the most cost-effective treatment in patients requiring treatment for greater than 6.75 years.

- **Conclusions**: Based on this model, peripheral trigger site deactivation surgery is the more cost-effective option for treating refractory migraine headaches.

### Clinical results of botulinum toxin type A treatment of migraine headache [^112SzW38]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case studies indicate that botulinum toxin type A is safe and effective for prophylactic and acute treatment of migraine headache. Further studies are needed to scientifically determine the optimum dosage, administration sites, and which patients are most likely to benefit from this treatment.

### Xeomin [^115keJHL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Xeomin for the treatment of blepharospasm patients pre-treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) were evaluated in Study 2 (NCT00406367), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial involving a total of 109 patients. Patients had a clinical diagnosis of benign essential blepharospasm, with a baseline JRS severity subscore ≥ 2, and a stable, satisfactory therapeutic response to previous administrations of onabotulinumtoxinA. At least 10 weeks had to have elapsed since the most recent onabotulinumtoxinA administration. Patients with any significant neuromuscular disease that might interfere with the study were excluded from enrollment. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive a single administration of Xeomin (n = 75) or placebo (n = 34). Each patient in the Xeomin group received a Xeomin treatment (dose, volume, dilution, and injection sites per muscle) that was similar to the most recent onabotulinumtoxinA injection sessions prior to study entry. The highest dose permitted in this study was 100 units (50 units per eye); the mean Xeomin dose was 33 units per eye.

### Botox [^112AGR4j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Excessive doses of Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection may be expected to produce neuromuscular weakness with a variety of symptoms. Symptoms of overdose are likely not to be present immediately following injection. If an accidental injection or oral ingestion occurs, or an overdose is suspected, the person should be medically supervised for several weeks for signs and symptoms of systemic muscular weakness, which could be local or distant from the injection site [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.6)]. These patients should be considered for further medical evaluation, and appropriate medical therapy should be immediately instituted, which may include hospitalization.

If the musculature of the oropharynx and esophagus is affected, aspiration may occur, possibly leading to the development of aspiration pneumonia. If the respiratory muscles become paralyzed or sufficiently weakened, intubation and assisted respiration may be necessary until recovery. Supportive care could involve the need for a tracheostomy and/or prolonged mechanical ventilation, in addition to other general supportive care.

In the event of an overdose, antitoxin raised against botulinum toxin is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA. However, the antitoxin will not reverse any botulinum toxin-induced effects already apparent at the time of antitoxin administration. In suspected or actual cases of botulinum toxin poisoning, contact your local or state health department to process a request for antitoxin.

### Utilization and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine from an observational study in Europe [^112h3qgq]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Patients who had experienced positive results and tolerable adverse events after prior treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA were more likely to be treated than those who experienced poor clinical outcomes or intolerable adverse events. Thus, patients who were treatment-naïve arguably provide data that may be more generalizable to new users of onabotulinumtoxinA in a real-world clinical setting. However, a real-world setting would likely include a mix of naïve and non-naïve patients; therefore, to observe utilization in routine clinical practice, we included a mix of patients in our study. Regarding safety data, the observed adverse events and their incidence rate were consistent with the Summary of Product Characteristics and previously published results.

Overall, this study captured utilization and safety data from a large population of chronic migraine patients treated primarily in headache or pain specialty clinics or at hospital-based practices across four countries in Europe, providing a comprehensive look at real-world practices of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine in these practice settings.

To our knowledge, this is the largest observational study at the time of writing examining the utilization and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine in actual clinical practice. Results from this study indicate that real-world utilization of onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine appears to be consistent with the recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics and the published PREEMPT results.

### Botulinum toxin in migraine prophylaxis [^112RgREW]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 4–72 hours. Characteristics of headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity, and association with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. The migraine aura is a complex of neurological symptoms that occur just before or at the onset of a migraine headache.

Botulinum toxin A represents a completely new option for patients with chronic pain conditions. Numerous retrospective open-label chart reviews and four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that botulinum toxin type A is significantly effective in migraine prophylaxis and reduces the frequency, severity, and disability associated with migraine headaches. Studies have generally reported a good and consistent efficacy.

The differential therapeutic use of botulinum toxin appears to be worth attempting in migraine patients with the following characteristic features:

- **Muscular stress as migraine trigger**: e.g. in craniocervical dystonia, pericranial painful muscular trigger points or tender points, oromandibular dysfunction.
- **Chronic tension-type headache** with the aggravating factors of muscular stress or oromandibular dysfunction.
- **Chronic migraine** with frequent migraine attacks on more than 15 days per month for longer than 3 months, and if other therapeutic options have been either ineffective or have not been tolerated.

Use of the agent does not cause CNS side effects. Migraine patients, in particular, often suffer greatly as a result.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA improves quality of life and reduces impact of chronic migraine over one year of treatment: Pooled results from the PREEMPT randomized clinical trial program [^116UM2W3]. Cephalalgia (2016). High credibility.

Chronic migraine (CM) is associated with high impact and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

- **Methods**: Patients with CM from PREEMPT (Phase 3 REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy) were randomized (1:1) to receive onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo for two 12-week cycles in the double-blind (DB) phase, followed by three 12-week cycles of open-label (OL) onabotulinumtoxinA (onabotulinumtoxinA/onabotulinumtoxinA (O/O) and placebo/onabotulinumtoxinA (P/O) groups, respectively). HRQoL endpoints were assessed over 56 weeks using the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ). HIT-6 score reductions ≥ 2.3 and ≥ 5 denoted between-group minimally important difference and within-patient clinically meaningful response, respectively.

- **Results**: A total of 1236 participants (O/O, n = 607; P/O, n = 629) participated in both phases. The DB phase showed significantly reduced HIT-6 and MSQ for onabotulinumtoxinA versus placebo (all p < 0.001). The OL phase showed significantly reduced HIT-6 for O/O versus P/O at weeks 28, 36, and 48, but not 56. All three MSQ domains showed improved HRQoL relative to baseline, but only the role restrictive domain showed a significant difference between O/O and P/O at week 56.

- **Conclusions**: Benefits of onabotulinumtoxinA on HRQoL versus baseline persisted throughout the OL phase. Statistical superiority in favor of O/O was demonstrated for HIT-6 through 48 weeks and for MSQ (role restrictive) at 56 weeks.

### Utilization and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine from an observational study in Europe [^113MX1jT]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

A total of 4017 onabotulinumtoxinA treatment sessions were administered to patients throughout the course of the study, with up to seven treatment sessions per patient. Because only one patient in Sweden received a seventh treatment, data are presented on six treatment sessions (Table 3). The median total number of sites injected for each side (right and left) across muscle areas and all treatment sessions was 15 sites, with one site on the midline also injected (median total number of sites injected was 31 for all treatment cycles 1 to 5). The median total dose of onabotulinumtoxinA administered across all treatment sessions was 75 U for each side (right and left) and 5 U in the midline (combined median total dose of 155 U). The median injection sites and doses were similar across all countries and were the same for treatment-naïve patients as for the overall analysis population (Supplementary Table 1). The majority of injections were administered using a 0.5 in/1.25 cm needle length. Muscle areas injected across treatment sessions were consistent, with the majority of physicians injecting the seven recommended muscle areas. The muscle areas injected were similar for the treatment-naïve subgroup (Supplementary Table 2). The average number of weeks between treatment sessions was 14.3 (SD, 3.19) weeks and ranged between 6.0 and 51.4 weeks, with the average time between treatment sessions generally decreasing slightly with each subsequent treatment session (Figure 4).

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^1137nNba]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

In total, the systematic literature review identified 193 real-world studies on migraine. Among these, 157 were published as full papers and 36 as conference abstracts. After removing duplicate publications and studies involving unspecified migraine, 44 full-text publications and 36 abstracts on chronic migraine passed screening and eligibility assessment. These were considered for inclusion in the primary meta-analysis.

Of the 44 studies in full-text form, 29 were prospective studies (15 of which had durations of 24 weeks or longer and were thus included in the primary analysis restricted to prospective studies). Additionally, there were 13 retrospective studies, and two studies were classified as "other". Geographically, most of the included studies were conducted in Italy (15 studies) and Spain (11 studies), with additional contributions from various countries across Europe, North America, and Australia.

- **Characteristics of studies included in meta-analysis**: PREEMPT endpoints, assessed where sufficient data were available in eligible studies, included mean change from baseline (CFB) in the number of headache days per month, the number of days of acute headache pain medication intake per month, total HIT-6 score, and MSQ score. Studies also evaluated the incidence of a ≥ 50% reduction in the number of headache days per month. In addition to PREEMPT endpoints, some included studies assessed the absolute MIDAS score. However, not all outcomes were assessed across all studies.

Baseline clinical characteristics of patients within the included onabotulinumtoxinA real-world studies were consistent with typical chronic migraine populations.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA improves quality of life and reduces impact of chronic migraine over one year of treatment: Pooled results from the PREEMPT randomized clinical trial program [^115k6CGM]. Cephalalgia (2016). High credibility.

The PREEMPT 1 and 2 trials were conducted concurrently at 122 sites (106 in North America and 16 in Europe) from January 2006 to August 2008. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 to 65 years who met the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD-2) diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine (CM). Participants needed to have at least 15 headache days during the 28-day screening period, with each headache day having at least 4 continuous hours and 50% being migraine or probable migraine days.

At the start of the double-blind period, eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo for 24 weeks, consisting of two injection cycles. Subsequently, all participants received onabotulinumtoxinA during a 32-week open-label period comprising three injection cycles. Randomization was stratified by baseline medication overuse, with blocks of four for each site.

Participants received onabotulinumtoxinA (155 U) or a matching placebo (2 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution) through 31 fixed-dose, intramuscular injections in specific head and neck muscle areas every 12 weeks. Investigators could administer an additional 40 U of the drug, for a total possible dose of 195 U, at up to 39 injection sites per cycle. Detailed study design information for PREEMPT 1 and 2 has been published previously.

The PREEMPT clinical trial program was approved by an independent ethics committee or a local institutional review board at each site, with written informed consent obtained from all participants.

### Botox [^112hi3NB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing safety data from Botox and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that predisposes them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with the spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than those used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech, or respiratory disorders occur.

No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with Botox for blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 Units and below), severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis at the recommended dose (100 Units), strabismus, or for chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA improves quality of life and reduces impact of chronic migraine over one year of treatment: Pooled results from the PREEMPT randomized clinical trial program [^115CnmMz]. Cephalalgia (2016). High credibility.

Chronic migraine (CM) is associated with a high impact on and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients with CM from PREEMPT (Phase 3 Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo for two 12-week cycles during the double-blind (DB) phase, followed by three 12-week cycles of open-label (OL) onabotulinumtoxinA. Participants were divided into onabotulinumtoxinA/onabotulinumtoxinA (O/O) and placebo/onabotulinumtoxinA (P/O) groups, respectively. HRQoL endpoints were assessed over 56 weeks using the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ). HIT-6 score reductions of ≥ 2.3 and ≥ 5 denoted a between-group minimally important difference and a clinically meaningful response within patients, respectively.

A total of 1236 participants (O/O, n = 607; P/O, n = 629) participated in both phases. The DB phase demonstrated significantly reduced HIT-6 and MSQ scores for participants receiving onabotulinumtoxinA compared to placebo (all p < 0.001). In the OL phase, HIT-6 scores showed significant reductions for the O/O group compared to the P/O group at weeks 28, 36, and 48, but not at week 56. All three MSQ domains exhibited improved HRQoL relative to baseline, although only the role restrictive domain showed a significant difference between O/O and P/O at week 56.

The benefits of onabotulinumtoxinA on HRQoL compared to baseline persisted throughout the OL phase. Statistical superiority in favor of the O/O group was demonstrated for HIT-6 through week 48 and for the role restrictive domain of MSQ at week 56.

### Exposure to medication for neurological disease in pregnancy - time to consider the long-term implications [^116KMSxS]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Injectable prophylactic treatments for migraine include botulinum toxin and CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) antagonists.

- **Botulinum toxin**: Botulinum toxin is an established treatment for chronic migraine when three or more oral treatments have failed. It is also used in the management of spasticity and more widely in cosmetic procedures. While published data on the safety of botulinum toxin administration in pregnancy is relatively lacking, its local mechanism of action and relatively low dosage suggest that potential risks are low. A single case series of 45 patients, 32 of whom continued treatment throughout pregnancy, provided reassuring results; however, treatment decisions must be made on an individual basis.

- **CGRP antagonists**: Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists are novel therapeutic agents for migraine prophylaxis. Evidence for use in pregnancy is currently lacking. CGRP is involved in the vascular development of the placenta and decidualization, acting as a potent vasodilator to regulate uteroplacental blood flow. In animals, CGRP levels increase during pregnancy, as does the responsiveness of uterine vasculature to it. Antagonism of CGRP in rats results in offspring with restricted growth, and offspring of CGRP receptor knockout mice develop hydrops fetalis and die in utero. Despite this, a study on erenumab, a CGRP antagonist, in cynomolgus monkeys showed no negative impacts on pregnancy, post-natal growth, or development.

Small case series of women exposed to CGRP antagonists during pregnancy have not yet provided conclusive evidence.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA effects on trigeminal nociceptors [^116HLqeG]. Cephalalgia (2023). Low credibility.

Since migraine, including chronic migraine, is considered a sensory disease, the acetylcholine inhibition-focused mechanism of action of BoNT/A and subsequent muscle relaxation do not readily explain the effectiveness of onabotA in treating this disease. The treatment pattern includes injecting onabotA in the region of the peripheral trigeminal nerve. Although the pathophysiology of migraine has not been fully elucidated, evidence suggests that the initiation of the headache phase of a migraine attack occurs when sustained activation of meningeal nociceptors sensitizes peripheral trigeminal neurons. This peripheral sensitization facilitates central sensitization and subsequent activation of multiple brain regions involved in processing sensory information and pain, leading to headache and cortically mediated symptoms of migraine (e.g. allodynia, phonophobia, photophobia).

Additionally, increasing evidence suggests that similar intracellular targets/mechanisms present in motor and autonomic neurons are also present in sensory neurons. Indeed, SNAP25 is expressed in sensory neurons, and BoNT/A cleavage of SNAP25 in primary sensory neurons inhibits SNARE-mediated processes that have been implicated in migraine pathophysiology, including neuropeptide release (e.g. calcitonin gene-related peptide [CGRP], substance P) and increased receptor surface expression (e.g. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subfamily member 1 [TRPV1], TRPA1).

Furthermore, a prior study showed that BoNT/A reduced TRPV1 expression in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons by interfering with plasma membrane transport processes.

### Utilization and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine from an observational study in Europe [^112TiHjU]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA have been established in controlled trials; however, real-world data in an actual clinical setting are limited. This study examined the utilization patterns and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA in a routine clinical setting, as such efficacy and effectiveness were not specifically examined. Consistent with other published studies on chronic migraine, the majority of patients in the study had a diagnosis of chronic migraine at their baseline visit. Although other diagnoses were also recorded, it is likely that migraine and chronic migraine diagnoses overlapped, in addition to tension-type headache and medication overuse headache. Overall, patient demographics and clinical characteristics align with typical chronic migraine characteristics; therefore, this study was successful in enrolling and observing chronic migraine patients in a real-world setting.

The doses and muscle areas injected were generally consistent across treatment sessions and with the Summary of Product Characteristics and PREEMPT injection guidelines. Approximately half of the patients received the recommended 155 U to 195 U dose during all their treatment sessions. Of those treatments that deviated from the recommended paradigm, the majority (72.8%) deviated due to longer treatment intervals (i.e. > 13 weeks between treatments). Although approximately 41% of patients received doses < 155 U, this may be an artifact of packaging restrictions for onabotulinumtoxinA (availability of 50 U, 100 U, or 200 U vials only).

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^1159eN2v]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Migraine is characterized by both painful symptoms, including attacks of intense throbbing headache often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound, and other sensory symptoms, such as tiredness, numbness, and allodynia. These symptoms of chronic migraine cause a level of functional and emotional impact in people with migraine that ranks the disease second among worldwide causes of disability.

When headaches occur on 15 or more days per month beyond a period of three months and have features of migraine occurring at least eight days per month, the condition is termed chronic migraine, a complex, progressive neurological disease that prevails in 1–2% of the global population. Chronic migraine is associated with considerable disease burden; people with chronic migraine experience significant impairments to daily functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and productivity. The disease also poses substantial direct costs to healthcare systems and indirect costs to society.

Preventive therapeutic strategies aim to reduce the frequency, duration, and intensity of migraine attacks. Among oral medications used and studied in the prevention of migraine, only topiramate 100 mg/day has clearly demonstrated efficacy in the prophylaxis of chronic migraine, yet no treatments are licensed specifically for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Moreover, the poor efficacy and tolerability of oral preventive medications have led to low treatment persistence (14% at 12 months) and overuse of acute prescription medication for migraine.

### Utilization and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine from an observational study in Europe [^114RkvhQ]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to examine the treatment utilization patterns and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine in routine clinical practice.

Clinical trials support the use of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylaxis of headaches in patients with chronic migraine, but real-world data are limited.

A prospective, observational, post-authorization study was conducted in adult patients with chronic migraine treated with onabotulinumtoxinA. Data were collected at the first study injection and approximately every three months for up to 52 weeks for utilization and up to 64 weeks for safety data, summarized using descriptive statistics.

Eighty-five physicians (81% neurologists) across 58 practices in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Sweden participated and recruited 1,160 patients (84.2% female, median age 46.6 years). At baseline, 85.8% of patients had physician diagnoses of chronic/transformed migraine and reported an average of 11.3 (SD = 6.9) severe headache days per 28-day period. Additionally, 50.6% had previously used onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine. A total of 4,017 study treatments were observed. The median number of injection sites (n = 31) and total dose (155 U) were consistent across all treatment sessions, with a median of 13.7 weeks observed between sessions. At least one treatment-related adverse event was reported by 291 patients (25.1%), with neck pain being the most frequently reported (4.4%). Most patients (74.4%) were satisfied or extremely satisfied with the onabotulinumtoxinA treatment.

### Utilization and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine from an observational study in Europe [^1154XQhF]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

For the purposes of the study, a deviation from the treatment paradigm recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics was defined as a dose of 195 U, injection of 39 sites, a dosing interval of 13 weeks, or use of a needle of length other than 1.25 cm (0.5 in) or 2.5 cm (1 in) for any treatment session; there could be more than one reason for deviation from the recommended label treatment paradigm. If a patient received a treatment with any of these characteristics at any time during the study period, the patient was classified as "deviated" regardless of other treatment sessions.

Overall, 1045 (90.1%) patients in the study were observed to have ≥ 1 treatment deviation. Patients in the United Kingdom were least likely to receive treatment that deviated from the recommended label treatment paradigm (80.1%) and those in Spain were most likely to do so (99.1%). The majority of the deviations documented were deviations from the recommended dosage schedule, with 844 (72.8%) patients receiving treatment at an interval greater than 13 weeks.

### Utilization and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine from an observational study in Europe [^115YLEYv]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic management of chronic migraine, defined as a headache occurring on at least 15 days per month for more than three months, includes acute treatment of headaches and preventive therapies to reduce the frequency of headaches and related migraine disability. Chronic migraine is estimated to affect approximately 1.4% to 2.2% of the population globally, with rates of 0.4% to 2.0% reported for German populations, depending on how strictly the criteria for chronic migraine were applied. As chronic migraine is often associated with substantial disability, functional impairment, and decreased quality of life — and may be associated with medication overuse — it is important that any treatment is both effective and well-tolerated.

The efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA have been demonstrated in the Phase III Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) trials. In a pooled analysis of four double-blind placebo-controlled trials, onabotulinumtoxinA was safe and well-tolerated, with 3.4% of patients discontinuing treatment due to an adverse event. Serious adverse events occurred in 5.4% of patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA and 3.0% of those receiving placebo. Consistent with the known tolerability profile of onabotulinumtoxinA, the most frequently reported adverse events in the pooled analysis were musculoskeletal in origin and were comparable to the known adverse events associated with onabotulinumtoxinA when used in other indications.

### Botox [^114DiVun]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The potency units of BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products, and therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Description (11)].

Indication-specific dosage and administration recommendations should be followed. When initiating treatment, the lowest recommended dose should be used. In treating adult patients for one or more indications, the maximum cumulative dose should not exceed 400 Units in a 3-month interval. In pediatric patients, the total dose should not exceed the lower of 10 Units/kg body weight or 340 Units in a 3-month interval [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

The safe and effective use of BOTOX depends upon proper storage of the product, selection of the correct dose, and proper reconstitution and administration techniques. An understanding of standard electromyographic techniques is also required for treatment of strabismus, upper or lower limb spasticity, and may be useful for the treatment of cervical dystonia. Physicians administering BOTOX must understand the relevant neuromuscular and structural anatomy of the area involved and any alterations to the anatomy due to prior surgical procedures and disease, especially when injecting near the lungs.

Do not use BOTOX and contact AbbVie (1–800–678–1605) if:

### Insights from 25 years of onabotulinumtoxinA in migraine - mechanisms and management [^116SBYwT]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2024). High credibility.

OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) was first linked to beneficial effects in migraine 25 years ago and was approved by the FDA for preventive treatment of chronic migraine in 2010. The treatment has since had a major impact on the well-being of people with chronic migraine. The clinical development program for BTX-A and research since its approval have provided insights into the neuromodulatory sensory effect of BTX-A, how it can control chronic migraine despite its peripheral action, and the underlying biology of migraine as a disease.

In this review, we consider the impact that BTX-A has had on the management of chronic migraine and on the research field. We discuss the insights provided by clinical research, encompassing the clinical trials and subsequent real-world evidence, and the mechanistic insights provided by preclinical and translational research. We also provide an overview of future directions of research in the field of BTX-A in migraine and the clinical translation of this research.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA is a well tolerated and effective treatment for refractory overactive bladder in real-world practice [^116wZrMP]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021).

This large, prospective, observational, non-randomized multinational study (GRACE, NCT02161159) was performed in four European countries: Germany (31 sites), Spain (nine sites), Sweden (six sites), and the UK (seven sites). Patients aged ≥ 18 years with overactive bladder (OAB) and urinary incontinence (UI) who were intolerant to and/or inadequately managed with at least one anticholinergic medication were enrolled. All participants were naive to botulinum toxin type A for the treatment of OAB.

Exclusion criteria included any treatment with botulinum toxin type A in the previous 18 months for any condition, unwillingness or inability to initiate clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment, or current participation in other clinical studies. Both efficacy and safety analyses were conducted on the safety population, which comprised patients who received at least one dose of onabotulinumtoxinA.

Treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA was based on the physician's normal clinical practice and local summaries of product characteristics (SMPC). Patients were followed up for 12 months with three scheduled follow-up visits: FU1 at approximately 12 weeks, FU2 at any time point after FU1, and FU3 approximately 12 months after baseline.

Patients had the option to complete a paper diary. Data entered into the diary were analyzed according to predefined documentation time points, allowing patients to document UI, micturition, and urge at specific time points, which were not necessarily linked to a particular visit.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA improves quality of life and reduces impact of chronic migraine over one year of treatment: Pooled results from the PREEMPT randomized clinical trial program [^112cb99y]. Cephalalgia (2016). High credibility.

**Patient disposition and demographics**: In the PREEMPT 1 and 2 trials, 1384 patients were randomized to receive onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 688) or placebo (n = 696) for 24 weeks of double-blind treatment. A total of 1236 patients (89.3%) continued into 32 weeks of open-label onabotulinumtoxinA (O/O, n = 607; P/O, n = 629), as detailed in the published patient flow diagram. Approximately 73% of patients who entered the study at baseline completed the 56-week study. Baseline demographics were similar between the two treatment groups. The mean patient age at baseline was 41 years, and the mean duration since chronic migraine onset was 19 years. The majority (> 85%) of patients were women, and over 60% were using prestudy prophylactic medications for migraine and/or were classified as overusing acute headache medications. Patient-recorded HIT-6 and MSQ data were available for 89% of patients at the end of the double-blind phase (week 24) and 81% at their final open-label phase visit.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of chronic migraine: PREEMPT 24-week pooled subgroup analysis of patients who had acute headache medication overuse at baseline [^117ULDez]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Acute headache medication overuse (MO) is common in patients with chronic migraine (CM). This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA as a preventive treatment for headaches in CM patients with baseline MO (CM+MO), through a planned secondary analysis from two similarly designed, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, Phase III trials. Patients were randomized into treatment groups (155–195 U of onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo) using MO (patient-reported and diary-captured frequency of intake) as a stratifying variable.

Of 1,384 patients, 65.3% (n = 904) met MO criteria (onabotulinumtoxinA: n = 445, placebo: n = 459). For the CM+MO subgroup at Week 24, statistically significant between-treatment group mean changes from baseline favoring onabotulinumtoxinA versus placebo were observed for headache days (primary endpoint: -8.2 vs. -6.2; p < 0.001) and other secondary endpoints: frequencies of migraine days (p < 0.001), moderate/severe headache days (p < 0.001), cumulative headache hours on headache days (p < 0.001), headache episodes (p = 0.028), migraine episodes (p = 0.018), and the percentage of patients with severe Headache Impact Test-6 category (p < 0.001).

At Week 24, the change from baseline in the frequency of acute headache medication intakes (secondary endpoint) was not statistically significant (p = 0.210) between groups, except for triptan intakes (p < 0.001), where the onabotulinumtoxinA-treated group was favored. OnabotulinumtoxinA was effective and well tolerated as a headache prophylaxis in CM+MO patients.

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^1129y5v7]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

This meta-analysis of onabotulinumtoxinA, in the context of clinical practice that reflects the heterogeneity of populations treated with onabotulinumtoxinA for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine, broadly corroborates with the efficacy that has been observed in the pivotal RCTs and long-term, open-label studies of onabotulinumtoxinA. Ongoing research collecting real-world data on onabotulinumtoxinA and the newer treatments for chronic migraine will provide further insights into the effectiveness of chronic migraine preventive treatments in clinically generalisable patient populations.

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^112KWimH]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

OnabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) is an intramuscularly injected acetylcholine release inhibitor and neuromuscular blocking agent that was the first prophylactic treatment specifically indicated for chronic migraine. OnabotulinumtoxinA was approved in 2010 by the FDA and by some national medicines agencies in Europe. Since its approval for chronic migraine, the effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA has been documented through a substantial body of real-world evidence collected from open-label prospective studies, such as FORWARD and COMPEL, in addition to observational studies of treatment effectiveness. This real-world evidence (RWE) complements the gold-standard evidence from the onabotulinumtoxinA Phase 3 Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT 1 [NCT00156910] and PREEMPT 2 [NCT00168428]) pivotal randomized controlled trial (RCT) program in the chronic migraine population.

RWE is of increasing interest for both initial and ongoing regulatory and payer assessments in healthcare markets worldwide, and such evidence on onabotulinumtoxinA effectiveness and safety representative of real-world practice is crucial for optimizing chronic migraine treatment pathways. This is important given the heterogeneity of the patient population (not reflected in RCTs) and the complexity of patient management in the real world. Hence, with ten years of experience using onabotulinumtoxinA since its licensing for chronic migraine, it is essential to systematically identify and evaluate observational data regarding its real-world effectiveness in reducing headache symptoms and frequency.

### Response to botulinumtoxinA in a migraine cohort with multiple comorbidities and widespread pain [^113TGjYm]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The phase III research evaluating migraine prophylaxis therapy (PREEMPT) protocol was developed in low-risk migraine patients. We studied longitudinal response to treatment in a sequential retrospective observational cohort to evaluate predictors of effectiveness in patients with multiple overlapping pain syndromes treated in a quaternary pain management clinic.

- **Methods**: We evaluated indicators of individual response in 402 consecutive chronic migraine patients who provided demographic information and used the Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry.

- **Results**: The patients were middle-aged, with a median age of 47 years (interquartile range, 38–56), and 83% were women. They reported multiple complex pain problems with 11 (6–18) regions represented on a pain body map. Evaluated with National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures, they reported higher scores for sleep impairment and disturbance, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain behavior, and pain interference, and worse function and satisfaction with social roles compared with the general US population; p < 0.001 for all domains. Within 120 days of treatment, 62% of patients reported reduced headache frequency. The best multivariable model developed for prediction of reduced headache frequency in response to treatment included lower treatment number, lower pain interference score, and less depression (p = 0.001, 0.002, and 0.009). Depression may have been an obstacle to successful treatment; there was no association between depression score and number of treatments (p = 0.54).

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that patients with multiple comorbidities and widespread pain can respond to botulinumtoxinA treatment, with predictors of effectiveness being lower treatment number, lower pain interference score, and less depression.

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^11343zry]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

Research analysts with a master's degree in pharmacy qualifications conducted the study selection, initially reviewing the abstracts and titles of each citation and identifying a list of potentially relevant studies following a screening flowchart. Only those studies that met all predefined criteria for inclusion were considered for final extraction, while excluded citations were coded to justify the reasons for exclusion. The lists obtained from the two reviewers were combined, and a third reviewer (EO) resolved any discrepancies. Any article that could not be clearly excluded based on the abstract was progressed for full-text review.

Full-text versions of relevant studies were examined in more detail to determine a final list of included studies based on the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS); a score of 4 (out of a maximum of 9) was the minimum cut-off point we applied for the inclusion of full journal publications only. Assessment criteria varied according to study type, including cohort studies or case–control studies. For meta-analysis, we specifically selected studies of patients with chronic migraine.

### Pooled analysis of the safety and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of chronic migraine [^115Ljz3w]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Although not specifically indicated for chronic migraine (CM), other currently prescribed treatments can have significant treatment-limiting, systemic adverse events (AEs). Antiepileptics are associated with systemic AEs including gastrointestinal problems, somnolence, difficulty with concentration/attention, nervousness, alopecia, tremor, liver toxicity, and paresthesia. Beta-blockers are associated with depression, fatigue, dizziness, sexual dysfunction, and sleep disturbances.

In the only other large double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) study in CM (n = 328), which compared topiramate with placebo for CM, AEs were reported by the majority of patients in both treatment groups (82.5% topiramate vs. 70.2% placebo). The most common AEs associated with topiramate were paresthesia (28.8% vs. 7.5% placebo), upper respiratory tract infection (13.8% vs. 12.5% placebo), and fatigue (11.9% vs. 9.9% placebo). Additional AEs occurring in more than 5% of the topiramate-treated patients were hypoesthesia, dry mouth, difficulty with concentration or memory, taste perversion, nausea, and somnolence.

In a small pilot study of CM prophylaxis (n = 60) comparing onabotulinumtoxinA (two intramuscular injections of 100–200 U every 12 weeks) and topiramate (100–200 mg/day), efficacy results were comparable. However, fewer treatment-related AEs were reported with onabotulinumtoxinA (69.2%) than with topiramate (86.2%). A greater percentage of topiramate-treated than onabotulinumtoxinA-treated patients (24.1% vs. 7.7%, respectively) discontinued the study due to treatment-related AEs.

Side-effect profiles may vary amongst different botulinum neurotoxin preparations. Safety information.

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^114KGtiP]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis indicates that outcomes for onabotulinumtoxinA in the real world, measured at approximately 24 weeks and 52 weeks, are broadly comparable to the outcomes observed in the PREEMPT pivotal studies of onabotulinumtoxinA. For example, the n = 347 adults randomized to onabotulinumtoxinA every 12 weeks for two cycles in PREEMPT 2 experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements on the primary endpoint, mean change from baseline (CFB) on the number of headache days per month (-9.0 onabotulinumtoxinA vs. -6.7 placebo, p < 0.001). Our meta-analytic results showed a comparable magnitude of treatment effect for onabotulinumtoxinA on this measure at approximately 24 weeks (-10.64 [CI: -12.31, -8.97]) and approximately 52 weeks (-10.32 [CI: -14.92, -5.73]).

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^116WaAWj]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

This meta-analysis evaluated the real-world effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®), the first preventive treatment FDA-approved specifically for chronic migraine in 2010.

- **Methods**: We systematically reviewed onabotulinumtoxinA observational data in chronic migraine published between 1 January 2010 and 31 March 2021. Random-effects models evaluated available data for primary and secondary endpoints defined in onabotulinumtoxinA pivotal trials at approximately 24 weeks and 52 weeks.

- **Results**: Of the 44 full-text eligible studies (29 prospective; 13 retrospective; 2 other), seven evaluated change from baseline (mean [confidence interval]) at ∼24 weeks and ∼52 weeks, respectively, for onabotulinumtoxinA in: number of headache days/month: (–10.64 [–12.31, –8.97]; –10.32 [−14.92, –5.73]); number of days of acute headache pain medication intake per month (–7.40 [–13.04, –1.77]; overlapping CIs at 52 weeks); total Headache Impact Test-6 score (–11.70 [–13.86, –9.54]; –11.80 [–14.70, –8.90]); and Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life v2.1 score (MSQ; 23.60 [CI: 21.56, 25.64]; 30.90 [CI: 28.29, 33.51]). At ∼24 weeks, onabotulinumtoxinA showed a total Migraine Disability Assessment score of 44.74 [28.50, 60.99] and ≥ 50% reduction in migraine days response rate of 46.57% [29.50%, 63.65%]. A sensitivity analysis at study-end suggested the durability of onabotulinumtoxinA effectiveness on MSQ.

- **Conclusion**: The meta-analysis reflecting real-world practice broadly corroborated with evidence from pivotal and long-term open-label studies of onabotulinumtoxinA in chronic migraine prevention.

### Bont-A efficacy in high frequency migraine: an open label, single arm, exploratory study applying the PREEMPT paradigm [^112zsJLo]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

In this open label, single-arm trial, we evaluated the efficacy of onabotulinum toxin-A in the prevention of high-frequency episodic migraine (8–14 migraine days/month).

- **Methods**: We enrolled 32 high-frequency episodic migraine subjects (age 44.8 ± 11.9 years, 11.0 ± 2.2 migraine days, 11.5 ± 2.1 headache days, 7 females). After a 28-day baseline period, subjects underwent 4 subsequent onabotulinum toxin-A treatments according to the phase III research evaluating migraine prophylaxis therapy (PREEMPT) paradigm, 12 weeks apart. The primary outcome was the reduction of monthly migraine days from baseline in the 12-week period following the last onabotulinum toxin-A treatment.

- **Results**: Onabotulinum toxin-A reduced monthly migraine days by 3.68 days (-33.1%, p < 0.01). Thirty-nine percent of the patients experienced a ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine days. Onabotulinum toxin-A also reduced the number of headache days (-33.9%, p < 0.01) and the intake of acute medications (-22.9%, p = 0.03). Disability and quality of life (QoL) scores improved markedly: migraine disability assessment (MIDAS) -41.7%; migraine-specific questionnaire (MSQ) -31.7%, p < 0.01.

- **Conclusions**: The findings suggest that, when administered according to the PREEMPT paradigm, onabotulinum toxin-A is effective in the prevention of high-frequency episodic migraine.

### Migraine headache prophylaxis [^11246K1g]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Migraine headaches are a debilitating condition that affects approximately 1% of the US population. The goals of migraine prophylaxis include the reduction in headache severity and frequency, improved response to acute treatment, fewer days with disability, improvement in quality of life, and the empowerment of patients with a sense of control over the condition. Indications for considering preventive therapy include frequent headaches, failure of or contraindication to acute treatments, overuse of acute treatments, and patient preferences.

First-line medications include propranolol, metoprolol, topiramate, divalproex, valproate, and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists; however, the use of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists is limited by cost and insurance coverage. Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are considered second-line medications due to a greater number of adverse events and less supporting evidence, respectively. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injection is approved for chronic migraine prophylaxis. It is as effective as other medications, is well tolerated, and has lower discontinuation rates than other drugs.

Common migraine triggers include alcohol, anxiety, dehydration, excessive caffeine, eye strain, hunger, sleep deprivation, and stress. Physicians should recommend the identification and management of migraine triggers. Cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, neural stimulators, and exercise are supported by varying levels of evidence and can be used individually or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Alternative agents, including feverfew, magnesium, and others, may also be considered based on individual patient needs and responses.

### Effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A meta-analysis on 10 years of real-world data [^1145MtP5]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

The patient-reported outcomes in PREEMPT included functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), as measured through change from baseline (CFB) in total Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) and Migraine-Specific Quality of Life v2.1 (MSQ) scores. HIT-6 evaluates the impact of headache on patient general well-being and daily activity, with scores ranging from 36 (no impact) to 78 (maximum impact); a score of ≥ 60 is considered a major impact on general well-being and daily activity. The MSQ 14-item questionnaire measures the impact of migraine on the respondent's physical and emotional functioning based on three domains: role-function restrictive (limitations to daily social and work-related activities), role-function preventive (how migraine prevents these activities), and emotional function (migraine-associated emotional functioning). All item scores are reverse-coded, and both MSQ domain and total score (evaluated in the present meta-analysis) are scaled 0–100, with a higher score indicating better migraine-related quality of life.

### Botox [^112oJwzc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Distant spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of Botox and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection, producing symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These symptoms include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported from hours to weeks after injection. The risk is notably high in children treated for spasticity but can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, especially those with underlying conditions predisposing them to these symptoms. Additionally, in both approved and unapproved uses, cases of spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to those used for treating cervical dystonia and spasticity, as well as at lower doses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Boxed warning**: Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening and there have been reports of death. It is crucial to consider the full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA effects on trigeminal nociceptors [^115v3BK6]. Cephalalgia (2023). Low credibility.

Multiple controlled and real-world studies have demonstrated the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in chronic migraine prevention; however, the classical mechanism of action (MoA) of onabotulinumtoxinA, involving the inhibition of acetylcholine from motor and autonomic neurons, cannot fully explain its effectiveness in preventing migraine attacks since it is considered a sensory neurological disease. OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment for migraine involves injections in the region of the trigeminal nerve, which has been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of migraine.

Indeed, a prior study demonstrated that peripheral injections of onabotulinumtoxinA produced functional changes, as evidenced by TRPV1-specific antinociception and decreased TRPV1 expression in dural neurons, which course through the trigeminal ganglion (TG). Similarly, peripheral injections of onabotulinumtoxinA in the region of the trigeminal nerve resulted in functional consequences on TRPV1 and TRPA1 when stimulated with their agonists, capsaicin and mustard oil, respectively.

Here, we extend these findings and provide evidence to show that onabotulinumtoxinA at a concentration comparable to clinical applications (50 U/mL; 2.75 pM) has direct effects on TG sensory neurons expressing TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors. It reduces the trafficking of TRP channels to the plasma membrane in a sensitized state seen in trigeminal pain, such as migraine, without concomitant changes in transcription. Additionally, it significantly inhibits their signaling and subsequent secretion of inflammatory mediators involved in migraine pain and pathophysiology.
