## Question

Severe gastritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage severe gastritis, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what constitutes "severe gastritis" in modern practice. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup, including endoscopic technique and histopathology. Next, I will consider etiologies, especially H. pylori and autoimmune gastritis, and the role of OLGA/OLGIM staging. After that, I need to outline management by etiology, including eradication, micronutrient replacement, and surveillance. Finally, I should review special populations, documentation, and a concise algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor prematurely: "severe gastritis" in contemporary practice generally corresponds to advanced atrophic gastritis with extensive loss of gastric glands and often intestinal metaplasia, typically staged as OLGA/OLGIM III–IV, which confers a higher risk of progression to gastric cancer and mandates surveillance considerations [^113EWNhf] [^111pAwnW].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before moving to treatment implications: diagnosis must be histopathologic, not endoscopic alone, and requires a standardized biopsy protocol mapping antrum, incisura, and corpus in separate jars to enable accurate staging and risk stratification. Endoscopic features such as pale mucosa, visible vessels, loss of folds, and light blue crests or white opaque fields suggest atrophy or metaplasia but must be confirmed histologically [^11363A1v] [^116h5TQ3] [^1174Nz8t].

> Hold on, I should verify the staging systems and their prognostic meaning: OLGA and OLGIM integrate severity and topography of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, with stages III–IV indicating advanced disease and a several-fold increase in gastric cancer risk. OLGIM has better interobserver agreement but may downstage some high-risk individuals, so I need to interpret results in clinical context and, when possible, correlate with endoscopic extent using high-quality imaging [^113EWNhf] [^111pAwnW] [^1122bfyn].

> I will now examine etiologies, starting with H. pylori, because missing this would be a major error: H. pylori is the leading cause of atrophic gastritis worldwide, and all patients with atrophic gastritis should be tested with a nonserologic modality and treated if positive, with eradication confirmed by a nonserologic test at least four weeks after therapy. Eradication reduces but does not eliminate cancer risk, especially in advanced atrophy, so surveillance remains important even after successful treatment [^114VgkT2] [^111WLsUd] [^1163Qnd8].

> Let me consider autoimmune gastritis next and double-check the serologic tools: autoimmune gastritis is corpus-predominant and associated with parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Pepsinogen I and the PG I:II ratio can support the diagnosis when available, but in the U.S. I should prioritize PCA and IFA while recognizing PCA's sensitivity and IFA's specificity. Importantly, AIG confers risk for type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors and may carry an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, so I need to maintain vigilance for NETs during surveillance [^114vhSmF] [^1138zmn2] [^113mQAK9].

> Next, I should review micronutrient deficiencies because they often precede overt anemia: iron deficiency is common in corpus-predominant atrophy and can present years before B12 deficiency, so I should routinely check ferritin, iron, and CBC, and also assess B12, methylmalonic acid, and gastrin. In newly diagnosed pernicious anemia, I should confirm corpus-predominant atrophy endoscopically and biopsy to exclude prevalent neoplasia, including NETs, before assuming a purely nutritional diagnosis [^114ZiGgB] [^113LbySV].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning surveillance with risk rather than applying a one-size-fits-all interval: for advanced atrophic gastritis or extensive intestinal metaplasia (OLGA/OLGIM III–IV), endoscopic surveillance every 3 years is recommended, with consideration of shorter 1–2 year intervals in the presence of additional risk factors such as family history, emigration from high-incidence regions, incomplete IM, or persistent H. pylori. For autoimmune gastritis, individualized 3–5 year surveillance is reasonable, with earlier endoscopy if symptoms or new lesions arise [^114mJ4Hv] [^112ENXGT] [^114cib5D].

> But wait, what if the patient has only mild, antrum-limited changes? I should confirm that routine surveillance is not advised in low-risk disease: guidelines recommend against surveillance for mild atrophy or limited IM confined to the antrum, so I should document low-risk status clearly and focus on H. pylori management and risk-factor modification rather than scheduled repeat endoscopy in those cases [^114mJ4Hv] [^116iiVk5].

> Let me think about H. pylori treatment specifics and test-of-cure so I don't gloss over implementation: first-line therapy should be chosen based on local resistance patterns, with bismuth or non-bismuth quadruple regimens favored where clarithromycin resistance exceeds 15%, and sequential or concomitant therapy as alternatives. I should confirm eradication with urea breath test or stool antigen at least four weeks after antibiotics and off PPI for 2–4 weeks to avoid false negatives, and if eradication fails, I should pursue susceptibility-guided salvage or validated alternative regimens [^112MmZKR] [^116v4nbG] [^111aHpRy].

> I should double-check the role of acid suppression in atrophic gastritis because it's easy to overprescribe PPIs: PPIs do not reverse atrophy or metaplasia and are not indicated solely for atrophic gastritis. They may be used for symptomatic relief or when there is a separate indication such as GERD or peptic ulcer disease, but long-term PPIs should be de-prescribed when no clear indication persists, balancing risks and benefits in shared decision-making [^113G8iEQ] [^111niNyf].

> Next, I should review autoimmune gastritis–specific management so I don't miss NET surveillance: all patients with AIG should be screened for H. pylori and treated if positive, monitored for iron and B12 deficiencies with replacement as needed, and surveilled for type 1 gastric NETs. Small NETs under 1 cm can be removed endoscopically with subsequent surveillance every 1–2 years, while larger or invasive lesions may require EUS staging and surgical resection depending on depth and nodal status [^1138zmn2] [^11581Cis] [^112ddiyr].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and risk modifiers so counseling is accurate: individuals from East Asian, Latin American, or other high-incidence regions, those with first-degree family history of gastric cancer, and certain racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. have higher baseline risk and may reasonably choose surveillance at 3-year intervals when other high-risk features are present. Conversely, low-risk individuals with mild disease should avoid unnecessary surveillance, and all decisions should be individualized via shared decision-making [^11128hK5] [^112F7ue2] [^116iiVk5].

> I need to ensure documentation and communication are standardized because inconsistent reporting undermines care: endoscopists and pathologists should coordinate to record H. pylori status, severity and extent of atrophy/IM, histologic subtype of IM if applicable, and OLGA/OLGIM stage when feasible, as this informs surveillance and longitudinal risk assessment and is emphasized in recent U.S. guidance for high-risk populations [^111Qikph] [^115Ttbba].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm severe atrophic gastritis histologically with proper biopsy mapping, stage with OLGA/OLGIM, test and eradicate H. pylori with nonserologic confirmation, evaluate and replace iron/B12, screen for AIG with appropriate serology when suspected, and institute risk-adapted surveillance at 3-year intervals for advanced disease or 3–5 years for AIG, with shorter intervals for high-risk features. Avoid surveillance in low-risk mild disease and tailor decisions to patient preferences and comorbidities [^11363A1v] [^114VgkT2] [^112ENXGT].

> Finally, I should confirm that I've addressed the key evidence gaps and uncertainties so expectations are realistic: optimal surveillance intervals after H. pylori eradication and in AIG are not fully defined, and ongoing studies may refine risk stratification. Until then, I should apply current guideline-concordant intervals, emphasize eradication and micronutrient management, and engage patients in shared decisions about the frequency and goals of endoscopic follow-up [^112ENXGT] [^112cNTXQ].

Severe gastritis is a critical **precancerous condition** [^116UsdAN] with a **significant cancer risk** [^113mQAK9], especially when atrophy and intestinal metaplasia are extensive [^113EWNhf]. Management centers on **confirming the diagnosis with high-quality endoscopy and histology** [^11363A1v], **eradicating H. pylori** with confirmation of cure [^114VgkT2], and **risk-stratified surveillance** every 3 years for advanced atrophy/IM [^114mJ4Hv] [^1116SsH6]. Autoimmune gastritis requires B12/iron monitoring and periodic endoscopy for NETs [^114ZiGgB] [^1138zmn2]. Symptom control with PPIs is appropriate, but long-term acid suppression may worsen atrophy and should be individualized [^113G8iEQ] [^111niNyf]. Patient education on cancer risk, symptom triggers, and adherence is essential to outcomes [^115EKsz9].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Severe gastritis may be **asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms** [^115vZGKK]; when symptomatic, features include:

- **Epigastric pain**: Persistent, often meal-related [^notfound].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Frequent, sometimes with blood.
- **Early satiety and bloating**: From mucosal damage and atrophy [^notfound].
- **Weight loss**: Unintentional, concerning for malignancy [^notfound].
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Melena or hematemesis in severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and risk stratification require a **combination of endoscopic and histopathological assessment** [^1174Nz8t]:

---

### Endoscopic findings

- **Pale, flat mucosa**: Loss of normal rugae, visible vessels [^111ky3op].
- **Atrophic border**: Transition zone between normal and atrophic mucosa [^116h5TQ3].
- **Intestinal metaplasia**: Light blue crests, white opaque fields [^111ky3op].

---

### Histopathological assessment

Histopathology confirms atrophy and intestinal metaplasia; **OLGA/OLGIM staging** stratifies cancer risk [^113EWNhf] [^11363A1v]. Advanced stages (III/IV) carry a **significantly higher risk** of gastric cancer [^113EWNhf].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **H. pylori detection**: Urea breath test, stool antigen, or biopsy-based methods [^114Q49z7].
- **Autoimmune markers**: Antiparietal cell and anti–intrinsic factor antibodies for autoimmune gastritis [^114vhSmF].
- **Vitamin B12 and iron levels**: Evaluate for deficiencies [^114ZiGgB].

---

## Etiological factors

Severe gastritis arises from **multiple causes**, with **H. pylori** as the most common [^1118RoQV]:

| **Etiological factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Helicobacter pylori infection | Most common cause; chronic infection leads to atrophy and metaplasia [^1118RoQV] |
| Autoimmune gastritis | Immune-mediated atrophy of the corpus/fundus; associated with pernicious anemia [^115vZGKK] |
| NSAID use | Chronic use causing mucosal injury and atrophy [^notfound] |
| Alcohol and smoking | Chronic irritants promoting mucosal damage [^notfound] |

---

## Complications

Severe gastritis carries **significant complications**, notably:

- **Gastric cancer**: Increased risk, especially with extensive atrophy/IM [^113EWNhf].
- **Pernicious anemia**: B12 deficiency from autoimmune gastritis [^113LbySV].
- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Higher incidence with chronic inflammation [^notfound].
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: From mucosal erosion or ulceration [^113LCdCr].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**:

---

### Medical management

- **H. pylori eradication**: Test all patients; treat and confirm cure with nonserologic tests [^114VgkT2] [^116v4nbG].
- **Acid suppression**: PPIs/H2RAs for symptom control; long-term use may worsen atrophy, so individualize [^113G8iEQ] [^113bNiFp].
- **Micronutrient supplementation**: B12 and iron replacement as indicated [^114ZiGgB].

---

### Endoscopic surveillance

For endoscopic surveillance, **advanced atrophy/IM warrants surveillance every 3 years** [^114mJ4Hv] [^11128hK5]; autoimmune gastritis merits individualized 3–5 year intervals [^114cib5D] [^112ddiyr]. High-quality endoscopy with image enhancement and systematic biopsies is essential [^113KHFj4] [^116R6e7j].

---

### Surgical intervention

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** with severe complications or high cancer risk not amenable to endoscopic therapy.

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis varies with etiology, extent of atrophy/IM, and adherence. H. pylori eradication reduces cancer risk but **does not eliminate it**, especially in advanced disease [^1122bfyn]. Autoimmune gastritis is chronic and requires lifelong monitoring for deficiencies and NETs [^114ZiGgB] [^1118RoQV].

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

Patient education and lifestyle changes are integral to care. Emphasize adherence to therapy, eradication, and surveillance; avoid NSAIDs, alcohol, and smoking; and adopt a balanced diet with regular follow-up [^112cNTXQ].

---

Severe gastritis is a high-risk precancerous state requiring **accurate diagnosis, H. pylori eradication, risk-stratified surveillance, and individualized care** to reduce complications and improve outcomes [^1153G8bC].

### Helicobacter pylori infection: selected aspects in clinical management [^111tbNcu]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on new aspects of recently published guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection as well as progress in diagnostic tests and treatment regimens. We also discuss new strategies for gastric cancer prevention.

Recent Findings

The general recommendation to treat H. pylori infection whenever diagnosed still faces resistance for reasons that are pertinent to the diversity of related clinical outcomes and to the complexity of eradication regimens. Thus, new updated guidelines for the management of H. pylori infection have been released in several continents. Progress has been made in molecular diagnostic tests for the detection of antibiotic resistance and serological tests for the detection of advanced gastric atrophic changes. Effective quadruple therapies in various combinations of 'traditional drugs' have been introduced with sequential or concomitant order of administration. Moreover, traditional drugs in a new galenic formulation have been introduced to overcome increasing H. pylori antibiotic resistance. Effective strategies for gastric cancer prevention have been adopted in some countries with high gastric cancer incidence, and have successfully contributed to lower the gastric cancer incidence. A screen-and-treat strategy for individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer needs to be further explored also in areas with low/moderate incidence of gastric cancer.

Summary

New guidelines share many universal similarities across countries but respect and emphasize specific needs and requirements in individual communities. Various combinations of traditional drugs have been successfully introduced to overcome the increasing H. pylori antibiotic resistance. Gastric cancer prevention by a screen and treat strategy showed promising results.

### Current concepts in the management of Helicobacter pylori infection: the maastricht III consensus report [^114Q49z7]. Gut (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the management of Helicobacter pylori, which cover indications for management and treatment strategies, were produced in 2000.

Aims

To update the guidelines at the European Helicobacter Study Group (EHSG) Third Maastricht Consensus Conference, with emphasis on the potential of H pylori eradication for the prevention of gastric cancer.

Results

Eradication of H pylori infection is recommended in (a) patients with gastroduodenal diseases such as peptic ulcer disease and low grade gastric, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma; (b) patients with atrophic gastritis; (c) first degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer; (d) patients with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia; and (e) patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Recurrent abdominal pain in children is not an indication for a "test and treat" strategy if other causes are excluded. Eradication of H pylori infection (a) does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) or exacerbate GORD, and (b) may prevent peptic ulcer in patients who are naïve users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). H pylori eradication is less effective than proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment in preventing ulcer recurrence in long term NSAID users. In primary care a test and treat strategy using a non-invasive test is recommended in adult patients with persistent dyspepsia under the age of 45. The urea breath test, stool antigen tests, and serological kits with a high accuracy are non-invasive tests which should be used for the diagnosis of H pylori infection. Triple therapy using a PPI with clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole given twice daily remains the recommended first choice treatment. Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, if available, is also a first choice treatment option. Rescue treatment should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility.

Conclusion

The global burden of gastric cancer is considerable but varies geographically. Eradication of H pylori infection has the potential to reduce the risk of gastric cancer development.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric Helicobacter pylori — initial diagnostic approach and role of noninvasive tests: We recommend that the diagnosis of H pylori infection should be based on either: positive culture or H pylori gastritis on histopathology with at least 1 other positive biopsy-based test (GRADE: Strong recommendation. Quality of evidence: high. Agreement: 100%). It is recommended that the initial diagnosis of H pylori infection be performed using invasive gastric biopsy-based methods including the following: positive bacterial culture OR H pylori gastritis on histopathology using the updated Sydney classification with at least 1 other positive test such as RUT (rapid urease test), or molecular-based assays where available, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or fluorescent in situ hybridization. The initial diagnosis of H pylori infection should not be based on noninvasive tests (e.g., 13C-UBT H pylori stool antigen test) or other noninvasive methods, and a positive noninvasive test supports the diagnosis in cases in which positive histology is the only invasive test available; none of the available diagnostic tests have 100% accuracy; Bacterial culture is, however, 100% specific.

Practice points — post-treatment assessment in pediatric Helicobacter pylori: The relief of symptoms is not an indicator for successful treatment; therefore, all children treated for H pylori should be assessed for treatment success with a reliable test. Endoscopy and biopsy-based tests to confirm eradication are rarely needed in pediatric patients with uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease, and gastric and duodenal peptic ulcers have a low risk for relapse with clearance of the infection.

Helicobacter pylori testing during evaluation for other gastrointestinal diseases in children — conditional recommendations are as follows: We suggest that when investigating other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), specific diagnostic biopsies for H. pylori infection are not indicated (New GRADE: conditional recommendation; Quality of evidence: very low to low; Agreement: 100%). We suggest that if H. pylori is an incidental finding during endoscopy performed for other GI diseases (IBD, celiac disease, EoE), treatment may be considered after discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient/family (New GRADE: conditional recommendation; Quality of evidence: low; Agreement: 100%). H. pylori-associated gastritis may be an incidental histopathologic finding during upper endoscopy for other GI diseases such as IBD, celiac disease, or EoE, especially in areas with a high prevalence of infection.

### Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young adults: report of a working group of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the Crohn's and colitis foundation of America [^113LQSU8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Indeterminate colitis (IC) — classification and documentation in pediatric colitis is outlined as follows: We suggest that clinicians try to avoid overuse of the IC diagnosis. Physicians should be aware that backwash ileitis, rectal sparing, histological patchiness, periappendiceal inflammation, and gastritis all can be seen in children with UC at the time of diagnosis, and medical therapy of UC before biopsy or resection can also result in attenuation of inflammation, resulting in less severe histological inflammation, focal disease, or even normal biopsies. A patient may be given a putative diagnosis of IC if he or she has IBD limited to the colon, and clinical features that are inconsistent with the diagnosis of UC; if the clinician decides to classify a patient as having IC, then it is suggested the physician clearly state in the medical record the precise piece of clinical data that prompted the use of the IC diagnosis, and at some point after diagnosis, patients may benefit from additional endoscopic and radiographic evaluation to determine whether the finding has changed or resolved and to attempt to establish a definitive diagnosis of CD or UC. Features that suggest IC in patients with colitis include colitis with an endoscopically and histologically normal rectum (absolute rectal sparing), mild ileitis with features atypical for backwash (eg, ileal aphthae), microscopic ileitis seen in a patient with colitis limited to left colon, severe focal gastritis, pancolitis with anal fissures or anal tags, and colitis with growth failure.

### Autoimmune gastritis: diagnosis, clinical management and natural history. A position paper by the autoimmune gastRitis Italian netwOrk study grOup (ARIOSO) [^111tU5vj]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune atrophic gastritis (AAG) is a non-self-limiting immune-mediated disorder exerting growing interest. The main autoantigen, the beta subunit of the proton pump (H+, K+-ATPase), is localised on the oxyntic mucosa parietal cells, limiting the autoimmune inflammatory damage to this stomach compartment. Clinical manifestations of AAG may occur late, once corpus-fundus atrophy occurs, and are characterised by loss of gastric acidity, impaired iron and/or cobalamin malabsorption, and increased risk of gastric type 1 neuroendocrine neoplasms and possibly gastric adenocarcinoma. Many topics regarding epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management remain to be clarified. AAG patients are frequently misdiagnosed or diagnosed with delay. AAG still represents a clinical challenge and a great opportunity for advancing our knowledge on gastrointestinal autoimmune diseases and gastric precancerous conditions. The timely and correct diagnosis of AAG patients is clinically relevant to avoid potentially harmful consequences due to micronutrient deficiencies and related anaemia and neoplastic complications. The current position paper addresses AAG in adults and reflects the views of the Autoimmune gastRitis Italian netwOrk Study grOup (ARIOSO) on its epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Improving the understanding of AAG would facilitate timely and accurate diagnosis, enhance clinical management and patients' quality of life, and reduce the economic and social burden of this underrecognized condition.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori [^1164LnDP]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroenterologists and many general internists and primary care physicians confront questions regarding the management of Helicobacter pylori on a daily basis. The subject remains of global interest and continue to generate debate and research. Using the search terms 'pylori and treatment' or 'pylori and management' we identified over 1000 relevant articles in PubMed published over the time period 1 January 2019 to 30 April 2020. We have selected the most highly clinically relevant of these to review here.

Recent Findings

Clinical evidence grows regarding the benefits of H. pylori eradication on gastric cancer prevention. High rates of resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, correlating with treatment failure in regimens utilizing these drugs, has stimulated interest in alternative regimens as well as the need for susceptibility testing of individual patients and populations. Although many aspects of H. pylori management are well established, implementation of appropriate testing and treatment pathways remains suboptimal throughout healthcare settings.

Summary

Increased emphasis on measuring H. pylori-related clinical outcomes in practice is needed to identify implementation gaps, and to suggest means to best apply the knowledge gained on H. pylori for the prevention of gastric symptoms and disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^114Qefuk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) epidemiology and malignancy risk: AIG is a progressive condition without cure or evidence of regression over time (185) and has a female:male predominance of approximately 3:1, with associations with older age and autoimmune disorders. Based on recent data, in the absence of H. pylori infection, the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma in patients with AIG seems to be similar to that of the baseline general population, although in one study of corpus-restricted atrophy the annual incidence rate person-year of HGD/GC was 0.59. These findings underscore the importance of testing for H. pylori in any patient with metaplastic or nonmetaplastic AG.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^11581Cis]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) 2015 — surveillance and carcinoid management: ASGE suggests surveillance endoscopy for patients with GIM who are at increased risk of gastric cancer due to ethnic background or family history, noting that optimal surveillance intervals have not been extensively studied and should be individualized (quality of evidence: low; grade of recommendation: not provided). ASGE suggests endoscopy within 6 mo of the diagnosis of pernicious anemia or the development of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with PA (quality of evidence: low; grade of recommendation: not provided). ASGE recommends endoscopic ultrasound for local staging of gastric carcinoids (quality of evidence: moderate; grade of recommendation: not provided). ASGE suggests endoscopic resection of small (< 1 cm) type 1 and type 2 gastric carcinoids that do not demonstrate aggressive features and endoscopic surveillance thereafter every 1–2 y (quality of evidence: low; grade of recommendation: not provided).

### Autoimmune gastritis [^115vZGKK]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Autoimmune gastritis (AG) is a corpus-restricted chronic atrophic gastritis associated with intrinsic factor deficiency, either with or without pernicious anemia. Autoimmune gastritis is a microscopic disease because patients present with no or vague symptoms, and clinicians rarely find endoscopic changes. Autoimmune gastritis only becomes a clinical disease when pathologists diagnose it in gastric biopsies performed for a variety of clinical indications. Unfamiliarity with this disease can result in misdiagnosis of patients, and thus inadequate patient management.

Objective —

To review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, sequelae, and surveillance recommendations for AG.

Data Sources —

The sources of the study include a review of the pertinent literature for AG.

Conclusions —

Autoimmune gastritis is an important disease characterized by a loss of oxyntic mucosa and presence of metaplastic epithelium and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. Awareness and proper diagnosis are critical to prevent mismanagement of patients.

### Updated joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for management of Helicobacter pylori infection in children and adolescents (2023) [^1122Uyuf]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric Helicobacter pylori — diagnostic aims and testing indications: We recommend that the primary goal of clinical investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms should be to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and not solely the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori, we recommend that testing for H. pylori be performed in children with gastric or duodenal ulcers and/or erosions and, if infection is identified, treatment should be administered and eradication confirmed, we recommend that diagnostic testing (invasive or noninvasive) for H. pylori infection in children with functional abdominal pain, a DGBI, is not indicated, we suggest that when investigating other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), specific diagnostic biopsies for H. pylori infection are not indicated, and we suggest that if H. pylori is an incidental finding during endoscopy for other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, treatment may be considered after discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient/family.

### Diagnosis and management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113LCdCr]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States, and has been associated with increasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. Rapid assessment and resuscitation should precede the diagnostic evaluation in unstable patients with severe bleeding. Risk stratification is based on clinical assessment and endoscopic findings. Early upper endoscopy (within 24 hours of presentation) is recommended in most patients because it confirms the diagnosis and allows for targeted endoscopic treatment, including epinephrine injection, thermocoagulation, application of clips, and banding. Endoscopic therapy results in reduced morbidity, hospital stays, risk of recurrent bleeding, and need for surgery. Although administration of proton pump inhibitors does not decrease mortality, risk of rebleeding, or need for surgery, it reduces stigmata of recent hemorrhage and the need for endoscopic therapy. Despite successful endoscopic therapy, rebleeding can occur in 10 to 20 percent of patients; a second attempt at endoscopic therapy is recommended in these patients. Arteriography with embolization or surgery may be needed if there is persistent and severe bleeding.

### Clinical symptoms of chronic gastritis… [^116uPD3R]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Since the demonstration by gastroscopy of the frequent occurrence of chronic gastritis, 1 gastroscopists have often stated that this disease does not show a definite symptom complex. 2 Advanced gastric cancer and chronic round ulcer of the stomach may exist with mild or no subjective complaints, yet it is rare for chronic disease to exist anywhere in the body without being accompanied with some symptoms which aid the physician in his diagnostic attack on the organ involved. In the cases of mildest cystitis some tenesmus or urinary frequency points to possible disease of the bladder, just as diarrhea points to possible disease of the bowel. It would be a rare anomaly if the stomach remained free from all symptoms referable to it in advanced chronic inflammation of its walls. With the idea of emphasizing a syndrome or at least of indicating symptoms most frequently present in chronic gastritis, we selected. SCHINDLER R, ORTMAYER M, RENSHAW JF.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^114vhSmF]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) serologic evaluation — In patients with histology compatible with AIG, providers should check parietal cell antibodies (PCAs) and intrinsic factor antibodies (IFA) to assist with the diagnosis, noting that PG I levels (< 70 μg/L) and a low PG I:II ratio (< 3.0) demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity for severe corpus atrophy; PG testing is not available for routine clinical use in the United States, PCA is the most sensitive serum biomarker but may yield false positives, and IFA has low sensitivity (< 30% in many studies) but high specificity.

Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) screening and eradication in individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer (GC) should emphasize opportunistic testing rather than universal screening, and all adults diagnosed with infection warrant eradication with confirmation at least 4 weeks after therapy; screening adult household members should also be considered. A meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (9 from China, 2 from Turkey, 1 from England) showed whole-family test and treatment achieving a 3-fold higher eradication success (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.68–5.13) and a 70% lower recurrence rate (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19–0.48) than single-patient treatment. A non-US RCT with nearly 27 years of endoscopic follow-up suggests eradication results in a less than 63% reduction in GC risk without baseline moderate to severe atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia vs a 43% reduction overall, and the Taipei Global Consensus suggests screening between ages 20 and 40 years; because eradication alone does not suffice as a stand-alone population prevention strategy, opportunistic screening and treatment should be considered an adjunct to endoscopic screening.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^117TkHTE]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Epidemiology of atrophic gastritis (AG) and autoimmune gastritis (AIG) shows that AG prevalence is estimated up to 15% in US populations, with a meta-analysis reporting a rate ratio of AG incidence with versus without Helicobacter pylori of 5.0 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–8.3) and very low AG incidence (< 1% annually) among H pylori–uninfected individuals; AIG is less common with prevalence estimated to approximate 0.5%–2%, increases with age and the presence of other autoimmune diseases, and up to one-third of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease have AIG with women having a higher prevalence; pernicious anemia (PA) is even rarer with an estimated prevalence of 0.15%–1%.

Management of Helicobacter pylori infection is evolving and in this 4th edition of the Maastricht consensus report aspects related to the clinical role of H pylori were looked at again in 2010. In the 4th Maastricht/Florence Consensus Conference 44 experts from 24 countries took active part and examined key clinical aspects in three subdivided workshops: (1) Indications and contraindications for diagnosis and treatment, focusing on dyspepsia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin use, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and extraintestinal manifestations of the infection. (2) Diagnostic tests and treatment of infection. (3) Prevention of gastric cancer and other complications. The results of the individual workshops were submitted to a final consensus voting to all participants. Recommendations are provided on the basis of the best current evidence and plausibility to guide doctors involved in the management of this infection associated with various clinical conditions.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^113EWNhf]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Atrophic gastritis (AG) risk stratification — OLGA and OLGIM staging is described as follows: The OLGA stage is determined by the combination of the histopathologic severity (score 0–3) of atrophic changes in each anatomic compartment (antrum/incisura and corpus), and stages III and IV in both OLGA and OLGIM systems are associated with a significantly higher risk of gastric cancer compared to stages 0–II. The OLGIM (not pictured) has similar prognostic value for gastric neoplasia as OLGA, with the distinct advantage of improved reproducibility and interobserver agreement, but with the disadvantage of downstaging some high-risk individuals. The Kimura-Takemoto classification demonstrates good correlation with the OLGA system in terms of its value in risk stratification, and a visual analogue scale of the Updated Sydney System for histopathologic severity grading of atrophic changes is shown.

### Helicobacter pylori diagnosis and management [^112MmZKR]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

H pylori is a global human pathogen and is the major cause of gastritis and the gastritis-associated diseases: gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric cancer, and primary gastric B-cell lymphoma (MALToma). Although several reliable diagnostic tests are widely available, the ideal regimen for treating the infection re-mains to be established. The current first-line or legacy triple therapy regimens fail in 20% to 40% of patients. Causes of treatment failure include antibiotic resistance, poor compliance, short (7–10 days) duration of therapy, and drug-related side effects. Fourteen-day triple therapy has an approximately 12% better cure rate than does 7-day therapy; therefore, shorter durations can no longer be recommended. Recent studies confirmed older observations that the success rate of legacy triple regimens (PPI plus two antibiotics) can be improved if the duration is extended to 14 days or if a third antibiotic is given. Sequential therapy (PPI plus amoxicillin followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin plus metronidazole) requires further evaluation although the concept appears very promising and therapy should probably replace the legacy triple therapies. More studies are needed to examine doses, durations, and the need for sequential administration of the drugs, which extends the duration to 14 days. Nonetheless, sequential quadruple therapy probably should replace the legacy triple therapies. Classic quadruple therapy contains bismuth, a PPI, 1500 mg of metronidazole, and 1500 mg of tetracycline. It provides the highest average eradication rates and in many regions should be considered as the initial approach. Confirmation of eradication using noninvasive diagnostic tests, such as a urea breath test or stool antigen assay, is now the standard of care. The diagnosis of latent or symptomatic H pylori like the diagnosis of latent or symptomatic syphilis, always should prompt treatment. Because of decreasing cure rates, new and improved therapies are needed.

Probably no term employed in the nomenclature of gastric diseases has been more misused than that of chronic gastritis. The disease has been and still is considered by some physicians a very common affection, yet Riegel says: "Chronic catarrh of the stomach is not a frequent disease. If we cease to force all known gastric disorders into a few disease categories, and rely only on positive signs of this condition, we shall soon learn that chronic gastritis is not so frequent as older physicians thought and as many modern ones still persist in believing". Stockton1 says that "the comparative infrequency of chronic gastritis will be endorsed by experience if the cases are carefully studied.

Table 6 — key changes in pediatric H pylori recommendations: Testing for H pylori during endoscopy should only be performed if intending to treat, and testing for H pylori is not recommended in the initial investigation of iron deficiency anemia. The guideline includes a weak recommendation to consider noninvasive testing for H pylori infection in the setting of chronic ITP and recommends against testing in the setting of short stature, with removal of recommendation for testing in the setting of family history of gastric cancer or MALT, as rarely encountered. For diagnosis, six gastric biopsies for either (a) histopathology (H pylori–positive gastritis) plus at least 1 other positive biopsy–based test or (b) positive culture. For treatment candidacy, if H pylori is an incidental finding at endoscopy treatment may be considered following careful discussion of the risks and benefits of H pylori treatment with the patient/parents, with a weak recommendation for patient with chronic ITP. For therapy parameters, duration of therapy 14 days, use a higher dose of PPI, particularly in younger children, with doses from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/ kg bodyweight and day, and include a recommendation that physician explain to the patient/ family the importance of adherence.

### Ulcers and gastritis [^114VDMWq]. Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

This article reviews recently published literature regarding ulcers and gastritis. Although endoscopy is the most useful procedure for diagnosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract, complications do occur, and procedure-related costs are significant. The appropriate indication for endoscopy has recently been debated. Helicobacter pylori is known to be an important pathogen involved in gastric and duodenal inflammation. Peptic ulcer disease and severe gastric mucosal injury are caused by virulent strains, and many reports have focused on CagA. Follow-up studies on surveillance endoscopy in patients with peptic ulcer or gastritis report that patients with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are at significantly higher risk for gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication sometimes causes gastroduodenal erosion and reflux esophagitis, and the mechanisms involved have been revealed. Proton-pump inhibitors are useful in the treatment of ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), reflux esophagitis, and for preventing rebleeding after endoscopic hemostasis, but the effect of long-term acid suppression on the gastric mucosa is still a matter of debate. H. pylori infection and NSAID intake are both risk factors for peptic ulcer disease, and are important aspects in this field.

### WITHDRAWN: initial management strategies for dyspepsia [^116UV7We]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

This review considers management strategies (combinations of initial investigation and empirical treatments) for dyspeptic patients. Dyspepsia was defined to include both epigastric pain and heartburn.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the following initial management strategies for patients presenting with dyspepsia (a) Initial pharmacological therapy (including endoscopy for treatment failures). (b) Early endoscopy. (c) Testing for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)and endoscope only those positive. (d) H. pylori eradication therapy with or without prior testing.

Search Strategy

Trials were located through electronic searches and extensive contact with trialists.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of dyspeptic patients presenting in primary care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and use of resources. An individual patient data meta-analysis of health economic data was conducted

Main Results

Twenty-five papers reporting 27 comparisons were found. Trials comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with antacids (three trials) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) (three trials), early endoscopy with initial acid suppression (five trials), H. pylori test and endoscope versus usual management (three trials), H. pylori test and treat versus endoscopy (six trials), and test and treat versus acid suppression alone in H. pylori positive patients (four trials), were pooled. PPIs were significantly more effective than both H2RAs and antacids. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were; for PPI compared with antacid 0.72 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.80), PPI compared with H2RA 0.63 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.85). Results for other drug comparisons were either absent or inconclusive. Initial endoscopy was associated with a small reduction in the risk of recurrent dyspeptic symptoms compared with H. pylori test and treat (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96), but was not cost effective (mean additional cost of endoscopy US$401 (95% CI $328 to 474). Test and treat may be more effective than acid suppression alone (RR 0.59 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83).

Authors' Conclusions

Proton pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in these trials which may not adequately exclude patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The relative efficacy of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and PPIs is uncertain. Early investigation by endoscopy or H. pylori testing may benefit some patients with dyspepsia but is not cost effective as part of an overall management strategy.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori infection: guidelines of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) and the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy (SIED) [^113nsKRc]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is very common and affects more than one-third of adults in Italy. Helicobacter pylori causes several gastro-duodenal diseases, such as gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric malignancy, and extra-gastric diseases. The eradication of the bacteria is becoming complex to achieve due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. To address clinical questions related to the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, three working groups examined the following topics: (1) non-invasive and invasive diagnostic tests, (2) first-line treatment, and (3) rescue therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection. Recommendations are based on the best available evidence to help physicians manage Helicobacter pylori infection in Italy, and have been endorsed by the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy.

Indications for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment — test-and-treat strategy and follow-up are outlined. Testing for, and treatment of, H. pylori infection should be viewed as dependent rather than independent actions, and therefore all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective treatment if confirmed to have active infection — and should subsequently undergo a test-of-cure after treatment. The "test-and-treat" approach for uninvestigated dyspepsia is reasonable in patients under the age of 60 years, without alarm features and without other indications for endoscopy. In patients with functional dyspepsia, eradication of H. pylori infection only provides modest benefit.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^1138zmn2]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Management of gastric neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in atrophic gastritis — Gastric NETs associated with AG represent approximately 80%–90% of all gastric NETs and are overwhelmingly categorized as type 1; they usually appear as small to tiny nodules < 10 mm, are often in the gastric corpus or fundus, and are well-differentiated with an indolent course. The rate of metastasis is < 10% in small gastric NETs ≤ 2 cm but approaches 20% in NETs > 2 cm. Small gastric NETs < 1 cm are generally amenable to endoscopic resection; providers should resect all small NETs < 1 cm endoscopically, and should consider surveillance endoscopy every 1–2 years depending on tumor burden. For gastric NETs > 1–2 cm, providers should consider endoscopic ultrasound to assess depth of invasion and local metastasis, and surgical resection is appropriate for NETs > 2 cm with invasion past the submucosa or with lymph node metastasis.

### Chronic superficial gastritis… [^112XbPpD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study of gastritis has received an added impetus with the introduction of the flexible gastroscope of Schindler. Doubt exists in the minds of many physicians as to what constitutes gastritis pathologically. Likewise the criteria for the gastroscopic diagnosis of this condition have been questioned. While clinical diagnosis of gastritis is possible, it is admittedly uncertain. It seems to us that the study of patients with a gastroscopic diagnosis of gastritis offers a logical basis of departure for the investigation of this condition. Like Benedict, 1 Borland, 2 Carey, 3 Schloss4 and others, we have accepted for purposes of discussion Schindler and Ortmayer's5 classification of chronic gastritis into the superficial, hypertrophic and atrophic types. The adoption of a uniform nomenclature should aid in the standardization of diagnostic criteria. The purpose of this investigation is to study the gastric function as judged by fractional gastric analysis and to record BANK J, RENSHAW JF.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on management of gastric intestinal metaplasia [^113bNiFp]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrophic gastritis:

- **Definition**: Atrophic gastritis is defined as a chronic inflammation leading to the loss of gastric glands, which can occur with or without metaplasia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of atrophic gastritis involves an immune response directed towards the parietal cells and intrinsic factor of the gastric body and fundus. This leads to hypochlorhydria, hypergastrinemia, and inadequate production of the intrinsic factor, which in turn results in the reduction of essential substances like hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of atrophic gastritis worldwide is estimated at 25%, and the risk is 2.4 times higher in H. pylori-positive individuals.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for atrophic gastritis include H. pylori infection, autoimmune disorders, and long-term use of PPIs. It is also frequently found in association with other autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and T1DM.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, atrophic gastritis can be asymptomatic or present with vague gastrointestinal symptoms. Complications such as pernicious anemia or gastric cancer can occur due to the condition's impact on the stomach's secretion of essential substances.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of atrophic gastritis is influenced by the extent and severity of gland loss and the underlying cause. It can progress to gastric cancer, especially in patients with advanced stages of gastritis.

### Chronic gastritis… [^112XSzFX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Gastroscopy with multiple biopsies shows that in severe chronic gastritis the mucosal pattern is distorted by irregular distribution of the gastric glands, increased numbers of mucus-secreting cells, and inflammatory infiltration of the stroma. The pattern of symptoms and failure to respond to antacids also distinguish chronic gastritis from the typical peptic ulcer. Ninety-two patients with chronic gastritis were treated with bed rest, sedatives, gastric suction, meals planned not to exceed the patient's critical volume, and a combination of aluminum hydroxide gel with oxethazaine hydrochloride, a topical anesthetic. While the severe forms of chronic gastritis were refractory to this treatment, the moderate and mild forms proved amenable, and the combination of antacid and anesthetic afforded relief from pain for periods up to six hours after each dose. Medication was continued for six days to 18 months without evidence of significant side-effects.

### Gastric endoscopy in the 21st century: appropriate use of an invasive procedure in the era of non-invasive testing [^11689WSF]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The acceptance of the premise that Helicobacter pylori infection is aetiologically related to gastric cancer and peptic ulcer and that the risk of gastric cancer among Helicobacter pylori infected individuals is related to the extent, severity and duration of atrophic gastritis has led to major changes in medical and endoscopic practices. The development of non-invasive methods to detect Helicobacter pylori and to estimate the extent and severity of gastritis has reduced the need for diagnostic endoscopy in asymptomatic individuals.

Methods and Results

Here we provide recommendations regarding deciding whether non-invasive and endoscopic assessment of the gastric mucosa is preferred. We also include specific recommendations and caveats regarding the preferred biopsy number and sites as well as the identification of specimens, to allow the pathologist to reliable stage the severity and extent of gastritis, and thus provide prognostic information needed for patient managements (e.g., whether endoscopic surveillance is recommended).

Conclusion

In summary, while there is clearly a role for gastric endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy in the Helicobacter pylori era, obtaining useful diagnostic and prognostic information is critically dependent upon attention to detail with regard to biopsy site and identification as to the location from where the specimen was taken.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — H pylori testing, surveillance, and pernicious anemia in atrophic gastritis: "All individuals with atrophic gastritis should be assessed for H pylori infection. If positive, treatment of H pylori should be administered and successful eradication should be confirmed using nonserological testing modalities". Regarding surveillance, "the optimal endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with atrophic gastritis is not well-defined and should be decided based on individual risk assessment and shared decision making", and "a surveillance endoscopy every 3 years should be considered in individuals with advanced atrophic gastritis, defined based on anatomic extent and histologic grade". For autoimmune gastritis, "the optimal surveillance interval… is unclear. Interval endoscopic surveillance should be considered based on individualized assessment and shared decision making". Providers should recognize that "pernicious anemia [is] a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B-12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia", and "patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors".

Atrophic gastritis and gastric intestinal metaplasia severity definitions — The severity of atrophic gastritis (AG) and gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) refers to the proportion of atrophy or GIM in individual biopsies in each compartment (antrum, incisura, and corpus). Intestinal metaplasia in up to one-third and two-thirds of glands can be regarded as mild and moderate, respectively, whereas greater than two-thirds is considered severe, and increased severity of AG/GIM is consistently associated with higher neoplastic risk, independent of anatomic extent. The Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment and Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia (OLGA/OLGIM) is a validated histologic scoring system that considers both the extent and severity (depth/histologic grade) of atrophy and GIM.

Management of coexisting conditions in atrophic gastritis — iron deficiency and autoimmune comorbidity guidance is provided. Iron deficiency is common "with some series reporting in up to 50% of patients with corpus-predominant AG", and it "often presents much earlier than the manifestation of B-12 deficiency". Accordingly, "Providers should therefore evaluate for iron and vitamin B-12 deficiency in patients with AG, especially if corpus-predominant; likewise, in patients with unexplained iron or vitamin B-12 deficiency, AG should be considered in the differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic evaluation pursued (BPA 11)". There is "an established association between AIG and other autoimmune diseases, especially autoimmune thyroid disease", and "Screening for autoimmune thyroid disease should be considered in patients diagnosed with AIG". Providers "should also have a low threshold to evaluate for other associated autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus and Addison's disease, if the clinical picture is consistent (BPA 12)". The conclusions emphasize that "Providers should recognize AG as an important, albeit frequently underdiagnosed, condition", and that "Patients with severe AG should be considered for endoscopic surveillance… and may require additional management considerations… particularly iron and vitamin B-12 deficiencies".

Description

The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis, a common preneoplastic condition of the stomach, with a primary focus on atrophic gastritis due to chronic Helicobacter pylori infection-the most common etiology-or due to autoimmunity. To date, clinical guidance for best practices related to the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis remains very limited in the United States, which leads to poor recognition of this preneoplastic condition and suboptimal risk stratification. In addition, there is heterogeneity in the definitions of atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and gastric neoplasia in the literature, which has led to confusion in clinical practice and research. Accordingly, the primary objective of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide clinicians with a framework for the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. By focusing on atrophic gastritis, this Clinical Practice Update is intended to complement the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association Institute guidelines on the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia. These recent guidelines did not specifically discuss the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. Providers should recognize, however, that a diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histopathology implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis because intestinal metaplasia occurs in underlying atrophic mucosa, although this is often not distinctly noted on histopathologic reports. Nevertheless, atrophic gastritis represents an important stage with distinct histopathologic alterations in the multistep cascade of gastric cancer pathogenesis.

Methods

The Best Practice Advice statements presented herein were developed from a combination of available evidence from published literature and consensus-based expert opinion. No formal rating of the strength or quality of the evidence was carried out. These statements are meant to provide practical advice to clinicians practicing in the United States. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Atrophic gastritis is defined as the loss of gastric glands, with or without metaplasia, in the setting of chronic inflammation mainly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity. Regardless of the etiology, the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by histopathology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Providers should be aware that the presence of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. There should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, particularly if marked atrophy is present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Providers should recognize typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields. Because these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: When endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis are present, providers should assess the extent endoscopically. Providers should obtain biopsies from the suspected atrophic/metaplastic areas for histopathological confirmation and risk stratification; at a minimum, biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura should be obtained and placed in separately labeled jars. Targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In patients with histology compatible with autoimmune gastritis, providers should consider checking antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies to assist with the diagnosis. Providers should also evaluate for anemia due to vitamin B-12 and iron deficiencies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All individuals with atrophic gastritis should be assessed for H pylori infection. If positive, treatment of H pylori should be administered and successful eradication should be confirmed using nonserological testing modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The optimal endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with atrophic gastritis is not well-defined and should be decided based on individual risk assessment and shared decision making. A surveillance endoscopy every 3 years should be considered in individuals with advanced atrophic gastritis, defined based on anatomic extent and histologic grade. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The optimal surveillance interval for individuals with autoimmune gastritis is unclear. Interval endoscopic surveillance should be considered based on individualized assessment and shared decision making. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Providers should recognize pernicious anemia as a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B-12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia. Patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Individuals with autoimmune gastritis should be screened for type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors with upper endoscopy. Small neuroendocrine tumors should be removed endoscopically, followed by surveillance endoscopy every 1–2 years, depending on the burden of neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Providers should evaluate for iron and vitamin B-12 deficiencies in patients with atrophic gastritis irrespective of etiology, especially if corpus-predominant. Likewise, in patients with unexplained iron or vitamin B-12 deficiency, atrophic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic evaluation pursued. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with autoimmune gastritis, providers should recognize that concomitant autoimmune disorders, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, are common. Screening for autoimmune thyroid disease should be performed.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^1153G8bC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC) include atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and certain gastric epithelial polyps and have an increased risk of progression to gastric adenocarcinoma. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on upper endoscopic screening for gastric cancer (GC)/GPMC detection in US populations deemed high-risk for GC. Surveillance endoscopy is recommended for individuals at high risk for GPMC progression, as defined by endoscopic, histologic, and demographic factors, typically every 3 years, but an individualized interval may be warranted. H. pylori testing, treatment, and eradication confirmation are recommended in all individuals with GPMC.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^113KHFj4]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Gastric adenocarcinoma carries a poor prognosis, in part due to the late stage of diagnosis. Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, family history of gastric cancer-in particular, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia. The stages in the progression to cancer include chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy (GA), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia. The key to early detection of cancer and improved survival is to non-invasively identify those at risk before endoscopy. However, although biomarkers may help in the detection of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, there is insufficient evidence to support their use for population screening. High-quality endoscopy with full mucosal visualisation is an important part of improving early detection. Image-enhanced endoscopy combined with biopsy sampling for histopathology is the best approach to detect and accurately risk-stratify GA and GIM. Biopsies following the Sydney protocol from the antrum, incisura, lesser and greater curvature allow both diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification for progression to cancer. Ideally biopsies should be directed to areas of GA or GIM visualised by high-quality endoscopy. There is insufficient evidence to support screening in a low-risk population (undergoing routine diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) such as the UK, but endoscopic surveillance every 3years should be offered to patients with extensive GA or GIM. Endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection of visible gastric dysplasia and early cancer has been shown to be efficacious with a high success rate and low rate of recurrence, providing that specific quality criteria are met.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^115QVTSa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is becoming increasingly challenging due largely to the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and to the relative complexity of treatment regimens. If a reliable test to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity/resistance of H. pylori was readily available, treatment would be more focused and-presumably-more effective. However, antimicrobial sensitivity testing is difficult to obtain in most parts of the United States. Therefore, physicians have to rely on clinical judgment in selecting treatment regimens for their infected patients. The aims of this review are to summarize recent treatment recommendations and to examine available evidence for how we might improve on our current treatment selections. Information on this review is directed primarily toward physicians practicing in the United States.

### RE.GA. IN.: the real-world gastritis initiative-updating the updates [^114kLp2q]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

At the end of the last century, a far-sighted 'working party' held in Sydney, Australia addressed the clinicopathological issues related to gastric inflammatory diseases. A few years later, an international conference held in Houston, Texas, USA critically updated the seminal Sydney classification. In line with these initiatives, Kyoto Global Consensus Report, flanked by the Maastricht-Florence conferences, added new clinical evidence to the gastritis clinicopathological puzzle. The most relevant topics related to the gastric inflammatory diseases have been addressed by the Real-world Gastritis Initiative (RE.GA. IN.), from disease definitions to the clinical diagnosis and prognosis. This paper reports the conclusions of the RE.GA. IN. consensus process, which culminated in Venice in November 2022 after more than 8months of intense global scientific deliberations. A forum of gastritis scholars from five continents participated in the multidisciplinary RE.GA. IN. consensus. After lively debates on the most controversial aspects of the gastritis spectrum, the RE.GA. IN. Faculty amalgamated complementary knowledge to distil patient-centred, evidence-based statements to assist health professionals in their real-world clinical practice. The sections of this report focus on: the epidemiology of gastritis; Helicobacter pylori as dominant aetiology of environmental gastritis and as the most important determinant of the gastric oncogenetic field; the evolving knowledge on gastric autoimmunity; the clinicopathological relevance of gastric microbiota; the new diagnostic horizons of endoscopy; and the clinical priority of histologically reporting gastritis in terms of staging. The ultimate goal of RE.GA. IN. was and remains the promotion of further improvement in the clinical management of patients with gastritis.

Despite guidelines for detection and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, recommendations to test patients before and after therapy are commonly not followed in the United States. At the Houston Consensus Conference, 11 experts on management of adult and pediatric patients with H pylori, from different geographic regions of the United States, met to discuss key factors in diagnosis of H pylori infection, including identification of appropriate patients for testing, effects of antibiotic susceptibility on testing and treatment, appropriate methods for confirmation of infection and eradication, and relevant health system considerations. The experts divided into groups that used a modified Delphi panel approach to assess appropriate patients for testing, testing for antibiotic susceptibility and treatment, and test methods and confirmation of eradication. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were evaluated using the GRADE system. The results of the individual workshops were presented for a final consensus vote by all panel members. After the Expert Consensus Development meeting, the conclusions were validated by a separate panel of gastroenterologists, who assessed their level of agreement with each of the 29 statements developed at the Expert Consensus Development. The final recommendations are provided, on the basis of the best available evidence, and provide consensus statements with supporting literature to implement testing for H pylori infection at health care systems across the United States.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^113ymyha]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Annual prevalence estimates of peptic ulcer disease range between 0·12% and 1·5%. Peptic ulcer disease is usually attributable to Helicobacter pylori infection, intake of some medications (such as aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications), or being critically ill (stress-related), or it can be idiopathic. The clinical presentation is usually uncomplicated, with peptic ulcer disease management based on eradicating H pylori if present, the use of acid-suppressing medications-most often proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)-or addressing complications, such as with early endoscopy and high-dose PPIs for peptic ulcer bleeding. Special considerations apply to patients on antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. H pylori treatment has evolved, with the choice of regimen dictated by local antibiotic resistance patterns. Indications for primary and secondary prophylaxis vary across societies; most suggest PPIs for patients at highest risk of developing a peptic ulcer, its complications, or its recurrence. Additional research areas include the use of potassium-competitive acid blockers and H pylori vaccination; the optimal approach for patients at risk of stress ulcer bleeding requires more robust determinations of optimal patient selection and treatment selection, if any. Appropriate continuation of PPI use outweighs most possible side-effects if given for approved indications, while de-prescribing should be trialled when a definitive indication is no longer present.

### AGA clinical practice update on screening and surveillance in individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer in the United States: expert review [^111Qikph]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Endoscopic management according to findings on the index screening examination — documentation and follow-up guidance includes that endoscopists should work with their local pathologists to achieve consensus for consistent documentation of histologic risk-stratification parameters when atrophic gastritis with or without metaplasia is diagnosed, and at a minimum the presence or absence of H pylori infection, severity of atrophy and/or metaplasia, and histologic subtyping of GIM, if applicable, should be documented to inform clinical decision making. If the index screening endoscopy performed in an individual at increased risk for GC does not identify atrophy, GIM, or neoplasia, then the decision to continue screening should be based on that individual's risk factors and preferences.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^114mJ4Hv]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) 2019 — atrophic gastritis (AG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) surveillance: For patients with mild to moderate atrophy restricted to the antrum there is no evidence to recommend surveillance. Patients with IM at a single location have a higher risk of gastric cancer; however, this increased risk does not justify surveillance in most cases, particularly if a high-quality endoscopy with biopsies has excluded advanced stages of AG. In patients with IM at a single location but with a family history of gastric cancer, or with incomplete IM, or with persistent H pylori gastritis, endoscopic surveillance may be considered. Patients with advanced stages of AG (severe atrophic changes or IM in both antrum and corpus, OLGA/OLGIM III/IV) should be followed up with a high-quality endoscopy every 3 y, and those with a family history of gastric cancer may benefit from a more intensive follow-up, eg, every 1–2 y after diagnosis. Patients with autoimmune gastritis may benefit from endoscopic follow-up every 3–5 y.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^11363A1v]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnostic workup — atrophic gastritis histopathology and risk stratification — the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis (AG) should be confirmed by histopathology (Best Practice Advice [BPA] 1), and practical reporting depends on submitting antral and corpus biopsy specimens in separate jars with correct orientation; gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) is readily identified irrespective of specimen thickness or orientation. Severity and topographic distribution of atrophic lesions are well-established determinants of gastric cancer risk and are incorporated in 2 classification systems for risk assessment — Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link for Gastritis Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment (OLGIM) — which are advocated by international guidelines, although reporting of OLGA/OLGIM stage has not gained a foothold in clinical practice in the United States. Providers should be aware that the presence of IM on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of AG, and that extensive atrophy and metaplasia are associated with an increased cancer risk; there should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting AG severity and extent, particularly if marked atrophy is present (BPA 2).

### Key points from the revised maastricht consensus report: the impact on general practice [^115d831M]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes. Advisable indications include functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Because H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, or exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression. Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce recurrent bleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs. Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

In the context of the wide clinical spectrum associated with Helicobacter pylori gastritis, specific issues persist and require regular updates for optimised management. The identification of distinct clinical scenarios, proper testing and adoption of effective strategies for prevention of gastric cancer and other complications are addressed. H. pylori treatment is challenged by the continuously rising antibiotic resistance and demands for susceptibility testing with consideration of novel molecular technologies and careful selection of first line and rescue therapies. The role of H. pylori and antibiotic therapies and their impact on the gut microbiota are also considered. Progress made in the management of H. pylori infection is covered in the present sixth edition of the Maastricht/Florence 2021 Consensus Report, key aspects related to the clinical role of H. pylori infection were re-evaluated and updated. Forty-one experts from 29 countries representing a global community, examined the new data related to H. pylori infection in five working groups: (1) indications/associations, (2) diagnosis, (3) treatment, (4) prevention/gastric cancer and (5) H. pylori and the gut microbiota. The results of the individual working groups were presented for a final consensus voting that included all participants. Recommendations are provided on the basis of the best available evidence and relevance to the management of H. pylori infection in various clinical fields.

### Results of surgical treatment for severe chronic gastritis… [^111BfCKW]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

When the surgeon has exposed the stomach of a patient suspected of harboring a cancer, peptic ulcer, or some other lesion, with or without a history of hemorrhage, and finds no such lesion, what is the best course for him to pursue. Most surgeons will find themselves in just such a dilemma from time to time. Occasionally it is discovered that the lesion at hand is severe chronic gastritis, which has led the internist, the roentgenologist, and occasionally the endoscopist to make an erroneous diagnosis. Ordinarily, one thinks of gastritis as being entirely a medical problem. When it can be proved that the patient has only chronic gastritis, the surgeon usually avoids surgical intervention, for he has surmised that the results from his efforts will probably be anything but satisfactory. The internist is left with a problem which often proves none too happy from his standpoint, either, and after variable. JUDD ES, EDWARDS CC.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^111ky3op]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for atrophic gastritis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic endoscopy, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to providers should recognize typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields. Because these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^115XnGxj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) — testing and surveillance: Among individuals diagnosed with AIG, we recommend assessment for H. pylori infection with a nonserological test, eradication treatment if positive, and posttreatment testing to confirm eradication (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation). There is insufficient evidence to make a formal recommendation on endoscopic surveillance in individuals with AIG; individualized surveillance may be considered given the increased risk of type 1 neuroendocrine tumors and the possible increased risk of GC (low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation).

### Management of Helicobacter pylori infection-the maastricht V / florence consensus report [^1169Po1o]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Important progress has been made in the management of Helicobacter pylori infection and in this fifth edition of the Maastricht Consensus Report, key aspects related to the clinical role of H. pylori were re-evaluated in 2015. In the Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Conference, 43 experts from 24 countries examined new data related to H. pylori in five subdivided workshops: (1) Indications/Associations, (2) Diagnosis, (3) Treatment, (4) Prevention/Public Health, (5) H. pylori and the Gastric Microbiota. The results of the individual workshops were presented to a final consensus voting that included all participants. Recommendations are provided on the basis of the best available evidence and relevance to the management of H. pylori infection in the various clinical scenarios.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^112ddiyr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) management — testing and surveillance: Among individuals diagnosed with AIG, we recommend assessment for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection with a nonserological test, eradication treatment if positive, and posttreatment testing to confirm eradication (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation). There is insufficient evidence to make a formal recommendation on endoscopic surveillance in individuals with AIG; given the increased risk of type I neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and the possible increased risk of GC, individualized surveillance may be considered (Low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation). There are no RCTs of surveillance vs no surveillance for the purpose of early neoplasia detection in patients with histologically confirmed AIG, and endoscopic surveillance is suggested in the context of shared decision-making. In patients with pernicious anemia, the risk of GC is highest within the first year of diagnosis; thus, endoscopy should be considered in patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia, with particular consideration of women 50 years or older.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^112cNTXQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC) are common and include atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and certain gastric epithelial polyps. GPMC have an increased risk of progression to gastric adenocarcinoma. Gastric cancer (GC) in the United States represents an important cancer disparity because incidence rates are 2- to 13-fold greater in non-White individuals, particularly early-generation immigrants from regions of high GC incidence. The US 5-year survival rate for GC is 36%, which falls short of global standards and is driven by the fact that only a small percentage of GC in the US is diagnosed in the early, curable stage. This document represents the first iteration of American College of Gastroenterology guidelines on this topic and encompasses endoscopic surveillance for high-risk patients with GPMC, the performance of high-quality endoscopy and image-enhanced endoscopy for diagnosis and surveillance, GPMC histology criteria and reporting, endoscopic treatment of dysplasia, the role of Helicobacter pylori eradication, general risk reduction measures, and the management of autoimmune gastritis and gastric epithelial polyps. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on upper endoscopic screening for GC/GPMC detection in US populations deemed high-risk for GC. Surveillance endoscopy is recommended for individuals at high risk for GPMC progression, as defined by endoscopic, histologic, and demographic factors, typically every 3 years, but an individualized interval may be warranted. H. pylori testing, treatment, and eradication confirmation are recommended in all individuals with GPMC. Extensive high-quality data from US populations regarding GPMC management are lacking, but continue to accrue, and the quality of evidence for the recommendations presented herein should be interpreted with this dynamic context in mind. The GPMC research and education agendas are broad and include high-quality prospective studies evaluating opportunistic endoscopic screening for GC/GPMC, refined delineation of what constitutes "high-risk" populations, development of novel biomarkers, alignment of best practices, implementation of training programs for improved GPMC/GC detection, and evaluation of the impact of these interventions on GC incidence and mortality in the US.

### Consensus recommendations for managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^117Fzesk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The management of patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding has evolved substantially over the past 10 years amid a paucity of published consensus guidelines.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based management recommendations that address clinically relevant issues. REVIEW AND CONSENSUS PROCESSES: A multidisciplinary consensus group of 25 voting participants representing 11 national societies used a 7-step approach to develop recommendation statements according to accepted standards. Sources of data included narrative and systematic reviews as well as published and new meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence, the strength of the recommendation, and the level of consensus were graded according to recognized classifications.

Main Findings

Recommendations emphasize appropriate initial resuscitation of the patient and a multidisciplinary approach to clinical risk stratification that determines the need for early endoscopy. Early endoscopy allows safe and prompt discharge of selected patients classified as low risk. Endoscopic hemostasis is reserved for patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions. Although monotherapy with injection or thermal coagulation is effective, the combination is superior to either treatment alone. The placement of endoscopic clips for endoscopic hemostasis appears promising. High-dose intravenous proton-pump inhibition is recommended in patients who have undergone successful endoscopic therapy. Routine second-look endoscopy is not recommended. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be tested for Helicobacter pylori infection and receive eradication therapy if infection is present.

Future Directions

The efficacy of newer endoscopic therapeutic technologies, the optimal regimen of proton-pump inhibition, and the roles of other pharmacologic agents require further research.

Regarding medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, more specifically with respect to indications for discontinuation, AGA 2022 guidelines recommend to avoid discontinuing PPI therapy in patients with any of the following:

- complicated GERD (such as a history of severe erosive esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, or peptic stricture)

- Barrett's esophagus

- eosinophilic esophagitis

- idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^111WLsUd]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Atrophic gastritis (AG) H pylori management — Irrespective of etiology, patients with AG should be tested for H pylori and, if positive, treated with confirmation of successful eradication; despite eradication, risk can remain elevated in extensive or moderate to severe atrophy (eg, OLGA/OLGIM III/IV), yet H pylori eradication does still appear to reduce the risk of gastric cancer.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^113mQAK9]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Natural history and cancer risk in atrophic gastritis indicate that the risk of progression of AG to gastric adenocarcinoma ranges from 0.1% to 0.3% per year; one meta-analysis of 27 studies demonstrated a nearly 7-fold significantly higher relative risk of gastric cancer in patients with versus without pernicious anemia (PA), with most individual studies suggesting a 2- to 4-fold higher risk; autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a risk factor for type 1 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), with longitudinal cohort studies estimating the incidence rate of type 1 gastric NETs in AIG as 0.4–0.7% per year, and the diagnosis of PA identifies patients who have had corpus-predominant AG for at least several years.
