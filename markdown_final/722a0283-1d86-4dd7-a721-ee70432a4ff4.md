## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which treatment is best for a 10-year-old girl with a circular, itchy scalp rash and hair loss, plus a tender posterior cervical node, consistent with tinea capitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether the clinical features fit tinea capitis. Then, I should verify why topical therapy alone is inadequate and why systemic therapy is required. Next, I will compare first-line oral antifungal options and dosing in children, including terbinafine, griseofulvin, and itraconazole. After that, I need to consider the role of adjunctive topical therapy and whether it changes the choice of oral drug. Finally, I will review red flags, follow-up, and why the other answer choices are incorrect before stating the best option with a clear rationale.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. A 10-year-old with a pruritic, circular, scaly scalp lesion and hair loss, accompanied by tender posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, strongly suggests tinea capitis, especially given the classic triad of scale, alopecia, and lymphadenopathy that supports this diagnosis in children [^115oJpz7] [^115cgnwJ]. Hold on, I should verify that lymphadenopathy is indeed a supportive sign; yes, occipital or posterior cervical nodes are commonly involved in pediatric tinea capitis and reinforce the diagnosis when present [^115cgnwJ].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before choosing therapy. Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp and hair shaft; because topical agents cannot penetrate the hair shaft adequately, systemic antifungal therapy is required to achieve mycologic cure and prevent scarring alopecia, so topical therapy alone should not be offered as definitive treatment [^115JK63G] [^114tHuQ3]. I should double-check guideline language; the British Association of Dermatologists explicitly advises against topical therapy alone and recommends oral therapy to achieve both clinical and mycologic cure, which aligns with this reasoning [^115JK63G].

> Next, I should review first-line oral options and dosing in children. Terbinafine is preferred for Trichophyton species because it achieves higher cure rates with shorter courses; typical pediatric dosing is weight-based at 62.5 mg/day if under 20 kg, 125 mg/day if 20–40 kg, and 250 mg/day if over 40 kg, for 2–4 weeks, which can improve adherence compared with longer regimens [^111DXT7n] [^111otfS3]. Hold on, I should verify the organism spectrum; in North America, T. tonsurans predominates, making terbinafine a rational first choice in many children, including this 10-year-old, assuming typical epidemiology [^115cgnwJ] [^115EX6mV].

> I need to ensure I consider alternatives and their trade-offs. Griseofulvin remains effective, particularly for Microsporum species, and is dosed at 15–20 mg/kg/day for 6–8 weeks; however, the longer duration can hinder adherence compared with terbinafine's shorter course, which is why terbinafine is often favored when Trichophyton is likely [^111DXT7n] [^111otfS3]. Let me reconsider itraconazole; it is a reasonable second-line option at 5 mg/kg/day for 2–4 weeks, but guidelines generally position it after terbinafine or griseofulvin unless there is a specific indication or intolerance, so it is not the best initial choice here [^113zajmk].

> But wait, what about adjunctive topical therapy; does that change the oral choice? Adjunctive antifungal shampoos such as ketoconazole or selenium sulfide can reduce spore burden and transmission and may shorten time to cure when combined with systemic therapy, yet they are not sufficient as monotherapy and should be used alongside, not instead of, oral treatment [^114TdtWp] [^1111eGKS]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse adjunctive shampoos; yes, both BAD and ESPD support their use as adjuncts to oral therapy in pediatric tinea capitis [^114TdtWp].

> I will now examine why the other answer choices are incorrect. Subcutaneous triamcinolone is a corticosteroid and is not indicated for tinea capitis; in fact, steroids can worsen fungal infections and are generally avoided unless treating a severe inflammatory kerion with careful antifungal coverage, which is not described here [^115cgnwJ] [^115gdfQi]. Ketoconazole shampoo alone is inadequate because it does not eradicate infection within the hair shaft, though it can be used as adjunctive therapy with systemic treatment [^115JK63G] [^114TdtWp]. Oral doxycycline is an antibiotic with no antifungal activity and would be inappropriate for a fungal infection like tinea capitis [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and monitoring. Clinical improvement is expected within 2–4 weeks, but mycologic cure is the endpoint; if there is clinical improvement but persistent positive mycology, extending therapy by 2–4 weeks is reasonable, whereas lack of initial improvement should prompt reassessment of adherence, absorption, organism, or reinfection and consideration of switching therapy [^111bbrVQ] [^117XGKpg]. I need to ensure we also address contagion; screening household contacts and treating carriers reduces reinfection risk and is recommended in guidelines [^113VNQcV] [^112Fy2CW].

> Putting this together, the best treatment for this 10-year-old with tinea capitis is oral terbinafine, given its efficacy against Trichophyton species, shorter treatment duration, and favorable adherence profile, with weight-based pediatric dosing of 125 mg/day if 20–40 kg for 2–4 weeks, and consideration of adjunctive ketoconazole shampoo to reduce spore burden and transmission risk [^111otfS3] [^111DXT7n] [^114TdtWp]. I should confirm that guidelines support empiric systemic therapy when classic features are present; yes, BAD recommends initiating treatment while awaiting mycology when cardinal signs are present, which fits this case [^115oJpz7].

The best treatment for a 10-year-old girl with a circular, itchy scalp rash and hair loss, with a tender posterior cervical node, is **oral terbinafine** [^111otfS3] for 2–4 weeks [^111DXT7n] because it is first-line for tinea capitis [^111DXT7n] and achieves high cure rates with a short course. Ketoconazole shampoo is **adjunctive only** [^114TdtWp] and not sufficient as monotherapy [^115JK63G]; doxycycline is inappropriate because it is not antifungal; and subcutaneous triamcinolone is contraindicated because steroids can worsen fungal infections [^notfound]. Confirm the diagnosis with KOH prep or culture [^115o8Lzv], treat household contacts [^115cgnwJ], and follow until mycologic cure [^111bbrVQ].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The clinical presentation — circular, itchy rash with hair loss and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy — is most consistent with **tinea capitis** [^115cgnwJ], a dermatophyte infection of the scalp and hair shafts [^114tHuQ3]. Other considerations include:

- **Alopecia areata**: Non-scarring alopecia without scaling or lymphadenopathy [^notfound].
- **Seborrheic dermatitis**: Scaly, greasy plaques without hair loss or lymphadenopathy [^1122SeT6].
- **Psoriasis**: Erythematous, scaly plaques with silvery scale, often on the scalp, but typically without lymphadenopathy [^notfound].
- **Bacterial folliculitis**: Pustular lesions with localized lymphadenopathy, but usually not circular or diffuse hair loss [^notfound].

Given the presence of hair loss, scaling, and lymphadenopathy, **tinea capitis is the most likely diagnosis** [^115oJpz7].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

Before initiating treatment, confirm the diagnosis with **mycological testing** [^115oJpz7]:

- **Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation**: Direct microscopic examination of scalp scrapings for fungal hyphae and spores [^115o8Lzv].
- **Fungal culture**: Gold standard for identifying the specific dermatophyte species, though results may take 1–3 weeks [^115o8Lzv].
- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: Rapid and accurate molecular method for dermatophyte detection, though availability may be limited [^115o8Lzv].

---

## Treatment options

Systemic antifungal therapy is **required** [^115JK63G] for tinea capitis because topical agents alone cannot penetrate the hair shaft sufficiently to eradicate the infection [^114tHuQ3]. The following oral antifungal agents are recommended:

| **Medication** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Terbinafine | 125 mg/day (20–40 kg); 250 mg/day (> 40 kg) | 2–4 weeks | First-line therapy for Trichophyton species [^111DXT7n] |
| Griseofulvin | 15–20 mg/kg/day | 6–8 weeks | Alternative therapy, particularly for Microsporum species [^111DXT7n] [^112avkM3] |
| Itraconazole | 5 mg/kg/day | 2–4 weeks | Second-line therapy for refractory cases [^113zajmk] |

---

Adjunctive topical therapy with antifungal shampoos (e.g. ketoconazole or selenium sulfide) is recommended to reduce spore burden and transmission but **should not be used as monotherapy** [^115JK63G] [^114TdtWp].

---

## Recommended treatment for this patient

Given the clinical presentation and age, **oral terbinafine is the preferred first-line therapy** [^111otfS3]. Terbinafine is highly effective against Trichophyton species, the most common causative agents of tinea capitis in children, and offers a shorter treatment duration (2–4 weeks) compared to griseofulvin (6–8 weeks), thereby improving adherence [^111DXT7n] [^112Fy2CW].

---

## Rationale for not recommending alternative treatments

- **Ketoconazole shampoo**: Recommended as adjunctive therapy only, insufficient as monotherapy due to limited penetration of the hair shaft [^115JK63G] [^114TdtWp].
- **Oral doxycycline**: Antibiotic with no antifungal activity, inappropriate for fungal infections [^notfound].
- **Subcutaneous triamcinolone**: Corticosteroid contraindicated in fungal infections, may worsen the condition and delay healing [^112Fy2CW].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to ensure clinical and mycological cure. Clinical improvement is typically observed within 2–4 weeks of therapy, but **mycological cure should be confirmed** with repeat KOH preparation or culture [^111bbrVQ]. If there is no improvement or if symptoms persist, reassess for adherence, consider alternative diagnoses, or switch to a different antifungal agent [^117XGKpg].

---

## Prevention of recurrence and transmission

To prevent recurrence and transmission, **educate the patient and family** on hygiene measures, including regular washing of hair with antifungal shampoo, avoiding sharing of combs, hats, or towels, and thorough cleaning of household items. Household contacts, particularly siblings, should be screened and treated if infected to prevent reinfection [^113VNQcV].

---

## Conclusion

The best treatment for a 10-year-old girl with a circular, itchy scalp rash, hair loss, and tender posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is **oral terbinafine** for 2–4 weeks [^111DXT7n]. This regimen is supported by current guidelines and clinical evidence, offering high efficacy, shorter treatment duration, and improved adherence. Adjunctive topical antifungal shampoo may be used to reduce spore burden, but systemic therapy is essential for cure [^115JK63G].

Question 2: What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
A. No treatment
B. Complete surgical excision with clear margins
C. Primary radiotherapy
D. Systemic chemotherapy
E. Wide local excision with adjuvant radiotherapy

Answers:

A. No treatment – Incorrect. Pilomatrical carcinoma is a malignant adnexal tumor. Metastasis occur in 10%-16% of cases; lung and regional lymph nodes are the most common sites for distant metastasis.
B. Complete surgical excision with clear margins – Correct. Standards for surgical management are not well defined given the rarity of this malignancy. Complete margin control is essential given the aggressive nature of this tumor. Surgical excision with wide margins is the current mainstay of treatment. Local recurrence rate is high (between 50% to 60% after simple excision). Most studies recommend complete excision with wide margins; recommendations range between 5 and 30 mm margins. Mohs micrographic surgery has been reported as a successful treatment for pilomatrical carcinoma, achieving complete margin control and no local recurrence at 5–6 months.
C. Primary radiotherapy – Incorrect. Complete surgical excision is the current mainstay of treatment; however, radiotherapy may be a good option in patients in whom wide excision is not possible.
D. Systemic chemotherapy – Incorrect. Systemic chemotherapy has been used in systemic disease but there is a poor response.
E. Wide local excision with adjuvant radiotherapy – Incorrect. Adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended in recurrent or residual macroscopic disease.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^1138Ngzd]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 78-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a 4-week history of an itchy, painful, pink-red progressively worsening rash on her chest and neck (Fig 1). Her history included remote breast cancer and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with known axillary nodal involvement. At presentation, she was undergoing treatment of her metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed for the last 6 months, and had undergone radiation to axillary lymph node metastases in previous months. Physical examination found thin pink-red plaques around her neck and chest. She denied fever or chills. She was prescribed a 2-week prednisone taper and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment with 1-month follow-up arranged where she demonstrated no response to treatment.

Question 1: What is the best next step in caring for this patient?
A. Perform biopsy of lesion.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin.

Answers:

A. Perform biopsy of lesion – Correct. In this patient with history of malignancies, biopsy should be done of the lesion to rule out metastasis of internal malignancy.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily – Incorrect. This patient had attempted oral and topical steroids with no relief of symptoms/rash. At this point, another round of steroids would be inappropriate.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction – Incorrect. This would be appropriate if herpes zoster was suspected. This patient's rash does not consist of papules or vesicles expected of herpes zoster and does not follow a dermatomal distribution.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve – Incorrect. This patient's rash has persisted for greater than 4 weeks. Her history of malignancy is concerning, and as such reassurance would be inappropriate at this time.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin – Incorrect. This would be the correct option if erysipelas or severe cellulitis was suspected. We would expect this patient to display acute-onset systemic symptoms such as fever; her rash developed slowly over 4 weeks and not as acutely as one would expect with erysipelas.

### The assessment and management of tinea capitis in children [^114tHuQ3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is an infection of the scalp and hair shaft caused by dermatophyte fungi. It is seen in all age groups, and the incidence seems to be on the rise in North America. Clinical diagnosis of tinea capitis can be challenging, as symptoms can vary from minimal pruritus with no hair loss, to severe tenderness, purulence, and permanent scarring in inflammatory kerion lesions. The diagnosis of tinea capitis must be confirmed in the laboratory by using fungal stains or obtaining cultures, since treatment may be prolonged with potential side effects. Systemic therapy is needed because topical antifungals cannot effectively penetrate the hair shaft to eradicate the infection. Oral griseofulvin remains the standard treatment agent, but terbinafine and itraconazole are also effective alternatives (although currently without Food and Drug Administration approval).

There is no consensus for the best therapeutic approach. An initial wait-and-see approach may be the best option, given the fact that RDD is often self-limiting.

However, in case of significant extranodal disease and/or compression of vital organs by massive lymphadenopathy, prompt therapy may be indicated.

When possible, surgery probably represents the best solution, being curative if resection is complete. Recurrence after surgical therapy is very rare and limited to incomplete debulking and multiorgan involvement.

Medical therapeutic options include corticosteroids, antibiotics, antiviral agents, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, no universally accepted treatment guidelines exist. Several Authors reported successful treatments using radiotherapy and/or corticosteroids in cases of recurrences or incomplete resection, but this strategy was not always effective. In our case, given the young age of the patient and the apparently rapid progression of the disease, we decided to treat the child using corticosteroids, obtaining an important dimensional reduction of hilar, cervical and parotid glands adenopathy, the resolution of systemic symptoms, and normalization of blood tests. Moreover, we chose to treat the patient with a relatively short course of prednisone therapy at a standard dosage of 1.5 mg/kg/day, obtaining a good clinical response and no adverse effects.

### Dissecting cellulitis mimicking kerion in a 9-year-old boy [^115KS6JP]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 9-year-old healthy boy with skin type V presented to the pediatric dermatology clinic with a 1-year history of scalp nodules and alopecia. He had been treated with ketoconazole shampoo. On examination, he had scattered alopecic scaly round thin plaques, cervical lymphadenopathy, tender papules and small nodules, some with drainage (Fig 1). There was no family history of fungal infection or scalp lesions, however, his mother had HS managed with adalimumab. The patient was prescribed oral griseofulvin 20 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks and topical ketoconazole shampoo for presumptive tinea capitis and kerion. Because of discomfort, a 7-day course of oral prednisolone was also given. Fungal culture and potassium hydroxide examination of the scalp scrapings obtained before treatment, were negative. After completion of this regimen, the boggy, painful lesions resolved, leaving round plaques of scarring alopecia. Two weeks later, the scalp nodules recurred. Repeat fungal and bacterial cultures were negative. He then received subsequent treatments with oral terbinafine, prednisolone, and oral cephalexin, all with temporary reduction in the size and drainage of the nodules but the scalp never fully cleared. Eventually, the nodules recurred and were worse than initial presentation (Fig 2).

Fig 2
After initial improvement, swollen, boggy weeping nodules developed despite treatment with oral terbinafine, griseofulvin, antibiotics, and short courses of prednisone. Punch biopsy was performed during this visit.

A punch biopsy was performed from an inflamed scalp nodule and a trial of intralesional kenalog (ILK) was injected to the largest nodule. On histopathology, a predominantly reticular dermal, periadnexal and perivascular, mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, and occasional eosinophils were seen. Periodic acid–Schiff stain was negative. Dermal fibrosis with focal scarring was present (Fig 3). These findings, coupled with the clinical picture, were consistent with DCS.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^115o8Lzv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is an infection of the scalp and hair follicles, caused by dermatophytes. Dermatophytes is a common name of three genera of fungi – Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton, with the first two species being most dominant. Dermatophytes are also classified by host preference and natural habitat, with anthropophilic dermatophytes affecting humans, zoophilic dermatophytes affecting animals, and geophilic dermatophytes mainly affecting the soil. The latter two are relatively rare. All dermatophytes can exploit keratin (hair, skin, and nails) for growth and their clinical manifestations are named after the affected area of the body (e.g. Tinea manum, Tinea pedis, Tinea capitis). Tinea capitis is one of the most common cutaneous infections in pre-pubertal children, mainly from 6 months to 10–12 years of age. The epidemiology of Tinea capitis varies across geographical regions throughout the world and changes over time. The infection spreads among family members and classmates 1.

The clinical manifestations of Tinea capitis are variable, depending on the type of hair invasion, the level of host resistance, the immune system and the degree of inflammatory host response, but can grossly be classified as alopecic or inflammatory. Inflammatory Tinea capitis includes kerion, which manifests as a tender mass with pustules, purulent discharge, lymphadenopathy, malaise, fever, and favus, with yellow cup-shaped crusts around the hair, inflammation and scarring.

Tinea capitis is often misdiagnosed, thus delaying appropriate treatment and enabling spread of infection. The diagnosis can be made in several ways. First and foremost, anamnesis and physical examination are crucial. In recent years, the dermatoscope has become more commonly used for close inspection of the scalp. Diagnosis can be confirmed by direct microscopy, with use of standard potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparations. Its disadvantages include the time-consuming process, requirement of an expert and equipment not necessarily available in every clinic, and a false negative rate of up to 40%. In addition, scalp scrapings and hair fragments from the affected area can be cultured, but can involve up to 3 weeks until results are provided. Molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), provide for faster and more accurate identification of dermatophyte infections.

She was initially administered pulse corticosteroid therapy and then treated with mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine. During the four years of treatment, she had an uneven clinical course and persistently low complement levels. Two years after being diagnosed with SLE, Raynaud's phenomenon affecting the fingers was observed, along with new-onset wrist and knee joint pain; therefore, she received additional methotrexate. One week before hospitalization, she developed fever and was treated with Baktar in the oral form (sulfamethoxazole 400 mg + trimethoprim 80 mg) for a suspected urinary tract infection. However, the fever persisted and was accompanied by an obvious malar rash, periungual erythema, generalized weakness, and multiple joint pains (wrist, knee, and fingers without swelling or limited range of motion). The patient was then admitted for further evaluation and treatment. Physical examination revealed ulcers on the bilateral buccal surfaces; rash on the face (malar distribution, presented with erythema over cheeks; nasal bridge but with spared nasolabial folds); enlarged right cervical lymph node with tenderness; right flank knocking pain; and localized heat on the right knee. Erythematous vasculitic purpuric plaques are present on the palmar surfaces and soles with some abrasion. The fingertips turned red without ulceration or gangrene but with periungual telangiectasias. Physical examination did not reveal skin lesions such as Gottron's papules, heliotrope eruption, shawl sign, Holster sign, or calcinosis.

### Spectrum and burden of dermatophytes in children [^112Fy2CW]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is the most important superficial fungal condition in children. It is often unrecognised but the presence of alopecia, scale and lymphadenopathy, especially in inner-city children should prompt investigation. An understanding of changing epidemiology and prevalence of causative organisms is important in deciding appropriate therapy. The use of diagnostic aids including dermoscopy is increasing and is reported to be helpful in identifying subtle signs. Trichophyton tonsurans accounts for the majority of cases in the UK and terbinafine is increasingly advocated as a safe and effective therapy. Exclusion from school is unnecessary provided the child is receiving appropriate systemic and topical therapy, but family members should be screened and carriers should receive treatment. Steroids and surgical treatments should be avoided. Treatment failure is common and may be multifactorial. Mycological cure after completing treatment should be sought and therefore follow up is necessary for Tinea capitis cases. Development of molecular diagnostic methods may improve our ability to diagnose Tinea capitis accurately and quickly in the future. Emerging new dermatophytoses affecting other anatomical sites are discussed which, although not common in the UK, may be seen due to increasing travel worldwide.

A 23-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe occipital headache, nausea and fever. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspected meningitis. After a brief period of response, her symptoms relapsed and remained refractory despite continuing intravenous antibiotics for 10 days leading to referral to our centre. Physical examination was significant for tender right cervical lymph node. Initial tests included pancytopenia, elevated C reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and unremarkable cerebrospinal fluid. Extensive infectious and rheumatology work-up was negative. Massive posterior cervical, axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy was revealed on imaging. Excisional biopsy of the deep cervical lymph node showed histiocytic necrotising lymphadenitis suggesting a diagnosis of Kikuchi disease. Her course was complicated by acute renal failure. Her symptoms resolved in about a week with supportive treatment along with improvement in pancytopenia and renal function. She had two additional self-limited recurrences in the next 3 months and remains symptom free thereafter.

The patient was staged as IVA, T4N2M0B2 Sézary Syndrome, and she began romidepsin in November 2023. In January 2024, she was found to have a partial response with significantly improved erythroderma that the patient felt had recently plateaued (Figs 1, B and 2, B). After the January visit, she began concurrent tofacitinib 5 mg daily for sarcoidosis. In March 2024, she was seen after completing her fourth romidepsin infusion. She was noted to have significant improvement since January, with a reduction of generalized erythema, minimal tenderness of the skin to palpation, and no cervical, axillary, or right inguinal lymphadenopathy. She continued to have diffuse reticular violaceous purpuric patches and erythematous scaly plaques occupying an estimated 2% to 3% total body surface area, but clear islands of normal skin appeared for the first time since her initial presentation (Figs 1, C and D, 2, C). Notably, throughout her course of combined treatment with romidepsin and tofacitinib, there was no hematologic toxicity observed beyond what is expected of treatment with single-agent romidepsin.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^112pfdkQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The presented findings emphasized the importance of diagnosis and treatment of these immigrant children by their primary pediatric doctor since it takes, as mentioned, an average of 4.3 months until they visit a dermatologist. During this critical time period, the scalp can become severely and permanently damaged, and the infection can become systemic or cause an outbreak within the entire community. In conclusion, we recommend to relate to scaly scalp in high-risk populations as Tinea capitis, and to treat with griseofulvin at a dosage of up to 50 mg/kg/day, starting from the first presentation to the pediatrician.

CASE REPORT

A previously healthy young adult male subject developed tender left posterior cervical lymph nodes 3 weeks after administration of his first dose of investigational product (later determined to be normal saline placebo). The initial diagnosis was acute bacterial lymphadenitis, and treatment with oral amoxicillin and ibuprofen was given by a study physician. When the lymphadenopathy slowly progressed over the next 2 months, a referral was made to an internist at La Paz Medical Center. There the patient was found to have eosinophilia, a positive toxoplasmosis IgG titer, and mild cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, mesenteric and mediastinal lymphadenopathy by computerized tomography (CT). The patient was referred to the national tuberculosis (TB) program for empiric treatment of suspected TB lymphadenitis. Oral isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were given for 4 weeks, during which time the cervical lymph nodes increased in size. Oral trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin were then given for 10 days for possible toxoplasmosis, but following treatment, the left cervical lymph nodes had enlarged to 10 cm in diameter (see Figure 1), and cervical lymph nodes were now also palpable on the right. The patient complained of left-sided neck pain that radiated down the left arm, throat discomfort with swallowing, and feeling feverish at night. There had been a weight loss of 3 kg over the preceding 2 months, but no sweats or impairment of breathing. A lymph node biopsy was performed at La Paz Medical Center and sent to Policlínico Dr. Loeri Comba in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, where the pathologist diagnosed a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Biopsy material was hand-carried to the University of Maryland Medical Center where further testing narrowed the diagnosis to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The study team had determined that there were no oncologists and no options for immunochemotherapy in Equatorial Guinea and were concerned that the patient would likely die without treatment. After a search for potential treatment centers, it was established that the Cytecare Cancer Hospital in Bangalore, India, was well-equipped to provide high-quality care for the patient. Oncologists at the University of Maryland and Cytecare agreed that the best treatment would be six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Eleven days after his diagnosis was made, the patient arrived in Bangalore accompanied by his cousin and the research study's head nurse. The nurse remained with the patient during his first 10 days of evaluation and treatment. Full-body positron emission tomography (PET) showed diffuse hypermetabolic activity and lymphadenopathy. Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated, but there was no anemia and no evidence of extranodal involvement. The patient was determined to have stage IIIBx disease with a Revised International Prognostic Index of 2, predictive of a 4-year overall survival rate of 79% with treatment. For the next 4 months, the patient lived in Bangalore with his cousin. He received six cycles of R-CHOP as an outpatient with only mild side effects, and there was a rapid reduction in the size of his cervical lymph nodes. A posttreatment PET scan showed resolution or regression of all previously observed lymphadenopathy and a complete metabolic response to immunochemotherapy, but some new right hilar lymphadenopathy and a small right pleural effusion were seen. Thoracentesis was performed. The pleural fluid was exudative and showed numerous leukocytes (primarily lymphocytes), with no bacteria seen on Gram stain, a negative smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and a negative bacterial culture. Cytopathology carried out on the pleural fluid showed predominantly lymphoid cells which expressed CD3, but not CD20 or CD79a, markers, which was felt to be inconsistent with malignancy. Five days later, the right pleural effusion had increased in size, prompting repeat thoracentesis. Pleural fluid adenosine deaminase activity was elevated, but GeneXpert and a repeat AFB smear were negative. The presumptive diagnosis was pleural TB, possibly secondary to reactivation of previously unrecognized latent TB post-immunochemotherapy. Treatment was begun with oral isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. A follow-up ultrasound performed after 2 weeks of therapy showed near resolution of the pleural effusion, supporting the diagnosis of TB. The patient traveled home to Equatorial Guinea 2 days later, where he was promptly referred to the national TB program to complete 6 months of standard directly observed therapy. Physical examination by a physician was advised every 3 months for surveillance, with ultrasound or CT evaluation of any clinical recurrence of cervical lymphadenopathy, or symptoms suggesting intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Given his excellent clinical and radiological response to therapy, he was estimated to have a 50–60% likelihood of complete cure. The total cost of evaluation and treatment of this patient at Cytecare was 10,521 U.S. dollars, plus an additional 36,128 U.S. dollars for airfare, travel documents, housing, and living expenses in India for the patient, his cousin, and the study head nurse. It was agreed, in writing, that the cost of any future medical care would be the responsibility of the patient and his family. As of 32 months after his final dose of immunochemotherapy, the patient was free of clinical signs and symptoms of lymphoma.

Malignant pilomatrixoma or pilomatrix carcinoma is a rare, locally aggressive malignant neoplasm, derived from the hair follicle with a high propensity for local recurrence. Only a few cases of metastatic pilomatrixoma have been described in the literature. Till date, only 17 cases have been reported in the English-language medical literature, most commonly occurring associated with local recurrence in adults. We report the first case in children of a metastatic malignant pilomatrixoma in an 8-year-old girl presenting with a recurrent pilomatrix carcinoma of the forehead with metastases in cervical and parotid lymph nodes.

Case 3

A 42-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who was not receiving any chronic medications presented to our clinic with a 3-year history of hair loss. She noted frontal hairline thinning and moderate pruritus. On examination, she demonstrated frontal and temporal recession of 6.4 cm progressing behind her ears, flesh colored keratosis pilaris-like papules on her forehead, perifollicular scale, and erythema with loss of follicular ostium as well as a lonely hair sign. Her estimated LPPAI score was 7 and FFASI score was 54 at the time of initial evaluation. Her anterior neck demonstrated a hyperpigmented reticular patch with gray regression-like features on dermatoscopy. She was provided a clinical diagnosis of FFA with associated lichen planus pigmentosus and started on topical clobetasol solution twice daily for 2 weeks with alternative use of topical compounded tacrolimus 0.12% solution twice daily for 2 weeks. There was no improvement with the use of this regimen for 3 months. Oral dutasteride 0.5 mg daily, oral minoxidil 1.25 mg daily, oral doxycycline 100 mg daily, as needed, were then added for pruritus. After 6 months with no clinical improvement, intralesional triamcinolone (5 mg/mL) was additionally applied to affected areas every 4 weeks. Topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream to be applied to her neck twice daily along with recommendations of strict photoprotection was added to address her neck findings. Further, after 6 months, she demonstrated modest improvement in her hyperpigmented neck rash, but there was no evidence of scalp improvement. She endorsed subjective progression of hair loss and consistent pruritus. Given the severity of the disease and lack of scalp improvement with 12 months of oral therapy and 6 months of intralesional corticosteroids, alternative treatment options were discussed, and the patient elected to pursue oral JAK inhibition. Baseline laboratory findings were obtained, and she was started on oral baricitinib 4 mg daily while continuing her other therapies. She demonstrated complete resolution of perifollicular scale/erythema, symptomatic improvement in pruritus, and absence of neck rash after 1 month of treatment, with an LPPAI score of 2 and FFASI score of 18. Baricitinib was discontinued after 2 months of use with no recurrence noted at 1 month follow-up (Fig 3).

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^115dNzcg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Post-COVID-19 alopecia universalis: autoimmune hair loss and the challenge of relapse management [^112GFJfM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Alopecia universalis (AU) is the most severe form of alopecia areata (AA), characterized by complete scalp and body hair loss. While post-COVID-19 hair loss is often attributed to telogen effluvium (TE), emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 may also trigger AU through immune dysregulation, particularly via interferon-gamma (IFN-&gamma;)-mediated inflammation. The chronic and relapsing nature of AU raises challenges in long-term disease management, particularly regarding treatment duration and relapse prevention.

Case Presentation

We present a 79-year-old woman with no personal or family history of hair loss who developed sudden-onset AU one month after recovering from COVID-19. Initial treatment with topical and intralesional corticosteroids failed, prompting systemic therapy initiation. Over 10 months of treatment, she achieved significant hair regrowth. However, 3 months after discontinuation, hair loss recurred, reinforcing the relapsing nature of post-COVID-19 AU.

Conclusion

This case uniquely demonstrates the rapid onset and relapsing nature of post-COVID-19 AU, distinguishing it from idiopathic AU and emphasizing the need for modified long-term treatment strategies. While Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and other immunomodulatory therapies show promise, the risk of relapse upon treatment discontinuation highlights the need for further research into long-term management strategies and maintenance therapy in post-viral AU.

### Diagnosis and treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^1122SeT6]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition in infants, adolescents, and adults. The characteristic symptoms-scaling, erythema, and itching-occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the location and appearance of the lesions. The skin changes are thought to result from an inflammatory response to a common skin organism, Malassezia yeast. Treatment with antifungal agents such as topical ketoconazole is the mainstay of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body. Because of possible adverse effects, anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors should be used only for short durations. Several over-the-counter shampoos are available for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, and patients should be directed to initiate therapy with one of these agents. Antifungal shampoos (long-term) and topical corticosteroids (short-term) can be used as second-line agents for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^115gdfQi]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Taken together, for a refugee patient, a full physical examination should be performed. If findings like scaling, alopecia or pruritis are identified, the physician must rely on his highest degree of suspicion, and provide empirical treatment from the first encounter. Prescriptions should be given for the entire treatment period, because it might be the only encounter with the patient.

Despite the challenges of follow up in this population, and in accordance with the literature, in any case of suspected Tinea capitis, the scalp should be cultured prior to treatment, at least for epidemiological investigation. If opportunity arises, follow-up with a repeat mycology culture at the end of treatment is recommended, as a definitive diagnosis of eradication.

Due to the relative resistance to traditional dosages of griseofulvin observed in this population and poor follow up, these patients should be treated at a higher dosage than usual. Although treatment decisions rely on the identity of the fungus, griseofulvin at a dosage of up to 50 mg/kg/day is recommended for first-line treatment, since it provides a sufficient clinical response. In addition, years of experience with the drug have demonstrated its long-term safety; it has the fewest known drug interactions, a favorable adverse-effect profile and rarely induces serious adverse-reactions. Griseofulvin treatment has been associated with a small number of minor adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea). Furthermore, it is the cheapest antifungal drug, a critical criterion for maintaining long-term compliance in the target population. When considering these benefits against the potential harm, empiric treatment prior to culture results is recommended. As shown in Table 4, the study population seemed to be resistant to fluconazole. It is therefore not recommended to treat them with this drug, as it may result in lower compliance. Topical treatment alone failed to achieve clinical resolution, and therefore should only be administered as adjunct therapy. In case of an inflammatory lesion, such as kerion, additional treatment with steroids and antibiotic is needed. All the medications should be given together, to enhance compliance.

### Superficial fungal infections [^115cgnwJ]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis, tinea corporis, and pityriasis versicolor are common superficial fungal infections in the pediatric population.
- Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection worldwide. In North America, the cause is almost exclusively T tonsurans. Diagnosis of tinea capitis usually can be made by clinical features alone, especially when occipital or postauricular lymphadenopathy is present. Skin scrapings prepared with potassium hydroxide for microscopic examination, or a cotton swab for fungal culture, usually are diagnostic.
- Treatment of tinea capitis requires systemic antifungal therapy. Terbinafine and griseofulvin are both effective against T tonsurans and are FDA-approved for this indication in children.
- Adjunctive topical therapy for the patient and household contacts decreases transmission of this infection.
- Topical antifungal therapy usually is effective for tinea corporis and pityriasis versicolor. However, recurrences of pityriasis versicolor are common.

### Anakinra and hepatotoxicity in pediatric rheumatology: a case series [^114BSEy4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist used in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), refractory Kawasaki disease (KD) and cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndrome (CAPS). Anakinra associated hepatotoxicity, while rare, has been described in several cases in daily practice. ​In this case series the authors describe three pediatric patients with this side effect in the setting of severe macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in KD and sJIA.

Case Presentation

The first patient was a 12-year-old boy who presented with fever, maculo-papular exanthema and polyarthralgia. Tonsillitis, distal limb induration and tender cervical lymph nodes were observed. Erythrocyte-sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin (11,975 ng/mL), D-dimers (5,98 mg/L FEU) and soluble CD25 (3645 pg/mL) levels were elevated. Exclusion of sepsis / toxic shock syndrome warranted introduction of IV methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin (IG IV), with partial response. A MAS secondary to KD was assumed, and anakinra 2 mg/kg/day was introduced. Twenty days later he developed new-onset nausea and severe cyto-cholestasis, normalizing after 2 months of drug discontinuation. Posterior onset of polyarthritis and evanescent lead to a final diagnosis of sJIA. The second patient was a 2-year-old boy with a 10-day history of fevers, generalized rash, hepatosplenomegaly and strawberry tongue. Leucocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated CRP were observed. Initial treatment with IVIG in the setting of incomplete KD was ineffective. Mild anaemia, leukopenia and very high serum ferritin (maximum 26,128 ng/mL) ensued. Presumptive sJIA associated MAS was treated with IV methylprednisolone and anakinra 2 mg/kg/day, with prompt response. Four weeks later transaminitis was detected, and temporary anakinra suspension led to normalisation of laboratorial values. The third case related to a 4-year-old boy presenting with fever, maculopapular rash and cervical lymphadenopathy. CRP and ESR were elevated, and KD was diagnosed. IVIG and methylprednisolone were initiated with clinical worsening, warranting for anakinra introduction at 2 mg/kg/day. After three weeks, liver enzymes progressively elevated, resolving on 2 weeks of anakinra discontinuation.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case series describing anakinra associated hepatotoxicity in pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases other than sJIA, bringing additional insight to therapeutic monitoring in patients undergoing this treatment.

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^114sEv96]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is a cutaneous fungal infection common among 3 to 7 year old children but it is rare in the first year of life.

Case presentation

We present a case of a 12-month-old infant with erythematous scalp lesions combined with hair loss. He was suspected of dermatophytosis and mycological analysis of all suspected lesions was performed. Clinical features and culture results confirmed tinea capitis caused by Microsporum canis. The infant patient was treated with griseofulvin for 2 months. However, 15 days later at the end of treatment he presented with a single vesicle positive for M. canis. Griseofulvin therapy continued for another month. After 3 months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed.

Conclusions

In infant, sometimes tinea capitis is misdiagnosed and underreported because it is similar to other scalp pathologies. Therefore, if erythematous scalp lesions are present, they must be examined from a mycological point of view to inform the differential diagnosis. Once diagnosed, treatment of tinea capitis can pose a dilemma because different factors may influence the choice between equally effective therapies (i.e. safety, age, formulation, cost). This case report suggests that it is important to establish an accurate diagnosis and treatment for this dermatophytosis to avoid recurrences or therapeutic failures, especially in infants.

Patient 1

A 24-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic with a 5-month history of painful "bumps" on the scalp. Physical examination revealed multiple, tender, erythematous papules, pustules, and subcutaneous fluctuant nodules with patches of alopecia localized to the occipital scalp and posterior aspect of the neck (Fig 1, A). The patient reported pain as 5 of 10 on a numerical rating scale (NRS). He was previously treated with a 4-month course of doxycycline 100 mg once daily with a partial response. Based on clinical findings, DCS was diagnosed. After a thorough discussion, he consented to twice-a-day monotherapy treatment with 1% diclofenac sodium gel for 3 months. At 1-month follow-up, he reported improvement in his condition and denied any treatment-related side effects besides mild burning sensation on application to draining lesions. Few, tender, erythematous papules, and pustules were noted on examination, and pain was rated as 3 of 10 NRS. At 3-month follow-up, tenderness had resolved, the number of papules had decreased, and hair growth was evident (Fig 1, B). Based on clinical improvement, the patient was recommended to decrease the application of diclofenac gel to once a day, every other day as maintenance therapy. After 4 months of maintenance therapy, treatment effectiveness was sustained.

### Genomic landscape of a metastatic malignant proliferating tricholemmal tumor and its response to PI3K inhibition [^113b91Ad]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

A 58-year-old, previously healthy, white female presented to her primary care provider (PCP) with the desire to remove a right posterior scalp cyst for cosmesis. This non-inflamed, non-draining, painless, 1–2 cm cyst had been present for close to 10 years without change in size or fluctuance. The cyst was initially drained by the PCP, but, when it recurred 6 months later, the PCP excised the cyst and sent the specimen for routine pathology. The initial read of the tissue sample was high-grade invasive carcinoma with squamous features and arising in association with a PTT. Based on the pathology, the PCP referred the patient to a plastic surgeon for a more definitive excision of the lesion and repair of the defect. The lesion was excised with negative margins and pathology read as invasive high-grade squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Eight months post resection, the lesion recurred locally along with a palpable right posterior cervical lymph node (LN). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan at that time demonstrated hypermetabolic activity in the posterior occiput and in a posterior neck LN. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of both the primary scalp lesion and LN were completed, and pathology was reported as SCC, similar to the primary lesion.

With a working diagnosis of locally advanced SCC, the patient's care was referred to a tertiary care center. There, a dermatopathologist re-evaluated the previous biopsy specimens and altered the diagnosis from SCC to MPTT (Fig. 1b). Subsequently, the patient was referred to a head and neck surgeon for modified radical posterior neck and lymph node dissection. Intraoperative findings uncovered the presence of nodal metastases to the posterior neck with extranodal extension, extensive perineural invasion of the spinal accessory nerve, and jugular venous invasion of the MPTT. After surgery, the case was discussed at a multi-disciplinary tumor board, and a common head and neck cancer protocol of adjuvant chemotherapy (weekly carboplatin plus paclitaxel) with concurrent radiation was recommended. The patient tolerated the adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with expected toxicities including nausea and fatigue.

### Pediatric tinea capitis: recognition and management [^116RNAjY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis (ringworm of the head) is the most common dermatophytosis of childhood with an increasing incidence worldwide. If suspected clinically, further diagnostic procedures, including direct microscopy and culture, should be performed. Other scalp alterations, such as seborrheic dermatitis, atopic eczema, psoriasis, alopecia areata, folliculitis, and pseudopelade, may mimic ringworm of the head and must be identified. A proven fungal infection of scalp skin and hairs warrants immediate initiation of systemic treatment. At present, only oral griseofulvin is approved for therapy of scalp ringworm in children by health authorities. However, the advent of several newer antifungal agents such as itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine has broadened the therapeutic armamentarium in recent years. These agents offer shorter treatment intervals, and their adverse effects and drug interaction profiles appear to be well within acceptable limits. In patients with tinea capitis, systemic therapy at weight-dependent dosages for an appropriate amount of time in conjunction with topical supportive measures will help to prevent disfiguring hair loss, permanent formation of scar tissue, spread of fungal organisms to other cutaneous regions, and infection of other persons.

Cutaneous manifestations of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. At presentation, patient with generalized pruritis and a non-specific macular erythema and excoriations on the torso.

In February 2022, the patient reported no improvement and returned for further management. A skin biopsy was performed and showed mild spongiotic dermatitis (Fig 2). Additional work-up included a frontal and lateral chest x-ray which showed no abnormalities. The patient was prescribed prednisone starting at 0.75 mg/kg with instructions to taper off over 3 weeks.

Fig 2

The patient followed up after completing treatment with prednisone and reported transient improvement with recurrent, severe pruritus noted upon discontinuation of prednisone. Given the patient's severe symptoms, lack of response to topical and systemic steroids and pathology results demonstrating spongiotic dermatitis a decision was made to initiate treatment with dupilumab. The patient received a 600 mg loading dose of dupilumab in March 2022 followed by 300 mg subcutaneous injections every other week thereafter. In April 2022, 1 month after starting dupilumab, the patient reported "lumps in the neck" and new onset of night sweats. Physical examination revealed tender left cervical lymphadenopathy and a computed tomography scan of the neck demonstrated innumerable lymph nodes bilaterally many of which were enlarged. The largest lymph node in the left submandibular region measured 2.4 cm × 1.5 cm transaxially. At this time, the patient also reported 30 pounds of weight loss over 4 months which was initially attributed to lifestyle changes. The patient was instructed to stop dupilumab and, in May 2022, the patient underwent an excisional biopsy of an enlarged lymph node leading to a diagnosis of AITL. A subsequent bone marrow biopsy showed multiple atypical lymphohistiocytic aggregates supporting a diagnosis of AITL. The malignant cells were cluster of differentiation (CD)3 +, CD4 +, and negative for CD8, B cell markers, and CD30 (Figs 3 and 4). The patient is currently managed by medical oncology on a chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone with plan for future stem cell transplant.

### Localised cervical lymphadenopathy: a rare presenting sign of syphilis [^117CvkKW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Recognising syphilis can be challenging due to enormous variability in disease presentation. We present a case of 56-year-old female patient, without any medical history, with unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and night sweats since 3weeks. Initial differential diagnosis consisted of infectious disease, lymphoproliferative disease and autoimmune disease. Despite considerable diagnostic efforts, including serological tests for common infectious diseases, a CAT scan and histologic examination, no diagnosis was found. After reconsideration, serologic testing for syphilis was performed and was positive. Hereby, the final diagnosis of syphilis was made. Neurosyphilis and HIV coinfection were ruled out before treatment with benzylpenicillin was initiated. After which our patient made a full recovery. Treatment delay could have been considerably diminished if the localised lymphadenopathy was recognised as possible syphilitic disease. In future cases this could not only prevent further dissemination and potential morbidity in the individual patient as well as further emergence within the population.

The pathogenic role of Rickettsia slovaca was first demonstrated in 1997 in a patient who presented with a single inoculation lesion of the scalp and enlarged cervical lymph nodes after receiving a bite from a Dermacentor tick. Subsequently, we evaluated the occurrence of R. slovaca infections among patients living in France and Hungary who presented with these symptoms. R. slovaca infections were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 17 of 67 enrolled patients. Infections were most likely to occur in patients aged < 10 years and in patients who were bitten during the colder months of the year. The median duration of incubation for the disease was 7 days. Fever was present in only 2 patients, and only 1 patient developed a rash. Sequelae included persistent asthenia (3 cases) and localized alopecia (4 cases). Immunofluorescence and/or Western blot analysis detected antibodies in 50% of tested patients. Three Dermacentor ticks obtained from patients revealed R. slovaca by PCR.

### Bumps on my head – A case of acute T-Cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [^114ME8JC]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is an aggressive, rare neoplasm of immature T-cell precursors, typically presenting with lymphadenopathy, a mediastinal mass, and bone marrow involvement. We report the case of a 25-year-old man who presented with plaques and subcutaneous nodules on the scalp, forehead, and left cheek, accompanied by posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Immunohistochemical studies of intralesional punch, lymph node, and bone marrow biopsies confirmed a diagnosis of T-LBL. In addition, NOTCH1 oncogene mutations, a common feature of T-LBL, were detected. Although cutaneous involvement in T-LBL is rare and uncommonly the most prominent symptom, this case highlights a rare presentation with predominantly cutaneous manifestations. This emphasizes the importance of early recognition when malignancy is suspected to prevent the development of more severe complications.

### Lichen planopilaris associated with pembrolizumab in a patient with metastatic melanoma [^112SFVgD]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Case report

A 47-year-old man presented with a bleeding nodular growth on the scalp, diagnosed from biopsy results as melanoma. A wide local excision showed no evidence of residual disease, and sentinel lymph node biopsy result was negative for metastases. Several months later, the patient had a new scalp nodule, with pathology findings consistent with those of metastatic melanoma. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) found 2 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lesions in the left posterior scalp and right suboccipital region concerning for multifocal bilateral metastases. After 3 cycles of pembrolizumab, the patient noted growth and erythema of the nodule and palpable lymphadenopathy. A repeat PET-CT confirmed that the nodule in left posterior scalp had increased in size and FDG uptake, and there were new mildly FDG-avid cervical lymph nodes. He then received 2 cycles of ipilimumab leading to a clinical remission.

Approximately 2 months after his first pembrolizumab infusion and before starting ipilimumab, oral ulcers developed consistent with oral lichen planus. Several weeks after receiving ipilimumab, he noted gingival swelling and tenderness, hair loss, and scalp pruritus. Physical exam found round incomplete patches of alopecia with perifollicular erythema and scaling on the parietal scalp (Fig 1), diffuse alopecia on the vertex scalp, depigmentation of the hair overlying the metastatic melanoma nodule, and shallow ulcers on the lateral aspects of the tongue. Cutaneous lichenoid papules and oral Wickham striae were not observed. Scalp biopsy found prominent lichenoid inflammation limited to the upper portion of the outer root sheath of the majority of hair follicles, perifollicular fibrosis, and focal follicular scarring (Fig 2, A-D). Based on these findings and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of LPP was made.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and granulomatous lymphadenopathy [^116roVH9]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 12 year-old girl presented to KIST Medical College Teaching Hospital in 2011 with complaints of painless lymph node swelling in bilateral neck and axillae for three years, along with a history of weight loss, generalized weakness, and fever. However, there was no history of joint pain, skin rash, edema, hematuria, or bone pain at the presentation. There was no contact history of tuberculosis, and there was no history of similar illness or of autoimmune diseases in the family.

In 2008, she was evaluated at another hospital for lymphadenopathy which showed reactive changes in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and no further treatment was instituted. She had developed generalized swelling of her body in 2009 for which she was evaluated at a different institute and improved after taking oral medications for one month. However, detailed medical records were not available.

On examination, she was febrile, BP 100/60 mm Hg and was pale. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes in both cervical, axillary and inguinal regions which were soft, non tender and discrete with the largest measuring 5 cm × 5 cm in diameter. She had hepatosplenomegaly, but there was no edema, skin rash, or bone tenderness. Her BMI was 14.03 (below 3 rd percentile) and she was in prepubertal SMR stage.

She was evaluated keeping diagnostic possibilities of tuberculosis, HIV, connective tissue disease, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis as shown in Figure 1. Her investigations revealed as follow (Table 1).

### Helical tomotherapy of the complete scalp and the ipsilateral lymph nodes in a case of scalp angiosarcoma [^1136Z96Q]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Scalp angiosarcoma represents a therapeutic challenge to all disciplines. This case report demonstrates the potential usefulness of helical tomotherapy (HT) as a new radiotherapeutic treatment option. A 71-year-old woman presented with a superficial angiosarcoma of the scalp, forehead, and left pre- and postauricular areas, with several nodular ulcerating and bleeding lesions. Irradiation of the gross tumor was performed with a total dose of 70 Gy in 2-Gy fractions and of the left cervical lymph nodes with 56 Gy in 1.6-Gy fractions. Good target coverage was achieved without compromising organs at risk, notably the brain. Treatment was very fast (661 seconds per fraction) and was administered with minimal acute toxicity (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria: grade 2 erythema and grade 2 dysphagia). During treatment, tumor nodules dissolved into hyperkeratosis. We conclude that with HT, irradiation of the scalp and cervical lymph nodes can be conducted with minimal acute toxicity and without junction problems.

### Alopecia areata following semaglutide treatment for weight loss: a case report [^115cowqy]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 23-year-old female presented with a sudden onset of a well-demarcated round patch of hair loss on her scalp, which she noticed approximately 2 months ago. She is a nonsmoker, medically healthy except for well-controlled asthma, for which she uses Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol) 160 mcg for maintenance and salbutamol 100 mcg as needed, with no exacerbations in the past 3 years. She is active and has no significant psychosocial stressors in her life. In particular, past medical history is negative for skin or hair disorders, thyroid disease, and malignancy. The patient's family history was noncontributory except for an uncle with a diagnosis of Graves' disease and a brother with asthma. The patient's previous body mass index was approximately 30.20 kg/m 2, which classified her as obese. Prior to her hair presentation, the patient had been using semaglutide for weight loss over the past 4 months and lost 10 kg. Her iron-deficiency anemia was corrected before starting semaglutide. Initially, she started on 0.25 mg once weekly for the first 2 months, followed by 0.5 mg once weekly during the third and fourth months. Notably, the first single well-demarcated round patch of hair loss appeared during the third month of semaglutide treatment, after the dose was increased to 0.5 mg. The patient first noticed it on the crown area (approximately 1.1 cm in size), which developed gradually without associated symptoms like pain, redness, or itching. Following the next month, the round patch of hair loss has increased in size, and other similar patches have developed, prompting the patient to seek medical attention.

### Incomplete Kawasaki disease presenting as retropharyngeal abscess: a case report and review of the literature [^1118VP6K]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a cryptic and self-limiting vasculitis predominantly seen in children, often posing a diagnostic challenge due to its varied clinical presentations. Among these, the emergence of deep neck infections, particularly retropharyngeal abscesses, stands out as an extremely rare manifestation. Herein, we present a case of a 10-year-old girl who was hospitalized for fever, neck pain, swollen cervical lymph nodes, and increased inflammation markers. Although anti-infective treatment was initiated, her condition remained unchanged. A cervical computed tomography scan revealed an abscess in the retropharyngeal space. Remarkably, on the third day post-admission, the patient developed symptoms synonymous with KD, such as conjunctival redness, reddened lips, and a strawberry tongue. Subsequent treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and oral aspirin led to swift symptom relief, including complete abscess resolution verified by a follow-up neck magnetic resonance imaging. This unique co-presentation of KD and a retropharyngeal abscess, possibly linked to infections like Streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus, underscores the importance of quick diagnosis and KD management, especially when conventional treatments prove ineffective.

### A case of atopic dermatitis with alopecia universalis in a patient treated with abrocitinib [^113xKGkU]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

We present the case of a 14-year-old girl with a history of AD since childhood, a 3-year history of AU, and allergic rhinitis. According to her parents, she developed a rash combined with gradual full-body hair loss 3 years previously, over the 4 months after receiving a measles-mumps-rubella vaccination injection (Fig 1, A - C). Routine laboratory tests revealed an increasing immunoglobulin E level (> 5000 kU/L) and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (> 300 U/L). Physical examination showed generalized symmetrical red patches and plaques on the limbs and trunk, with several ulcers and scabs. She was diagnosed with severe AD (Investigator's Global Assessment = 4). Prior to consultation, she had experienced no significant changes with the use of topical steroids, oral antihistamines, and Chinese acupuncture treatments. Therefore, the patient was treated with abrocitinib (200 mg), administered orally once every day. After 12 weeks of treatment, she noted patchy hair regrowth on all affected body parts, which indicated an effective therapy. Fifty-two weeks after the initiation of therapy, thick regrowth of terminal hairs was noted on her scalp, eyebrows, limbs, and axillae (Fig 1, D and E). Meanwhile, the AD lesions subsided (Investigator's Global Assessment = 1) after abrocitinib administration (Fig 1, F). At present, which is more than 2 years after therapy initiation, the patient's AU symptoms are completely relieved, and AD lesions relapsed mildly (Investigator's Global Assessment ≤ 2) after the follow-up period.

CLINICAL COURSE

The average time between contact with monkeypox virus and symptoms is 5–13 days, with a range of 4–17 days. The classic features of the infection include fever, lymphadenopathy, malaise, headache, and muscle aches. Lymphadenopathy may occur in the submandibular, cervical, axillary, or inguinal regions and may be unilateral or bilateral. Typically, a rash develops approximately 1–4 days after these prodromal symptoms, characterized as deep-seated, vesicular, or pustular, most often beginning centrally and spreading to the limbs. The rash can last 2–4 weeks, progressing through stages including macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and eventually scabs and crusts. The rash often can leave scars. The lesions are firm, well circumscribed, may be umbilicated or confluent, and may be in varied stages of progression at different sites. An example of the rash is provided in Figure 1. Additional photographs are available at:

Fig. 1.
Photographs of the rash. Panels A and B show scattered papulovesicular lesions on the chest that were present 2 days before admission. The lesions measure 2 mm in diameter, are filled with clear fluid, and have surrounding erythema. Panel C shows a lesion on the right palm that was present at the time of admission.

### Isoradiotopic response of lichen planus after radiotherapy of the breast [^115ywLFw]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case

A 64-year-old woman with invasive lobular carcinoma received radiation treatment of the right breast and axilla. She received a total dose of 61 Gy in 33 fractions after undergoing lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. In 2015, 3 months after completion of radiation treatment, she reported having a pruritic, irritating rash localized to the radiation field. Physical examination found multiple 4- to 8-mm well-demarcated, violaceous papules on her right axilla, lateral breast, and inframammary fold confined to the radiation site (Fig 1). The papules exhibited fine overlying scale without white lines indicative of Wickham striae. There was no evidence of scalp, mucosal, or nail involvement. Three to four months before the onset of rash, she was started on anastrozole and zoledronic acid injections. The patient had no history of liver disease, and her dermatologic history was unremarkable except for a single asymptomatic pink papule in the right axilla in 2011 and a subtle pink plaque on the left upper back in 2013, which a punch biopsy determined to be nodular granulomatous mixed dermatitis. Biopsy of the new rash found changes suggestive of LP including vacuolar alteration of the basal layer, dyskeratosis, and a bandlike infiltrate of lymphocytes and occasional eosinophils (Fig 2). Her symptoms were well controlled with application of 0.1% triamcinolone ointment 1 to 2 times per day, 3 times per week. In 2016, 10 months after her initial presentation, she returned with 2 new pruritic papules on her upper right posterior shoulder resembling the initial eruption (Fig 3).

### Clinical course, antifungal susceptibility, and genomic sequencing of trichophyton indotineae [^115535KA]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this case series is the largest US cohort describing T indotineae infections and highlights several important points. Patients experienced extensive, prolonged pruritic lesions that generally failed monotherapy with topical antifungals and showed inadequate response to typical doses and durations of oral antifungal medications, including prolonged terbinafine therapy at standard doses, consistent with findings from international reports. Diagnostic delays were common, and most patients did not have immunocompromising conditions that might predispose them to severe dermatophytosis. These findings, in addition to others (eg, recent travel to a high-prevalence region and/or initial laboratory culture identification of T mentagrophytes or T interdigitale in patients with compatible physical examination findings and history) should prompt consideration of T indotineae, which requires molecular-based techniques for definitive diagnosis. Because T indotineae identification was retrospective in most cases described in this report, treating dermatologists were often unaware of T indotineae diagnosis at the time of treatment, likely leading to the selection of ineffective or suboptimal antifungal treatment. Data highlight that 100-mg or 200-mg daily dosing of itraconazole for 6 to 8 weeks is the current preferred therapy, yet longer durations and higher doses may be required with reported relapse occurring. Terbinafine at higher than standard doses (500 mg daily) may be effective for some patients. Griseofulvin and fluconazole show limited efficacy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^116WHrmw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer systemic chemotherapy approach — sequential monotherapy is preferred and treatment duration should be individualized with shared decision-making: The NCCN Panel finds no compelling evidence that combination chemotherapy is superior to sequential single agents; therefore, sequential monotherapy is preferred and combination therapy is useful in patients with rapid clinical progression or need for rapid symptom and/or disease control. Usually the first-line regimens are given until progression or unacceptable toxicity, and adverse effects may require dose reduction and cessation of chemotherapy prior to disease progression. The NCCN Panel recommends considering scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy. Determining the duration of chemotherapy in an individual patient typically depends on the efficacy and tolerability and shared decision-making between the treating physician and patient, and at each reassessment clinicians should assess the value of ongoing treatment, the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic therapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a shared decision-making process.

Case 2

A 77-year-old white man with coronary artery disease and history of localized prostatic adenocarcinoma underwent margin-negative resection of an apical scalp MCC in January 2016. PET/CT showed no detectable metastases. Within 2 weeks, palpable left postauricular and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy developed. PET/CT in February 2016 found regional recurrence in 2 posterior mastoid lymph nodes with a maximum SUV of 9.3 and extensive left cervical lymphadenopathy involving stations IIA and IIB with a maximum SUV of 11 (Fig 2) and bidimensional measurements provided in Table I. Serology testing performed at the University of Washington was negative for antibody against MCPyV oncoprotien. The lymphadenopathy was rapidly progressive with 4 distinctly palpable left cervical lymph nodes up to 3 cm in diameter and a 2-cm left posterior mastoid node at treatment initiation. With the patient's consent, TVEC was administered intratumorally into all palpable metastases across the left side of the neck and posterior mastoid regions using standard dosing according to the product insert but with less than the maximum 4-mL dose to contain cost. He received an initial dose of 1 mL of 10⁶ PFU/mL TVEC on February 19, 2016 followed by maintenance doses of 1 to 2 mL of 10⁸ PFU/mL at 2-week intervals on 7 occasions from March 18 to June 23, 2016. Toxicity was limited to mild fatigue, nausea, and injection site tenderness. A PET/CT on May 6, 2016 showed a partial response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria with 36% reduction in index lesions (Table I). A neck CT scan on September 16, 2016 found continued shrinkage of index lesions by 46% compared with baseline with residual radiographic findings in the mastoid region thought to represent linear scarring (Table I). The level IIA and IIB lymph nodes had new central necrosis on the September 2016 examination (Fig 2). PET/CT scan in late January 2017 showed resolution of hypermetabolism aside from a single left level IIA node with diminishing SUV and further shrinkage of index lesions by 62% from baseline (Table I). He was asymptomatic with normal physical examination 11 months after treatment initiation and 7 months after the last TVEC dose.

### Recurrent granular cell tumor: how to treat [^112zWDqF]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Granular cell tumor is an uncommon lesion usually located in the head and neck region (50%) with a female sex predominance. It is believed to be of primitive neuroectodermal origin. Typical clinical presentation is a small, uninflamed, slowly growing, yellowish mass approximately 2 cm in diameter. Granular cell tumor has a peculiar clinical behavior ranging from clearly benign, locally aggressive, or manifestly malignant. Treatment is surgical excision, but recurrences are possible. In this article, we present a case of recurrent benign granular cell tumor with the discussion of the treatment modalities. The patient was a 16-year-old girl with a 3-year history of a painless mass on the right side of her neck. The mass was excised two times at different centers and diagnosed as granular cell tumor after the pathologic examination. The time interval between the operations and recurrences was approximately 1 year. On physical examination, a yellowish, firm, nodular mass measuring approximately 2 x 1 cm was noted. Cervical lymph nodes were evaluated with ultrasonography preoperatively to exclude metastasis and no pathologic lymph nodes were noted. The lesion was excised under local anesthesia with a 1-cm safe margin and the resulting defect was closed primarily after undermining of the wound edges. Postoperatively, the wound began to heal with a hypertrophic scar and immediate precautions were taken. Topical steroid treatment and silicone blocks were applied. Now the patient is in the sixth postoperative month and followed up every month for signs of recurrence.

### Cutaneous metastases from adenocarcinoma of the ovary [^115QgB82]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

A 24-year-old Hispanic woman presented with a 3-month history of painful, pruritic, progressive rash localized to both breasts. Her medical history was significant for refractory metastatic stage IIIB mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary diagnosed 10 months before appearance of the rash. Initial management included right salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, stripping of bladder peritoneum, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, and appendectomy. She declined adjuvant chemotherapy and completion surgery in a desire to preserve fertility. Five months after treatment she presented with abdominal pain, bilateral hydronephrosis, renal failure, ascites, and computed tomography findings consistent with recurrence of her ovarian adenocarcinoma, and 3 months later the rash began.

She was not on chemotherapy at presentation. The rash initially manifested near her port site on the right chest wall and was attributed to allergic contact dermatitis from ChloraPrep (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Over the next 2 months, the patient described enlargement and hardening of bilateral breasts, originating on the right and spreading to the left. Her medical history was otherwise normal.

On physical examination, bilateral breasts were tender to palpation and exhibited diffuse dermal induration and taut skin with erythematous and hyperpigmented patches (Fig 1). There was no nipple discharge, peau d' orange, nodular infiltrates, or axillary, cervical, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Findings for the remainder of the full-body skin examination were normal with the exception of a large suprapubic abdominal mass noted on deep palpation.

Histopathologic examination of skin from the left breast found tumor cells and mucin resembling primary tumor. Immunostaining for estrogen and progesterone receptors, mammaglobulin, and gross cystic disease fluid were negative. The patient was discharged home to hospice care and died 4 months after appearance of the rash.

The Study

This research has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Medical Foundation (approval nos. 202001561B0 and 202300067B0). The patient consent was waived by the institutional review board.

Case-patient 1 was a 10-year-old boy who had abrupt onset of a scalp lesion that was 0.5 cm in diameter initially and evolved rapidly over the following 2 days. Physical examination showed a round erythematous plaque studded with multiple pustules and hair loss on his scalp measuring ≈3 cm in diameter. He had no history of animal or soil contact and had not visited a barbershop before the onset.

On the basis of a clinical diagnosis of tinea capitis, pus was collected for fungal and bacterial cultures, and treatment with oral griseofulvin (500 mg/d) was started. Nine days after treatment started, rashes appeared on the patient's face, ears, trunk, arms, and legs. The treatment was changed to oral terbinafine (250 mg/d) because of a suspected allergic drug reaction. However, the rashes persisted, so his parents stopped treatment after 2 doses of terbinafine. The rashes disappeared thereafter, and the scalp lesion also resolved gradually during the following 2 weeks.

At a follow-up visit, the residual lesion was a round erythematous hairless patch (Figure 1, panel A). Two residual broken hairs were noted by dermoscopy but were negative for fungal spores on microscopy. Fungal culture was performed on a sample collected by using a sterile shampoo brush, but the result was negative.

### Initial check… [^113iJXmx]. atsdr.cdc.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial Check Course: WB 2490 CE Original Date: November 28, 2014 CE Renewal Date: November 28, 2016 CE Expiration Date: November 28, 2018 en Español Download Printer-Friendly Version pdf icon. This Initial Check will help you assess your current knowledge about Environmental Triggers of Asthma. To take the Initial Check, read the case below, and then answer the questions that follow. A 12-year-old girl arrives at your office with her mother for an evaluation of the child's cough. The mother reports that the child has a nocturnal nonproductive cough 2 to 3 times per month for the past 3 months associated with increasing episodes of shortness of breath that usually resolve spontaneously. However, during soccer games, the girl has recurrent episodes of cough and wheezing that are only relieved when she uses a friend's albuterol inhaler.

Past medical history reveals that the patient has had recurrent upper respiratory infections and had bronchitis 2 years ago. The patient has had no hospitalizations or emergency department visits. Current medications include diphenhydramine for her intermittent runny nose and an occasional puff from her friend's albuterol inhaler during soccer games. Family history reveals that the girl lives with her mother, father, and older sister in a house on the outskirts of the community. The father had a history of seasonal hay fever as a child. Both parents are indoor and outdoor smokers. The mother reports that her husband has had some difficulties with episodic cough and shortness of breath, but has not seen a physician. A review of systems reveals that the patient has numerous episodes of
- Sneezing,
- Itchy eyes, and
- Clear discharge from the nose. You ask the mother to leave the examination room.

This allows you to ask the patient confidentially if she has been smoking or is around friends who smoke. The patient states that neither she nor any of her friends smoke cigarettes or any other inhaled substances, such as marijuana. In addition, the patient has not reached menarche and she denies sexual activity. The patient has met developmental milestones and followed a 50th-percentile growth curve. She is a 7th grader doing well academically, with no school absences. Physical examination reveals a young girl, who sits quietly and comfortably, in no apparent distress. Her vital signs are
- Temperature 98. 6º F,
- Respiratory rate 17,
- Heart rate 82,
- Blood pressure 118/75 millimeter of mercury. No dyspnea or stridor is evident. Her skin color is normal, without cyanosis. Examination of the nares reveals boggy, red turbinates with moderate congestion, but no sinus tenderness or flaring. The tympanic membranes are mobile and without erythema or air/fluid levels.

Inspection of the chest does not show accessory muscle use or intercostal, suprasternal, or supraclavicular retractions. The antero-posterior diameter does not seem to be increased. Pulmonary auscultation reveals inspiratory and expiratory wheezing scattered throughout both lung fields. Her peak expiratory flow rate reading is 285 liters per minute. You explain to the patient and her mother that her predicted normal should be 360 L/min, which is the predicted normal PEFR for her age and build. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. The fingers are not clubbed, nor are the nail beds cyanotic. Your primary working diagnosis for this patient is asthma.
- List the primary and differential diagnosis for wheezing in this patient.
- What are some risk factors for asthma in this patient and her family.
- What further questions might you ask about other environmental triggers of asthma in this household.

### Head lice… [^113AoKR2]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Permethrin leaves a residue on the hair that is designed to kill nymphs emerging from the 20% to 30% of nits not killed with the first application. 23 A repeat application is recommended between day 9 and 10 after initial treatment if live lice are seen in the interim, with evidence based on the life cycle of head lice suggesting that retreatment at day 9 may be ideal. 24 An alternate treatment schedule on days 0, 7, and 13 to 15 has been proposed on the basis of the longest possible life cycle of lice.
25. These products are available OTC in shampoo or mousse formulations for people 24 months and older. The product is applied to dry hair and left on for 10 minutes before rinsing out. Hair should not be shampooed for 24 to 48 hours after application. Unlike permethrin, no residual pediculicidal activity remains after rinsing. Because 20% to 30% of nits remain viable after treatment. Ivermectin Ivermectin, a widely used anthelmintic agent, increases the chloride ion permeability of muscle cells, resulting in hyperpolarization, paralysis, and death of lice. 31 This medication was approved in a lotion form by the FDA in 2012 for people 6 months and older for head lice and was approved for OTC use in late 2020. Topical ivermectin lotion is applied to dry hair and rinsed after 10 minutes. Hair should not be shampooed for 24 to 48 hours after application. Only 1 application is required, because when the treated nits hatch, the lice are not able to feed as a result of pharyngeal muscle paralysis and, therefore, are not viable. 32 Two randomized controlled trials in the United States reported the effectiveness of 0. 5% ivermectin lotion 14 days after a single application to be 71% and 76%.

31 Adverse effects are rare and include skin or eye irritation and erythema, burning, or dryness.
31. The oral formulation of ivermectin is FDA-approved for treatment of head lice in adult patients, although it does not have this indication in pediatrics. However, it is approved for treatment of other infections in pediatric patients, so it can be used for the treatment of head lice in pediatric patients. Oral ivermectin is only available by prescription and should only be used if head lice is resistant to all topical FDA-approved treatments. Treatment with 2 single oral doses of 200 μg/kg, spaced 7 to 10 days apart, has been shown to be effective against head lice. 15, 33, 34 Comparisons of oral ivermectin versus malathion lotion has demonstrated that oral ivermectin, with a single dose of 400 μg/kg and repeated 7 days later, is comparable or more effective than 0. 5% malathion lotion.

35 Concerns have previously been raised that ivermectin could cross the blood/brain barrier and block essential neural transmission and that young children may be at higher risk of resulting adverse drug reaction. However, ivermectin acts principally on glutamate-dependent chloride channels in nerve and muscle cells in nonmammals, and these are absent in mammals. Ivermectin might have theoretical effects on central nervous system gamma-aminobutyric acid channels resulting in inhibition of neurotransmission. However, there have been a small number of studies that have begun to document the relative safety and low rate of adverse effects of ivermectin use in infants weighing < 15 kg treated for scabies. 36, 37 Therefore, oral ivermectin should be used with caution for children who weigh < 15 kg until more data are available. 34, 35 Although ivermectin-resistant head lice is not well documented, 2 cases of probable ivermectin resistance have been observed outside the United States. 38.
