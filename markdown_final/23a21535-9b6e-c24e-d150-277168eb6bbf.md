## Question

Causes of pancreatitis in 90 year old female

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of pancreatitis in a 90-year-old woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why age and sex matter for etiologies. Then, I should verify the most likely cause in this demographic. Next, I will review other important etiologies that remain relevant in the very elderly. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach and what guidelines recommend. Finally, I will consider management implications and recurrence prevention, while double-checking for pitfalls like drug-induced pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia from non-pancreatic sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why age and sex shift the etiologic spectrum. In patients aged 75 years and older, biliary etiology dominates, while alcohol-related, drug-induced, and hypertriglyceridemia-related pancreatitis become uncommon, and females predominate in this older cohort, which aligns with contemporary regional cohorts and reviews of elderly-onset pancreatitis [^13f3fc71] [^9354d0fd] [^f403ee25].

> I will now examine the most likely cause. Biliary pancreatitis is the leading etiology in the very elderly, with a median age around 65–67 years and a strong female predominance; importantly, the proportion of biliary pancreatitis rises with age and is markedly higher in those ≥ 75 years, consistent with gallstone disease prevalence and cholestasis risk in older women [^41f777c7] [^13f3fc71] [^9354d0fd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review other etiologies that, while less common, still merit consideration in a 90-year-old. Drug-induced pancreatitis is less frequent in the very old but can occur, particularly with polypharmacy; case reports and series implicate agents like doxycycline and olanzapine, so a meticulous medication reconciliation is essential before labeling a case idiopathic [^045563c3] [^753eeb0c] [^cbb67829]. Neoplasm-associated pancreatitis increases with age and should be actively considered when no other cause is found, especially in patients over 40; guidelines recommend evaluating for a pancreatic tumor in older adults with idiopathic pancreatitis, and MRCP or EUS can be instrumental when ultrasound is nondiagnostic [^350d03e7] [^8488bc71]. Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis is rare in the very elderly but should still be checked when gallstones and alcohol are absent, with a threshold of > 1,000 mg/dL supporting causation [^25783f95] [^d69f9e2a]. Idiopathic pancreatitis remains a significant category even after initial evaluation, so I need to ensure a thorough, guideline-concordant workup before accepting that label [^1f8c9f85].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't miss a reversible cause. Transabdominal ultrasound is first-line to evaluate for biliary disease, but a negative study does not exclude a passed stone or microlithiasis; repeating ultrasound, MRCP, or EUS improves diagnostic yield and is recommended in idiopathic cases or when initial imaging is inconclusive [^8488bc71] [^ee8c2885]. I should confirm that serum triglycerides and calcium are checked when gallstones and alcohol are not identified, and I need to remember that lipase is more specific and remains elevated longer than amylase, which helps in delayed presentations [^25783f95] [^c90c92b1]. But wait, what if the enzyme elevation is non-pancreatic? Hyperamylasemia can arise from salivary sources or tumors, so I should correlate with clinical context and imaging to avoid misattribution [^05ecac8a] [^84159483].

> I need to ensure I address management and recurrence prevention, because etiology guides therapy. For confirmed biliary pancreatitis, definitive biliary therapy reduces recurrence; in elderly patients, the balance of procedural risk versus benefit must be individualized, and ERCP with sphincterotomy or stenting and cholecystectomy when feasible are standard considerations, with data suggesting ERCP can be safe even in nonagenarians when clinically indicated [^0cd09866] [^f403ee25]. If a drug is suspected, discontinuation is critical; if a tumor is found, oncologic management is indicated; if hypertriglyceridemia is causal, aggressive lipid-lowering and dietary measures are warranted, though this is less common in the very old [^25783f95] [^9ddfa9b8].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. In a 90-year-old woman, the pretest probability strongly favors biliary pancreatitis, but I should actively exclude drug-induced disease, neoplasm, and metabolic causes like hypertriglyceridemia through a structured, guideline-based evaluation before concluding idiopathic disease, because identifying the cause changes both acute management and long-term recurrence prevention [^8488bc71] [^350d03e7] [^25783f95].

---

In a 90-year-old female, the most common cause of pancreatitis is **biliary disease** (gallstones or sludge) [^476adaf6], accounting for roughly 60–70% of cases, with incidence rising with age and female sex [^41f777c7] [^13f3fc71]. Other important causes include **drug-induced pancreatitis** (e.g. thiazides, ACE inhibitors, statins, antibiotics) [^28f9f08c] [^045563c3], **malignancy** (pancreatic or ampullary tumors) [^350d03e7], and **idiopathic** cases after standard evaluation [^1f8c9f85]. Alcohol, hypertriglyceridemia, and trauma are less common at this age, but should still be considered when clinically relevant [^13f3fc71]. Evaluation should prioritize ultrasound for biliary disease [^8488bc71], medication review, and cross-sectional imaging if no cause is found, given the higher risk of neoplasm in older adults [^350d03e7].

---

## Most common cause: biliary disease

Biliary disease — gallstones or biliary sludge causing obstruction or inflammation — is the **most common cause** of pancreatitis in elderly women, with incidence increasing with age and female sex [^41f777c7] [^13f3fc71]. Gallstone disease is prevalent in older adults due to cholesterol metabolism changes and decreased gallbladder motility [^notfound].

---

## Other common causes

### Drug-induced pancreatitis

Medications are a **significant cause** of pancreatitis in the elderly because of polypharmacy [^045563c3]. Common culprits include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, statins, and antibiotics (e.g. doxycycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^045563c3] [^9e5763ad]. Drug-induced pancreatitis is often underrecognized in older adults [^045563c3].

---

### Malignancy

Pancreatic or ampullary tumors can cause obstruction and inflammation, leading to pancreatitis [^7c6697b2]. The risk of **pancreatic cancer** increases with age, making malignancy an important consideration in older adults with pancreatitis [^350d03e7].

---

### Idiopathic pancreatitis

Despite thorough evaluation, a significant proportion of cases remain idiopathic [^1f8c9f85]. Advances in imaging and endoscopic techniques have reduced the proportion of idiopathic cases, but it remains a common diagnosis in elderly patients [^1f8c9f85].

---

## Less common causes

- **Alcohol**: Less common in very elderly patients, but chronic alcohol use can still contribute to pancreatitis [^13f3fc71].
- **Hypertriglyceridemia**: Rare in this age group, but should be considered if no other cause is identified [^13f3fc71].
- **Trauma**: Minimal trauma, such as falls, can cause pancreatitis in frail elderly patients.
- **Infections**: Viral infections (e.g. mumps, cytomegalovirus) can rarely cause pancreatitis.

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause:

- **Clinical history**: Detailed history of alcohol use, medication use, trauma, and symptoms.
- **Laboratory tests**: Serum amylase, lipase, liver function tests, calcium, triglycerides, and inflammatory markers.
- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound is the first-line modality to assess for gallstones or biliary sludge [^8488bc71]. If ultrasound is inconclusive, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be indicated [^ee8c2885].
- **Endoscopic evaluation**: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be necessary if biliary obstruction is suspected [^0cd09866].

---

## Clinical implications

Pancreatitis in elderly patients carries **higher morbidity and mortality** due to comorbidities and delayed presentation [^5b71aaad]. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate management are critical to improving outcomes [^ffd688fd].

---

In a 90-year-old female, **biliary disease** is the most common cause of pancreatitis, followed by drug-induced pancreatitis, malignancy, and idiopathic cases. A comprehensive evaluation, including clinical history, laboratory tests, and imaging, is essential to identify the underlying cause and guide management.

Age and sex patterns

No statistically significant differences in the incidence, prevalence, or YLDs were observed between women and men in all age groups. The prevalence rate increased with age, peaking in the 95 plus age group in both females and males in 2017. However, the number of prevalent cases increased with age, reaching its highest level in the 60–64 and 45–49 age groups for females and males, respectively, after which the trend decreased with increasing age. The number of prevalent cases was higher in males than in females at the age of 60–64 years, after which the number in males was lower than that in females. The number of prevalent cases was lower in both sexes below 20 years age and above 90 years age (Fig. 3). The incidence rate increased with age, peaking in the 95 plus age group for both females and males in 2017. The number of incident cases peaked in the 60–64 age group in females, whereas the peak in males occurred in the 40–44 age group. The numbers of incident cases were also higher in males younger than 55 years than in females, whereas the numbers of incident cases were lower in males than females in the 55 years and older age group. The lowest incident case was found in patients younger than 20 years and older than 90 years (Additional file 2: Fig.S8). The patterns of the YLDs rates and numbers by sex and age group were similar to the prevalence patterns (Additional file 2: Fig. S9).

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common yet polymorphic disease that requires clinicians to be vigilant early in the course. From benign, self-limited abdominal pain to a systemic inflammatory syndrome resulting in pancreatic necrosis and/or organ failure, there is a spectrum of disease. The diagnosis and management of AP is challenging. Through a clinical vignette of inappropriate patient management, we highlight recommendations and advice from the recent guideline for treating this difficult disease.

### Epidemiology of acute pancreatitis: the influence of age and gender in a regional population [^773b6d63]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Striking age-related etiologic differences were observed. BAP was significantly more common in patients ≥ 75 years, while AAP, DIAP, and HTG-AP were more frequent in younger patients. These patterns emphasize the need for age stratified approaches in both diagnosis and management.

Although the primary aim was to explore etiologic trends, we also evaluated severity, LOS, and mortality. Some studies suggest AAP and HTG-AP may have more severe courses. In our cohort no significant association between etiology and severity was observed, likely due to the predominance of BAP and smaller size of other etiologies. Severity increased with age, particularly in patients over 75 years old. As expected, LOS correlated with AP severity.

In-hospital mortality was low (1.8%), with only 8 deaths during admission. Most of these occurred in patients with moderately severe or severe AP, often involving multi-organ failure. Our findings align with literature. In contrast, post-discharge 90-day mortality was 6.3%, mainly among older patients due to neoplasms or cardiovascular events. Notably, many of these patients were initially classified as mild AP, highlighting the importance of monitoring post-discharge outcomes, particularly in elderly patients.

This study is subject to several limitations. First, it represents a regional and exploratory analysis conducted at a single tertiary referral center, which may introduce referral bias and limit the generalizability of the findings to broader or more diverse populations. Second, the retrospective design is inherently prone to bias due to missing, incomplete, or inconsistently recorded data. Third, the sample sizes of certain etiological subgroups (e.g. DIAP, HTG-AP, and neoplasm-associated AP) were relatively small, limiting the statistical power to detect meaningful differences between groups. Fourth, cases with multiple contributing etiologies were categorized according to the presumed dominant cause, which may have obscured the role of multifactorial pathogenesis. Lastly, post-discharge mortality was assessed only through readmissions or follow-up within our center, potentially missing deaths that occurred outside the institutional system and thus underestimating the 90-day mortality rate.

### Acute pancreatitis in the elderly: a cause for increased concern? [^5b71aaad]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an aggressive and potentially fatal clinical condition. Although all age groups are at risk, the elderly may be a group of special concern. We aimed at evaluating clinical outcomes of patients with elderly-onset AP.

Materials and Methods

Using a single-center retrospective database, treatment and follow-up records of 550 patients admitted with AP were reviewed. Outcomes included mortality, admission to the ICU, need for interventional procedures, nutritional support, and length of hospital and ICU stay. Elderly-onset AP was defined as an episode of AP occurring in patients older than 65 years.

Results

A total of 263 patients were classified as having elderly-onset AP. There was an association between older age and higher Ranson and the bedside index of severity in AP scores, translating into longer lengths of hospital stay, higher requirements for ICU admission, interventional procedures, organ failure, persistent organ failure, and overall mortality. In multivariate analysis, age was an independent predictor of mortality in AP.

Conclusions

Age was strongly associated with a more severe course of AP. Early recognition and prompt action are essential to improve outcomes in this population.

### Acute pancreatitis [^476adaf6]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas. Acute abdominal pain is the most common symptom, and increased concentrations of serum amylase and lipase confirm the diagnosis. Pancreatic injury is mild in 80% of patients, who recover without complications. The remaining patients have a severe disease with local and systemic complications. Gallstone migration into the common bile duct and alcohol abuse are the most frequent causes of pancreatitis in adults. About 15–25% of pancreatitis episodes are of unknown origin. Treatment of mild disease is supportive, but severe episodes need management by a multidisciplinary team including gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, intensivists, and surgeons. Improved understanding of pathophysiology and better assessments of disease severity should ameliorate the management and outcome of this complex disease.

Conclusions

In summary, the age-standardized incidence, mortality and DALY rates of acute pancreatitis decreased gradually in the globe. However, the overall burden remains high with aging population, and will not decrease without effective strategies to address associated risk factors. The attributable burden is higher in males and elderly, and alcohol etiology is an important driver that contribute to the morbidity and mortality. There were substantial differences in the burden of acute pancreatitis across regions, geographically targeted considerations are needed to tailor future interventions to relieve the burden of acute pancreatitis in specific countries, especially for Eastern Europe.

### Acute pancreatitis [^ffd688fd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is one of the most common reasons for gastroenterology-related hospitalization in the United States. With significant morbidity and subsequent mortality related to both the acute presentation and subsequent sequelae, prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are critical, especially in the first 24 hours of illness. It is also important to accurately recognize complications, such as pancreatic fluid collections and vascular events, and identify a definitive cause so that a strategy to prevent future attacks can be implemented.

Introduction

AP represents an acute inflammatory condition of the pancreas. It poses a significant global health challenge due to its rising incidence, potential for severe complications, and substantial healthcare burden. AP is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases requiring hospitalization in our center. A multitude of factors can trigger AP, including gallstones, alcohol abuse, hypertriglyceridemia, certain medications, post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, hypercalcemia, infections, trauma, autoimmune diseases, anatomical abnormalities, neoplasms, and rare causes. When a definitive etiology cannot be identified, the condition is classified as idiopathic. The distribution of these etiologies varies considerably based on geographic region and socioeconomic status, adding complexity to the understanding and management of AP.

Defining the demographics and understanding the varied etiologies across different age and sex groups, as well as the associated outcomes of AP, is paramount for developing tailored diagnosis and management policies to improve patient prognosis. Conflicting findings regarding the prevalence of diverse etiological factors underscore the need for further research in regional populations. Furthermore, the influence of age and sex on the etiology of AP remains an ongoing subject of investigation. While some studies suggest minimal impact, others report significant associations. These discrepancies highlight the importance of regionally examining the interplay between demographics and AP etiology. This study aimed to assess the effect of age and gender on the distribution of AP etiologies and related clinical outcomes within Southwestern Turkey, which may provide insights to inform personalized diagnostic and management strategies.

### Epidemiology of acute pancreatitis: the influence of age and gender in a regional population [^41f777c7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Etiology across sex and age groups

We analyzed the relationship between age, sex, and etiology in 445 patients with AP. For each etiology, we reported the median age. To determine the significance of the difference in distribution ratio of each etiology across age categories, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the data. To assess the trends between age and each of the seven etiological categories of AP, separate linear regression analyses were performed using age as the independent variable, and binary-coded etiology variables (1 = presence, 0 = absence) as dependent outcomes. The significance of gender difference is analyzed by chi-square tests.

BAP was the most common subtype and predominantly observed in older individuals, with a median age of 65.5 years (IQR: 54–76). The distribution of biliary etiology varied significantly across age categories (p < 0.001), with a significant linear trend indicating increasing prevalence of biliary etiology with advancing age (p = 0.002). Additionally, biliary etiology was more common in females than males (56.8% vs. 43.2%), and this sex-based difference was statistically significant (p = 0.007).

DIAGNOSIS OF AND DETERMINATION OF THE ETIOLOGY AP

The diagnosis of AP in this patient is straightforward. He is presenting with characteristic abdominal pain with a markedly elevated lipase. A computed tomography (CT) scan is not needed in this patient. It will not assist in diagnosis nor be useful in predicting severity, especially as most patients (80%) will improve. CT should be reserved for the patient who presents with atypical symptoms and/or mild elevations of the amylase/lipase which could be nonspecific.

The etiology of the AP in this patient is not clear. Identifying the etiology is important for potentially preventing recurrent pancreatitis. Biliary and alcohol are the most common causes of AP. Although the US is indicated as an initial evaluation of AP, the negative examination does not rule out biliary etiology. A stone in the gallbladder may have passed to the common bile duct and be missed by the US whether it has or has not passed to the duodenum. Although initial US may be negative, given prevalence of biliary pancreatitis, the examination should be repeated on an outpatient basis if no other etiology is found. Alcohol is a common cause of AP but requires a relatively large amount of alcohol (50 g) consumption over multiple years to cause pancreatic disease. Could a medication, such as semaglutide, have caused the AP? Not likely, as there is little evidence that most medications cause AP. Although the triglyceride is lower than 1,000 mg/dL, an outpatient repeat evaluation will be needed. Given the patient's age, there is a small but real risk of a tumor causing AP, an outpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography should be performed if no etiology is identified. It is common that no etiology is identified. Such patients are correctly identified as having idiopathic AP whose further management is complex and controversial.

### Epidemiology of acute pancreatitis: the influence of age and gender in a regional population [^4f32850f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

HTG-AP was observed in the youngest subgroup overall, with a median age of 45 years (IQR: 38–47), showing a significant decreasing age trend (p < 0.001). Although 64.3% of these patients were male, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.211), possibly due to limited sample size or confounding metabolic factors.

Neoplasm-related AP was found predominantly in older patients, with a median age of 70 years (IQR: 66–79), and increasing age trend was significant (p = 0.008). Despite a slightly higher proportion of males (57.9%), sex differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.371).

Other miscellaneous causes, which included fewer common etiologies, showed a broad age distribution (median age 68.5, IQR: 48–81) with no significant difference across age categories (p = 0.701) or trend (p = 0.552). Although only 25% of patients in this category were male, the sex difference did not reach significance (p = 0.076), possibly due to limited sample size. Altogether the results reflect the different pathophysiology and heterogeneous nature of this group.

### Acute pancreatitis [^1b2217a3]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Acute pancreatitis, an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas, is the leading cause of admission to hospital for gastrointestinal disorders in the USA and many other countries. Gallstones and alcohol misuse are long-established risk factors, but several new causes have emerged that, together with new aspects of pathophysiology, improve understanding of the disorder. As incidence (and admission rates) of acute pancreatitis increase, so does the demand for effective management. We review how to manage patients with acute pancreatitis, paying attention to diagnosis, differential diagnosis, complications, prognostic factors, treatment, and prevention of second attacks, and the possible transition from acute to chronic pancreatitis.

### Chronic pancreatitis: managing a difficult disease [^2a1c2ed8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by progressive, irreversible morphologic and functional changes that are most commonly attributed to environmental insults, particularly when there is a genetic or anatomic predisposition. Heavy alcohol use and cigarette smoking are the most common environmental risk factors, but both may be absent. Antecedent episodes of acute pancreatitis occur in about half of patients. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom and requires a tailored approach depending on the anatomic changes in the pancreas. Other clinical manifestations include diabetes mellitus, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, metabolic bone disease, pancreatic cancer, and anatomic complications. Current disease management is centered on risk factor reduction and screening for and treating disease complications. There are no current therapies to delay or retard disease progression, but there are ongoing efforts to more fully understand the natural history of chronic pancreatitis and underlying mechanisms of disease. These studies are expected to provide insights that will transform our approach to disease management and provide increased hope to patients.

### Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is safe and effective in patients 90 years of age and older [^0cd09866]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Goals

To review our experience of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients 90 years and older.

Background

ERCP is effective in the investigation and treatment of biliary disease; however, in the very elderly, a perception of high procedural risk and lack of efficacy may limit its use.

Study

Retrospective analysis of ERCPs performed on patients 90 years of age and older from one institution.

Results

Between 1987–2000, 23 ERCPs were performed on patients 90 years of age and more (16 women; age range, 90–96 years). The primary indications were obstructive jaundice (16 patients), pancreatitis (2), cholangitis (1), unexplained abdominal pain (1), and planned follow-up (3). The main endoscopic findings were common bile duct (CBD) stone (15 patients), pancreatic carcinoma (2), cholangiocarcinoma (2), and dilated duct (only 1). Sixteen sphincterotomies were performed, with successful common duct clearance in 10 patients. Seven biliary stents were inserted for benign disease and three, for malignancy. In two patients, CBD cannulation was unsuccessful. Three minor hemorrhages were controlled endoscopically. Three patients died of nonprocedural causes.

Conclusions

ERCP is safe and effective in the very elderly. The decision to undergo ERCP should be determined by clinical need.

### Editorial: drug-induced acute pancreatitis: uncommon or commonplace? [^28f9a08c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Many drugs have been implicated as causing acute pancreatitis (AP), mainly based on the recurrence of pancreatitis following rechallenge with a drug that the patient had been taking at the time of an initial episode of AP. However, estimates of the relative frequency with which drugs cause AP vary widely. This is largely because many patients may be taking a number of drugs, may have co-morbidities such as gallstone disease or hypertriglyceridemia, or may be consuming large amounts of alcohol, making it difficult to determine what actually is the primary cause of an episode of AP. Large, rigorously designed epidemdiological studies are needed to better define the frequency with which the drugs in general cause AP and the specific risk of pancreatitis associated with any individual drug.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on Initial management of acute pancreatitis [^8ab34b60]. Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — diagnostic criteria and etiologies specify that diagnosis of AP requires at least 2 features, including characteristic abdominal pain; biochemical evidence with amylase or lipase elevated > 3 times the upper limit of normal; and/or radiographic evidence on cross-sectional imaging. The most common causes remain gallstones and alcohol, which together comprise 80% of cases, and most cases of AP (around 80%) are mild with only interstitial changes without local or systemic complications. Necrotizing pancreatitis is characterized by pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis and is typically seen in patients with moderately severe or severe AP.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis [^ba3148cb]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing in incidence across the world, and in all age groups. Major changes in management have occurred in the last decade. Avoiding total parenteral nutrition and prophylactic antibiotics, avoiding overly aggressive fluid resuscitation, initiating early feeding, avoiding endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the absence of concomitant cholangitis, same-admission cholecystectomy, and minimally invasive approaches to infected necrosis should now be standard of care. Increasing recognition of the risk of recurrence of AP, and progression to chronic pancreatitis, along with the unexpectedly high risk of diabetes and exocrine insufficiency after AP is the subject of large ongoing studies. In this review, we provide an update on important changes in management for this increasingly common disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^c1e6c66c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Chronic Pancreatitis — current concepts emphasize that chronic pancreatitis (CP) was historically defined as an irreversible inflammatory condition with exocrine and endocrine dysfunction, but now the most accepted mechanistic definition is a pathologic fibroinflammatory syndrome in individuals with genetic, environmental, and/or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, with other symptoms such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes developing at highly variable rates. CP is most commonly caused by toxins such as alcohol or tobacco use, genetic polymorphisms, and recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, although no history of acute pancreatitis is seen in many patients. Diagnosis is made usually on cross-sectional imaging, with modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography and pancreatic function tests playing a secondary role. Total pancreatectomy represents the only known cure for CP, although difficulty in patient selection and the complications inherent to this intervention make it usually an unattractive option, and the diagnostic paradigm has changed to focus on diagnosing the underlying pathologic process early and managing the syndrome more holistically to change the natural course of disease and minimize adverse effects.

### Doxycycline induced severe acute pancreatitis: a rare finding to A common medication [^753eeb0c]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Doxycycline is a commonly prescribed antibiotic with growing evidence suggesting a possible linkage with drug-induced acute pancreatitis. We present an elderly female presenting with severe acute pancreatitis likely secondary to doxycycline therapy after thorough investigation. We reviewed the evidence linking doxycycline-inducing acute pancreatitis and signs and symptoms for severe disease. Early recognition and intervention are critical for positive patient outcomes.

Table 3 — Etiology in acute pancreatitis (AP) highlights targeted evaluation: in the absence of gallstones or significant alcohol history, serum triglyceride should be checked and considered the etiology when elevated, preferably if greater than 1,000 mg/dL; in patients older than 40 years without an established etiology, a pancreatic tumor should be considered; and after a second idiopathic episode in surgery-fit patients, we suggest performing a cholecystectomy to reduce recurrence risk.

Subgroup analysis of patients with BAP

BAP was the most common etiology in both sexes. In the overall AP cohort, female participants were significantly older than male participants (median age 67 vs. 60 years, p < 0.001). To determine whether this age difference was driven solely by a higher prevalence of AAP in younger males, we conducted a subgroup analysis restricted to BAP. Among the total of 445 AP patients, 294 (66.1%) had BAP. Within this subgroup, females remained older than males (median age 67 vs. 63 years, p = 0.006).

Of the 294 BAP patients, 167 (56.8%) were female and 127 (43.2%) were male. When stratified by age, 77 patients (26.2%) were under 55 years old, and 217 patients (73.8%) were ≥ 55 years old. Among those under 55, 42 (54.5%) were male, whereas among those aged ≥ 55, 85 (39.2%) were male.

### Idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis [^d794ff5e]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis is clinically challenging and has substantial socioeconomic consequences. Investigations are expensive and often reveal little about the cause of the disease. Little is known about the interaction between genetic, environmental, anatomical, and other factors that contribute to the disease. Data on the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of endoscopic therapies are scarce. The effect of idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis on quality of life is often underestimated. A more thorough examination of the causes of the disease and the roles of other associated risk factors is needed, as are well designed clinical studies with robust and objectively measurable outcomes. Ideally, evaluation of the causes of disease and therapy should be done only in specialised centres, should follow a protocol, and all outcomes should be formally assessed.

After routine investigations, including a thorough history, routine laboratory study, and noninvasive imaging with transcutaneous ultrasonogram, 10% to 25% of cases of acute pancreatitis have no readily identifiable cause and are termed idiopathic. But modern medicine has made notable advances in uncovering various causes of acute pancreatitis, and several new diagnostic tools that allow clinicians to less invasively approach the patient without sacrificing the diagnostic yield have been introduced. By being knowledgeable of these new changes and by their proper use in a proper circumstances, clinicians will be able to find the cause more accurately and earlier. This better management will not only improve the well-being of the patients but also reduce the number of "true" idiopathic acute pancreatitis to a minimum.

### First attack of acute pancreatitis in Sweden 1988–2003: incidence, aetiological classification, procedures and mortality-a register study [^e6dcb7e9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

In analyses of acute pancreatitis it is of importance to differentiate between first and recurrent attack. We found that 16.9% of all patients with FAAP had a recurrent attack of acute pancreatitis within one year of FAAP. Recurrent pancreatitis was less common (9.4%) for patients with biliary pancreatitis, most likely attributable to the fact that 55.7% of these patients had a definitive treatment (cholecystectomy) within one year of index admission for FAAP.

Incidence of FAAP comparable to the one found in this audit has been described for other non-UK studiesincluding Sweden, whereas a lower incidence is reported from UK and the Netherlands. Population-based studies indicate an increasing incidence with time, particularly for women. In the present 16-year audit, incidence increased slightly but significantly for women but not for men. During the last six years of our audit, crude incidence for men and women differed by less than 10%.

Studies reporting age adjusted incidence rates have found that incidence increases with age. We observed a six-fold increase in age standardized incidence from patients 0–49 years of age to patients 80 years and above. For patients above the age of 70 years, the incidence increased significantly during the audit period. One might speculate that this could be due to a true increase of biliary disease in elderly or to a reduction in cholecystectomy rate. We have no data concerning change in gallstone prevalence during the period studied and no specific data for different age groups. There is a falling cholecystectomy rate during the 80s, followed by a noticeable increase after introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the early 90s. However, according to Danish data this increase does not hold for older ages, where the cholecystectomy rate is decreasing.

As in previous studies, biliary aetiology was more common in women than in men, whereas the reverse was true for alcohol-related aetiology. The most striking finding in our audit was, however, that 68.4% of all patients with first attack acute pancreatitis lacked an aetiological diagnosis at index stay. This is at variance with the UK guidelines according to which the aetiology of acute pancreatitis should be determined in at least 80% of cases and no more than 20% should be classified as idiopathic. As treatment should be governed by aetiology and severity of disease at index stay, substandard aetiological classification may lead to sub-optimal treatment.

### Doxycycline-associated acute pancreatitis: a rare adverse effect of a commonly prescribed antibiotic [^045563c3]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

In this case, a woman in her 80s presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis that began after starting a course of doxycycline. Common aetiologies of acute pancreatitis, including alcohol use, gallstones and hypertriglyceridaemia were ruled out. Less common aetiologies, including recent Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, hypercalcaemia, malignancy, infection and trauma, were also ruled out, making drug-induced acute pancreatitis the most likely aetiology. After consideration of her medication list, doxycycline was determined to be the offending medication. On discontinuation and treatment with fluids and analgesics, her condition slowly improved. This case illustrates a rare but severe complication of doxycycline use. Determining the aetiology of drug-induced acute pancreatitis is more difficult in older patients due to high rates of polypharmacy. Recognition of doxycycline as an aetiology of drug-induced pancreatitis may allow earlier recognition and intervention in cases of suspected pancreatitis without a clear common aetiology in older patients with polypharmacy.

### Acute pancreatitis [^6863b2ea]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute pancreatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute pancreatitis is a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute pancreatitis is most frequently due to gallstones (40%) and alcohol (30%). Other minor causes include ERCP (5–10%), surgical complications (5–10%), drugs (< 5%), hypertriglyceridemia (2–5%), trauma (< 1%), infection (< 1%) and autoimmunity (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute pancreatitis ranges from 13 to 45 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: In patients with acute pancreatitis, localized tissue damage causes activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a systemic inflammatory response that can progress to multiple organ failure and early mortality. The compensatory release of anti-inflammatory mediators plays a role in causing increased susceptibility to septic complications, such as infected pancreatic necrosis, and contributes to late mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Mortality associated with acute pancreatitis is approximately 1–5%, and the recurrence rate is approximately 20%.

### The global, regional, and national burden of pancreatitis in 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^b1a8a7b5]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pancreatitis, especially chronic pancreatitis, has traditionally been regarded as a disease of men, and it has been reported that the frequency is five times higher in men than in women because of the higher intake of alcohol and smoking in men. In contrast, some studies have indicated that the prevalence in females may be higher than that in males. A systematic review reported by Xiao et al. indicated that the incidence of chronic pancreatitis was two times higher in men than in women, whereas there was no difference in acute pancreatitis between men and women. In addition, no statistically significant difference was found between women and men in terms of incidence, prevalence, and YLDs in our study. This result was consistent with that of a population-based study that reported a difference in etiologies of chronic pancreatitis between the two sexes; smoking and alcohol consumption were more common in men, whereas gallstones, autoimmune diseases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and idiopathic causes were more common in women. The distribution of age and sex varied greatly based on etiology. In GBD 2017, the highest burden of pancreatitis among females and males occurred in the 60–64 years and 45–49 years age groups, respectively. Similar to our results, previous studies also reported that both acute and chronic pancreatitis were more common in middle-aged and older people. This implies that more policies should focus on these specific age groups globally. A previous study estimated that more than half of pancreatitis cases could be prevented if there were no smokers in the general population, nearly 1/4 of cases if there was a normal weight (body mass index [BMI] 18–25 kg/m 2) in all people in the general population, and nearly 1/5 of cases if there was no alcohol consumption in all individuals. Therefore, policies on how to tackle alcohol consumption, smoking, and weight should be prioritized for these age groups. Although the rate of pediatric pancreatitis has increased in recent years, it is uncommon among people younger than 20 years of age; this was confirmed in our study because the burden in younger people was much lower than that in the middle-aged group. However, this does not mean that pediatric pancreatitis does not need more attention, and additional measures to prevent pediatric pancreatitis are warranted.

### Epidemiology of acute pancreatitis: the influence of age and gender in a regional population [^9354d0fd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common and potentially severe inflammatory condition of the pancreas with a heterogeneous etiology influenced by geographic, demographic, and lifestyle factors. This study aimed to evaluate the distribution of AP etiologies and their associations with age and sex in a regional cohort from a tertiary center.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective observational study included 445 adult patients hospitalized with a first episode of AP between January 2022 and October 2023. Data on demographics, etiology, severity (revised Atlanta classification), hospital course, and outcomes were extracted from medical records. Etiologies were classified as biliary, idiopathic, alcohol-related, drug-induced, hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), neoplasm-associated, or other miscellaneous causes. Age was grouped into five categories, and statistical analyses assessed the association between etiologies and demographic variables.

Results

The median age was 65 years (range: 18–97), and 52.1% were female. Biliary etiology was the most frequent (66.1%), followed by idiopathic (9.4%), alcohol-related (7.0%), drug-induced (6.5%), neoplasm-associated (4.3%), and HTG-induced (3.1%). Females were significantly older than males (median 67 vs. 60 years, p < 0.001). Alcohol-related AP (AAP) was more common in males, particularly under age 55. Notably, among biliary AP (BAP) patients, males predominated in those under 55 (p = 0.02). Etiological patterns varied significantly by age. In patients aged ≥ 75 years, BAP was markedly more common (80.4% vs. 61.8%), whereas alcohol, drug, and HTG-related etiologies were rare. Severity of AP correlated with age and length of stay but not with etiology.

Conclusion

Biliary pancreatitis remains the predominant etiology in this region, especially among elderly patients. A novel finding of male predominance in younger BAP cases warrants further investigation. These data underscore the importance of regional age and sex specific approaches to AP prevention and management.

### Epidemiology of acute pancreatitis: the influence of age and gender in a regional population [^e88c1de3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given these limitations, we also acknowledge that the study involved numerous subgroup comparisons without correction for multiple testing, which may increase the likelihood of false positive findings. While this approach allowed for exploratory assessment of age and sex related patterns in AP etiology, the results especially those based on smaller subgroups or marginal p-values should be interpreted as hypothesis generating rather than confirmatory.

Despite its limitations, this study has several notable strengths. It presents a comprehensive analysis of 445 patients with AP, which is a relatively large sample for a single center study. The findings provide valuable regional insight into the age and sex-specific distribution of AP etiologies, including a potentially novel observation of male predominance in younger patients with BAP, as well as distinct etiological patterns among elderly patients. These results can serve as a foundation for future prospective research.

Moreover, our findings emphasize the importance of regional factors in AP prevention. Public health strategies such as promoting smoking cessation, reducing alcohol misuse (particularly among younger males), and raising awareness about the risks of drug and herbal induced AP may help lower the incidence in our population. The high prevalence of BAP in this region also highlights the need for better utilization of diagnostic resources to ensure timely and accurate identification of biliary causes. Finally, the high post discharge mortality rate highlights the need for close follow up and careful risk stratification of AP patients after hospitalization, particularly among the elderly.

Abstract.

A 32-year-old medical practitioner presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting, 1 week after the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient did not report any comorbid conditions, alcohol usage, or gallstone disease. Laboratory and radiological investigations revealed the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. He underwent conservative management and was discharged after 3 days of hospital admission. This case highlights a possible association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis, and the need for clinicians to carefully evaluate patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints during the current pandemic.

### A 21-year-old man with chronic pancreatitis [^070ae99a]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis is a disease for which the diagnosis may be difficult to ascertain and the treatments are limited. Using the case of a 21-year-old man who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric pain since age 10 years and was ultimately diagnosed as having idiopathic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic duct stones, we discuss the evaluation and treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis is based on thorough history taking, physical examination, and carefully selected imaging studies. Etiologies may be structural or nonstructural; genes predisposing to chronic pancreatitis have been identified. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by a paucity of randomized controlled trials. We address the patient's concerns regarding chronic pancreatitis, including what he should expect over the next several years, whether endoscopic or surgical therapies should be considered, and whether there are any cures.

### The global, regional, and national burden of acute pancreatitis in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019 [^37fd1b23]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis is a common and potentially lethal gastrointestinal disease, but literatures for the disease burden are scarce for many countries. Understanding the current burden of acute pancreatitis and the different trends across various countries is essential for formulating effective preventive intervenes. We aimed to report the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by acute pancreatitis in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019.

Methods

Estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) were used to analyze the epidemiology of acute pancreatitis at the global, regional, and national levels. We also reported the correlation between development status and acute pancreatitis' age-standardized DALY rates, and calculated DALYs attributable to alcohol etiology that had evidence of causation with acute pancreatitis. All of the estimates were shown as counts and age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years.

Results

There were 2,814,972.3 (95% UI 2,414,361.3–3,293,591.8) incident cases of acute pancreatitis occurred in 2019 globally; 1,273,955.2 (1,098,304.6–1,478,594.1) in women and 1,541,017.1 (1,307,264.4–1,814,454.3) in men. The global age-standardized incidence rate declined from 37.9/100,000 to 34.8/100,000 during 1990–2019, an annual decrease of 8.4% (5.9–10.4%). In 2019, there were 115,053.2 (104,304.4–128,173.4) deaths and 3,641,105.7 (3,282,952.5–4,026,948.1) DALYs due to acute pancreatitis. The global age-standardized mortality rate decreased by 17.2% (6.6–27.1%) annually from 1.7/100,000 in 1990 to 1.4/100,000 in 2019; over the same period, the age-standardized DALY rate declined by 17.6% (7.8–27.0%) annually. There were substantial differences in the incidence, mortality and DALYs across regions. Alcohol etiology attributed to a sizable fraction of acute pancreatitis-related deaths, especially in the high and high-middle SDI regions.

Conclusion

Substantial variation existed in the burden of acute pancreatitis worldwide, and the overall burden remains high with aging population. Geographically targeted considerations are needed to tailor future intervenes to relieve the burden of acute pancreatitis in specific countries, especially for Eastern Europe.

### Practical guide to the management of acute pancreatitis [^ea427688]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterised by inflammation of the exocrine pancreas and is associated with acinar cell injury and both a local and systemic inflammatory response. AP may range in severity from self-limiting, characterised by mild pancreatic oedema, to severe systemic inflammation with pancreatic necrosis, organ failure and death. Several international guidelines have been developed including those from the joint International Association of Pancreatology and American Pancreatic Association, American College of Gastroenterology and British Society of Gastroenterology.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^8488bc71]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Etiology of acute pancreatitis — initial evaluation and key management concepts are: We suggest transabdominal ultrasound in patients with AP to evaluate for biliary pancreatitis and a repeat US if the initial examination is inconclusive (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with idiopathic AP (IAP), we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation with repeat abdominal ultrasound, MRI, and/or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) (conditional recommendation; very low quality of evidence). In the absence of gallstones and/or a significant history of alcohol use, serum triglyceride (TG) should be obtained and considered in the etiology, preferably if greater than 1,000 mg/dL. In patients older than 40 years in whom an etiology is not established, a pancreatic tumor should be considered as a possible cause of AP. Following a second episode of AP with no identifiable cause, in patients fit for surgery, we suggest performing a cholecystectomy to reduce the risk of recurrent episodes of AP.

Results

Baseline characteristics

A total of 445 patients with AP were included in the analysis. The cohort consisted of 213 males (47.9%) and 232 females (52.1%), with a median age of 65 years (range: 18–97). BAP was the most common cause of pancreatitis (66.1%), followed by IAP (9.4%), AAP (7.0%), DIAP (6.5%), neoplasms (4.3%), HTG-AP (3.1%), and other miscellaneous etiologies (3.6%). Miscellaneous cases consisted of post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, trauma, infection, pancreatic divisum, post-operative and hypercalcemia induced AP. The median length of hospital stay was 6 days (IQR: 5). ICU admission occurred in 4.9% of cases, in-hospital mortality was 1.8%, and three-month post-discharge mortality was 6.3%.

Statistical analysis test indicated that age was not normally distributed in both gender groups (p < 0.001). Age distribution of AP patients by sex is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Age distribution of acute pancreatitis patients by gender

The female participants were older than the male participants (median 67 vs. 60 years old, p < 0.001). Consequently, the sex ratio varied across different age groups, with males being more prominent in the younger age categories and females being more prominent in the elderly population (p = 0.002). The ratio of males and females according to age category is shown in Fig. 2.

### Amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-induced pancreatitis: case report [^9e5763ad]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas that varies in severity from mild to life threatening usually requiring hospitalization. The predominant symptom is severe abdominal pain and diagnosis can be made through blood tests and imaging studies such as x-rays, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) scan. The major causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones (30–60%) and heavy alcohol use (15–30%) in addition to other common causes: hypertriglyceridemia, hyperparathyroidism, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), trauma, pancreatic tumors, surgery, infections, and medications. Of increasing interest is the drug-induced pancreatitis (DIP) which is less common (1–2%) even though true incidence is indeterminate due to the inadequate documentation of case reports of DIP where DIP is often undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or underdiagnosed. Here lies the importance of identifying cases of DIP in medical practice and the need for documenting and publishing such cases to increase the awareness among physicians regarding the side effects of most commonly used drugs and also to aid scientists and researchers in identifying the mechanism behind DIP. Here we present the case of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-induced pancreatitis in a previously healthy male after excluding all other causes of pancreatitis.

We followed CARE reporting guidelines in publishing our case report.

### Pancreatitis [^b5abb9bd]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammation of the glandular parenchyma of the retroperitoneal organ that leads to injury with or without subsequent destruction of the pancreatic acini. This inflammatory process can either result in a self-limited disease or involve life-threatening multiorgan complications. Chronic pancreatitis consists of endocrine and exocrine gland dysfunction that develops secondary to progressive inflammation and chronic fibrosis of the pancreatic acini with permanent structural damage. Recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis can result in chronic pancreatitis; acute and chronic pancreatitis are different diseases with separate morphologic patterns. Acute pancreatitis has an increasing incidence but a decreasing mortality.

### Mortality and recurrence risk after a first episode of acute pancreatitis in the elderly: population-based study [^f403ee25]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Improved standard of living and advances in medical care have increased longevity in Sweden and the rest of the Western world. Increased longevity has led to an increase in the proportion of the population older than 80 years. At the same time, the incidence of first-time acute pancreatitis among those aged at least 80 years has increased.

Gallstone disease and alcohol are the main causes of acute pancreatitis in the adult population. In the elderly, however, gallstone disease is the most common aetiology. In biliary acute pancreatitis, cholecystectomy or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is recommended to prevent recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. However, there is a risk of serious adverse events from these interventions in elderly patients with high co-morbidity. Several studieshave shown that the co-morbidity level influences outcome in acute pancreatitis.

Whether age itself is a risk factor in acute pancreatitis is debated. Many studies of elderly patients with acute pancreatitis have been conducted over the past decade. However, it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions from these because different cut-off values have been used for age. Studies have come to divergent conclusions, some, that age is an independent risk factor and othersthat it is not.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the mortality of patients aged 80 years or more treated for acute pancreatitis, as well as mortality related to interventions aimed at preventing recurrent biliary pancreatitis. A second aim was to explore the risk of recurrent pancreatitis in elderly patients who had undergone ERCP or cholecystectomy.

### Chronic pancreatitis [^7c6697b2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic pancreatitis:

- **Definition**: Chronic pancreatitis is a clinical syndrome involving inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of acinar and islet cells of the pancreas.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis typically involves multiple risk modifiers that interact to produce pancreatic disease, including bile duct obstruction (pancreatic tumors, chronic strictures), exogenous toxins (alcohol, smoking), metabolic disturbances (hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia), as well as autoimmune disease and genetic disease.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of chronic pancreatitis ranges from 5 to 12 cases per 100,000 person-years, while its prevalence is estimated at 50 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Destruction of normal pancreatic tissue leads to the clinical manifestations of chronic abdominal pain, exocrine insufficiency (compromised digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients), and endocrine insufficiency (pancreatogenic diabetes).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with chronic pancreatitis have increased mortality as compared with age and sex-matched controls (HR 5.0, 95% CI 4.8–5.2).

### Clinical profile, etiology, and treatment of chronic pancreatitis in north American women: analysis of a large multicenter cohort [^00eb3945]. Pancreas (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Historically, chronic pancreatitis (CP) was considered a disease of alcoholic males, but recent data suggest its etiology to be complex. To better understand CP in women, we compared data on women and men with CP in a large, prospectively ascertained multicenter US cohort.

Methods

Patients with CP enrolled in the NAPS2 Continuation and Validation study were studied. Information on demographics, etiology, risk factors, phenotype, and treatment(s) used was obtained from detailed questionnaires completed by the patients and physicians.

Results

Of 521 cases, 45% were women. Women were significantly (P < 0.05) less likely to have alcohol etiology (30% vs 58.5%) and more likely to have nonalcoholic etiologies (idiopathic, 32% vs 18%; obstructive, 12% vs 2.4%; genetic, 12.8% vs 7.3%). Demographics, pain experience, morphologic findings, exocrine and endocrine insufficiency, CP-related disability, and use of medical therapies were mostly similar in both sexes. Sphincterotomy (biliary, 33% vs 24%; pancreatic, 38% vs 28%; P < 0.05) was performed more frequently in women, whereas cyst/pseudocyst operations were more common in men (6.6 vs 2.6%, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Most CP cases in women are from nonalcoholic etiologies. In contrast to many other chronic diseases, clinical phenotype of CP is determined by the disease and is independent of sex.

Subgroup analysis of patients aged ≥ 75 years

Among the 445 patients with AP, 102 (22.9%) were aged ≥ 75 years, and 343 (77.1%) were < 75 years. Female predominance was more pronounced in the elderly group (61.8% vs. 49.3%, p = 0.032). The distribution of AP etiologies differed significantly between the two age groups (p < 0.001).

BAP was significantly more common in elderly patients (80.4% vs. 61.8%, p < 0.001). In contrast, AAP was rare in this group (1.0% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.004). DIAP and HTG-AP were not observed in patients aged ≥ 75 years (0.0% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.001 and 0.0% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.047, respectively).

The frequency of IAP was similar between groups (8.8% vs. 9.6%, p = 1.000). Neoplasm-associated AP showed an increasing trend with age, peaking in the 65–74 age group. However, due to this peak occurring before age 75, the prevalence did not differ significantly between the ≥ 75 and < 75 age groups (4.9% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.780).

These findings highlight a clear shift toward biliary etiology in older adults, while alcohol-related, drug-induced, and metabolic causes are more frequently observed in younger patients.

In summary, these analysis of AP patients and subgroups highlights significant etiological diversity in AP with distinct age and sex patterns. The results of variations across age categories, age-related trends and gender across different etiological subtypes are presented in Table 2.

Hypertriglyceridaemia is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis but is relatively rare and therefore requires a high level of clinical suspicion to be diagnosed. We discuss the case of a 46-year-old man who initially presented to the accident and emergency department with suspected first presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a normal amylase but who did not respond to DKA treatment. Further history revealed significant cardiovascular risk factors, examination showed an evidence of hyperlipidaemia and investigations revealed acute pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridaemia. We discuss the causes of hypertriglyceridaemia, the difficulty in differentiating primary versus secondary hypertriglyceridaemia, possible pathogenesis and current evidence-based treatments.

### Alcoholic pancreatitis [^f4a22785]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Without doubt, alcohol consumption is one of the most important considerations in adults with acute or chronic pancreatitis. Understanding chronic pancreatitis as a complex disorder in which complimentary factors are required for recurrent acute and late chronic pancreatitis to develop in subsets of patients is critical for the early diagnosis and management of these individuals. Recent pathophysiological and genetic findings represent the beginning of major diagnostic and treatment breakthroughs that are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The information provided in this article should provide the physician with a fresh perspective and remind the clinician of the importance of an accurate and complete history, and the need to document the actual alcohol consumption, pattern of drinking, and raise appropriate concerns if signs of alcoholism are detected. If alcohol-associated pancreatitis is detected, then limitation of pancreatic damage, limitation of progression, or preventative intervention should become the major concern.

### A multidisciplinary approach to an unusual cause of hyperamylasaemia [^84159483]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical features together with elevation of pancreatic enzymes are the key diagnostic indicators of acute pancreatitis. We report a case of a woman in her 50s who presented with abdominal distension and serum amylase raised to more than 30 times the upper limit of normal. She was initially treated for acute pancreatitis, however, she was not symptomatic of this and the pancreas appeared to be normal on CT scan. Further investigations revealed the patient had a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with nodal metastatic spread. An amylase-secreting ovarian tumour was suspected, which was supported by elevated salivary-amylase isoenzymes, consistent with previous reports in the literature. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and surgery, during which her serum amylase and CA-125 initially fell significantly, but eventually both increased, reflecting disease progression. This case serves as an important reminder to consider non-pancreatic causes of raised serum amylase, to avoid misdiagnosis.

Educational Objectives

Given the rising prevalence of cannabis use in youth, cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) should be on the differential diagnosis and a lipase level should be assessed when a patient presents with symptoms of acute pancreatitis, especially when there is no clear etiology from initial investigations.

### Mortality and recurrence risk after a first episode of acute pancreatitis in the elderly: population-based study [^82a133d4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

There are limitations to this study. It was assumed that gallstones were the predominant aetiology in the cohort, but it cannot be ruled out that the acute pancreatitis had other aetiologies. However, the effectiveness of cholecystectomy and ERCP would have been more pronounced if all aetiologies other than gallstones had been excluded. The study was purely observational, which may be a source of bias. Treatment decisions may have been based on factors that it was not possible to adjust for. Even though the CCI is one of the most commonly used scoring systems for co-morbidity in research, it may not always capture the true burden of co-morbidity.

Given the high mortality risk of acute pancreatitis per se, as well as the non-negligible risks of interventions available, it is imperative to involve the patient and next of kin in the decision-making process. The decision to carry out cholecystectomy or ERCP after an episode of acute pancreatitis requires a delicate trade-off between the potential benefit of preventing new episodes of acute pancreatitis and the risk of complications related to the procedure itself.

Detailed medical histories, laboratory results, and imaging studies were reviewed to determine the etiology of AP. Data were initially collected by three internal medicine physicians. The etiological classification was subsequently verified by three senior gastroenterologists. All available clinical, biochemical, radiological, and endoscopic data were independently evaluated, and final etiological assignments were made by consensus.

Biliary acute pancreatitis (BAP) was diagnosed in the presence of gallstones or biliary sludge on imaging and/or elevated liver enzymes, particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 150 U/L, in line with established guidelines. In cases with suspected biliary etiology but inconclusive findings on abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was routinely used in our clinic to support the diagnosis. Alcohol-related acute pancreatitis (AAP) was defined based on a documented history of sustained or binge alcohol intake. HTG induced AP (HTG-AP) was diagnosed in patients with serum triglyceride levels > 1000 mg/dL in the absence of other etiologies. Drug induced AP (DIAP) was considered in patients with recent use of medications, herbals or supplements associated with AP, following exclusion of more common causes. Neoplasm associated AP was diagnosed when pancreatic or periampullary tumors were identified as the cause of ductal obstruction or inflammation. Patients in whom no etiology could be determined despite thorough evaluation were classified as having idiopathic AP (IAP). This structured classification approach aimed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and ensure consistency across the study population.

Individualized treatment plans were provided to all patients, which typically consisted of hydration with lactated Ringer's solution to maintain fluid balance, effective pain control, interventions to address nausea, and the introduction of early oral feeding as tolerated, reflecting a comprehensive and patient-centric approach.

Age and sex of the patients and etiology of AP recorded. Additionally, we collected the revised Atlanta classification severity index (RAC) for each patient. The presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality were also recorded. Post-discharge mortality was calculated only for patients who were re-hospitalized in any ward or emergency service and died within 3 months of the index admission's discharge.

Patients were stratified into five age groups based on categories used in the APACHE II scoring system (under 45, 45–54,55–64,65–74, equal or above 75 years old).

American College of Gastroenterology acute pancreatitis epidemiology and burden are summarized with U.S. utilization, global incidence, and mortality. In the United States, there are almost 300,000 admissions annually for AP, resulting in more than 1 million patient days in the hospital at a cost over 2.5 billion dollars. The incidence of AP has been increasing by 2%–5% per year and varies between 3.4 and 23.4 cases per 100,000 worldwide. Although the case fatality rate has decreased over time, the overall population mortality rate has remained unchanged with 5,000–9,000 deaths reported annually. While most patients experience symptoms lasting a few days, almost one-fifth of patients will go on to experience complications, including pancreatic necrosis and/or organ failure.

### AGA clinical practice update on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: expert review [^1420941f]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency:

- **Definition**: EPI is a condition characterized by the inadequate production or secretion of digestive enzymes by the pancreas, leading to malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies.
- **Pathophysiology**: Progressive structural and functional alterations in the pancreatic acinar and ductal compartments, such as in chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and ductal obstruction, compromise the synthesis, processing, and delivery of pancreatic digestive enzymes into the duodenum. These pathologic changes disrupt the coordinated release of lipolytic, proteolytic, and amylolytic enzymes, impairing the normal hydrolysis of dietary macronutrients. Over time, the enzymatic deficiency leads to a profound disturbance in nutrient absorption, resulting in weight loss and micronutrient deficiencies.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of EPI varies by the underlying condition and its severity, ranging from 20–90% in chronic pancreatitis, 27–35% after acute pancreatitis, 70% in pancreatic cancer, 75–90% in cystic fibrosis, 10–100% after pancreatic surgery, and 9–67% after upper gastrointestinal surgery. Low fecal elastase-1 levels have been reported in 21.7% of individuals aged > 60 years and 11.5% of individuals aged 50–75 years.
- **Risk factors**: Common causes of exocrine pancratic insuficiency include chronic pancreatitis, post-acute pancreatitis, pancreatic or ampullary cancer, cystic fibrosis and CFTR-related disorders, and pancreatic surgery. Other conditions that are associated with exocrine pancratic insuficiency include autoimmune pancreatitis, celiac disease, IBD, short bowel syndrome, gastrinoma, Sjögren's disease, hemochromatosis, upper gastrointestinal surgery, immune-checkpoint inhibitor and TKI therapy, somatostatin analogs, and rare inherited disorders, such as Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, Johanson-Blizzard syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and Shteyer syndrome. Additionally, patients with CKD, congestive HF, alcohol use disorder, and the elderly have an increased risk of EPI.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of EPI typically evolve gradually as the capacity for adequate digestive enzyme delivery declines, often remaining subtle until significant maldigestion occurs. Symptims include steatorrhea, characterized by greasy, foul-smelling stools, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, weight loss, muscle wasting, and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), which may present as night blindness, osteopenia, coagulopathy, or neurological symptoms. Vitamin B12 deficiency may also occur as a result of reduced intestinal pH, impairing the transfer of vitamin B12 from R protein to intrinsic factor. In advanced stages, ongoing nutrient deficits lead to further metabolic derangements, deterioration of general health, and diminished QoL.

Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP) is the most common complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and not uncommonly is the reason behind ERCP-related lawsuits. Patients at high risk for PEP include young women with abdominal pain, normal liver tests, and unremarkable imaging. Procedure-related factors include traumatic and persistent cannulation attempts, multiple injections of the pancreatic duct, pancreatic sphincterotomy, and, possibly, use of precut sphincterotomy. Aggressive hydration, use of rectal indomethacin, and prophylactic pancreatic stenting can diminish the risk (and likely severity) of PEP. Though hugely beneficial, these measures do not supersede careful patient selection and technique.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^da4872eb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP), defined as acute inflammation of the pancreas, is one of the most common diseases of the gastrointestinal tract leading to hospital admission in the United States. It is important for clinicians to appreciate that AP is heterogenous, progressing differently among patients and is often unpredictable. While most patients experience symptoms lasting a few days, almost one-fifth of patients will go on to experience complications, including pancreatic necrosis and/or organ failure, at times requiring prolonged hospitalization, intensive care, and radiologic, surgical, and/or endoscopic intervention. Early management is essential to identify and treat patients with AP to prevent complications. Patients with biliary pancreatitis typically will require surgery to prevent recurrent disease and may need early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography if the disease is complicated by cholangitis. Nutrition plays an important role in treating patients with AP. The safety of early refeeding and importance in preventing complications from AP are addressed. This guideline will provide an evidence-based practical approach to the management of patients with AP.

### Epidemiology of acute pancreatitis: the influence of age and gender in a regional population [^beb614f2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Severity

AP was classified as mild in 314 patients (70.6%), moderate in 111 (24.9%), and severe in 20 (4.5%). There was no significant difference in AP severity between male and female patients (p = 0.549). Similarly, no significant association was found between AP severity and its etiological subtypes (p = 0.382). However, a significant difference in severity was observed across age groups (p = 0.038). Post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni-adjusted Mann–Whitney U test (adjusted α = 0.005) revealed that patients aged ≥ 75 years experienced significantly greater disease severity compared to those under 45 years of age. (p = 0.002) (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Acute pancreatitis severity according to age categories

LOS in hospital increased in proportion to the severity of AP (p < 0.001). However, the etiology of pancreatitis did not appear to impact on the LOS in hospital.

In-hospital mortality

Eight patients (1.8%) died during hospitalization. The median age of the deceased patients was 73 years old (59–95). The patient died in the 4th day of hospitalization was 95 years old, and she died because of cardiovascular reasons. All other 7 patients were in moderately severe or severe AP groups, and they died of multi-organ failure (MOF) after ICU stay with a median of 30-day LOS.

In-hospital mortality was 0% in mild, 2.7% in moderately severe and 20% in severe pancreatitis cases classified according to RAC. A binary logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with APs. The model included age, etiology, and RAC as covariates. Age was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.048), indicating that older age increases the risk of death during hospitalization. RAC was a significant predictor (p = 0.001). Compared to mild cases, patients with moderately severe and severe pancreatitis had 71.2 times higher odds of in-hospital death (OR = 71.2; 95% CI: 6.3–804.4; p < 0.001), Etiology was not a significant independent predictor (p = 0.393), and most subgroups had sparse or unstable estimates due to limited events.

### Prospective evaluation of the aetiological profile of acute pancreatitis in young adult patients [^b62cfc88]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The aetiologies of acute pancreatitis in young adult patients are poorly known.

Aims

To prospectively evaluate the causes of acute pancreatitis in patients aged less than 35 years.

Methods

Overall, 309 consecutive patients admitted to our centre for acute pancreatitis received first-line investigations, including medical history, standard laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography. If no aetiology was found, second-line investigations were performed, including endoscopic ultrasound, magnetic-resonance cholangiopancreatography and genetic testing in cases of idiopathic pancreatitis.

Results

Overall, 66 patients aged between 16 and 35 years were included. After first-line investigations, 49% of cases of acute pancreatitis remained idiopathic. Second-line investigations reduced this rate to 21%. The frequency of aetiologies for acute pancreatitis significantly differed in adults aged ≤ 35 compared to those aged > 35 years: biliary aetiology was less frequent (23% versus 43%, p = 0.003) as well as alcohol-related (8% versus 24%, p = 0.01); drug-induced was more common (16% versus 4%, p = 0.0007), as well as cannabis-related (13% versus 1%, p < 0.0001), or genetic (10% versus 1.5%, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

The aetiologies of acute pancreatitis significantly differed in adults aged less than 35 years when compared to older patients. Thus, use of medications, exposure to cannabis, and genetic mutations should be actively sought in these patients.

### Annular pancreas in a 24-year-old woman with persistent abdominal pain [^ad6aef6d]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Annular pancreas (AP) is a rare diagnosis in the adult population but can cause significant morbidity if not correctly identified. In adults, the most common symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. While these are not specific to AP, they are important clues to this diagnosis in the right clinical context. We present the case of a 24-year-old woman presenting with a 6-year history of progressive abdominal pain and dyspepsia in the context of an extensive negative workup. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series and MRI revealed partial duodenal obstruction, concerning for AP. While patients with chronic abdominal pain and vague GI complaints may be diagnosed with functional bowel disorders, it is important to appropriately address the possibility of an underlying structural lesion such as AP. This strategy is not only cost-effective but also saves the patient discomfort associated with unnecessary procedures and allows a timely intervention.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^1edb62d5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

### Practical guide to the management of chronic pancreatitis [^0ae48440]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an irreversible fibroinflammatory disorder of the pancreas. It presents with relapsing, remitting upper abdominal pain accompanied by features of malabsorption due to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and endocrine deficiency with the development of diabetes mellitus. The associated increased hospitalisation and high economic burden are related to CP often presenting at advanced stage with irreversible consequences. Diagnosing CP at an early stage is still challenging and therefore CP is believed to be under-reported. Our understanding of this disease has evolved over the last few years with attempts to redesign the definition of CP. Better recognition of the risk factors and conditions associated with CP can lead to an earlier diagnosis and coupled with a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, ultimately reduce complications. This article reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis and management of CP.

Diagnostic enzymes and imaging — Serum amylase concentrations may be normal in alcohol-induced AP and hypertriglyceridemia, and serum lipase seems to be more specific and remains elevated longer than amylase following disease presentation. For example, an upper limit of normal greater than 3–5 times may be needed in some patients, and while elevations of amylase and lipase greater than 3× normal help establish AP, some patients without AP will have such elevations; once the diagnosis of AP is established, there is no reason to follow the serum amylase or lipase. Abdominal imaging may confirm AP: contrast-enhanced CT provides more than 90% sensitivity and specificity; routine abdominal CT is unwarranted, but in a patient failing to improve after 48–72 hours CT or MRI is recommended to assess local complications, and CT and MRI are comparable in the early assessment of AP.

Chronic pancreatitis describes a wide spectrum of fibro-inflammatory disorders of the exocrine pancreas that includes calcifying, obstructive, and steroid-responsive forms. Use of the term chronic pancreatitis without qualification generally refers to calcifying chronic pancreatitis. Epidemiology is poorly defined, but incidence worldwide seems to be on the rise. Smoking, drinking alcohol, and genetic predisposition are the major risk factors for chronic calcifying pancreatitis. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of chronic calcifying pancreatitis, focusing on pain management, the role of endoscopic and surgical intervention, and the use of pancreatic enzyme-replacement therapy. Management of patients is often challenging and necessitates a multidisciplinary approach.

The incidence of this condition may be increasing with rising rates of intervention affecting the biliary system. Recognition may also be increasing with growing use of high-quality radiography. Treatment should prevent rupture and ameliorate cardiovascular risk. Surgery should be considered in patients with complications or those likely to have them in future.

Results

A total of 918 patients with AP (age range 21–89 years, mean age 58.4 ± 18.1) were hospitalized. They were divided into two groups (Table 1): The aged group (aged 60–89 years, mean age 73.83 ± 7.78) and the younger group (aged 21–59 years, mean age 42.10 ± 9.50). Of the 368 elderly patients, 27 (7.3%) developed severe acute pancreatitis, 28 (7.6%) developed pancreatic necrosis and 11 (3%) died. In the control group, among 550 younger patients, 25 (4.5%) developed severe acute pancreatitis, 34 (6.2%) developed pancreatic necrosis and 5 (0.9%) died. For both groups, there were more males than females. The male/female ratios were 201:167 and 359:191 in the aged and younger groups, respectively.

Acute pancreatitis etiology — We suggest transabdominal ultrasound in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) to evaluate for biliary pancreatitis and a repeat ultrasound if the initial examination is inconclusive (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with idiopathic AP (IAP), we suggest additional diagnostic evaluation with repeat abdominal ultrasound, MRI, and or endoscopic ultrasound (Conditional recommendation; very low quality of evidence).

### Recognition and management of persistent chylomicronemia: a joint expert clinical consensus by the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^9ddfa9b8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Risks associated with chylomicronemia — clinical manifestations and pancreatitis risk — are described. Chylomicronemia "is associated with eruptive xanthomas, lipemia retinalis, hepatosplenomegaly, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), abdominal pain, recurrent acute pancreatitis (with onset as early as infancy), and generalized symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive impairment ('brain fog')". Moreover, "Severe TG elevation is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis (after cholelithiasis and excess ethanol consumption)".

### A 5-year retrospective cohort study: epidemiology, etiology, severity, and outcomes of acute pancreatitis [^8d87c0dd]. Pancreas (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology, etiology, severity, and outcomes of acute pancreatitis (AP) in the southern Sichuan region of China.

Methods

All patients with first-attack AP between 2013 and 2018 in the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University were retrospectively identified. The etiology tendency was analyzed, and the relationship was defined with sex, aging, severity, length of stay, and mortality.

Results

Three thousand twenty-eight patients were enrolled for analysis. Acute biliary pancreatitis had the highest incidence rate; the second and third most common causes were hypertriglyceridemic (14.4%) and alcoholic (14.2%), followed by idiopathic (13.6%), mixed etiology (12.9%), and miscellaneous (2.31%). Patients with alcoholic AP were more likely to be middle-aged males, whereas patients with acute biliary pancreatitis were more likely to be elderly females (P < 0.05). The overall mortality in the hospital was 1%, and there was no difference in each etiological groups (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Biliary disease was the predominant etiology of AP in southern Sichuan of China, and hypertriglyceridemia ranked second. The proportion of hypertriglyceridemic AP and mixed etiology AP gradually increased, whereas idiopathic AP decreased. There were different etiology proportion of AP according age, sex, and severity.

### Comparison of clinical course and outcome of acute pancreatitis according to the two main etiologies: alcohol and gallstone [^0d5a7e56]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

AP has many causes and the proportion of each etiologic factor varies greatly in different countries. In general, the most frequent cause of AP is cholelithiasis, followed by alcohol. Together these etiologies are responsible for approximately 80% of all episodes of AP. In a previous study including 1,068 European patients with AP, the percentage of biliary AP varied between 24 and 71%, and that of alcoholic AP between 6 and 60% among different countries. In our study, 50% (76/153) of the patients were diagnosed with biliary AP and 33% (50/153) with alcoholic AP, showing results similar to those of previous studies.

A number of studies have reported that alcoholic AP was more prevalent in men and younger patients. Our study showed that male was significantly predominant in the alcohol group compared with the biliary group, and patients with alcoholic AP were younger than those with biliary AP; however, this was not statistically significant.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^3b96dcec]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

American College of Gastroenterology guideline — predicting severity and early management in acute pancreatitis — Most episodes are mild, but 20% of patients develop a moderately severe or severe disease requiring a prolonged hospitalization; because many patients who later develop a complicated course initially appear mild without organ failure or necrosis, this has led clinical scientists to recommend intensive early supportive care with aggressive or moderately aggressive intravenous hydration; moderately severe and severe AP constitute approximately 15%–25% of all cases, only a small proportion can be diagnosed in the first 24 hours, and a substantial proportion cannot be reliably classified during the first 24–48 hours and sometimes up to 72 or 96 hours.

### Classification of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population: clinical report from the NASPGHAN pancreas committee [^967785e5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric organ dysfunction thresholds — circulatory and renal considerations. Circulatory dysfunction based on a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg will overestimate SAP in younger age groups where normal systolic blood pressure may be < 90 mmHg; for example, a 5-year-old girl at the 5th percentile with a systolic blood pressure of 89 mmHg would actually be at 50th% and should be considered normal. Creatinine > 2 mg/dL will likely underestimate kidney injury and in younger children injury might occur at values lower than 2 mg/dL; for clinical applications, absolute change from baseline is more appropriate and even a modest increase (eg, by 0.3 mg/ dL) is a risk factor for mortality.
