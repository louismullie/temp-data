## Question

Adenomyomstosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about adenomyomatosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the term because "adenomyomstosis" looks like a typographical error. Then, I should verify whether the question targets gallbladder adenomyomatosis versus uterine adenomyosis. Next, I will outline the pathophysiology and classification, followed by imaging features and diagnostic algorithms. After that, I should review management principles, including when to observe versus operate, and finally synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "adenomyomstosis" does not map to a standard medical entity; wait, let me verify the likely intended terms. The two most common conditions that fit the morphology are gallbladder adenomyomatosis and uterine adenomyosis, and given the provided references, both are plausible, so I should explicitly ask which organ system the user means and then proceed with a dual-path explanation while citing the strongest sources for each condition.

> If the user meant gallbladder adenomyomatosis, I will now examine the core definition and pathophysiology. Gallbladder adenomyomatosis is a benign hyperplastic change of the gallbladder wall characterized by epithelial proliferation with muscularis hyperplasia and formation of Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses, which are intramural diverticula that can contain bile, sludge, crystals, or calcifications; importantly, the serosa is not involved, which helps distinguish it from malignant processes on imaging [^116QQWiT].

> Next, I should review the classification, because pattern recognition guides both imaging and management. The four main patterns are localized (often fundal), segmental, annular, and diffuse; localized disease is most common, whereas segmental disease has been associated with a higher prevalence of gallbladder carcinoma in some series, though confounding by cholelithiasis and chronic inflammation complicates causality, so I need to be cautious in overinterpreting malignancy risk solely based on morphology [^116QQWiT] [^117DKGtt].

> I will now examine imaging features and the diagnostic algorithm, starting with ultrasound as first-line. On grayscale ultrasound, gallbladder wall thickening with small intramural cystic spaces and comet-tail or twinkling artifacts from cholesterol crystals or calcifications are characteristic; the outer wall should remain sharp and intact, and there should be no pericholecystic fluid, which helps differentiate from acute cholecystitis and malignancy; accuracy for differentiating adenomyomatosis from early gallbladder cancer has been reported in the 91–95% range in experienced hands, though operator dependence remains a limitation [^11352QEm] [^114pjJCh].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound when RAS are not clearly seen. CEUS improves visualization of Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses as avascular intramural spaces against an enhancing wall, and it can better depict wall integrity; in small series, CEUS increased detection of RAS to 100% compared with about two-thirds on grayscale, and it helps exclude vascularized soft tissue that would suggest neoplasm, aligning with AIUM guidance that CEUS can distinguish tumefactive sludge from vascularized tissue in the gallbladder [^111KdX1c] [^115r12Sy] [^1133HoZ4].

> Let me consider MRI as a problem-solver when ultrasound is inconclusive. On heavily T2-weighted sequences or MRCP, the "pearl necklace" sign — serial small hyperintense intramural cysts — is highly specific; diffusion-weighted imaging can support benignity when ADC values are not low, though overlap exists, so I should interpret DWI cautiously; overall, MRI is excellent for confirming RAS and characterizing extent when ultrasound is limited by body habitus or equivocal features [^111m9wmc] [^117H6sy6].

> But wait, what if CT is the only modality available. CT can show intramural cystic spaces and the "cotton ball" sign — fuzzy grey dots or a dotted inner enhancing layer — which, when present, strongly favors adenomyomatosis over malignancy; however, CT has lower sensitivity than ultrasound and MRI for small RAS, so a negative CT does not exclude disease and should not replace ultrasound-first strategies [^112kGxxd] [^111nhGg8].

> I should double-check the management principles, because this is where unnecessary surgery often occurs. In asymptomatic patients with classic imaging features, observation is appropriate given the benign nature of adenomyomatosis; cholecystectomy is reserved for symptomatic patients, those with diagnostic uncertainty where malignancy cannot be excluded, or selected cases of segmental disease where some series suggest higher cancer risk, acknowledging that this association is debated and likely confounded; in all cases, decisions should be individualized and imaging correlated with clinical context [^114Bj2GL] [^117DKGtt].

> If the user instead meant uterine adenomyosis, I need to ensure I pivot correctly. Uterine adenomyosis is defined by ectopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium, typically presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and sometimes infertility or adverse pregnancy outcomes; diagnosis is noninvasive, with transvaginal ultrasound as first-line and MRI as problem-solving when ultrasound is inconclusive or when mapping disease extent is needed [^112Kyujk] [^115WhTfs].

> Let me verify imaging performance so I don't overstate accuracy. Meta-analyses show TVUS and MRI have comparable diagnostic performance, with pooled sensitivity and specificity around 74–78% and 88% respectively for both modalities; MUSA criteria on TVUS include asymmetric myometrial thickening, myometrial cysts, hyperechoic islands, fan-shaped shadowing, and subendometrial lines or buds, which improve diagnostic consistency when applied systematically [^notfound] [^notfound] [^117XTnxV].

> Next, I should review management, and I need to be careful to separate medical from surgical options. First-line medical therapy includes combined oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, or dienogest for pain and heavy bleeding; GnRH agonists with add-back are second-line for refractory symptoms; for focal disease in patients desiring fertility, adenomyomectomy can be considered, ideally via minimally invasive approaches, while total hysterectomy is definitive for those who have completed childbearing after counseling on risks and alternatives [^112WLdm9] [^117Y76FG] [^111Hs4fu] [^113qc7Hz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cite the mifepristone RCT here, but hold on, I should verify the context. That trial addresses adenomyosis, not gallbladder adenomyomatosis, so it belongs to the uterine adenomyosis pathway; while promising for symptom control and uterine volume reduction, it is not yet standard of care and should be framed as investigational pending broader validation and guideline endorsement [^113J5bHp].

> In summary, I need to ensure the user clarifies which organ system is intended. If gallbladder, adenomyomatosis is a benign wall hyperplasia with Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses; ultrasound first with CEUS or MRI as needed, and avoid surgery unless symptomatic or diagnostically uncertain; if uterus, adenomyosis is ectopic endometrium in the myometrium; TVUS first with MRI for problem-solving, and treat medically first, reserving surgery for refractory symptoms or completed fertility with patient preference [^116QQWiT] [^112Kyujk].

Adenomyomatosis is a **benign gallbladder wall thickening** with Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, most often detected incidentally on ultrasound [^113eHnPW]. It is classified as localized, segmental, or diffuse, and is best diagnosed by **ultrasound** [^116QQWiT] showing wall thickening with comet-tail artifacts; MRI can show the "pearl necklace" sign when ultrasound is inconclusive [^111m9wmc]. Management is **observation unless symptomatic** or when malignancy cannot be excluded, in which case cholecystectomy is indicated [^114Bj2GL]. There is no proven malignant potential, but segmental forms may coexist with gallbladder cancer, so careful imaging and clinical correlation are essential [^117DKGtt].

---

## Pathophysiology

Adenomyomatosis reflects **hyperplasia of the gallbladder wall**, with epithelial invaginations forming Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses that communicate with the lumen [^116QQWiT]. Chronic inflammation, increased intraluminal pressure, and gallstones are implicated in its development [^117DKGtt].

---

## Classification

Adenomyomatosis is classified into **three main types** based on distribution:

| **Type** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Localized | Focal thickening, often at the fundus ("fundal adenomyomatosis") [^116QQWiT] |
| Segmental | Involves a segment, causing narrowing and an "hourglass" appearance [^117DKGtt] |
| Diffuse | Generalized wall thickening with a contracted gallbladder [^117DKGtt] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Most cases are **asymptomatic** and found incidentally [^117DKGtt]. When symptomatic, patients may have biliary colic, dyspepsia, or right upper quadrant pain, often related to coexisting gallstones or cholecystitis [^117DKGtt].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

### Ultrasound (US)

Ultrasound is the **first-line modality** [^113eHnPW], with high sensitivity and specificity when performed with high-frequency probes and optimal focal depth [^113eHnPW]. Key features include:

- **Gallbladder wall thickening**: Focal or diffuse, with a sharp outer margin and clear cleavage from the liver [^113eHnPW].
- **Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses**: Small intramural cystic spaces (1–10 mm) that are pathognomonic [^113eHnPW].
- **Comet-tail artifacts**: Reverberation from cholesterol crystals within sinuses [^113eHnPW].
- **Twinkling artifact**: On color Doppler, from calcifications [^113eHnPW].

---

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)

CEUS improves visualization of **nonenhancing sinuses** and wall integrity, aiding differentiation from malignancy [^111KdX1c]. RAS appear avascular in all phases, whereas malignancy shows vascularity and wall destruction [^111KdX1c].

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI is a **problem-solving tool** when ultrasound is inconclusive [^117H6sy6]. The "pearl necklace" sign — a string of small T2-hyperintense sinuses — is characteristic [^111m9wmc]. Diffusion-weighted imaging can help distinguish benign from malignant wall thickenings [^111m9wmc].

---

### Computed tomography (CT)

CT is less sensitive but may show intramural cysts or the "cotton ball" sign (fuzzy dots in the wall), which support adenomyomatosis when present [^112kGxxd] [^111nhGg8].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Adenomyomatosis must be differentiated from:

- **Gallbladder carcinoma**: Irregular wall thickening, mass, vascular invasion, and lymphadenopathy [^notfound].
- **Chronic cholecystitis**: Uniform wall thickening with gallstones and inflammatory changes [^notfound].
- **Gallbladder polyps**: Mobile, nonshadowing intraluminal lesions without wall thickening [^114Rvz2F].

---

## Management

Management is **guided by symptoms and imaging confidence**:

- **Asymptomatic cases**: Observation with periodic ultrasound [^notfound].
- **Symptomatic cases or diagnostic uncertainty**: Cholecystectomy (laparoscopic preferred) [^114Bj2GL].
- **Segmental type**: Consider prophylactic cholecystectomy due to possible association with gallbladder cancer, though evidence is limited [^114Bj2GL].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Adenomyomatosis is **benign** with no proven malignant potential [^117DKGtt]. Segmental forms may coexist with gallbladder cancer, so careful imaging and clinical correlation are essential [^117DKGtt]. Complications are rare and usually relate to coexisting gallstones or cholecystitis [^117DKGtt].

---

Adenomyomatosis is a **benign gallbladder wall alteration** with characteristic imaging features; ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool, with MRI and CEUS as adjuncts. Management is conservative unless symptomatic or when malignancy cannot be excluded, in which case cholecystectomy is indicated [^114Bj2GL].

### Imaging update on gallbladder adenomyomatosis and its mimics [^1178dx7D]. Clinical Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Radiologists across many imaging modalities commonly encounter gallbladder adenomyomatosis. The classic imaging appearances of gallbladder adenomyomatosis are well described and confirm benignity. However, in clinical practice, adenomyomatosis can be challenging to differentiate from other gallbladder pathologies that require cholecystectomy. In this article, we describe the common and uncommon appearances of gallbladder adenomyomatosis on multimodality imaging, helping differentiate adenomyomatosis from non-benign gallbladder abnormalities. Accurately differentiating adenomyomatosis from its mimics provides the surgical team with important clinical and surgical management information, improving patient outcomes.

### Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: imaging findings, tricks and pitfalls [^114pjJCh]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Gallbladder adenomyomatosis (GA) is a benign alteration of the gallbladder wall that can be found in up to 9% of patients. GA is characterized by a gallbladder wall thickening containing small bile-filled cystic spaces (i.e., the Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, RAS). The bile contained in RAS may undergo a progressive concentration process leading to crystal precipitation and calcification development. A correct characterization of GA is fundamental in order to avoid unnecessary cholecystectomies. Ultrasound (US) is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing GA; the use of high-frequency probes and a precise focal depth adjustment enable correct identification and characterization of GA in the majority of cases. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can be performed if RAS cannot be clearly identified at baseline US: RAS appear avascular at CEUS, independently from their content. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for cases that are unclear on US and CEUS. At MRI, RAS can be identified with extremely high sensitivity, but their signal intensity varies widely according to their content. Positron emission tomography (PET) may be helpful for excluding malignancy in selected cases. Computed tomography (CT) and cholangiography are not routinely indicated in the suspicion of GA.

Teaching Points

1. Gallbladder adenomyomatosis is a common benign lesion (1–9% of the patients). 2. Identification of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses is crucial for diagnosing gallbladder adenomyomatosis. 3. Sonography is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing gallbladder adenomyomatosis. 4. Intravenous contrast material administration increases ultrasound accuracy in diagnosing gallbladder adenomyomatosis. 5. Magnetic resonance is a problem-solving technique for unclear cases.

### Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: imaging findings, tricks and pitfalls [^114Bj2GL]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

GA is frequently observed in cholecystectomy specimens, with a reported prevalence of 1–9% in pathology series. GA represents about 40% of benign gallbladder lesions.

Given its relatively high prevalence and the continuous increase in imaging studies performance, GA can be frequently encountered during everyday practice. The radiologist plays a central role in the diagnosis of GA and its main aim is to distinguish GA from neoplastic gallbladder wall thickenings (Fig. 3) in order to avoid unnecessary cholecystectomies. It is also important to accurately describe the gallbladder wall involvement pattern, as it can modify patient management.

Fig. 3
Gallbladder cancer: gallbladder adenocarcinoma may involve the gallbladder wall with various patterns. This case of gallbladder adenocarcinoma with annular involvement (white lines) can be differentiated from an adenomyomatosis because of the absence of cystic spaces (RAS) within the wall thickening on ultrasound (a) and because of the presence of hypodense tissue between the gallbladder wall and the adjacent liver (arrows) on contrast-enhanced CT (b)

There are no universally accepted guidelines for GA management. Given the lack of malignancy potential, GA is usually considered a "don't touch" lesion and cholecystectomy should be routinely reserved for symptomatic patients only or in case of inconclusive imaging findings. In any case, the surgical option might be considered in patients with segmental type GA, given its higher association with gallbladder cancer, and in patients with diffuse GA, given the possible difficulties in identifying neoplastic foci within the wall thickening.

In this article, we review multimodality imaging findings of GA, providing tips that may increase diagnostic confidence and highlighting possible pitfalls.

### Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder: the "good omen" comet [^117YVx9w]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

As emergency physicians perform bedside ultrasound with greater frequency, greater numbers of incidental and potentially unfamiliar sonographic findings will be encountered.

Objectives

Illustrate, discuss, and briefly review literature regarding one such finding and diagnosis in right upper quadrant sonography.

Case Report

A middle-aged woman was evaluated in the Emergency Department for abdominal pain. Limited bedside sonography of the gallbladder revealed mural thickening and comet-tailing. A diagnosis of adenomyomatosis was made.

Conclusion

Gallbladder adenomyomatosis can produce ultrasound findings similar to those of more serious and emergent gallbladder diseases. Cognizance of the sonographic details and typical clinical characteristics will allow the emergency physician to appropriately assess and disposition patients with this condition.

### Endoscopic ultrasonography of a multiseptate gallbladder: differentiation from adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder [^114tLYvo]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

A multiseptate gallbladder is a rare gallbladder anomaly, with a recorded occurrence of around 150 documented cases globally. Although multiple theories regarding the pathogenesis of multiseptate gallbladder have been proposed, its rarity precludes definitive management guidelines. It is typically diagnosed using imaging, and ultrasonography is considered the most effective and practical diagnostic modality.

We present the case of a 66-year-old Japanese man who was evaluated at our hospital because of pancreatic enlargement and increased IgG4 levels. The patient had been previously diagnosed with adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder neck and had been undergoing long-term observation (Fig. 1). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of the pancreas demonstrated diffusely reduced echogenicity in the caudal body, which is consistent with chronic progressive autoimmune pancreatitis. EUS of the gallbladder neck identified multiple septations, with a "honeycomb" pattern of linear internal echoes crossing the gallbladder lumen, which are characteristic of multiseptate gallbladder. The gallbladder had a normal size and thin walls; no evidence of wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or cholelithiasis was observed. The biliary tract was not significantly dilated. Enhanced EUS images obtained with perflubutane contrast medium were clearer than standard EUS images (Fig. 2; Video 1). Based on the EUS findings, we concluded that the diagnosis was multiseptate gallbladder in the gallbladder neck, rather than adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder.

Fig. 1
A multiseptate gallbladder that was found incidentally is seen on: a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), showing increased contrast enhancement in the affected region, and multiple septations, with a "honeycomb" pattern, in the gallbladder neck; b magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), performed to rule out other abdominal pathologies, showing septations in the gallbladder neck, which are characteristic of a multiseptate gallbladder.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound

Intravenous administration of micro-bubble contrast material represents a useful complement to conventional US and is increasingly used for various indications in abdominal imaging (e.g. for the differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions and for the characterization of renal cysts). In recent years, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been proposed, with encouraging results, also for the differential diagnosis of gallbladder wall thickenings and Tang et al. have demonstrated that contrast material administration significantly increases US sensitivity in the detection of RAS and in the depiction of gallbladder wall continuity in patients with GA. CEUS implicates the use of dedicated low mechanical index presets and intravenous administration of a bolus of 2.4 mL of contrast material, containing 8 μl/ml sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles, followed by a 10-ml saline flush; the target lesion is then scanned for the following 3–5 min in order to assess its vascularization.

Imaging findings

The thickened gallbladder wall shows the same degree of enhancement as the adjacent normal wall in the majority of the cases, whereas a relative hyper-enhancement may be observed in about 15% of the cases. Wall enhancement typically shows a trilaminar pattern during the arterial phase as a consequence of increased mucosal and serosal vascularization. The external layer must show no discontinuities.

Avascular spaces, representing RAS, must be observed within the thickened gallbladder wall (Fig. 9). RAS appear avascular in every phase of the dynamic study, independently from their content. The identification of avascular spaces within a gallbladder wall thickening is virtually pathognomonic for GA.

Fig. 9
Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: typical contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings. On CEUS, the thickened gallbladder wall shows discrete contrast enhancement, whereas Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses (arrows) appear as avascular structures during every phase of the exam

Tips & tricks

Intramural avascular spaces are best appreciated 70–100 s after endovenous contrast material administration when the gallbladder wall shows a homogeneous high-degree enhancement.

Pitfalls & limitations

The low mechanical index preset used for the performance of CEUS may reduce the accuracy in the characterization of gallbladder wall thickenings located in deep positions, away from the abdominal surface and from the probe. This may significantly limit CEUS accuracy in lesions involving the gallbladder neck and in obese patients.

### Gallbladder imaging interpretation pearls and pitfalls: ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging [^114NNQvx]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The gallbladder is a source of common disease processes with a wide variety of presentations. Common pathologies include acute or chronic cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, cancer, polyps, and postoperative complications. Accurate imaging assessment of the gallbladder can be very challenging and fraught with potential pitfalls. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. CT is often used as part of a broader evaluation of patient's abdominal pain if nongallbladder pathologies are also suspected. MRI/MRCP is typically reserved for problem-solving and evaluating patients who present with cholestatic presentation. We discuss common pitfalls, diagnostic challenges, and problem-solving approaches to the imaging evaluation of common gallbladder patho logies.

### Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: imaging findings, tricks and pitfalls [^113eHnPW]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound

Trans-abdominal ultrasound (US) represents the imaging modality of choice for the detection and characterization of GA, with accuracy values that range from 91.5 to 94.8% in differentiating GA from early-stage gallbladder cancer.

Imaging findings

Focal or diffuse gallbladder wall thickening (Fig. 5) can be easily detected at US and represents the consequence of both epithelial hypertrophy and muscular hyperplasia. Wall thickening represents a hallmark of GA, being always present, but it is poorly specific, as it can be found in most gallbladder pathologies. Anyway, in GA, the outer gallbladder layer must appear sharp and a clear cleavage plane with the liver must always be present. No pericholecystic fluid should be observed.

Fig. 5
Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: typical US findings in annular type (a), fundal type (b and d), segmental type (c) and diffuse type (e). Gallbladder wall thickening (line) is always seen in gallbladder adenomyomatosis, but it is non-specific. On b-mode images, Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses (arrows) typically appear anechoic (a), but they can also appear hyperechoic if cholesterine crystals or calcifications are present (b and c). Comet-tail reverberation artefacts (Figures b and e, arrowheads) or acoustic shadowing (c, arrowheads) are usually observed profoundly in RAS. On colour Doppler images (d), twinkling artefacts (arrowheads) may be observed profoundly in RAS

Small anechoic cystic spaces (1–10 mm) representing clear bile-filled RAS should be recognized within the thickened gallbladder, being pathognomonic for GA (Fig. 5a). Whenever cholesterine crystals fill RAS, they appear as intramural echogenic spots in association with reverberation artefacts (Fig. 5b and e). Reverberation artefacts are the consequence of the coexistence of different acoustic impedance media, i.e. clear bile and cholesterine crystals, within RAS and appear as hyperechoic "comet-tail" artefacts that project deeply into RAS. Sometimes RAS themselves may be not directly recognizable at the origin of reverberation artefacts. Calcification-filled RAS appear as intramural echogenic spots associated with posterior acoustic shadowing (Fig. 5c). Also, the presence of cholesterine crystal- or calcification-filled RAS is virtually diagnostic for GA.

### Rare gallbladder adenomyomatosis presenting as atypical cholecystitis: case report [^113t4hpL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Gallbladder adenomyomatosis is a benign condition characterized by hyperplastic change in the gallbladder wall and overgrowth of the mucosa because of an unknown cause. Patients with gallbladder adenomyomatosis usually present with abdominal pain. However, we herein describe a case of a patient with gallbladder adenomyomatosis who did not present with abdominal pain, but with only fever.

Case Presentation

A 34-year-old man presented to our hospital with a fever. No abdominal discomfort was declared. His physical examination showed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed thickness of the gallbladder. Acute cholecystitis was diagnosed. The fever persisted even after 1 week of antibiotic therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen showed gallbladder adenomyomatosis with intramural Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. Exploratory laparotomy with cholecystectomy was performed. The fever recovered and no residual symptoms were reported at the 3-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Gallbladder adenomyomatosis can present with fever as the only symptom. Although the association between gallbladder adenomyomatosis and malignancy has yet to be elucidated, previous reports have shown a strong association between gallbladder carcinoma and a subtype of gallbladder adenomyomatosis. Surgical intervention remains the first-choice treatment for patients with gallbladder adenomyomatosis.

### Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: imaging findings, tricks and pitfalls [^117DKGtt]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Annular GA is characterized by a ring-form thickening of the gallbladder wall, usually involving the middle portion. The gallbladder appears contracted only in the involved portion, changing its global morphology and becoming "hourglass-shaped". In some cases, epithelial proliferation may be particularly conspicuous and subdivide the gallbladder lumen into two separate compartments. As a consequence, biliary sludge and stones may accumulate into the isolated fundal compartment. According to some authors, annular GA should be considered a subtype of segmental GA.

Diffuse GA is characterized by the involvement of the whole organ that consequently appears contracted, even after fasting.

The pathogenesis of GA is not fully understood: an association with gallbladder stones and chronic inflammatory changes has been highlighted in many studies, but a correlation with acquired wall motility as a consequence of increased endoluminal pressure has also been postulated. GA is a benign lesion as the hyperplastic epithelium of GA has no higher neoplastic potential than that of a normal gallbladder, even though gallbladder carcinoma may also arise in association with GA. Some studies have shown an increase in gallbladder cancer prevalence among patients with segmental type adenomyomatosis compared to patients without GA or with other patterns of GA, in particular, in the elderly. However, these results may have been influenced by the higher prevalence of cholecystolithiasis in patients affected by segmental type GA, which represents a well-known risk factor for gallbladder carcinoma. GA may increase in size over time and this change by itself must not be considered an index of malignancy. Patients affected by GA are usually asymptomatic. When present, symptoms may include right upper quadrant pain, possibly also as a consequence of the presence of gallbladder stones.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography diagnosis of fundal localized type of gallbladder adenomyomatosis [^11352QEm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is characterized by hyperplastic changes in the mucosal layer, with the formation of intramural diverticula or sinus tracts termed Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses penetrating into a thickened muscular layer. Adenomyomatosis is commonly detected in 2%-5% of all cholecystectomies. In most patients, the adenomyomatosis is asymptomatic but is detected by an incidental US examination or by post-operative examination of gallbladder specimens. US examination is the first line investigation used to diagnose adenomyomatosis of the GB. The criteria for diagnosis of adenomyomatosis by ultrasonography are localized or diffuse thickening of the GB wall and the presence of small intramural cyst(s) with or without intramural echogenic foci. But some cases are misdiagnosed as chronic cholecystitis or cancer, because of the uncertainty of intramural anechoic cystic spaces. Thus, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in demonstrating adenomyomatosis has been reported as being less than 70%, especially in the localized fundal type, which is the most common type of GB adenomyomatosis.

Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been used for the diagnosis of GB and biliary duct diseases and is considered a valuable complement to conventional US. Some researchers have concluded that CEUS may be useful for differentiating malignant tumors from sludge, and could also differentiate cystic structures from parenchymal structures by dynamic observation of the blood-perfusion in the tumor or organ. Therefore we propose that CEUS, by depicting the non-enhancing intramural diverticula could be helpful in detecting the tiny Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses that are uncertain on grayscale US. In this paper, we present findings in the CEUS imaging of the fundal localized type of adenomyomatosis of the GB. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of CEUS in describing the fundal localized type of GB adenomyomatosis.

This article reviews the imaging of various benign and malignant diseases of the gallbladder. Clinical findings and imaging features using ultrasound, CT, and MR for the detection and evaluation of gallstones, acute cholecystitis, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, and carcinoma of the gallbladder among other disorders are discussed.

### Rare gallbladder adenomyomatosis presenting as atypical cholecystitis: case report [^115RNeGU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

To date, the pathogenesis of GAM has not been well understood. Neurogenic dysfunction of the gallbladder may create an increased intracystic pressure that is thought to be responsible for the formation of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. Furthermore, according to previous analyses, the association between GAM and gallstones ranges from 36% to 95%. Chronic inflammation of the gallbladder may cause GAM. The pathological findings in our patient included chronic inflammation, but no gallstone was observed; the pathogenesis of GAM remains unclear.

Ultrasonography is an adequate, noninvasive diagnostic technique for GAM. Ultrasonographic features of GAM include diffuse or segmental gallbladder wall thickening with intramural diverticula observed as anechoic spaces or as echogenic foci that may show acoustic shadows or reverberation artifacts. However, ultrasongraphic diagnosis is highly operator-dependent. Ultrasound of our patient's abdomen showed gallbladder wall thickening. However, the typical findings of GAM with intramural diverticulae were not seen. Therefore, our patient was diagnosed with acute acalculous cholecystitis rather than GAM. However, because of the poor response to adequate antibiotic therapy in our patient, a further imaging study with a gallium-67 scan was indicated to survey for other infection sources. Recently, several investigators suggested that MRI is the most accurate diagnostic technique for GAM characterized by the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for GAM may reveal hot spots, which cannot be distinguished from malignancy.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography diagnosis of fundal localized type of gallbladder adenomyomatosis [^115r12Sy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Adenomyomatosis of gallbladder is an acquired hyperplastic lesion, characterized by focal or diffuse thickening of the gallbladder with intramural cysts or echogenic areas with comet tail on ultrasonography. But in some cases, especially in the localized fundal type of adenomyomatosis, the intramural anechoic cystic spaces are uncertainty which causes difficult to differential adenomyomatosis from GB cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography(CEUS) in the diagnosis of the fundal localized type of gallbladder adenomyomatosis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 21 patients with pathologically proven fundal localized type of gallbladder (GB) adenomyomatosis. All patients underwent preoperative grayscale ultrasound (US) and real-time CEUS examination. The study's reviewers made the diagnosis of adenomyomatosis according to the presence of the focal thickening of the fundal gallbladder wall with intramural cyst or intramural echogenic foci on grayscale US or CEUS. The diagnostic accuracy of US and CEUS was compared. The enhanced pattern and degree of intactness of the GB wall were also recorded.

Results

The fundal portion of the GB wall showed localized thickness in all 21 patients. Small anechoic spaces or intramural echogenic foci were detected in 14 (66.7%) and 21 (100%) of cases respectively, and the intactness of the GB wall's outer hyper-echoic layer was demonstrated in 17 (81%) and 20 (95%) on grayscale US and CEUS, respectively. The accuracy rate of the above two examination modalities was significantly different (p < 0.05). In the arterial phase of the CEUS, areas of focal thickened GB wall were iso-enhanced in 18 cases and hyper-enhanced in 3 cases. All 21 cases appeared to show heterogeneous enhancement with small non-enhancement spaces. The mucosal and serosal layers of the GB wall surrounding the lesions were enhanced, which presented as two "hyper-echoic lines" in the arterial phase of CEUS. In the venous phase of the CEUS, 19 lesions were iso-enhanced and 2 lesions were hypo-enhanced. The small non-enhancement spaces were more clearly during the venous phase.

Conclusion

The small non-enhancement space is a characteristic finding of the fundal localized type of gallbladder adenomyomatosis on CEUS. CEUS could increase the degree of visualization of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (RAS) and intactness of the GB wall, which play an important role in differential diagnosis.

Discussion

Adenomyomatosis is an acquired and degenerative disease of the gallbladder, mostly seen in adults. Adenomyomatosis consists of three types: localized, segmental and diffuse. The localized type is the most common and usually involves the GB fundus. The fundal area of the GB is a superficial area where ultrasonography is more limited due to reverberation artifacts from subcutaneous tissue decreasing spatial resolution and interruption from gastrointestinal gas. Therefore, recognition of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses is more difficult at this part of the GB wall. But without the observation of intramural cysts, focal wall thickening is a non-specific finding; it may represent an early state of gallbladder carcinoma, chronic cholecystitis or localized adenomyomatosis. Thus, recognition of intramural cysts is essential in the sonographic diagnosis of adenomyomatosis.

Microbubble US contrast agents are truly blood pool contrast agents. The agent remains entirely intravascular and with it, any abnormal vascular supply will demonstrate different enhancement. This property is of benefit in distinguishing tumors of the GB wall from pseudotumors; motionless sludge or debris will not be enhanced. The contrast enhancement could also increase spatial resolution and reduce artifact and noise. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses could be more clearly visualized as background GB wall enhances, because Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses remains anechoic on CEUS. Therefore, CEUS is better than US at helping to depict the intramural cysts of adenomyomatosis and making the correct diagnosis. In this study, only 66.7% of cases had small anechoic areas in thickened GB wall on US, but 100% cases had small no-enhancement areas on CEUS.

### Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder: disease spectrum with pathologic correlation [^114iCv8s]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Gallbladder polyps are seen on as many as 7% of gallbladder ultrasonographic images. The differential diagnosis for a polypoid gallbladder mass is wide and includes pseudotumors, as well as benign and malignant tumors. Tumefactive sludge may be mistaken for a gallbladder polyp. Pseudotumors include cholesterol polyps, adenomyomatosis, and inflammatory polyps, and they occur in that order of frequency. The most common benign and malignant tumors are adenomas and primary adenocarcinoma, respectively. Polyp size, shape, and other ancillary imaging findings, such as a wide base, wall thickening, and coexistent gallstones, are pertinent items to report when gallbladder polyps are discovered. These findings, as well as patient age and risk factors for gallbladder cancer, guide clinical decision making. Symptomatic polyps without other cause for symptoms, an age over 50 years, and the presence of gallstones are generally considered indications for cholecystectomy. Incidentally noted pedunculated polyps smaller than 5 mm generally do not require follow-up. Polyps that are 6–10 mm require follow-up, although neither the frequency nor the length of follow-up has been established. Polyps that are larger than 10 mm are typically excised, although lower size thresholds for cholecystectomy may be considered for patients with increased risk for gallbladder carcinoma, such as patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography diagnosis of fundal localized type of gallbladder adenomyomatosis [^116uUi9m]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Adenomyomatosis is characterized by a thickened muscularis with Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, with the mucosal layer and serosal layer of thickened GB wall separate and intact. Ijin Joo et al. reported that the presence of a "multilayer pattern" in the GB wall, with a smooth innermost hyper-echoic layer, was useful in the diagnosis of adenomyomatosis, in cases where the anechoic area or intramural echogenic foci in thickened GB wall were not detected. In this study, 3 cases of suspected adenomyomatosis on US before operation were observed because of the intact mucosal and serosal layers presenting as "multilayer pattern" of local thickened GB wall. But if the local GB wall thickness and intactness was obscured, the presence of a malign lesion could not be excluded, which occurred in 4 cases in our research. But in 3 of these 4 cases, the GB wall intactness was detected by CEUS and confirmed by surgery, due to the GB wall being enhanced at the early arterial phase and appearing as a "hyper-echoic line" compared with the surrounding hepatic parenchyma, which increases the depiction of the GB wall. CEUS was therefore more accurate for the detection of the intactness of the GB wall.

This report describes a 41-year-old female who presented with adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder mimicking polypoid carcinoma, on the diagnostic imaging findings and revealing unusual histologic features for such a localized adenomyomatosis. The mass was located on the gallbladder liver-side wall at the fundus and papillary hyperechoic growth showed no clear ultrasonographic features of adenomyomatosis. The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a tentative diagnosis of superficial polypoid carcinoma. Histologically, the tumor bulged due to subserosal excessive fat tissue.

Limitations and pitfalls

Our study had several limitations. First, the number of was small and only the fundal localized type of adenomyomatosis was assessed. Second, this study showed the value of CEUS in the diagnosis of GB adenomyomatosis, but it was not accurate enough to differentiate the diagnosis of adenomyomatosis from that of early-stage carcinoma or tumor-like lesions of the GB. Of the several lesions causing wall thickness similar to that of the fundal type adenomyomatosis, GB carcinoma is most dreaded. Thus, a further study with a large population including all the types of GB adenomyomatosis and the different disease pathologies of GB is needed.

Recommendations and statements

A summary of the recommendations is described in the algorithm (Fig. 1). Each point in the algorithm will be discussed separately below. Diagnosis and follow-up are based on transabdominal ultrasound. In cases of multiple polyps the largest polyp should be used in deciding management. Grades of evidence as per the GRADE system and agreement level of the group (in per cent) are included in brackets after each statement.

Fig. 1
Management algorithm

Polyp definition

On ultrasound a gallbladder polyp is seen as an elevation of the gallbladder wall that protrudes into the lumen. It should not be mobile or demonstrate posterior acoustic shadowing (which would suggest it is more likely a calculus). It may be sessile or pedunculated.

A clearly infiltrating or large mass should be treated as a gallbladder cancer rather than a polyp.

If there is clear reverberation or "comet tail" artefact present posterior to the lesion (Fig. 2) this should be identified as a pseudopolyp (focal adenomyomatosis or a cholesterol polyp). The follow-up guidelines, therefore, do not need to be followed for these patients. Of note, not all pseudopolyps will demonstrate these findings.

Oral cholecystography

Oral cholecystography (OC) was the first imaging modality used for diagnosing GA, but nowadays represents an obsolete technique. The knowledge of typical GA findings at OC, however, enables better understanding of the imaging patterns we are now dealing with. In particular, besides gallbladder wall thickening and possible strictures formation, the most relevant finding at OC was the visualization of rounded contrast media collections adjacent to the gallbladder lumen, representing RAS (Fig. 4). This finding represents the imaging demonstration of the communication between RAS and the gallbladder lumen.

Results

Grayscale US

The GB walls were localized thickenings protruding into the lumen in form of triangles at the fundus in all patients. The thickness range was from 1.0 × 0.9 cm 2 to 2.7 × 1.3 cm 2. In 14 patients, small anechoic areas or intramural echogenic foci were detected in areas of thickened GB wall (Fig. 1). These 14 patients were diagnosed with certainty as adenomyomatosis. The thickened GB revealed a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass in 7 patients without small anechoic areas or intramural echogenic foci. Three of these 7 patients were suspected as having adenomyomatosis, due to two hyperechoic layers being observed around the lesions, which indicated the mucosa and serosa of the GB wall. The other 4 patients could not be excluded from a diagnosis of carcinoma because their local GB walls were obscured.

Main text

Gallbladder adenomyomatosis

Gallbladder adenomyomatosis (GA) is a benign alteration of the gallbladder wall characterized by excessive epithelial proliferation associated with hyperplasia of the muscularis propria, resulting in gallbladder wall thickening. The excessive epithelial proliferation leads to epithelial infolding within the underlying muscular layer with subsequent formation of epithelium-lined diverticular pouches, the so-called Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses (RAS; Fig. 1). The content of RAS consists of bile that may undergo progressive dehydration over time, leading to cholesterine crystal precipitation. Moreover, cholesterine crystals may induce a chronic inflammatory reaction leading to intramural dystrophic calcification development. The serosa is never involved by GA.

Fig. 1
Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: pathology findings. Macroscopically (a) GA is characterized by gallbladder wall thickening (lines) containing small cystic spaces (arrows) representing Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses. Microscopically, at low (2×) magnification (b and c), wall thickening is due to hyperplasia of the muscular layer (lines); a variable degree of epithelial proliferation (arrowheads) is also appreciable and epithelium-lined cystic spaces, representing RAS (arrows), can be observed within the muscular layer. Biliary stones (star) may be present within RAS. At high (40×) magnification (d), the proliferative mucosal glandular component that leads to epithelial infolding (arrowheads) and RAS formation is better recognizable

Adenomyomatosis may involve the gallbladder according to four main patterns: localized, segmental, annular and diffuse (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: patterns of gallbladder wall involvement. Drawings showing localized gallbladder adenomyomatosis (a), annular gallbladder adenomyomatosis (b), segmental gallbladder adenomyomatosis (c) and diffuse gallbladder adenomyomatosis (d)

Localized GA is the most common pattern and is characterized by a focal thickening, usually involving the fundal region (the so-called " fundal GA "). The uninvolved gallbladder wall appears physiologically thin and the overall gallbladder shape is usually maintained.

Segmental GA is characterized by the involvement of a larger portion of the gallbladder wall, typically the fundus and the distal third of the body. The involved portion appears contracted, whereas the uninvolved one maintains its normal shape.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography diagnosis of fundal localized type of gallbladder adenomyomatosis [^1126suTn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, CEUS could increase the visualization of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses and is a more accurate means of detection of abnormalities of the GB wall. These CEUS results played important roles in diagnosing adenomyomatousis of the GB. Though the use of CT and MR imaging has also been described in the diagnosis of gallbladder adenomyomatosis, CEUS is the best choice of diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of adenomyomatosis of the GB, as it is real-time, does not involve radiation exposure and is reproducible.

### An unusual association of diffuse adenomyomatosis with dysplastic adenoma in chronic calculous cholecystitis: case presentation [^115jQmy8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with adenomyomatosis and (or without) adenomas may present signs or symptoms of chronic cholecystitis or acute-on-chronic cholecystitis such as right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting associated with meals, or more unexplained signs. However, the majority of patients are asymptomatic and the diagnosis of adenoma is usually rare. Our patient was symptomatic and clinical signs were probably related to lithiasis, but their relationship to adenoma or adenomyomatosis cannot be excluded.

US is useful to diagnose adenoma and adenomyomatosis, and could be sufficient in patients that should be treated surgically for symptoms or for the dimensions of adenomas (> 1 cm in diameter). In asymptomatic patients with lesion smaller than 1 cm, MRI or ecoendoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) may be used to obtain a differential diagnosis. EUS may be useful to differentiate non neoplastic from neoplastic polyps of the gallbladder; however, caution should be used because some findings can also occur in neoplastic polyps when they contain a concomitant non neoplastic component (cholesterosis or proliferated Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses). MRI may provide important information for the diagnosis of adenomyomatosis and may differentiate it from gallbladder carcinoma. On MRI, these sinuses appear as small intramural foci of low T1 and high T2 signal intensity. Early linear mucosal enhancement is seen, which turns homogeneous on late phases. On MRI images, the tumor usually shows T1 and high T2 signal intensity. The enhancement pattern of gallbladder carcinoma is described as irregularly delineate peripheral enhancement in early phases and further enhancement in late phase. Due to the small number of patients studied up to now, this procedure is not well validated and should be confirmed by other studies.

Our patient only underwent US due to her symptoms, and was promptly operated on. Surgery should be performed quickly when symptoms are present. In asymptomatic patients, laparoscopic surgery may become mandatory if diagnosis remains uncertain after EUS or MRI. Moreover, as in this case report, degenerative risk may exist in non-reported conditions, suggesting surgery should be mandatory when there is a concomitant presence of large adenoma and adenomyomatosis.

### An unusual association of diffuse adenomyomatosis with dysplastic adenoma in chronic calculous cholecystitis: case presentation [^113nfTP8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Gallbladder adenomyomatosis is an epithelial proliferation and hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosae of the gallbladder. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses are a characteristic of this condition. The segmental adenomyomatosis has a higher risk of developing into gallbladder carcinoma, especially in the fundal region of elderly patients. We report the case of a patient affected by chronic calculous cholecystitis with diffuse adenomyomatosis associated with dysplastic adenoma.

Case Presentation

An 81-year-old woman presented at our hospital with a 1-year history of intermittent pain localized at the right upper abdominal quadrant, without diffusion to any other body part. On physical examination the abdomen was soft, not distended, and tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant. Murphy sign was negative. Laboratory tests were normal. The patient was scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and neither endoscopic ultrasonographic scan nor magnetic resonance imaging was performed. The operation, performed after obtaining informed consent, was uncomplicated and the intra-operative pathological examination showed no malignancy. The definitive pathological examination of the gallbladder showed: multiple stones of cholesterol origin; diffuse mucosal adenomyomatosis; and a 1.1 cm pedunculated mass localized at the fundus, whose surface was lumpy. This mass was diagnosed as an adenoma with multiple areas of severe dysplasia.

Conclusions

The adenoma of the gallbladder, together with the dysplasia, represents a biological carcinogenetic model. Carcinoma has rarely been reported in adenomyomatosis. Degenerative risk suggests surgery should be mandatory when there is a concomitant presence of large adenoma and adenomyomatosis.

Gallbladder cancer risk factors and prophylaxis: Cholelithiasis with chronic inflammation is the most prevalent risk factor and risk increases with stone size. Calcified gallbladder wall (porcelain gallbladder) has historical cancer estimates in up to 22% with calcification, though later reports show gallbladder cancer present in 7% to 15%. Additional risk factors include anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction, gallbladder polyps (> 1 cm), chronic typhoid infection, primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and possibly adenomyomatosis. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is probably beneficial for high-risk patients (eg, porcelain gallbladder, polyps > 1 cm). The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound proposed 3 risk categories for gallbladder polyps and recommend a surgical consult for extremely low risk and low risk polyps ≥ 1.5 cm and for indeterminate risk polyps ≥ 0.7 cm. Patients with chronic cholecystitis or pancreatiobiliary malfunction have a greater prevalence of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) gallbladder cancers.

### MR imaging of the gallbladder: a pictorial essay [^117H6sy6]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

The gallbladder serves as the repository for bile produced in the liver. However, bile within the gallbladder may become supersaturated with cholesterol, leading to crystal precipitation and subsequent gallstone formation. The most common disorders of the gallbladder are related to gallstones and include symptomatic cholelithiasis, acute and chronic cholecystitis, and carcinoma of the gallbladder. Other conditions that can affect the gallbladder include biliary dyskinesia (functional), adenomyomatosis (hyperplastic), and postoperative changes or complications (iatrogenic). Ultrasonography (US) has been the traditional modality for evaluating gallbladder disease, primarily owing to its high sensitivity and specificity for both stone disease and gallbladder inflammation. US performed before and after ingestion of a fatty meal may also be useful for functional evaluation of the gallbladder. However, US is limited by patient body habitus, with degradation of image quality and anatomic detail in obese individuals. With the advent of faster and more efficient imaging techniques, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has assumed an increasing role as an adjunct modality for gallbladder imaging, primarily in patients who are incompletely assessed with US. MR imaging allows simultaneous anatomic and physiologic assessment of the gallbladder and biliary tract in both initial evaluation of disease and examination of the postoperative patient. This assessment is accomplished chiefly through the use of MR imaging contrast agents excreted preferentially via the biliary system.

### Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: imaging findings, tricks and pitfalls [^111m9wmc]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Tips & tricks

The use of fat-saturated T2-weighted sequences increases RAS conspicuity.

MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) images can be useful for identifying RAS that sometimes may be overlooked on axial images. On MRCP images, many RAS can be usually observed one next to each other along the involved gallbladder wall leading to the so-called pearl necklace sign (Fig. 12).

Fig. 12
MRI of gallbladder adenomyomatosis: the pearl necklace sign. On heavily T2-weighted images, like in this maximum intensity projection reconstruction of a volumetric MRCP, a lot of RAS can be identified one next to the other around the gallbladder, leading to the so-called pearl necklace sign

RAS may be extremely small and, therefore, barely recognizable on thick slab T2-weighted images. The acquisition of volumetric respiratory-triggered T2-weighted images increases the sensitivity of MRI in recognizing small RAS and offers the possibility of multiplanar reconstructions.

Contrast material administration is not routinely indicated in the suspicion of GA. Indeed, heavily T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences are the most reliable for the identification of RAS.

Diffusion-weighted imaging can be helpful in the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant gallbladder wall thickenings. Ogawa et al. demonstrated that malignant thickenings show significantly lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values than benign ones. Despite this, some overlap exists between benign and malignant lesions.

Pitfalls & limitations

T1-hyperintense RAS can be frequently observed. This must not raise any doubt in the diagnosis of GA, being the consequence of concentrated biliary content, cholesterine crystals or calcifications.

RAS with different content, and consequently with different signal intensities, often coexist in the same patient.

### Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: imaging findings, tricks and pitfalls [^115ZqUNw]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Positron emission tomography

Despite its low spatial resolution, positron emission tomography (PET) offers the possibility of obtaining metabolic information from body tissues. After i.v. administration of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxiglucose (18 F-FDG), high glucose-consuming tissues (i.e. neoplastic and inflammatory ones) can be identified. PET is not usually performed in the suspicion of GA, but patients affected by GA may sometimes undergo PET for other reasons.

Imaging findings

GA typically shows no 18 F-FDG uptake or lower uptake compared to the liver (Fig. 15). This finding is not specific for GA, but may help in excluding malignancy.

Fig. 15
Gallbladder adenomyomatosis: typical PET-CT findings. Gallbladder adenomyomatosis (circle) usually shows an F-18FDG uptake equal or lower than the adjacent liver

Pitfalls & limitations

An acute inflammatory reaction sometimes surrounds RAS, generating an increased 18 F-FDG uptake that leads to false positive diagnosis of neoplasm.

PET has low spatial resolution and its accuracy in excluding early gallbladder neoplasms may be unsatisfactory in lesions measuring less then 1 cm.

### CT differentiation of adenomyomatosis and gallbladder cancer [^112kGxxd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of CT in differentiating adenomyomatosis from gallbladder cancer.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively identified the cases of 36 patients with pathologically proven adenomyomatosis (n = 22) or gallbladder cancer (n = 14) who had undergone preoperative abdominal CT. Two reviewers independently evaluated the presence and nature of morphologic gallbladder abnormalities, including the presence of intramural diverticula (i.e., small cystic-appearing spaces within the gallbladder wall). The reviewers used a five-point scale (1, definitely absent; 5, definitely present) to rate the overall likelihood of the presence of adenomyomatosis and gallbladder cancer. Ratings were dichotomized such that a diagnosis was considered present at a rating of 4 or 5 and considered absent at lower ratings.

Results

Reviewer 1 detected a morphologic gallbladder abnormality in 17 patients and correctly characterized the abnormality in 14 (82%) of the patients (eight with adenomyomatosis and six with gallbladder cancer). Reviewer 2 detected an abnormality in 18 patients and was correct for 13 (72%) of the patients (eight with adenomyomatosis and five with gallbladder cancer). In particular, reviewer 1 detected intramural diverticula in eight patients, and all had the pathologic diagnosis of adenomyomatosis, whereas reviewer 2 detected intramural diverticula in 11 patients, and eight (73%) had the pathologic diagnosis of adenomyomatosis.

Conclusion

CT is limited in the detection and differentiation of adenomyomatosis and gallbladder cancer, but the diagnosis of adenomyomatosis can be made with reasonable accuracy when thickening of the gallbladder wall is seen to contain small cystic-appearing spaces.

A case of polypoid leiomyosarcoma of the gallbladder arising in association with pre-existing adenomyomatous hyperplasia is described. The patient, a 34-year-old woman with symptoms of cholelithiasis, underwent a cholecystectomy for gallstones. The resected specimen showed, in addition to multiple stones, a large, rubbery, broad-based polypoid mass in the fundus. Histologic examination showed a malignant spindle cell proliferation with immunophenotypic features of smooth muscle differentiation. The base of the lesion showed features of adenomyomatous hyperplasia. The possible relationships of this lesion with adenomyomatous hyperplasia and other stromal lesions of the gallbladder are reviewed.

Clinical diagnosis, imaging examination and surgical-related information

The biliary related comorbidities and ultrasonography results of the 83 patients with cholecystolithiasis in non-MRCP group were shown in Table 2. Among them, 76 patients underwent simple LC surgery. Six cases of CBDS with common bile duct dilatation (one of them combined with preoperative percutaneous gallbladder puncture and drainage) underwent LC combined with common bile duct exploration, choledocholithotomy and T-tube drainage. One case of CBDS without common bile duct dilatation underwent LC combined with preoperative Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), Endoscopic sphincteropapillotomy (EST) lithotomy.

The biliary related comorbidities, ultrasound and MRCP results of 101 patients with cholecystolithiasis in MRCP group were shown in Tables 2 and 3. Of the 101 cases, 80 cases underwent simple LC surgery. Fifteen cases of CBDS with common bile duct dilatation (one of them combined with preoperative percutaneous gallbladder puncture and drainage) underwent LC combined with common bile duct exploration, choledocholithotomy and T-tube drainage. Seven cases without common bile duct dilatation (one case combined with common bile duct exploration, common bile duct lithotomy and T-tube drainage) underwent LC combined with preoperative ERCP, EST stone extraction.

Comparison of abdominal ultrasound and MRCP findings in the MRCP group

There was a statistically significant difference in CBDS, adenomyomatosis and biliary tract variation between the two groups (P < 0.05). MRCP can find more CBDS, adenomyomatosis and biliary tract variation than ultrasound.

The prevalence and etiology of the cystic components within gallbladder carcinomas as seen on MR images were evaluated. A retrospective review of MR images was performed for 35 proven gallbladder carcinomas in search of radiologically detectable intratumoral cystic components. The pathologic specimens were meticulously reviewed to determine the etiology. MR images of 31 adenomyomatoses were also reviewed for comparison to clarify the difference in MR features between these two entities. Three cases out of 35 proven gallbladder carcinomas were found to have intratumoral cystic components. They were all well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, and the cystic components consisted of dilated neoplastic glands filled with abundant mucin pool. Adenomyomatosis tended to have more and rounded cystic components (Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses) lined in a linear fashion and were flat-elevated in shape, smaller in size and had a regular surface, as compared to the three carcinomas. Although rare, radiologists need to be aware that well-differentiated gallbladder carcinoma with mucin production can have cystic components, which may mimic adenomyomatosis. Careful interpretation of MR images may provide useful information in the differentiation of these two entities.

Prevalence of pancreaticobiliary disease

The prevalence of disease is shown in Table 2. There were thirty-two patients with pancreatic cyst. The median cyst size was 5 mm. The largest was a 20-mm multilocular cyst, which was diagnosed as a branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) without high-risk stigmata or worrisome features. All patients with pancreatic cysts were scheduled for follow-up MRI at six months. Twenty-five patients were diagnosed with early chronic pancreatitis, which had 3 to 4 minor features of chronic pancreatitis, according to the Rosemont classification. No patients had symptoms of chronic pancreatitis. Fourteen patients had gallbladder polyp (suspected cholesterol polyp). Nine patients had adenomyomatosis and thirteen had asymptomatic gallbladder stones. These gallbladder lesions were scheduled for follow-up AUS at six months. One patient had asymptomatic common bile duct stone, and was treated with endoscopic removal of the common bile duct stone by endoscopic sphincterotomy. Other patients were followed up with AUS, MRI or CT at one year at the patient's request.

Table 2
Prevalence of diseases

EUS endoscopic ultrasound

Forty-four patients had undergone AUS in the past year. Sixteen of these patients were diagnosed with pancreatic disease (pancreatic cyst, n = 8; early chronic pancreatitis, n = 8) which was not detected by AUS in the past year. Twelve of these patients were diagnosed gallbladder disease (adenomyomatosis, n = 7; gallbladder stones, n = 5), that had already been diagnosed by AUS. To date, 88 (59.5%) have already undergone follow-up CT or MRI examinations. None of the patients showed other pancreaticobiliary findings.

Prevalence of upper-gastrointestinal disease

As shown in Table 2, various findings were detected by EGD screening. No patients had malignant features. In 56 patients (37.8%) cases, it was difficult to delineate the lesser curvature of the gastric angle when pulling back the scope because of the long distal end of the scope. In these cases, the gastric angle could be evaluated in the short scope position. All patients were scheduled for follow-up EGD at one year.

### CT diagnosis of gallbladder adenomyomatosis: importance of enhancing mucosal epithelium, the "cotton ball sign" [^111nhGg8]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic value of the cotton ball sign and other CT features in patients with gallbladder (GB) wall thickenings (WTs).

Methods

Three blinded readers reviewed the preoperative CT and MR images of 101 patients with pathologically confirmed GB adenomyomatosis (GA) (n = 34) and other benign (n = 29), malignant (n = 41), and premalignant (n = 2) GBWTs. Three readers analysed the morphological features of GBWT and presence of the "cotton ball sign", defined as fuzzy grey dots in GBWT or a dotted outer border of the inner enhancing layer on contrast-enhanced (CE) CT. In addition, the "pearl necklace sign" on MR was analysed.

Results

In the GA group (n = 34), prevalence of the cotton ball sign and pearl necklace sign was 74% (25/34) and 44% (15/34), respectively. Presence of the cotton ball sign, smooth contour of the mucosa, double-layering enhancement, and enhancement degree weaker than the renal cortex on CT images were significant predictors of benign GBWT (p < 0.01). When differentiating GA from GB malignancy or premalignancy, accuracy of the cotton ball sign and pearl necklace sign was 81% (62/77) and 74% (57/77), respectively.

Conclusion

The cotton ball sign on CE-CT showed higher sensitivity and comparable specificity to those of the pearl necklace sign in differentiating GA from malignancy.

Key Points

- Prevalence of the cotton ball sign on CT was 74% in gallbladder adenomyomatosis.
- The cotton ball sign was useful in differentiating gallbladder adenomyomatosis from gallbladder cancer.
- The cotton ball sign was more sensitive than the pearl necklace sign for adenomyomatosis diagnosis.

### Acromegaly: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111YSv42]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs) — gallbladder monitoring recommendation 5.4 — states: "We suggest against routine abdominal ultrasound to monitor for gallstone disease in a patient receiving a SRL (2|⊕⊕○○)". It further specifies, "Ultrasound should be performed if the patient has signs and symptoms of gallstone disease. (2|⊕⊕○○)". Supporting evidence notes gallbladder stones and sludge occur in approximately 25% of subjects and are usually asymptomatic, with only 4% showing biochemical cholestasis in one study, and that routine monitoring is not considered necessary, though symptoms of obstruction may occur after cessation of the SRL.

### Effect of mifepristone vs placebo for treatment of adenomyosis with pain symptoms… [^113J5bHp]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Is mifepristone effective for adenomyosis treatment. Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 134 participants with adenomyosis pain symptoms, the participants in the mifepristone group and had significantly greater improvement in pain scores than the placebo group. All the secondary outcomes, including hemoglobin, platelet count, and uterine volume, showed significant improvements in the mifepristone group, and there were no serious adverse events. Meaning This randomized clinical trial found that mifepristone was effective and safe for the treatment of adenomyosis, which supports the repositioning of this drug as a new treatment option for adenomyosis. Importance Adenomyosis is a common chronic gynecological disorder, and its treatment is an unmet need. New therapies need to be developed. Mifepristone is being tested for adenomyosis treatment.

The primary end point was the change in adenomyosis-associated dysmenorrhea intensity, evaluated by the visual analog scale after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points included the change in menstrual blood loss, increased level of hemoglobin in patients with anemia, CA125 level, platelet count, and uterine volume after 12 weeks of treatment. Safety was assessed according to adverse events, vital signs, gynecological examinations, and laboratory evaluations. In particular, uterine volume was significantly decreased after 12 weeks of mifepristone treatment compared with placebo. The mean change in uterine volume from baseline was −29. 32 cm3 in the mifepristone group and
18. 39 cm3 in the placebo group. The results of the primary analysis for these key efficacy outcomes in PPS population were similar to the results in the FAS population.

In this placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of mifepristone vs placebo for the treatment of adenomyosis, 12 weeks of mifepristone treatment at a dose of 10 mg per day led to a significant remission for patient symptoms with acceptable tolerability. Therefore, mifepristone was effective and safe for the treatment of adenomyosis. However, further research is still needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy.

### Gallbladder and the risk of polyps and carcinoma in metachromatic leukodystrophy [^112Mkf3J]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess frequency of gallbladder polyposis and carcinoma in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).

Methods

We evaluated 34 patients with MLD (average age 16.7 years, age range 2–39 years) screened for gallbladder abnormalities by ultrasound. In the case of cholecystectomy, findings at pathology were reviewed.

Results

Only 8 of 34 patients (23%) had a normal gallbladder at ultrasound. Gallbladder polyps were visible in 8 patients (23%). Cholecystectomy was performed in 11 patients (32%). In these, pathology revealed various abnormalities, including hyperplastic polyps, intestinal metaplasia, prominent Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, and sulfatide storage.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that gallbladder involvement is the rule rather than the exception in MLD. The high prevalence of hyperplastic polyps, a known precancerous condition, and one death from gallbladder carcinoma at a young age suggest that MLD predisposes to neoplastic gallbladder abnormalities. As novel therapies for this patient group are emerging leading to increased life expectancy, we recommend screening for gallbladder abnormalities by ultrasound in order to prevent early death.

### Differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis and concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis: a MUSA criteria analysis [^116y81Yk]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, our study highlights significant differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis in symptomatic patients when it occurs concurrently with endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis. This research contributes to the broader investigation of the complex interplay between endometriosis and adenomyosis, suggesting that the spectrum of these conditions is more nuanced than previously understood. Our findings imply that these conditions may represent more than 2 distinct entities with varying etiologies potentially coexisting. Additionally, the study reinforces the value of ultrasound imaging in diagnosing and assessing these conditions. These insights pave the way for future research to improve diagnostic techniques and enhance our understanding of these interconnected diseases.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound detects gallbladder perforation in a patient with acute abdominal pain [^112R5BTJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

We present the case of a patient with abdominal pain, in which gallbladder perforation was detected by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. A 90-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with a complaint of acute abdominal pain and vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a thickened gallbladder wall and small amounts of perihepatic fluid. Because these findings were suspicious for gallbladder perforation and contrast-enhanced computed tomography could not be performed because of a history of monoclonal gammopathy, a contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan was performed. After the administration of 2.5 mL of SonoVue (Bracco, Milan, Italy), a defect of the gallbladder wall was detected. The patient underwent laparotomy, on which the diagnosis of gallbladder perforation was confirmed.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation and treatment of patients with biliary neoplasia [^116ivYUF]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Gallbladder polyps — radiologic imaging performance: Transabdominal ultrasound (TUS) can detect GBPs with high accuracy, with a 90% sensitivity and 94% specificity for detecting GBPs. Computed tomography (CT) features such as GBP size 10 mm or larger, sessile shape, and perception on unenhanced images are more common in neoplastic than non-neoplastic GBPs, but CT is not accurate for differentiating benign from malignant GBPs, supporting cholecystectomy in patients with GBPs 10 mm or larger. Similar to CT, MRI features that favor a neoplastic etiology include sessile GBP and a diameter of 10 mm or larger.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of adenomyosis: a structured review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy in imaging [^111Nx2NC]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate imaging methods used to diagnose adenomyosis.

Data Sources

A thorough search was completed through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and PubMed or MEDLINE databases from January 2000 to June 2019.

Methods Of Study Selection

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool, studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of an imaging method and histopathology as a reference standard were selected and prospectively registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Statistical analysis was performed using the R-package Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Accuracy.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Of the 1168 records identified, 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis, and these included 827 patients undergoing 2- or 3-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and 317 patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The risk of bias was low or unclear for all Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies domains. The overall prevalence of adenomyosis was 40%. Overall MRI, 2-dimensional TVUS, 3-dimensional TVUS, and TVUS had the following aggregated diagnostic qualities (95% confidence interval): sensitivity of 78% (70%-84%), 74% (68%-79%), 84% (77%-89%), 78% (73%-82%); specificity of 88% (83%-92%), 76% (71%-79%), 84% (77%-89%), 78% (74%-81%); positive likelihood ratio of 6.8 (4.5%-10%), 3 (2.5%-3.7%), 5.2 (3.6%-7.4%), 3.5 (3%-4.2%); negative likelihood ratio of 0.25 (0.18%-0.35%), 0.34 (0.27%-0.43%), 0.19 (0.13%-0.28%), 0.28 (0.23%-0.34%); and pooled area under the operator curve of 0.77, 0.7, 0.83, 0.73, respectively. The pooled area under the operator curve for all modalities was not significantly different (all: p ≥ .4).

Conclusion

As a result of the systemic review and meta-analysis, we identified TVUS and MRI as good and comparable noninvasive imaging methods for diagnosing adenomyosis, leading us to recommend TVUS as the first-line diagnostic imaging method and MRI as a second-line method, if TVUS is inconclusive.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^116q154c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

SAGES laparoscopic biliary surgery — gallbladder polyps: Polypoid lesions can be found in about 1–5% of adults on ultrasound in Western populations and 9.6% in Asian populations; gallbladder polyps are most frequently cholesterol polyps, usually small (less than 1cm) and multiple, and tend to remain stable. In Western patients, size is the only reliable indicator for malignant potential, with all malignancies found in polyps greater than 6mm, though non-Western populations may develop malignancies in smaller polyps. There are no randomized studies to direct decisions, and management remains controversial; a reasonable approach would include laparoscopic cholecystectomy for larger, especially single, polyps or those with associated symptoms with watchful waiting for small (< 5mm) asymptomatic polyps.

### Ultrasound imaging findings in primary biliary cholangitis [^1179BnDJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

It has been reported that the liver surface, echogenicity, and liver edge of patients with chronic liver disease undergo regular changes as the disease progresses. In our study, we noted similar changes in patients with PBC. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the liver surface of patients with PBC remained smoother than that of patients with CHB as the disease progressed. Furthermore, during the cirrhosis period, the ultrasound images of patients with PBC differed from those of most patients with chronic liver disease, who typically manifest more regenerative nodules in the liver parenchyma. In our study, we observed that among the 25 patients with stage IV PBC, only 4% showed few regenerative nodules. In contrast, 30.8% of patients with stage F4 CHB presented nodular manifestations in their imaging data. In general, the progression of CHB to cirrhosis is characterized by macronodular cirrhosis, whereas regular micronodular cirrhosis dominates in PBC. Importantly, Aishima et al. proposed that the lower degree of interlobular bile duct loss in PBC could lead to macronodular cirrhosis with more acini, whereas severe interlobular bile duct loss could result in the separation of individual acini, leading to micronodular cirrhosis. In this study, the incidence of intrahepatic nodules assessed by ultrasound imaging was lower in patients with PBC than in those with CHB. Two plausible reasons could account for this finding. First, 96% of patients with PBC with cirrhosis were identified based on clinical symptoms. Thus, their condition may have been severe at the time of diagnosis, and they might have already developed a substantial number of severe interlobular bile duct defects that could manifest as small nodular cirrhosis. Second, the size of the nodules in patients with PBC was either equal to or smaller than the liver lobules, implying that the ultrasound imaging resolution may not be sufficient to detect them. Patients with advanced disease often present with typical manifestations of portal hypertension, ascites, and collateral circulation. Our study findings showed that 20.0% of patients with PBC presented with gallbladder stones or polyps, while 12.0% had enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Furthermore, approximately 60.9% of patients with advanced (stage IV) PBC developed esophagogastric varices (EGV), which is a higher percentage than what has been previously reported by Gao et al. (50.9%). This may be because our study only considered the incidence of EGV in patients with stage IV PBC.

### Value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of polypoid lesions of gallbladder ≥ 1 CM [^113k7TJe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the usefulness of Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Polypoid lesions of gallbladder (PLGs) ≥ 1 cm.

Methods

A prospective analysis was performed on 180 patients with PLGs ≥ 1 cm. 175 cases were confirmed by pathological diagnosis and the remaining were confirmed by other imaging findings. The characteristics of lesions on conventional Ultrasonography (US) and CEUS were recorded.

Results

Significant differences were observed in enhancement patterns between benign and malignant PLGs during both arterial (P < 0.001) and venous phases (P < 0.001). The malignant lesions typically yielded a "fast-in and fast-out" enhancement pattern. There was no significant difference in Arrival time (AT) between malignant and benign PLGs. If we consider wash-out time ≤ 40 s as a diagnostic standard for malignant lesions, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 88.24%, 85.62%, and 86.11%, respectively. Destruction of the Gallbladder (GB) wall was a particularly important indication of malignant PLGs, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 93.33%, 92.12%, and 92.22%, respectively. The accuracy of CEUS in the diagnosis of PLGs, as well as malignant and benign lesions, was 92.22%, 92.47%, and 91.17%, respectively.

Conclusions

The "fast-in and fast-out" enhancement pattern, hyper-enhancement in comparison to the GB wall in the arterial phase, wash-out time ≤ 40 s, GB wall destruction, and hepatic parenchymal infiltration are the characteristic findings of malignant PLGs. Besides, CEUS provides a valuable reference to classify some of the benign lesions.

### Grading sonographic severity of adenomyosis: a pilot study assessing feasibility and interobserver reliability [^112bk9d6]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

"Estimation" Compared With Real Time Severity Estimation and the Number ofFeatures

A total of 55% of the categories scores with "MPR estimation" and real‐time estimation were scored similarly, resulting in a moderate weighted reliability (κ w = 0.468, 95% CI: 0.226–0.711). The comparison with number of features shows increasing median number of features per severity category (mild: 4.0 [IQR 3.0–5.0], moderate: 5.0 [IQR 3.5–6.0], and severe: 6.0 [IQR 5.0–8.0]). A positive correlation was found between the severity categories and the number of features (r s (27) = 0.523, 95% CI: 0.169–0.757).

"‐Clip Estimation" Compared With Real‐Time Severity Estimation and the Number ofFeatures

The categories scored with "2D‐clip estimation" and with real‐time estimation were 57.9% comparable and weighted reliability was moderate (κ w = 0.443, P = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.124–0.762). The number of MUSA features per category scored with "2D clip estimation" were almost equally distributed across the different severity categories (mild: 4.0 [3.0–5.2], moderate: 4.5 [3.3–5.8], and severe: 5.0 [4.5–6.5]). The correlation of the methods was r s (27): 0.347, 95% CI: −0.141 to 7.00.

### Adenomyosis: common and uncommon manifestations on sonography and magnetic resonance imaging [^116uAsMo]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this presentation is to show the imaging findings of the common and uncommon variants of adenomyosis as seen on sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methods

A 3-year database search was performed to identify women who had pelvic sonography and pelvic MRI within a 6-month interval. Images of these cases were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Eighty women were identified. Adenomyosis was diagnosed on MRI, which was used as the reference standard, in 45 of these women. The correct diagnosis was made on sonography in 73% of the cases.

Conclusions

Awareness of the spectrum of imaging features of adenomyosis is important to use sonography effectively for diagnosing this entity and to help avoid misdiagnosis.

### Classification and reporting systems for adenomyosis [^114Nz1mZ]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To conduct a review of the available histologic and image-based classification systems to determine which of these systems, if any, provide clinical utility for prognosis or the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions.

Data Sources

PubMed in addition to the bibliographies of identified publications.

Methods Of Study Selection

One investigator searched PubMed using Medical Subject Headings terms that included "Adenomyosis", "Classification", "Ultrasound Classification", "MRI Classification", and "Diagnosis", TABULATION, INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Search results were tabulated in a Microsoft Excel workbook that facilitated the identification of duplicate entries. Publications were allocated into separate categories that included histopathologic, ultrasound, and MRI classifications. Identified systems associated with clinical outcomes were separately tabulated. Abstracts of 1669 articles were reviewed and 278 were identified for review of full text. Twenty-five were considered potentially relevant from the PubMed review and an additional 17 were found in bibliographies. In the 42 full-text articles that were reviewed in detail, 9 histologic classifications were identified, 4 of which were accompanied by an attempt at clinical correlation, 1 of which described a correlation with the outcome of medical, procedural, or surgical intervention. There were 9 image-based reporting or classification systems, 2 using transvaginal ultrasound and 7 using MRI, 3 of which included correlations with intervention outcomes, although these were surrogate (imaging) and not clinical outcomes.

Conclusion

There is inconsistency in histopathologic definitions, and there is no uniformly accepted or validated system of image-based reporting or classification that can inform clinical decision making. There exists a need for harmonized classification systems for both ultrasound and MRI that agree with the histopathologic features of the disorder.

Ultrasound of the female pelvis — uterine abnormality documentation states that abnormalities of the uterus should be documented, and the myometrium and cervix should be evaluated for contour changes, echogenicity, masses, cysts, and symmetry; the myometrial echogenicity is reported as either homogenous or heterogenous, and if the myometrium is heterogenous due to shadowing or hyperechogenic islands, that should be specified; myometrial lesions need to be assessed and described, and when an abnormality of the myometrium is noted, the objective finding leading to this conclusion must be documented; simply documenting adenomyosis as a subjective finding is insufficient and has poor reproducibility and reliability, note should be made when the uterus is not mobile or tenderness is elicited, fixed retroflexion or absence of sliding with adjacent structures should be recognized as a possible indicator of pelvic adhesion seen in deep endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac; size and location of clinically relevant lesions should be documented, and masses that may require follow-up or intervention should be measured in at least two dimensions.

### Diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging for adenomyosis: systematic review and meta-analysis and review of sonographic diagnostic criteria [^115EsRVf]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We aim to first systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, second, to evaluate the accuracy of various sonographic diagnostic criteria for adenomyosis. A search of PubMed and Embase yielded 32 eligible studies. In diagnosing adenomyosis, the diagnostic performance of TVUS was found to be high and comparable to the performance of MRI. Of the eight sonographic criteria, only five were assessable. The best individual criterion was echogenic subendometrial lines and buds. Limited data exist for the various sonographic criteria, and further studies are required to compare their performance.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation and treatment of patients with biliary neoplasia [^113Gn7C3]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder — epidemiology and imaging accuracy: Incidence is 1.2/100,000 in the United States and can be as high as 21.5/100,000 in regions such as India. On TUS, GB adenocarcinoma is more likely to show features including a mass or polyp 10 mm or larger. For T staging, the accuracy of CT has been reported to be 71% to 86%, and CT is poor for detecting nodal involvement. The sensitivity of MRI for nodal invasion is 56% to 92% and 67% to 100% for local involvement.

### MRI for adenomyosis: a pictorial review [^1158wWw1]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Adenomyosis is asymptomatic in one third of cases, in the remaining being a cause of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and uterine enlargement. Its role in infertility is still debated, with a reported frequency of association of 1–14%. There are, however, no large studies on this topic.

Clinical diagnosis of adenomyosis is usually difficult due to the nonspecific nature of symptoms and the confounding factor of coexistent pelvic diseases.

Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the main radiologic tools for the diagnosis of adenomyosis. MRI has a diagnostic accuracy of 85%, with added value in confirming the diagnosis and determining disease characteristics and extent and additional uterine lesions.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation and treatment of patients with biliary neoplasia [^116zm5Wp]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Gallbladder polyps — prevalence and management guidance: Gallbladder polyps (GBPs) are detected in 4% to 7% of healthy subjects, and most GBPs are not neoplastic. Symptomatic GBPs should be removed via cholecystectomy, but there are no standard guidelines on the management of asymptomatic GBPs. Traditionally, cholecystectomy for polyps larger than 10 mm has been recommended, and asymptomatic patients at risk of gallbladder (GB) cancer (60 years of age and older, coexistence of gallstones, sessile morphology) with GBPs 6 mm or larger may benefit from cholecystectomy, but stronger evidence is required before this can be advocated. GBPs 6 mm or larger that are not removed should be followed by serial examinations, for example, every 12 months. In patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), it has been proposed that GBPs of any size should prompt cholecystectomy.

### Differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis and concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis: a MUSA criteria analysis [^117XTnxV]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Adenomyosis is a benign gynecological disease affecting approximately 20 percent of women of reproductive age, with a key characteristic of ectopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium. This disease is frequently called "enigmatic" as the pathophysiology remains unknown, and several theories have been suggested. Among these theories, 1 revolves around an invagination of the endometrial basalis layer via a tissue injury and repair ("TIAR") process, while the other depicts a process of metaplasia of displaced embryonic pluripotent cells or differentiation of adult stem cells.

Adenomyosis is characterized by a broad clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic patients diagnosed incidentally to women suffering from severe dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, chronic pelvic pain, fertility issues, and impaired quality of life. Some studies suggest that up to 82% of symptomatic women required hysterectomy and 37% were given chronic pain medications.

While the gold standard for diagnosing adenomyosis is the histological inspection of specimens obtained following hysterectomies,2D transvaginal ultrasonography is widely accepted as the first‐line diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of superficial, deep and ovarian endometriosis holding an overall sensitivity of 65–81% and an overall specificity of 65–100%.,

In 2015, the MUSA (Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment) statement was published, encompassing the terms, definitions, and measurements for describing myometrial features and lesions with transvaginal ultrasound (TVS). This statement mentions the following features as typical for adenomyosis: asymmetrical myometrial wall thickening, myometrial cysts, myometrial hyperechoic islands, fan‐shaped shadowing, echogenic sub‐endometrial lines and buds, translesional vascularity within the myometrium, irregular junctional zone, and interrupted junctional zone.

Adenomyosis usually occurs in women in their reproductive years, predominantly in those with menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. The etiology and pathophysiology remain unclear; however, recent advancements in diagnostic methods and new investigations of treatment options have changed how clinicians manage adenomyosis. A review was performed using PubMed and cross-references of reviews, case reports, and prospective and retrospective studies published from 1958 to 2010 to provide an overview of the etiology, diagnosis, prevalence, risk factors, clinical signs and symptoms, and treatments of adenomyosis.

### Acute gallbladder torsion: an unexpected intraoperative finding [^1132mxDk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The symptoms of gallbladder torsion are largely non-specific and this makes preoperative diagnosis difficult on the basis of history and physical examinations alone. Patient typically presents with acute onset abdominal pain with or without vomiting. There may be the presence of a tender mobile mass indicating a 'floating gallbladder'. Our patient presented atypically with features of bowel obstruction and a tender mass around the umbilicus. Lau et al proposed triple triads for a clinical diagnosis of gallbladder torsion, which include specific symptoms (short history, abdominal pain and early vomiting), physical signs (abdominal mass, absence of toxaemia and pulse rate-temperature discrepancy) and patient's physical characteristics (thin, elderly and deformed spine). The clinical features may mimic that of acute cholecystitis but low frequency of fever and jaundice, absence of toxaemia and poor response to antibiotic therapy can help differentiate it from cholecystitis.

Laboratory investigations are largely unhelpful. Raised white blood cell count and C-reactive protein are frequent findings especially with the onset of gangrenous cholecystitis. Liver function tests are usually normal in patients with gallbladder torsion. Imaging investigations like ultrasound and Computerised tomography (CT) may complement the diagnosis of gallbladder torsion but are sometime non-specific. Ultrasound scan will normally identify the enlarged gallbladder inferior to its normal anatomical position with a thickened wall and surrounded by free fluid.

Kitagawa H et al provided CT criteria for identifying gallbladder torsion and this include fluid collection between gallbladder and gallbladder fossa of the liver, the presence of horizontal rather than vertical axis of the gallbladder, the presence of a well-enhanced cystic duct located on the right side of the gallbladder and signs of inflammation such as oedema and thickening of the wall. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings include a high signal intensity within the gallbladder wall on T1-weighted images suggesting haemorrhagic infarct and necrosis. The presence of a large anteriorly floating gallbladder away from normal anatomical location with gross wall thickening and without gallstones in an elderly woman with kyphosis can be suggestive of gallbladder torsion.

### A comprehensive review of imaging findings in COVID-19-status in early 2021 [^111YsGK7]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Additional organ manifestations of COVID-19

Symptomatic patients suffering of COVID-19 typically present with symptoms caused by acute lung injury such as fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, rising testing capacities and case numbers have led to the emerging understanding of COVID-19 as a systemic disease, affecting not only the pulmonary, cardiovascular, or neurological systems, as reviewed above, but also extending to other systems such as the renal, gastrointestinal (GI), or the hepatobiliary system. Against this background, there is an increasing awareness of these manifestations and their associated imaging findings.

The pathophysiological mechanism of abdominal organ damage by COVID-19 derives from the type II pneumocytes of the lung. As in the case of pulmonary and vascular infections, the virus probably gains access to visceral organs via their surface expression of ACE2. This docking site has broad expression in the human viscera, thus enabling direct or indirect tissue damage of the liver, biliary ducts, pancreas, spleen, intestine, or kidneys. A hepatocellular injury pattern is assuming an increasing clinical importance, now evident in 14–53% of critically ill COVID-19 patients. It shall be important to follow-up patients receiving investigational antiviral treatments such as remdesivir, lopinavir, or tocilizumab, due to their potential for causing drug-induced liver injuries. The ultrasound findings of hepatobiliary manifestations of COVID-19 reported in the literature include signs of biliary stasis such as gallbladder sludge and distension, as well as ascites. Occasionally, CT findings of acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis have been reported. However, it seems very likely that CT, MRI, or ultrasound examinations may prove to detect features of hepatic steatosis in COVID-19 patients.

### Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration in the evaluation of gallbladder masses [^117HZWAQ]. Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

There are very few data on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of gallbladder masses. The aim of this study was to assess the utility and safety of EUS-FNA in the evaluation of patients with gallbladder masses.

Patients and Methods

Six patients who underwent EUS-FNA of gallbladder masses over a 2-year period between 2002 and 2004 were studied retrospectively. Reports of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) procedures, EUS images, cytology results, and clinical records were reviewed. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) prior to EUS had revealed a definitive gallbladder mass in only one of the six patients and no gallbladder masses were identified in any of the patients who had undergone prior transabdominal ultrasound.

Results

At EUS, all the patients were found to have an echo-poor mass arising from the gallbladder wall or within the lumen of the gallbladder. EUS-FNA of the gallbladder masses revealed adenocarcinoma in five patients and benign disease in one patient. After a mean follow-up period of 127 days (range 90–187 days), three patients had died, two were undergoing palliative chemoradiotherapy, and one had been confirmed as having chronic cholecystitis at surgery. No complications occurred.

Conclusions

In patients with obstructive jaundice and equivocal ultrasound or CT findings, evaluation of the gallbladder for the presence of a primary malignancy by EUS is useful. In patients with gallbladder masses, EUS-FNA can be performed safely and can help to make a definitive diagnosis.

### Adenomyosis: a clinical review of a challenging gynecologic condition [^116DS4KY]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Adenomyosis is a heterogenous gynecologic condition. Patients with adenomyosis can have a range of clinical presentations. The most common presentation of adenomyosis is heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea; however, patients can also be asymptomatic. Currently, there are no standard diagnostic imaging criteria, and choosing the optimal treatment for patients is challenging. Women with adenomyosis often have other associated gynecologic conditions such as endometriosis or leiomyomas, therefore making the diagnosis and evaluating response to treatment challenging. The objective of this review was to highlight current clinical information regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, imaging findings, and treatment of adenomyosis. Several studies support the theory that adenomyosis results from invasion of the endometrium into the myometrium, causing alterations in the junctional zone. These changes are commonly seen on imaging studies such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The second most common theory is that adenomyosis results from embryologic-misplaced pluripotent mullerian remnants. Traditionally, adenomyosis was only diagnosed after hysterectomy; however, studies have shown that a diagnosis can be made with biopsies at hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. Noninvasive imaging can be used to help guide the differential diagnosis. The most common findings on 2-dimensional/3-dimensional TVUS and MRI are reviewed. Two-dimensional TVUS and MRI have a respectable sensitivity and specificity; however, recent studies indicate that 3-dimensional TVUS is superior to 2-dimensional TVUS for the diagnosis of adenomyosis and may allow for the diagnosis of early-stage disease. Management options for adenomyosis, both medical and surgical, are reviewed. Currently, the only definitive management option for patients is hysterectomy.

### Adenomyosis [^116mfJsY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Adenomyosis is characterized as ectopic endometrial tissues within the myometrium in the uterus. The etiology and pathogenetic mechanism(s) responsible for adenomyosis are poorly understood. Definite diagnosis is made on hysterectomy specimens, although attempts are made at securing preoperative diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging and myometrial biopsies. Definite treatment of symptomatic women is hysterectomy.

### Adenomyosis at a glance: an integrated review of transvaginal ultrasound and MR imaging findings [^112Mediw]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Adenomyosis is a benign uterine disorder increasingly recognized in premenopausal women. Given its significant clinical burden, an accurate noninvasive diagnosis is paramount. Both transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance (MR) provide an adequate assessment of adenomyosis, the former being recommended for first-line imaging evaluation and the latter being mainly used as a problem-solving technique. In this article, the authors review the TVUS and MR imaging findings of adenomyosis while referring to their histopathological background. Whereas direct signs correlate directly to ectopic endometrial tissue and are highly specific to adenomyosis, indirect signs result from myometrial hypertrophy and increase diagnostic sensitivity. Potential pitfalls, differential diagnoses, and frequently associated estrogen-dependent conditions are also discussed.
