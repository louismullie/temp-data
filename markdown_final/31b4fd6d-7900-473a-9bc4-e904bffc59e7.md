## Question

what is the next step in a patient who tested positive on quantiferon gold?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold result and rule out active tuberculosis before initiating latent TB therapy or immunosuppression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the test result and excluding active TB disease. Then, I should verify the immediate next steps in evaluation, including symptom screening, chest radiography, and targeted labs. Next, I will consider when to repeat or confirm the IGRA, especially in low-risk or borderline results. After that, I should review risk stratification and indications for LTBI treatment. Finally, I will outline treatment options, follow-up, and special scenarios such as immunosuppression and pediatrics, making sure each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and practical clinical workflows.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the test itself, because I need to ensure we are not jumping to conclusions from a single positive IGRA without anchoring to pretest probability and the reason for testing. IGRAs detect infection but cannot distinguish latent from active TB, so a positive result mandates evaluation for active disease before any LTBI treatment or immunosuppression is contemplated [^11183sTw] [^115WVym7].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate next step: a structured symptom review and physical examination focused on TB manifestations is essential now, because absence of cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis substantially lowers the likelihood of active TB and guides the need for further diagnostics. In people with HIV, a negative symptom screen has about a 97% negative predictive value for culture-positive TB, which reinforces the primacy of clinical assessment at this stage [^112R1Me9] [^11183sTw].

> Next, I should review the chest radiograph as the pivotal next test. A normal chest radiograph in an asymptomatic patient makes active TB unlikely and supports proceeding toward LTBI management, whereas any abnormality consistent with active TB warrants sputum studies and infectious diseases consultation before LTBI therapy is considered. Guidelines explicitly recommend chest radiography for all with a positive IGRA to exclude active disease prior to LTBI treatment [^11183sTw] [^115WVym7].

> Hold on, I should verify when to repeat or confirm the IGRA rather than immediately labeling this as LTBI. In low-risk individuals who test positive, a second diagnostic test (TST or IGRA) is suggested, and infection is considered confirmed only if both are positive, given the higher false-positive rate in low-risk populations and the known variability around assay cutoffs. Borderline QFT-Plus results (about 0.35–0.99 IU/mL) frequently revert on repeat testing and carry low short-term progression risk, so repeating a borderline or unexpected positive in a low-risk patient is reasonable before committing to therapy [^117PdKeH] [^116upsr4].

> I need to ensure I am interpreting the IGRA correctly. A positive QFT reflects sensitization to M. tuberculosis antigens but does not prove disease activity, and results near the cutoff are less reliable due to biological and analytical variability. Quantitative reporting is helpful, and values in the uncertainty zone should prompt caution and, in some cases, retesting or adjunct clinical correlation rather than automatic treatment [^112eoZqu] [^117SPT35].

> Let me consider risk stratification next, because treatment decisions hinge on progression risk. High-risk groups include people with HIV, recent close contacts, those with fibrotic lesions on chest radiograph, immunosuppressed patients including TNF-alpha inhibitor users, transplant candidates, and young children, whereas low-risk individuals without epidemiologic exposure have a lower pretest probability and a higher chance of false positives, which should temper overtreatment [^113DeKt4] [^112s8KMD].

> Now, I should confirm the indications for LTBI therapy. If active TB is excluded and the patient is at increased risk of progression, treatment for LTBI is indicated, with regimens including 6–9 months of isoniazid, 3 months of isoniazid plus rifapentine, 3 months of isoniazid plus rifampin, or 4 months of rifampin, chosen based on comorbidities, drug–drug interactions, and shared decision-making. Importantly, IGRAs should not be used to monitor treatment response because they often remain positive after successful therapy and lack validated correlates of cure [^11183sTw] [^111fCgy9].

> But wait, what if the patient is about to start immunosuppression? I should double-check that in patients initiating biologics, especially TNF-alpha inhibitors, guidelines require baseline TB screening with IGRA or TST, chest radiograph for positives, and consideration of infectious disease referral, and that some clinicians use dual testing (TST plus IGRA) to maximize sensitivity in immunomodulated hosts. During therapy, periodic TB surveillance is advised in high-risk patients given documented seroconversions and rare reactivations despite initial negative screens [^116CH8Vk] [^112h7VhA] [^1148A8W5].

> I will now examine special populations. In children under 5 years, TST is generally preferred for LTBI testing due to higher indeterminate IGRA rates and lower sensitivity, though IGRAs can be considered in specific contexts or when BCG cross-reactivity is a concern. In people with HIV, IGRA or TST positivity warrants LTBI treatment after excluding active disease, and in those with advanced immunosuppression, test sensitivity may be reduced, so a negative test does not exclude infection and clinical vigilance remains essential [^11183sTw] [^114tm2jV] [^113HteXV].

> Hold on, I should verify the follow-up cadence. For patients on immunosuppressive therapy, annual TB screening is reasonable in high-risk groups, and any new positive IGRA during therapy should trigger the same active disease exclusion pathway. Documented seroconversions on biologics are uncommon but do occur, reinforcing the need for ongoing surveillance rather than a one-time clearance [^1119kax7] [^1148A8W5].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing. Confirm the positive IGRA in clinical context, screen meticulously for TB symptoms, obtain a chest radiograph to exclude active disease, repeat or confirm the test if the patient is low risk or the result is borderline, stratify progression risk, and if active TB is excluded and risk is nontrivial, initiate evidence-based LTBI therapy without relying on IGRA to monitor response. This sequence aligns with ATS/IDSA/CDC and USPSTF guidance and minimizes both missed active disease and unnecessary treatment [^11183sTw] [^115WVym7].

---

The next step after a positive QuantiFERON Gold test is to **exclude active TB** with a focused history, exam, and chest radiograph [^11183sTw] [^115WVym7]. If active TB is excluded, **treat latent TB** with one of the recommended regimens (e.g. isoniazid for 6–9 months, rifampin for 4 months, or isoniazid plus rifapentine for 3 months) [^11183sTw]. If active TB is suspected or the chest radiograph is abnormal, obtain sputum smear/culture and refer to infectious diseases or pulmonary specialists [^112R1Me9]. Do not start LTBI therapy until active TB is ruled out [^11183sTw].

---

## Clinical evaluation to exclude active tuberculosis

Before initiating LTBI therapy, it is essential to **exclude active TB disease** [^11183sTw]. The following steps are recommended:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess for TB symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue [^11183sTw].

- **Chest radiograph**: Obtain a chest radiograph to identify any abnormalities suggestive of active TB disease [^11183sTw] [^115WVym7].

- **Sputum studies**: If the chest radiograph is abnormal or active TB is suspected, obtain sputum smear and culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) [^115cL6bq].

- **Referral**: Refer to infectious disease or pulmonary specialists for further evaluation and management if active TB is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management of latent tuberculosis infection

If active TB is excluded, **LTBI should be treated** to prevent progression to active disease. Recommended regimens include:

| **Regimen** | **Duration** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Isoniazid (INH) | 6–9 months | Daily |
| Rifampin (RIF) | 4 months | Daily |
| Isoniazid plus rifapentine (INH + RPT) | 3 months | Weekly (directly observed therapy) |

---

Treatment selection should be individualized based on patient factors, potential drug interactions, and **hepatotoxicity risk** [^1154F81C].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Patients with HIV, those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, or organ transplant recipients require careful evaluation and management due to increased risk of progression to active TB [^113DeKt4].

- **Pregnancy**: INH is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but treatment should be individualized and discussed with the patient [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for adverse effects, adherence, and conversion to active TB [^notfound].

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Document the **positive QFT result**, clinical evaluation, chest radiograph findings, and treatment plan. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor adherence, adverse effects, and any development of active TB symptoms [^notfound].

---

The next step after a positive QuantiFERON Gold test is to **exclude active TB** through clinical evaluation and chest radiography [^11183sTw]. If active TB is excluded, initiate LTBI treatment with an appropriate regimen; if active TB is suspected, perform sputum studies and refer to specialists [^11183sTw].

Latent TB infection — combined testing and specimen sequencing explain that when increased sensitivity for diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection is sought, both a TST and an IGRA can be done, with a positive result from either test being diagnostic (expert opinion), and if the tests are performed simultaneously, blood for IGRA testing should be drawn before the TST is administered (expert opinion); younger age, HIV infection, and reduced numbers of CD4 cells increase the rate of indeterminate IGRA results, and a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found reduced QuantiFERON-TB Gold sensitivity in young children, which greatly reduced the diagnostic utility of the assay in TB-endemic areas.

### Prognostic value of interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin test in predicting the development of active tuberculosis (UK PREDICT TB): a prospective cohort study [^113BnaGM]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Our results have implications for guidelines and future cost-effectiveness analyses, particularly in the screening of tuberculosis contacts for latent tuberculosis infection and also recent migrants (ie, in the past 5 years) from high-burden countries. Although negative predictive values were similar for all tests, we have found statistically significant differences for the positive prediction of progression to active tuberculosis between tests, with a positive TST-5 result being a significantly worse predictor than all other tests, and a positive T-SPOT. TB result being a significantly better predictor than all other tests, except for TST-15, and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube was significantly better than TST-10. Although the review of the WHO guidelines, did not examine TST stratified by BCG-vaccination status compared with IGRAs, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that by use of this stratification method, TST is equivalent to IGRAs. The most recent WHO guidelinesrecommend either a TST or IGRA as equivalent alternatives without taking into account previous BCG vaccination. Our results contradict this recommendation. The screening strategy by which participants are identified for treatment influences the cost-effectiveness of any test-and-treat programme; the more people who are identified as positive and eligible for treatment, the greater the cost. The trade-offs of testing with TST-5 (which identified the most progressors but with potentially the highest number needed to treat) versus IGRAs and TST-15 (which are likely to have the lowest numbers needed to treat) has implications for WHO guidelines depending on the uptake of testing and adherence to management in different settings. In the absence of a highly specific diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis infection at risk of progression, a cheap and non-toxic treatment is needed that can be given to a larger proportion of screened people than is the case with current treatment options.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — IGRA vs TST recommendations for individuals ≥ 5 years: We recommend performing an IGRA rather than a TST in individuals 5 years or older who are likely to be infected with Mtb, have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, it has been decided that testing for LTBI is warranted, and either have a history of BCG vaccination or are unlikely to return to have their TST read (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence); remarks note that a TST is an acceptable alternative, especially where an IGRA is not available, too costly, or too burdensome.

4 Clinical performance of IGRAs in patients with IMID before anti-TNF therapy

Published data on IGRA performance in the diagnosis of LTBI in IMID is scarce but expanding rapidly (Table 1). IGRAs performance in patients with IMID has been based on agreement of results with the TST and on the relative strength of the association of TST and IGRA results with risk factors for LTBI. The former type of study design is less useful than the latter. Data from studies that is not correlated with surrogate markers of LTBI collectively concludes that (a) agreement between TST and IGRA is poor and weaker in patients with IMID than in healthy controls due to lower proportions of TST-positive results in patients with IMID, (b) the magnitude of the TST response is significantly lower in patients with IMID than in healthy controls, (c) that discordant TST-positive, IGRA-negative results are associated with prior BCG vaccinationand that (d) discordant TST-negative, IGRA-positive results are associated with steroid therapy.

Only two studies to date have correlated IGRA and TST results with risk factors for LTBI. In 142 patients with IMID, QuantiFERON ® -TB Gold in-tube was significantly more closely associated with the presence of risk factors for LTBI than TST whereas TST was significantly more closely associated with BCG vaccination than QuantiFERON ® -TB Gold in-tube. Moreover, the odds of a positive QuantiFERON ® -TB Gold in-tube result, but not TST result, increased with increasingly relevant prognostic risk factors for LTBI from born or resident in a high prevalence country to a history of active tuberculosis. In the second study, IGRAs were positive in 7 TST-negative patients with IMID and risk factors for TB infection.

The only gold standard for LTBI is the subsequent development of TB but the generation of such data requires large longitudinal clinical outcome studies to establish the prognostic value of positive test results. The only published prospective data to date is too small to be able to draw any conclusions, comprising follow-up of 7 RA patients with positive QuantiFERON ® -TB Gold results, 4 of whom subsequently started anti-TNF agents, for between 6 and 30 months, but none developed active TB.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — cautions and limitations: While both IGRA and TST provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent tuberculosis and the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to treatment for LTBI; a large (> 15 mm) TST reaction is more likely to reflect infection, measurement variability exists for IFN-γ tests (the FDA accepts a variance of 11%), there are insufficient data for quantitative interpretation of IGRAs beyond FDA cut-points, results near the cut-point are less reliable, and the results of IFN-γ testing should be reported quantitatively; discordance between TST and IGRA is common and in low-risk populations discordant tests are likely to be false positives.

### Low concordance between QIAreach quantiFERON-TB, a novel interferon-gamma release assay, and quantiFERON-TB gold plus, in a population-based survey in blantyre, Malawi [^115ZivQX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Urgent improvements in the diagnosis and management of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection are required to reach End TB goals. Conventional interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), require substantial laboratory infrastructure and large blood volumes, limiting use in high-burden settings. The QIAreach QuantiFERON-TB (QIAreach QFT) was developed to overcome these challenges but has not previously been evaluated in field conditions in a low-income, high-burden country, or at scale in children. We performed a diagnostic evaluation of QIAreach QFT against QFT-Plus, in a cross-sectional IGRA survey in Blantyre, Malawi. We recruited a population-representative sample of children aged 1–4 years and adolescents and adults aged 10–40 years, from households and primary care. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's kappa for QIAreach QFT against QFT-Plus, and constructed Bayesian hurdle-categorical models to compare quantitative test results. A total of 1,049 participants were recruited (64%: 1–4 years; 13%: 10–19 years; and 23%: 20–40 years). More participants had a positive QIAreach QFT result (32%) compared to QFT-Plus (15%). Over half of positive QIAreach QFT results had time-to-positivity of exactly 20 min, the assay cutoff. There was minimal agreement between QFT-Plus and QIAreach QFT results (κ = 0.26), which was lowest in children aged 1–4 years (κ = 0.13). Sensitivity and specificity of QIAreach QFT relative to QFT-Plus were 62% and 74%, respectively, with poor correlation between quantitative results. The suboptimal performance of QIAreach QFT, particularly in young children, suggests that it cannot currently be recommended for wider use and that the urgent need for an accessible test of Mtb infection remains unmet.

IMPORTANCE

Almost a quarter of the world's population has evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Monitoring and addressing this substantial burden of so-called "latent" tuberculosis (TB) infection will be critical to reach End TB targets. However, current interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for Mtb infection are costly, and require a large volume of venous blood and significant laboratory processing, which are major barriers to their wider use in low-income countries. The novel QIAreach QuantiFERON-TB (QIAreach) assay has been designed as a more accessible alternative. We sought to evaluate it against a reference standard of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, in a large cross-sectional survey in Blantyre, Malawi. To our knowledge, this is the first diagnostic evaluation of QIAreach QFT to be performed in a population-based survey in a low-income high-incidence setting, and to specifically focus on young children (a priority group for interventions targeting Mtb infection). In contrast to previous studies in other settings, we observed poor performance of QIAreach QFT, particularly in young children where there was little correlation between the novel test and the reference standard. This leads us to conclude that this test cannot be widely recommended for use in its current form; indeed manufacture is currently suspended. We believe our findings are of urgent importance to policymakers, clinicians, and researchers and underscore the importance of careful evaluation of new diagnostics in the contexts where they are intended to be used.

### What does IGRA testing add to the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis? A Bayesian latent class analysis [^114AtUvj]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the contribution made to the diagnostic work-up for patients with suspected ocular tuberculosis (TB) by QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) tests using latent class analysis model.

Methods

A single centre retrospective cohort study. A Bayesian latent class model was constructed on the basis of demographics, phenotypes and test results from patients attending a tertiary referral center in the UK. This estimated the probability of ocular TB for each patient in two versions, first with and then without QFT. The estimated probability of ocular TB was compared with treatment failure.

Results

From a database of 365 patients with clinical signs suggestive of ocular TB, 267 patients who had QFT and complete data were evaluated. Mean age was 45.0 ± 15.4 years with 141 (52.9%) male and 148 (50.5%) of Asian ethnicity. QFT was positive in 208 (70.1%) patients and ATT was instituted in 145 (49.5%) patients with 100 (34.1%) patients also having concurrent systemic corticosteroid therapy. The best estimate of a QFT level separating TB-positive and TB-negative patients was extremely low. This weak discrimination between TB and non-TB groups was reflected in poor positive and negative predictive values for treatment failure.

Conclusions

The latent class model did not successfully predict treatment failure, despite taking all variables into account. The threshold between TB and non-TB in QFT values was implausibly low and removing QFT from the model made prediction slightly worse. A larger prospective study is required to establish the role of all tests, demographics and phenotypes in diagnosis.

### The impact of borderline quantiferon-TB gold plus results for latent tuberculosis screening under routine conditions in a low-endemicity setting [^116upsr4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Quantiferon-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) is an interferon gamma release assay used to diagnose latent tuberculosis (LTB). A borderline range (0.20 to 0.99IU/ml) around the cutoff (0.35IU/ml) has been suggested for the earlier QFT version. Our aims were to evaluate the borderline range for QFT-Plus and the contribution of the new TB2 antigen tube. QFT-Plus results were collected from clinical laboratories in Sweden and linked to incident active TB within 3 to 24months using the national TB registry. Among QFT-Plus results from 58,539 patients, 83% were negative (< 0.20IU/ml), 2.4% were borderline negative (0.20 to 0.34IU/ml), 3.4% were borderline positive (0.35 to 0.99IU/ml), 9.6% were positive (≥ 1.0IU/ml), and 1.6% were indeterminate. Follow-up tests after initial borderline results were negative (< 0.20IU/ml) in 38.3%, without any cases of incident active TB within 2years. Applying the 0.35-IU/ml cutoff, 1.5% of TB1 and TB2 results were discrepant, of which 52% were within the borderline range. A TB2 result of ≥ 0.35IU/ml with a TB1 result of < 0.20IU/ml was found in 0.4% (231/58,539) of all included baseline QFT-Plus test results, including 1.8% (1/55) of incident TB cases. A borderline range for QFT-Plus is clinically useful as more than one-third of those with borderline results are convincingly negative upon retesting, without developing incident active TB. The TB2 tube contribution to LTB diagnosis appears limited.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^117XXFnS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

AAD–NPF psoriasis care — IL-17 inhibitors ongoing monitoring recommends periodic history and physical examination including screening for nonmelanoma skin cancer, specific assessment for infections, and monitoring for exacerbation or development of inflammatory bowel disease; yearly testing for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or Quantiferon Gold) should be done in patients at high risk, while for patients not at high risk screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist; the Quantiferon Gold test can remain positive after treatment of latent TB so caution should be exercised; an annual chest radiograph may be considered at the discretion of the treating dermatologist; periodic assessment of suicidal ideation is recommended for patients treated with brodalumab and might necessitate more frequent follow-up visits; follow-up visits can be scheduled from quarterly to twice yearly on the basis of time of treatment, response, and tolerability of medication.

### QuantiFERON-TB gold in-tube as a confirmatory test for tuberculin skin test in tuberculosis contact tracing: a noninferiority clinical trial [^113yHZ7J]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Screening strategies based on interferon-γ release assays in tuberculosis contact tracing may reduce the need for preventive therapy without increasing subsequent active disease.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, randomized trial to test the noninferiority of a 2-step strategy with the tuberculin skin test (TST) followed by QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) as a confirmatory test (the TST/QFT arm) to the standard TST-alone strategy (TST arm) for targeting preventive therapy in household contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Participants were followed for 24 months after randomization. The primary endpoint was the development of tuberculosis, with a noninferiority margin of 1.5 percentage points.

Results

A total of 871 contacts were randomized. Four contacts in the TST arm and 2 in the TST/QFT arm developed tuberculosis. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, this accounted for 0.99% in the TST arm and 0.51% in the TST/QFT arm (-0.48% difference; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] -1.86% to 0.90%); in the per-protocol analysis, the corresponding rates were 1.67% and 0.82% in the TST and TST/QFT arms, respectively (-0.85% difference; 97.5% CI, -3.14% to 1.43%). Of the 792 contacts analyzed, 65.3% in the TST arm and 42.2% in the TST/QFT arm were diagnosed with tuberculosis infection (23.1% difference; 95% CI, 16.4% to 30.0%).

Conclusions

In low-incidence settings, screening household contacts with the TST and using QFT-GIT as a confirmatory test is not inferior to TST-alone for preventing active tuberculosis, allowing a safe reduction of preventive treatments.

### Updated guidelines for using interferon gamma release assays to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection-United States, 2010 [^115C1Lyq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

n 2005, CDC published guidelines for using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-G) (Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) (CDC. Guidelines for using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, United States. MMWR;54[No. RR-15]:49–55). Subsequently, two new interferon gamma (IFN- gamma) release assays (IGRAs) were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as aids in diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection, both latent infection and infection manifesting as active tuberculosis. These tests are the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) (Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) and the T-SPOT.TB test (T-Spot) (Oxford Immunotec Limited, Abingdon, United Kingdom). The antigens, methods, and interpretation criteria for these assays differ from those for IGRAs approved previously by FDA. For assistance in developing recommendations related to IGRA use, CDC convened a group of experts to review the scientific evidence and provide opinions regarding use of IGRAs. Data submitted to FDA, published reports, and expert opinion related to IGRAs were used in preparing these guidelines. Results of studies examining sensitivity, specificity, and agreement for IGRAs and TST vary with respect to which test is better. Although data on the accuracy of IGRAs and their ability to predict subsequent active tuberculosis are limited, to date, no major deficiencies have been reported in studies involving various populations. This report provides guidance to U.S. public health officials, health-care providers, and laboratory workers for use of FDA-approved IGRAs in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection in adults and children. In brief, TSTs and IGRAs (QFT-G, QFT-GIT, and T-Spot) may be used as aids in diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection. They may be used for surveillance purposes and to identify persons likely to benefit from treatment. Multiple additional recommendations are provided that address quality control, test selection, and medical management after testing. Although substantial progress has been made in documenting the utility of IGRAs, additional research is needed that focuses on the value and limitations of IGRAs in situations of importance to medical care or tuberculosis control. Specific areas needing additional research are listed.

### Impact of an analytical intervention to assure the accuracy of LIAISON quantiFERON-TB gold plus results [^113J3Eh9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings from this study are consistent with prior studies on the inflated QFT-Plus responses with CLIA and show that the problem we encountered during our validation phase persisted during clinical implementation. Importantly, 63.1% of borderline positives retested with ELISA were reported as negative. In addition, 91.3% of high-positive discordant results repeated with CLIA were reported negative. During the first 13 months of clinical testing using CLIA, we avoided reporting 999 false-positive QFT-Plus results. Our findings underscore the need for clinical laboratories to adopt an analytical algorithm to mitigate reporting false-positive results with CLIA at the cost of repeating about 4.0% of all QFT-Plus tests. Such a diagnostic stewardship measure is essential to prevent unnecessary clinical workups performed to rule out active tuberculosis and to avoid prophylaxis therapy.

### Screening of immigrants in the UK for imported latent tuberculosis: a multicentre cohort study and cost-effectiveness analysis [^112BZdY1]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

We did this prospective multicentre study and cost-effectiveness analysis of immigrant screening in three centres in the UK: Westminster, London; Leeds, Yorkshire; and Blackburn, Lancashire. Together these centres serve 1·6 million peopleof whom 6·5% (IQR 4·3%–9·9%) are foreign born. Between 2007 and 2009, the average 3-year notifications in these centres ranged from 54 to 126, and incidence varied from 16 to 33 cases per 100 000 population per year.

Participants were foreign-born new entrants (arrival within the past 5 years) who were aged 35 years or younger and who were referred for and underwent tuberculosis screening between Jan 1, 2008, and July 31, 2010. Referrals to these centres were made either through port-of-entry screening systems, health-protection units, or after registration with primary-care services. Ethical approval was not needed because the study used fully anonymised observational data that were obtained as part of an assessment of routine clinical service.

Screening and management

We first screened immigrants who attended the centres with a symptom questionnaire followed by one-step IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube. Carnegie, Cellestis, Australia), a whole blood ELISA, containing ESAT-6 (early secretory antigenic target-6), CFP-10 (culture filtrate protein-10), and TB7.7 (Rv2654), which was done in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Results were positive, negative, or indeterminate, dependent on the manufacturer's criteria. A meta-analysisof the effectiveness of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube suggests that sensitivity is 84% and specificity is 99%. Immigrants who were symptomatic or who had a positive IGRA result were referred for chest radiography and further clinical assessment to discount active tuberculosis.

We defined latent tuberculosis infection as immigrants with a positive IGRA and normal chest radiography in the absence of any clinical features that would suggest active disease. Immigrants who were diagnosed with latent infection were offered chemoprophylaxis with either 3 months of rifampicin and isoniazid, or 6 months of isoniazid, in accordance with UK guidelines, dependent on clinician and patient preference.

5.2.1.2.1 Tuberculosis

Statement 80. We recommend that prior to commencing anti-TNF therapy, IBD patients should be screened for tuberculosis (TB) using a combination of clinical risk stratification, chest x-ray and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Screening for active or latent TB is essential prior to starting anti-TNF or other biologic therapy. A Dutch study suggested that screening rates for TB in IBD patients are high at 90–97%, with 3% latent prevalence. Tuberculin skin test is likely to have false-negative results due to immunosuppressive therapy, so interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) should be used. A high rate of anergy to skin-based antigen tests was shown by immunising 82 consecutive IBD patients against tuberculin (TST) or control antigens. In this study no TST result was positive, but 71% of patients failed to respond to any antigen. Importantly, 83% of patients on steroid or immunomodulator therapy were anergic versus 43% not on these therapies (p < 0.002). A retrospective study of TB screening in 340 patients in the USA with 512 Quantiferon TB Gold (QFT-G) IGRA tests reported 1.5% positivity, 2.7% indeterminate and 95.8% negativity. Only one case of tuberculosis reactivation occurred in 17 months of follow-up (0.3%). This patient had an indeterminate test and was on immunosuppressive therapy prior to testing. No significant difference was seen in positivity rates between those on immunosuppressive therapy and those not. Only moderate concordance was seen between TST and QFT-G in this study (kappa = 0.4152, p = 0.0041). IGRA tests were evaluated in 125 adult patients with IBD in London, 90 of whom were anti-TNF naïve, with 35 on established anti-TNF therapy.109 (87%) were BCG vaccinated. 98% IGRA tests were negative, 1% indeterminate and 2% positive. This method of screening was deemed cost-effective in comparison to the 2005 British Thoracic Society guideline. No subsequent cases of TB were reported with a median follow-up of 24 months. A Korean study examined newly developed TB cases in IBD patients on established anti-TNF therapy. They described 25 cases in total (84% pulmonary, 16% extrapulmonary), of whom 76% developed TB within 5 years of commencing anti-TNF despite previous negative screening for latent infection, and 12% developed reactivation of latent infection after 3 months of chemoprophylaxis. Primary infection with TB on anti-TNF agents is therefore a significant risk, particularly in higher incidence areas, irrespective of baseline screening.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — two-step strategy considerations are described: Performing a second diagnostic test when the initial test is negative is a strategy to increase sensitivity. This may reduce specificity, but the panel decided that this is an acceptable trade-off in situations in which the consequences of missing LTBI (ie, not treating individuals who may benefit from therapy) exceed the consequences of inappropriate therapy (ie, hepatotoxicity). Performing a confirmatory test following an initial positive result is based upon both the evidence that false-positive results are common among individuals who are unlikely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the committee's presumption that performing a second test on those patients whose initial test was positive will help identify initial false-positive results.

Table I
Review of the literature on TB cases in patients on biologics

Even with high specificity and sensitivity (> 99% and 92%) and a positive predictive value 4 times greater than PPDs, QFT-G results must serve as an adjunct to meticulous clinical investigations — not the denouement of screening in high-risk patients. Careful clinical evaluation and questioning regarding the common signs, symptoms, and high-risk exposures of TB may be valuable in stratifying patients at risk of TB infection and identifying patients on TNFI therapy who need more frequent TB screening or chest x-rays. There are limited data regarding the optimal time to recommence TNFIs following an active TB infection. Studies suggest that TNFIs are safe to restart in most patients who have been treated for latent TB with no relapses. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal timing for restarting TNFIs. Screening results, albeit negative, are not the end but a means to an end. It is paramount for physicians to remain vigilant throughout the entirety of a treatment course regardless of negative screening tests and questionnaires. Physicians should be aware of the risk factors of active TB in patients on TNFIs and maintain a high index of suspicion, notwithstanding patient health literacy, to mitigate adverse sequelae in patients on TNFI therapy.

### Clinical testing and diagnosis… [^113DeKt4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- CDC recommends testing people who are at increased risk for TB infection.
- People with symptoms of TB disease or positive TB blood test or TB skin results should be evaluated for TB disease.
- TB testing activities should be accompanied by a plan for medical evaluation and treatment. Considerations Targeted testing Targeted testing for tuberculosis is a strategy to diagnose and treat latent TB infection among persons who are at risk for developing TB disease. Treating latent TB infection supports U. S. TB elimination goals through preventing TB disease, stopping the spread of TB to others. Determining an approach Targeted testing CDC and the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend testing people who are at increased risk for TB infection. Testing for TB infection is a routine and integral part of health care for patients with increased risk for TB.

People who are at low risk generally should not be tested because the predictive value of a positive result is lower. Testing people at low risk increases the number of false positive test results and can divert resources away from preventing TB among those most likely to develop it. False positive results cause people to undergo unnecessary evaluation and treatment. People who are at higher risk of developing TB disease once infected with TB bacteria
- People with HIV
- Children younger than 5 years of age
- People recently infected with TB bacteria
- People with a history of untreated or inadequately treated TB disease
- People who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists, systemic corticosteroids equivalent to/greater than 15 mg of prednisone per day, or immunosuppressive drug therapy following organ transplantation.

Recommended tests There are two tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria: TB blood tests and the TB skin test. TB blood tests or skin tests should not be performed on people who have written documentation of a previous positive TB test results or treatment for TB disease. Most people who have a positive TB test result will continue to have a positive test result. Additional TB blood tests or skin tests will probably not contribute to medical care, regardless of the result. TB blood tests measure the immune response in whole blood after it has been mixed with controls and with synthetic peptides that are designed to simulate TB antigens. The white blood cells in most people who have TB infection are sensitive to the test antigens and release interferon-gamma. The tests measure the amount of the IFN-γ response.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has approved these two TB blood tests that are commercially available in the United States:

- QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus
- T-SPOT®. TB test Only one visit is required to draw blood for the test. TB blood tests are the preferred method of TB testing for people 5 years of age and older who have received the bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine. After 48–72 hours, the skin test reaction must be examined by a trained health care worker. The health care worker measures any swelling where the tuberculin was injected to determine if the reaction to the test is positive or negative. TB skin tests are an acceptable alternative in situations where a TB blood test is not available, is too costly, or is too burdensome. Interpreting test results Interpreting TB blood test results Interpretation of TB blood test results depends on the test being used.

Targeted testing program factors — IGRA vs TST: The benefit of targeted testing for LTBI resides not in the test employed, but in its programmatic use, and programmatic considerations such as cost, test availability, prevalence of BCG exposure in the target population, ability to reevaluate the patient 2–3 days after testing, and staff training/experience might affect the decision to use IGRA- or TST-based evaluations.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115WVym7]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests for LTBI — two types are used in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires intradermal purified protein derivative with interpretation 48 to 72 hours later, whereas the IGRA uses a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response with laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. FDA-approved IGRAs include T-SPOT.TB, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, and QuantiFERON-Gold Plus; patients tested with an IGRA do not need to return for interpretation, and testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination because IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine and for persons who may be unlikely to return. Diagnosis of LTBI is based on further clinical assessment and ruling out active tuberculosis by medical history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and other laboratory tests.

### QuantiFERON-TB gold plus performance in children: a narrative review [^116QpASL]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major cause of ill health and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to 2020 statistics, children account for 11% of all TB cases. In 2014, approximately 1.7 billion individuals (almost one quarter of the global population) were estimated to have evidence of immunological sensitization to Mtb [termed Mtb infection or latent TB infection (LTBI)],56 million of whom are at high risk of developing TB disease. The risk of progression to TB disease (also known as "active TB") from Mtb infection is highest in infants and young children (< 2 years old), falls to a nadir in primary school-age children and then rises into adolescence. Compared with adults, children (particularly young children) also have a greater risk of severe TB disease, extrapulmonary dissemination (including TB meningitis) and death. Therefore, early detection of Mtb infection and initiation of TB preventive therapy (TPT) are critical to avert the development of TB disease in pediatric populations.

For the detection of Mtb infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the tuberculin skin test (TST) and 3 interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs): QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus; Qiagen Diagnostics, Hilden, Germany), T-SPOT. TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK) and TB-IGRA (Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, Ltd. Beijing, China). However, there is no gold-standard or reference test, and questions remain about the best method for screening children of different age groups. There is substantial variation in region-specific guidelines for the diagnosis of Mtb infection in children: some recommend either the TST or IGRAs, others recommend IGRAs following either a positive or negative TST and there are also recommendations based on cost and availability. – The TST is inexpensive and well characterized but requires 2 separate clinic visits, and response measurement (the size of skin induration) is subject to misclassification. Furthermore, the TST can cross-react with nontuberculous mycobacteria and with the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. IGRAs require a single visit for phlebotomy and results, and have greater specificity than the TST in BCG-vaccinated populations, as they do not cross-react with BCG antigens. However, their availability is limited in many high TB-burden contexts, and they are substantially more expensive than TST.

### Validity and reliability of a new incremental step test for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116buhWE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding reliability, the target sample size was reached. Our study found a 'positive' rating for reliability based on the high ICC (0.96; 95% CI 0.92 to 0.98) for the IST, which indicates that this test provides consistent results when the test is applied on different occasions. Other studies that determined the reliability of other IST in people with COPD have presented results similar to ours, such as the CST (ICC = 0.99)and the MIST (ICC = 0.99). Nevertheless, different types of reliability were conducted between studies (ie, within-day vs between-day reliability), especially for the CST, thus, caution should be taken when establishing comparisons. Another finding in our results was the significant difference in the number of steps between IST-1 and IST-2, which indicates a learning effect, suggesting that two tests are required in clinical practice and the result of the second test should be recorded. According to the results for measurement error of the IST, the MDC95 value determined suggests that it is necessary to improve above 27.9 steps to assume that a statistical change in participants' performance was achieved. Although this cut-off is informative, the calculation and the interpretation of the MDC95 value alone cannot rate the quality of the measurement error as a measurement property. To rate it and to consider it 'positive', the MDC95 value must be lower than the minimal important change (MIC), which is defined as the smallest change in the outcome of interest that patients perceive as important, either beneficial or harmful, and that would lead the patient to consider a change in management. However, the MIC was not determined in this study, which rates the IST, for now, as 'indeterminate' for measurement error. Therefore, future studies should aim to determine the MIC of the IST (eg, based on PR interventions) in patients with COPD, to determine the quality of this measurement property. The MIC will also provide important information for the interpretability of the IST. Even so, the MDC95% of our study was above the 30% acceptable limit, which can induce a 'negative' rating. One explanation for this high MDC95% could be the heterogeneity of groups participants included in our sample, according to the ABCD assessment tool (GOLD A, B, C and D). The ABCD classification appears to be important to discriminate patients with worst outcomes, and therefore, participants from ABCD groups present a heterogeneity of symptoms and exercise capacity levels, despite their stable COPD condition during the study.

Indeterminate Results

The rate of indeterminate results (defined per the manufacturer's instructions as nil tube values > 8.0 IU/mL or mitogen tube minus nil tube values < 0.50 IU/mL)ranged from 0.0% to 33.3% (Table 2); however, the 33.3% rate was from a cohort of 12 subjects, where 3 of 4 indeterminate results were in children with HIV. Excluding this cohort, the rate of indeterminate results was 0.0%–9.3%, with the highest rate for "non-TB" (ie, an alternative diagnosis). The lowest rates were reported in children/adolescents with a microbiologically confirmed TB diagnosis, and subjects screened for Mtb infection due to household contacts with TB or radiologic or clinical signs or symptoms of TB disease, including children 1–4 years old. An insufficient mitogen response was cited as the cause of an indeterminate result in 3 studies –; 1 study reported an indeterminate result arising from an elevated nil tube IFN-γ concentration in a single patient.

In a study comparing indeterminate rates between the QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT, there were no marked differences either in children with household TB exposure (2.2% vs. 4.3%, respectively) or children diagnosed with TB disease (33.3% vs. 33.3%, respectively).

### Optimization and interpretation of serial quantiFERON testing to measure acquisition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^117SPT35]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

Conversion from a negative to positive QuantiFERON-TB test is indicative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, which predisposes individuals to tuberculosis disease. Interpretation of serial tests is confounded by immunological and technical variability.

Objectives

To improve the consistency of serial QuantiFERON-TB testing algorithms and provide a data-driven definition of conversion.

Methods

Sources of QuantiFERON-TB variability were assessed, and optimal procedures were identified. Distributions of IFN-γ response levels were analyzed in healthy adolescents, Mtb-unexposed control subjects, and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Measurements and Main Results

Individuals with no known Mtb exposure had IFN-γ values less than 0.2 IU/ml. Among individuals with IFN-γ values less than 0.2 IU/ml, 0.2–0.34 IU/ml, 0.35–0.7 IU/ml, and greater than 0.7 IU/ml, tuberculin skin test positivity results were 15%, 53%, 66%, and 91% (P < 0.005), respectively. Together, these findings suggest that values less than 0.2 IU/ml were true negatives. In short-term serial testing, "uncertain" conversions, with at least one value within the uncertainty zone (0.2–0.7 IU/ml), were partly explained by technical assay variability. Individuals who had a change in QuantiFERON-TB IFN-γ values from less than 0.2 to greater than 0.7 IU/ml had 10-fold higher tuberculosis incidence rates than those who maintained values less than 0.2 IU/ml over 2 years (P = 0.0003). By contrast, "uncertain" converters were not at higher risk than nonconverters (P = 0.229). Eighty-seven percent of patients with active tuberculosis had IFN-γ values greater than 0.7 IU/ml, suggesting that these values are consistent with established Mtb infection.

Conclusions

Implementation of optimized procedures and a more rigorous QuantiFERON-TB conversion definition (an increase from IFN-γ < 0.2 to > 0.7 IU/ml) would allow more definitive detection of recent Mtb infection and potentially improve identification of those more likely to develop disease.

### Interferon-γ release assays or tuberculin skin test for detection and management of latent tuberculosis infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117X3Z6V]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Use of an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay or tuberculin skin test for detection and management of latent tuberculosis infection is controversial. For both types of test, we assessed their predictive value for the progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease, the targeting value of preventive treatment, and the necessity of dual testing.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with no start date or language restrictions, on Oct 18, 2019, using the keywords ("latent tuberculosis" OR "latent tuberculosis infection" OR "LTBI") AND ("interferon gamma release assays" OR "Interferon-gamma Release Test" OR "IGRA" OR "QuantiFERON®-TB in tube" OR "QFT" OR "T-SPOT.TB") AND ("tuberculin skin test" OR "tuberculin test" OR "Mantoux test" OR "TST"). We included articles that used a cohort study design; included information that individuals with latent tuberculosis infection detected by IFN-γ release assay, tuberculin skin test, or both, progressed to active tuberculosis; reported information about treatment; and were limited to high-risk populations. We excluded studies that included patients with active or suspected tuberculosis at baseline, evaluated a non-commercial IFN-γ release assay, and had follow-up of less than 1 year. We extracted study details (study design, population investigated, tests used, follow-up period) and the number of individuals observed at baseline, who progressed to active tuberculosis, and who were treated. We then calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) for disease progression, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of IFN-γ release assay versus tuberculin skin test.

Findings

We identified 1823 potentially eligible studies after exclusion of duplicates, of which 256 were eligible for full-text screening. From this screening, 40 studies (50592 individuals in 41 cohorts) were identified as eligible and included in our meta-analysis. Pooled RR for the rate of disease progression in untreated individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay versus those were negative was 9·35 (95% CI 6·48–13·49) compared with 4·24 (3·30–5·46) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled PPV for IFN-γ release assay was 4·5% (95% CI 3·3–5·8) compared with 2·3% (1·5–3·1) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled NPV for IFN-γ release assay was 99·7% (99·5–99·8) compared with 99·3% (99·0–99·5) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled RR for rates of disease progression in individuals positive by IFN-γ release assay who were untreated versus those who were treated was 3·09 (95% CI 2·08–4·60) compared with 1·11 (0·69–1·79) for the same populations who were positive by tuberculin skin test. Pooled proportion of disease progression for individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test was 6·1 (95% CI 2·3–11·5). Pooled RR for rates of disease progression in individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test who were untreated versus those who were treated was 7·84 (95% CI 4·44–13·83).

Interpretation

IFN-γ release assays have a better predictive ability than tuberculin skin tests. Individuals who are positive by IFN-γ release assay might benefit from preventive treatment, but those who are positive by tuberculin skin test probably will not. Dual testing might improve detection, but further confirmation is needed.

### Detection and management of latent tuberculosis in liver transplant patients [^115Xu7rA]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The optimal means for detecting and managing liver transplantation (LT) patients with latent tuberculosis (TB) are not well defined. Our study aims were to (1) determine the frequency and risk factors of latent TB in a large cohort of consecutive adult LT candidates and (2) determine the safety and efficacy of isoniazid treatment in LT recipients with latent TB. A review of patients assessed for latent TB by skin testing using purified protein derivative (PPD; January 2004 to September 2008) or with the interferon-γ release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT; March 2008 to October 2009) was undertaken. The baseline clinical features and outcomes of subjects with latent TB and subjects without latent TB were compared. Twenty-five of 420 subjects (6.0%) were positive for PPD. In comparison, 11 of 119 subjects (9.2%) had a positive QFT assay, and 15 others (13%) had indeterminate results. Both PPD-positive and QFT-positive subjects were less likely to be Caucasian than subjects without latent TB (p < 0.001). The 3-year survival rate of the 25 LT recipients with latent TB was similar to that of the 296 LT recipients without latent TB (78.7% versus 74.6%, P = 0.58). Fifteen of the 25 latent TB patients received isoniazid at a mean of 0.67 months after LT. Although isoniazid was discontinued in 8 subjects because of possible side effects, none of the 25 latent TB patients developed TB reactivation after transplantation with a mean follow-up of 33 months. In conclusion, both QFT testing and PPD testing demonstrate similar rates of detecting latent TB infection in American LT candidates, but QFT testing also leads to a moderate rate of indeterminate test results. Early isoniazid chemoprophylaxis after LT is poorly tolerated and is frequently discontinued.

### Comparison of the 2-step tuberculin skin test and the quantiFERON-TB gold in-tube test for the screening of tuberculosis infection before liver transplantation [^117XYKKr]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The ability of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) to detect latent tuberculosis (TB) infection before liver transplantation (LT)is not well established. The aims of this study were (1) to compare the ability of the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) test (a whole-blood IGRA) to diagnose latent TB infections in patients awaiting LT and (2) to correlate the results with the severity of liver disease. We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study of patients who were evaluated for LT between July 2008 and July 2010. The 95 patients who were included underwent the 2-step TST and the QFT-IT test. The mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 13.8. Forty-four patients (46.3%) had positive TST results, 42 (44.2%) had positive QFT-IT results, and 2 (2.1%) had indeterminate QFT-IT results. Simultaneous TST and QFT-IT testing yielded a positivity rate of 55.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 45.3–65.9] with either test, and the 2-step TST yielded a positivity rate of 46.3% (95% CI = 36.1–56.8); the difference was 9.5% (P = 0.004). In an adjusted analysis, the rates for positive TST results were lower in patients with MELD scores ≥ 18 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.04–0.7], lower in Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) class C patients versus CPT class A patients (OR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.02–0.6), and higher in males (OR = 6.4, 95% CI = 1.9–22.0). In contrast, only being male (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.1–11.0) was associated with positive QFT-IT results; no association was found with the MELD score (OR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.2–2.8) or the CPT class (OR = 0.3; 0.05–1.4). In conclusion, the QFT-IT test is better than the TST for detecting latent TB infection in patients with more advanced liver disease. Our results support the regular use of the QFT-IT test for screening patients with end-stage liver disease for latent TB infection before LT.

### Prognostic value of interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin test in predicting the development of active tuberculosis (UK PREDICT TB): a prospective cohort study [^111i8PWi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

When the intention is to identify the largest proportion of individuals with a positive test result who might progress to active tuberculosis, such as among household contacts of patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, TST-5 — as currently recommended in US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines — might be the best approach. By contrast, screening programmes (eg, of migrants) should consider progression rates, the trade-off between the three criteria of selecting the most appropriate testing method outlined earlier, and the cost-effectiveness of the selected testing strategy.

We compared our results with the review that informed the WHO guidelines on managing latent tuberculosis, and summarised all existing pairwise comparisons of an IGRA versus TST. We identified several studies in our literature search and from the WHO review that evaluated TST versus a single IGRA in high incidence countries, and four did head-to-head comparisons in low incidence countries. However, only one of these studies compared TST with each of the commercially available IGRAs, and the other three studies only compared TST with QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube. Although sample sizes ranged from 339 to 1335 participants, all four studies had 15 or fewer individuals who progressed to active tuberculosis. To our knowledge, our study is the largest head-to-head comparison of the three available diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis infection, both in terms of the number of participants and progressions to active tuberculosis. Our estimates of positive predictive value are towards the low end of those previously reported, and are less than were found in two other small cohort studies. Positive predictive values for the development of active tuberculosis depend in part on the incidence of tuberculosis in the study population — ie, the positive predictive value is higher when the incidence is greater. Our analysis of TST stratified by BCG-vaccination status showed similar IRRs to those for both IGRAs, which is in contrast with the WHO guidelines reviewthat concluded TSTs had a lower IRR than IGRAs for progression to active tuberculosis in low incidence countries. In our study, progression of disease was increased among the recently exposed participants compared with migrants whose infection had probably been acquired in another country.

### Utilization of the quantiFERON-TB gold test in a two-step process with the tuberculin skin test to evaluate health care workers for latent tuberculosis [^116XZNtV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

A cost analysis of combining a tuberculin skin test (TST) and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-GT) to detect latent tuberculosis in newly hired health care workers was performed. An approximately 50% reduction in the cost of additional care was realized when workers with positive TST results were subsequently screened using the QFT-GT.

### QuantiFERON-TB gold plus performance in children: a narrative review [^116fSZ7B]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The principal role of IGRA, both in adult and pediatric settings, is to identify individuals who are infected by Mtb and at risk of progression to TB disease, and who, therefore, may benefit from TPT. Children with a positive IGRA or TST are more likely to progress to TB disease within 2 years than those with negative results. The second role for IGRAs is to aid the diagnosis of children with TB disease, which can be challenging due to difficulty in obtaining sputum samples, the paucibacillary nature of Mtb in specimens and a lack of disease-specific symptoms.

QFT-Plus was developed to improve Mtb test sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy compared with the previous generation, QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube (QFT-GIT) assay. As well as CD4+ T-cell responses to Mtb, the QFT-Plus detects CD8+ responses; this could increase assay sensitivity, especially in young children. However, since the introduction of QFT-Plus in children, no reviews have evaluated QFT-Plus performance in the pediatric population specifically. Therefore, in this narrative review, we identified and summarized recent studies evaluating the performance of the QFT-Plus IGRA as a test for Mtb infection and TB disease in children. The performance of this test in adults was reviewed previously.

### Performance of interferon-gamma release assays for tuberculosis screening in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease [^112LUBqd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to analyze the diagnostic accuracy and utility of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), as a screening tool for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergoing treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) medications. To describe cases of tuberculosis in the pediatric IBD population, TB treatment courses, outcomes, and their effect on IBD management.

Methods

A single-center, retrospective cohort study of pediatric IBD patients who underwent tuberculosis screening. IGRA testing from 2011 to 2017 were analyzed to determine result rates, characteristics, and outcomes.

Results

One thousand seven hundred fifty-four (1,754) tests were performed on 859 patients. One thousand six hundred thirty-four (1,634) tests were negative, 9 were positive, and 111 were indeterminate. Eight of 9 positive tests resulted during repeat annual screening while receiving IBD treatment. Five patients were treated for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and 4 were false-positives. IBD therapy was interrupted in 3 patients, with no negative long-term outcomes. We report 1 known false-negative, in a patient who developed disseminated TB on anti-TNF therapy. Indeterminate testing rates were higher at IBD diagnosis than during treatment (10.3% vs 5.3%, P < 0.001). Follow-up testing of indeterminate results was negative in all patients retested, with 14 patients lost to follow-up. No patient with indeterminate testing developed TB.

Conclusions

IGRAs are a useful tool to screen for LTBI, both before anti-TNF therapy and during treatment. Results should be used in concert with detailed history and examination. Positive and indeterminate results should be promptly repeated for timely TB diagnosis and to minimize interruptions in IBD therapy.

### Increased tuberculosis reactivation risk in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapy [^116V6PhA]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

In the natural history of Mtb infection, approximately 30% of close contacts will be infected following exposure to Mtb bacilli in the patient's airway. Subsequently, the LTBI status is defined by the absence of clinical or radiological evidence of active TB but a positive immune test for Mtb, such as IGRAs. For patients with cancer, the reactivation risk is higher than that in the general population. Studies have demonstrated that the new positive seroconversion of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube (QFT) testing, a type of IGRA, is associated with a higher risk of TB reactivation and serves as a more accurate marker than a single positive test of IGRA. Given the relatively low incidence of TB, we used positive LTBI seroconversion as a surrogate marker for the elevated risk of TB development in our prospective study because of its ease of measurement and follow-up. The findings of our prospective study were consistent with those obtained from our retrospective cohort on TB reactivation.

CBC with differential and CMP are not supported by evidence and are to be assessed at the discretion of each physicians' criteria except in cases involving patients treated with infliximab, for whom it is recommended that liver function tests be repeated every 3 mo after initiation, and if the result is normal, every 6–12 mo thereafter; a follow-up visit may be scheduled from quarterly to twice yearly depending on time of treatment, response, and tolerability of medication.

Boosting of IGRAs by tuberculin skin testing (TST) — observations and timing: Initial studies found that repeat TST testing did not alter the IGRA response, but more recent evidence suggests that prior TST placement can boost an IGRA, particularly in those already IGRA positive; this can be observed in as little as 3 days post-TST and may wane after several months; based on these data, they suggest when dual testing is to be considered that the IGRA be collected either concurrently or prior to TST placement.

### Reversion rates of quantiFERON-TB gold are related to pre-treatment IFN-gamma levels [^112vsHmg]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The quantitative interferon (IFN)-gamma in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens declines in tuberculosis patients after starting treatment, however, in some cases remains high despite clinical improvements. Our aim was to evaluate clinical parameters associated with remaining QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) positive after treatment.

Methods

A prospective cohort study of 101 culture-positive, positive QFT-G, HIV-uninfected patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. QFT-G was performed at diagnosis, at the end of intensive phase, at treatment completion, and 5–7 months post-treatment completion.

Results

There were 80 patients with complete results, 34 (43%) remaining QFT-G positive and 46 (58%) reverting to QFT-G negative at the 5–7 month post-treatment time point. There was a significant decline in IFN-gamma levels in response to both CFP-10 and ESAT-6 with tuberculosis treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between IFN-gamma levels detected before treatment and remaining QFT-G positive post-treatment after adjustment for smear status, presence of cavitation, and positive sputum culture two months after starting treatment.

Conclusions

Quantitative QFT-G responses drop significantly in active tuberculosis patients undergoing treatment, with almost 60% becoming test negative. Reversion to a negative QFT-G result was closely associated with the magnitude of the IFN-gamma response prior to treatment and increasing age.

On June 13, 2012, a group of key stakeholders, leaders, and national experts on tuberculosis (TB), occupational health, and laboratory science met in Atlanta, Georgia, to focus national discussion on the higher than expected positive results occurring among low-risk, unexposed healthcare workers undergoing serial testing with interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs). The objectives of the meeting were to present the latest clinical and operational research findings on the topic, to discuss evaluation and treatment algorithms that are emerging in the absence of national guidance, and to develop a consensus on the action steps needed to assist programs and physicians in the interpretation of serial testing IGRA results.

High-risk Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection — committee practice when initial testing is negative is described as follows: many committee members acknowledged that they perform a second test in clinical practice if patients at high risk for progression test negative, specifically performing a tuberculin skin test (TST) if an initial interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is negative or an IGRA if an initial TST is negative, and if the second test is positive, they consider this evidence for infection with Mtb; this approach aims to increase sensitivity, is not based upon empirical evidence, and may be an acceptable trade off when the consequences of missing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are judged higher than those of a false-positive result.

Management approach and education for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in health care workers (HCWs) — the lack of a "gold standard" LTBI test and potential drug toxicity often complicate decisions, so occupational health clinicians should consider all available clinical data; in some circumstances, serial screening and/or the use of both TSTs and IGRAs may be helpful in judging relative risks although not yet reflected in national guidelines; clinicians should manage LTBI based on analysis of screening tests, medical risk for reactivation and hepatotoxicity, and prior exposure history, which is essentially a Bayesian approach supported by interactive TB reactivation risk calculators; HCWs with established positive TSTs or IGRAs who have been evaluated for LTBI treatment should continue to receive annual education and may need periodic questionnaire screening for symptoms of active disease.

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection? [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionised LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

Objectives

With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence-base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis these include: prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion and the significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

Methodological Approach

On-going large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the current uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

Conclusions and Impact

Current and planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence-base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of current IGRAs in the near future.

Tuberculosis screening in persons with HIV — interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) vs tuberculin skin test (TST) and special situations: The QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube and T-SPOT TB tests are US Food and Drug Administration–approved aids for detecting latent M. tuberculosis, and a meta-analysis suggests IGRAs perform similarly to TSTs; prior Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination may yield a positive TST with less cross-reactivity for IGRA. The CDC states that use of an IGRA is preferred over the TST in patients with a history of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination and in those unlikely to return for skin test reading, and IGRAs reported as indeterminate should be repeated. Advanced immunosuppression may be associated with false-negative results, routine cutaneous anergy testing is not recommended, and routine use of IGRA in children aged < 5 years is currently not recommended.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113HteXV]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosing latent TB infection — All people with HIV should be evaluated for LTBI at the time of HIV diagnosis, regardless of their epidemiological risk of TB exposure; in programmatic settings in the United States, TB screening has been suboptimal, with only 47% to 69% of people with HIV presenting to care completing initial screening, and 42% of those with LTBI initiating therapy, and the two current diagnostics available in the United States, IGRA and TST, help differentiate those with and without TB infection, but the diagnostic accuracy of TST and IGRA is limited such that a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis of LTBI or TB disease and a positive test does not, by itself, mean LTBI therapy is warranted, so decisions about medical and public health management should include epidemiological risk factors, medical history, and other clinical information when interpreting IGRA or TST results.

TB disease evaluation in HIV after positive screening — diagnostic workflow: All persons with a positive TST or IGRA should be evaluated for the possibility of active TB disease; absence of any TB symptoms has a 97% negative predictive value for culture-positive TB disease, adding a chest radiograph improves sensitivity but decreases specificity, obtaining a sputum culture is the gold standard but not high yield for screening asymptomatic persons with HIV, and a negative symptom screen combined with a normal chest radiograph is usually sufficient to exclude TB disease in a patient with a positive TST or IGRA.

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion? [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in the diagnosis of active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations. The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed: (i) two-step approach of tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals), or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals); (ii) Either TST or IGRA, but not both; (iii) IGRA and TST together (to increase sensitivity); and (iv) IGRA only, replacing the TST. Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended, but most of the current guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interests. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

Screening and management

In our prospective screening study, we used QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFN-GIT), with gradual switching to QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) between May 2016 and January 2017. Results were positive, negative or indeterminate, dependent on manufacturers' criteria. Indeterminate results were included in the denominator.

The majority of PWH with CD4 + cell counts at least 200 cells/μl received a single IGRA test. Those with CD4 + cell counts less than 200 cells/μl generally received two tests (T-SPOT. TB plus a QuantiFERON-TB test), in most cases performed on the same day (where this was not possible, dual results were included if tests were taken within 14 days). PWH taking two tests were classed IGRA positive if either test was positive.

The most recent previous CD4 + cell count to an IGRA test was used as the CD4 + cell count classification at the time of the test. Individuals who had CD4 + cell counts performed more than a year prior to the planned time of IGRA testing had testing withheld until a more recent CD4 + cell count became available.

Individuals with positive IGRA tests were recalled for chest radiography and further clinical assessment to exclude active TB. We defined LTBI as PWH with a positive IGRA and normal chest radiography in the absence of any clinical features that would suggest active disease. PWH diagnosed with LTBI were offered chemoprophylaxis, in most cases, 6 months of isoniazid, in accordance with UK guidelines, although individual clinicians made the final decision dependent on clinician and patient preference. Where active TB was diagnosed, treatment again followed UK guidelines.

Data acquisition

Date of birth and sex at birth were recorded, together with NHS number wherever available, to verify records. Ethnicity and country-of-birth were ascertained from electronic hospital, HIV records or paper hospital records, and ethnicity was coded according to the national NHS data dictionary. Countries of birth were further classified into regions according to the World Bank Analytical Grouping. We took TB incidence in country-of-birth (< 50, 50–149, 150–249, 250–349 and ≥ 350 per 100 000 population) from WHO's Global Health Observatory and used figures available in March 2019.

Literature search

An electronic literature search was conducted from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2020 of articles in the PubMed database using the following keywords alone and in combination: 'interferon-gamma release assay', 'QuantiFERON', 'T-SPOT.TB', 'TB uveitis', 'serpiginous like choroiditis', 'tuberculoma', 'TB vasculitis', 'TB panuveitis' and 'ocular tuberculosis'. Manuscripts published in the past 10 years in English were included. References of included articles were also searched for relevant studies.

We included studies that met the following criteria: investigated the use of currently marketed versions of both tests (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-GIT), QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay (QFT-Plus), T-SPOT.TB or the premarket ELISpot version of T-SPOT.TB). Studies were excluded if authors had failed to specify which version of the QFT was being used and if the assays were being used on a bodily fluid other than blood. For data extraction, one reviewer abstracted relevant data from the eligible studies, which was double-checked by a second reviewer. Details have been provided in figure 1.

Types of tests

QuantiFERON-TB assay (QFT)

The first version of the QuantiFERON-TB test (QIFN) was approved by the FDA as a diagnostic tool for latent TB infection in 2001. It is an ELISA-based whole blood test that uses peptides from the M. tuberculosis -specific antigens. The result is reported as quantification of IFN-γ in international units (IU) per millilitre. The patient is considered positive for latent TB infection if the reported value is above the cut-off specified by the manufacturer. The QFT assay has four versions: QIFN, QFT-Gold, QFT-GIT and QFT-Gold Plus. The mechanisms of action of tests are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Mechanisms of actions of IGRAs

QuantiFERON-TB assay (QIFN)

This version used the whole purified protein derivative (PPD) as the antigen: human, avian and bovine types. Whole heparinised blood is incubated with these PPDs, phytohaemagglutinin as a positive control and saline as a negative control. The plasma is then collected, and the IFN-γ is quantified using an ELISA kit. This product is no longer marketed.

### Evaluation of the effect of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection on quantiFERON-TB gold assay results [^111fCgy9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the utility of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay for monitoring latent tuberculosis treatment efficacy, the assay was performed serially for healthcare workers receiving isoniazid therapy. After 9 months of isoniazid therapy, all of these healthcare workers remained QuantiFERON-TB Gold positive, and cellular proliferation assays revealed persistently strong purified protein derivative responses. These results do not support the use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay to monitor therapy.

### Preliminary performance of the VIDAS TB-IGRA as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals infected with… [^114z4vdy]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Since 2001, the development of IGRAs has provided many benefits over the TST for the detection of TB latent infection. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and T-SPOT-TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK) have been the most widely used, FDA-approved IGRAs that utilize synthetic peptides derived from M. tuberculosis- specific early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10). These tests are used to detect ex vivo reactivity specifically associated with M. tuberculosis infection. False-positive results due to BCG cross-reaction are very low with these IGRAs because the synthetic peptides used are absent in BCG vaccine strains and most pathogenic NTM strains. Additionally, these IGRAs only require a single patient visit, and results can be made available within 24 hours of testing, unlike the TST, which requires a second visit within 48–72 hours.

Although the development of IGRAs represents a huge breakthrough in diagnosing latent TB infection, many drawbacks remain. The currently available IGRAs involve multiple cumbersome manual steps, which can increase the likelihood of human error and introduce variability in the execution of the preanalytical steps, potentially leading to erroneous results and interpretations. Additionally, these IGRAs are typically performed as batch tests that require several patient samples per microplate, which may delay results for days.

The newly developed, fully automated VIDAS TB-IGRA offers an improved method for the detection of both latent TB infection and disease. The fully automated system uses the commercially available VIDAS3 platform to quickly deliver results in one easy step, thus eliminating the multiple steps required by other IGRAs, decreasing the occurrence of human (or operator) error, and enhancing robustness with lower variability in results. Furthermore, the process is performed in a single-patient format, which allows for a quick (within 17 hours) turnaround time.

In the present study, we evaluated and compared the first preliminary performance of VIDAS TB-IGRA with that of the QFT-Plus to detect both latent TB infection and disease in three patient populations, including individuals with confirmed TB disease as well as high-risk or low-risk populations for latent TB infection. Our data demonstrate an improved detection capacity with maintained specificity for the optimized VIDAS TB-IGRA, suggesting its value in diagnosing both latent TB infection and disease.

### An update on the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection [^113rdoJp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Targeted testing and treatment of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection at increased risk of progression to active disease is a key element of tuberculosis control. This strategy is limited by the poor specificity of the tuberculin skin test in populations vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin and its low sensitivity in immunosuppressed persons, who are at highest risk of progression. Two blood tests (T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold), based on detection of IFN-gamma released by T cells in response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens, may offer an improvement on the skin test. However, validation is challenging due to the lack of a diagnostic gold standard. This critical appraisal of published evidence summarizes the diagnostic accuracy of the new tests. The blood tests have operational advantages over the skin test because no return visit is required, results are available by the next day, and repeated testing does not cause boosting. Both tests are significantly more specific than the skin test in populations vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. The data suggest that T-SPOT.TB may be more sensitive than the skin test. Data in groups at high risk of progression to disease are scarce, and more research is needed in these populations, but it is clear that T-SPOT.TB performs better than the skin test in young children and HIV-infected people with active tuberculosis. Incorporation of these tests into programs for targeted testing of latent tuberculosis infection will reduce false-positive and false-negative results inherent in tuberculin testing, equipping clinicians with more accurate tools for tuberculosis control and elimination in the 21st century.

### Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis [^1146GSZA]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

According to current recommendations, tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assays can be considered interchangeable, and tuberculin skin test should not replace interferon-gamma release assays for LTBI diagnosis in low- and middle-income settings. Both tests are limited by the inability to predict the risk of reactivation and cannot distinguish between latent infection and active disease. In case of a positive result to any of them, active TB must be reasonably ruled out before starting LTBI treatment, which is essential to avoid the selection of drug resistances. A 6-month course of daily isoniazid is the only currently recommended option for treatment in resource-limited settings, with life-long administration encouraged among people living with HIV in high TB transmission areas. Alternative therapeutic regimens can be considered in high-income countries for patients other than children and HIV-positive individuals (Tables 3 and 4).

This investigation was a prospective, controlled substudy of IGRA responses in 82 healthy South African adults with HIV seronegative and positive tuberculin skin test results randomly assigned to treatment with 6 months of daily isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) or observation before Bacillus Calmette-Guérin revaccination in a clinical trial. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay was used to measure interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response to mycobacterial antigens at baseline and after IPT or observation.

Results

IFN-γ levels declined between baseline and the end of IPT (signed rank test P ≤ .0001) and between baseline and a similar period of observation without IPT (signed rank test P = .03). The rate of decrease in IFN-γ responses over time did not differ between the groups (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test P = .31). QFT-GIT test results in two subjects (5%) in the IPT group and two subjects (5%) in the observation group reverted from positive to negative during follow-up. No significant difference was found between the groups with respect to baseline positivity or the proportion of patients whose tests reverted to negative.

Conclusions

IPT had no effect on changes in QFT-GIT readouts during short-term follow-up of adults with positive tuberculin skin tests in a high TB incidence setting. QFT-GIT is unlikely to be a useful biomarker of response to treatment of latent TB infection.

Biologic therapy — tuberculosis (TB) monitoring for pediatric psoriasis includes baseline testing and risk-based ongoing screening. Pretreatment testing for latent TB with purified protein derivative (PPD), T-Spot, or QuantiFERON Gold is advised; yearly testing for latent TB "should be done in patients at high risk", while "for patients who are not at high risk, screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist", and "this screening is particularly important for patients who are taking TNF-α inhibitors". The result of the QuantiFERON Gold test "can remain positive after treatment of latent TB", and "an annual chest radiograph may be considered at the discretion of the treating dermatologist"; this table is "expert consensus and not part of evidence-based recommendations".

High-risk individuals ≥ 5 years — test performance and recommendation: Individuals at high risk of progression include those with HIV infection, an abnormal chest radiograph consistent with prior TB, silicosis, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy; in HIV infection, IGRA sensitivity has been estimated to be from 65% to 100% while TST sensitivity is only 43% using TB diagnosis as reference, and limited data suggest IGRAs are at least as sensitive as TST; Recommendation 2 states there are insufficient data to recommend a preference for either a TST or an IGRA as the first-line diagnostic test in individuals 5 years or older who are likely to be infected with Mtb and at high risk of progression when testing for LTBI is warranted.

### QuantiFERON-TB gold plus performance in children: a narrative review [^111J1VQS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The WHO's End TB Strategy targets a reduction in incidence to below 10 cases per 100,000 people per year by 2050; however, modeling suggests that reductions in this magnitude will not be possible unless cases of Mtb infection are effectively identified early and treated.WHO targets for preventive TB treatment (30 million for 2018–2022)are also unlikely to be met. Pediatric TB remains neglected for various reasons, including difficulty diagnosing pulmonary TB and the belief that children do not contribute significantly to transmission. Given the incidence of pediatric TBand the high risk of progression and severe disease in young children, there is an urgent need to better understand appropriate methods for early detection of Mtb infection to identify those suitable for TPT. IGRAs have value in closing this diagnostic gap.

Evaluation of IGRA performance is limited without a gold standard or reference method. In this review, we summarized the evidence surrounding QFT-Plus in pediatric populations and found this assay has moderate sensitivity of 54.5%–87.3% against a reference standard of microbiologically confirmed TB disease.– However, considering the challenging nature of microbiological confirmation of TB disease in children, this should be interpreted with caution.

Agreement between QFT-Plus and TST varied between studies, possibly due to technical and biological reasons, such as subjectivity in TST reading, and TST cross-reactivity to nontuberculous mycobacteria and BCG vaccination. Performing the TST within 2 years of BCG vaccination can result in false-positive results that later revert to negative. The high rate of TST-positive/IGRA-negative discordance in the Ho et alstudy in children less than 5 years of age in the US (and the high risk ratio of TST vs. QFT-Plus positivity in children < 2 years) may have reflected false-positive TST results arising from BCG vaccination rather than true Mtb infection, as these children had less opportunity for exposure to TB than older children. IGRAs offer an advantage over TSTs in reducing false-positive results associated with BCG vaccination or nontuberculous mycobacteria infection. Some investigators suggested that using IGRAs in children less than 2 years is of value, especially in settings where BCG vaccination is mandatory, to prevent unwarranted TPT.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^116opVjE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — rationale and strength language: Accuracy studies indicate that IGRAs are more specific and equally or more sensitive than TST in individuals who have received the BCG vaccination; therefore, false-positive results are less likely with IGRAs than with TST, and false-positive results may lead to unnecessary treatment and its accompanying risks (i.e., hepatotoxicity). To minimize these risks, the guideline development panel chose to recommend IGRA testing for individuals who received the BCG vaccination, and the recommendation to perform IGRA testing rather than TST testing is strong for those who have received the BCG vaccination or who are not likely to return for TST read; in contrast, the suggestion to perform IGRA testing rather than TST testing on all other patients who are likely to be infected with Mtb and have a low or moderate risk of progressing to TB disease is conditional, and while the committee concluded that IGRA testing is preferable in most patients, it recognized that TST testing may be more appropriate in a sizeable minority due to availability, feasibility, cost, or burden.

### Serial quantiferon-TB gold test results in 279 patients with psoriasis receiving biologic therapy [^1148A8W5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The risk of active tuberculosis is still a concern in patients receiving biologics. To determine the risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation by Quantiferon-TB Gold (QFT) assay in psoriatic patients treated with biologics in 11years' follow-up, along with chest radiography alterations. This retrospective study included 279 patients with plaque-type and/or pustular, or nail psoriasis who were treated with biologics, and had results for ≥ 2 LTBI tests. The QFT outcomes were defined according to the baseline and the follow-up QFT results; seroconversion as from negative to positive, seroreversion as from positive to negative, persistently seronegative as invariantly negative, persistently seropositive as invariantly positive, and other any result was accepted as indeterminate. Demographic features, the presence and the type of any chest X-ray abnormality was noted during the follow-up. Of 279 baseline QFT tests, the vast majority were negative (n = 193; 69%), with a less of positive (n = 86; 31%). Ten (5.2%) of 193 patients converted from negative to positive QFT status after starting biologic therapy (P < 0.001) during 11years' follow-up. Although these 10 patients exhibited seroconversion of QFT from negative to positive, only one patient was diagnosed with active TB. There was no statistically significant difference among biologics as regards with QFT seroconversion risk (P = .09). This study showed that 5.2% of patients showed seroconversion. Annual QFT testing remains a necessary and mandatory tool to prevent further TB reactivation in psoriasis patients taking biologic therapy although only one patient was diagnosed with active TB in this cohort.

Methotrexate monitoring and interacting medications — baseline/ongoing monitoring includes history and physical examination, hepatitis B and C (baseline monitoring), pretreatment test for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or QuantiFERON Gold), and referral for a chest radiograph for a positive TB test. Monitor CBC and LFT every 3–6 months assuming no abnormal laboratory results, with additional monitoring recommended for patients with impaired kidney function including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and to check CBC 5 to 7 days after a test-dose. Medications that may increase the risk of methotrexate toxicity include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylates, naproxen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, phenylbutazone), antibiotics (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole†, sulfonamides, penicillin, minocycline, ciprofloxacin), and others (barbiturates, colchicine, dipyridamole, ethanol, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, furosemide, thiazide diuretics), with †Greater potential for methotrexate toxicity. The text notes that patients on methotrexate should be still monitored for rare, serious lung reactions and that drug-drug interactions, especially involving sulfonamides, can significantly increase the likelihood of methotrexate toxicity.

### Clinical characteristics and aetiology of uveitis in a viral haemorrhagic fever zone [^114qUvX2]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic infections causing uveitis, including TB and syphilis are also represented in our cohort. In our cohort, no patients were thought to have uveitis caused by TB as the predominant aetiology, despite 48% of cases tested being QuantiFERON positive. The initial clinical diagnosis did not take into account the results of QuantiFERON, as these were only available once the data collection period had elapsed. TB uveitis diagnosis was predominantly therefore a clinical diagnosis where there was granulomatous uveitis with no other cause. This demonstrates that whilst there is a high prevalence of latent TB in the population generally, few cases within our cohort presented with active TB. Quantiferon testing is often positive in those who are exposed to TB and can be positive in latent or active TB infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that quantiferon TB testing does not have added value in differentiating between latent and active TB in areas of high TB disease burden, and therefore should not be used as a replacement for conventional microbiological diagnosis of TB in these settings. Similarly, our high quantiferon TB results, although being in a cohort of patients with active uveitis, adds to the data that positive testing does not add weight to diagnosis of active TB. None of the positive results led to a change in management of their ocular or systemic condition. However, the benefit of a negative quantiferon result helped with excluding ocular TB as a diagnosis, and to differentiate with other aetiologies, in particular syphilitic uveitis. Additionally, the high positive rates raise the concern that extrapulmonary TB may be more prevalent in Sierra Leone than would previously have been imagined. This small study calls for a more robust research project, in which quantiferon TB testing is systemically performed to look for prevalence of TB in Sierra Leone. Recommendations should include the reliable availability of Quantiferon TB testing in the main laboratory and the routine request for this in cases of uveitis where clinically indicated, such as those with bilateral uveitis, panuveitis or posterior uveitis, in particular to help differentiate from other diagnoses.

### Role of interferon gamma release assay in the diagnosis and management of-associated uveitis: a review [^116zLccz]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay

The second version received approval in 2005. Fresh heparinised whole blood is incubated with synthetic peptides representing ESAT-6 and CFP-10, rather than with PPDs. IFN-γ concentration is measured using ELISA. This product is no longer marketed.

QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay

The QFT-GIT assay was approved by the FDA in 2007. In QFT-GIT, whole blood is collected in three heparinised tubes, one containing stimulating antigens ESAT-6, CFP-10 and TB7.7, a mitogen (positive control) tube, and a nil (antigen-free) tube. After incubation, IFN-γ concentration is measured using an ELISA kit.

Diagnostic accuracy

The sensitivity of QFT-GIT reported in meta-analyses ranged between 69% and 89% and the specificity between 76% and 99% for active TB. Similarly, for latent TB infection, sensitivity was reported between 58% and 84% and specificity between 71% and 89%. For TBU, sensitivity was 64% (95% CI 60% to 69%) and specificity was 99.5% (95% CI 98.8% to 99.9%) in a study conducted in Singapore.

QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay

The fourth generation of QFT uses two antigen tubes: TB1 and TB2. Both tubes contain the antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (TB7.7 is not used in this assay). TB2 contains an additional set of peptides targeted to induce a response from CD8+ cells. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017.

Diagnostic accuracy

The sensitivity of QFT-Plus reported in meta-analyses for active TB was 94% and the specificity was 96%. For latent TB infection, sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 95%. No study reported the diagnostic accuracy of QFT-Plus among patients with TBU.

### Initial results of quantiFERON-TB gold testing in patients with uveitis [^111aaD7M]. Eye (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the use of the second-generation QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) test in a series of patients in an ophthalmic practice.

Methods

The charts of all patients who had QFT-G tests ordered by Mayo Clinic ophthalmologists in the past 3 years were reviewed.

Results

A total of 27 QFT-G tests were ordered. Thirteen (48%) tests were negative, six (22%) were indeterminate, two (7%) tests were re-ordered after a lab accident or an improper cancellation, four (15%) were positive and represented infection, and two (7%) were positive but negative when re-tested. Of the four truly positive cases, three were treated for tuberculosis (TB): one had tuberculous iritis, one had retinal vasculitis and haemorrhage, and one had asymptomatic TB but was on immunosuppressive therapy. The fourth patient had previously been treated for latent infection.

Conclusions

In a series of selected patients with uveitis, the QFT-G test was able to detect TB infection in 15% of the patients, though it does not differentiate between active and latent TB infection. QFT-G should be considered in place of purified protein derivative testing in those with uveitis that have had prior BCG vaccination and in immunocompromised patients. Patients with a positive QFT-G, but who have little risk for TB infection and a negative systemic work-up, should be re-tested.

Healthcare worker serial testing with interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) — variability and retesting: IGRAs have not proven to solve false-positive results in serial testing of low-risk individuals, and there is insufficient information to define conversion or reversion; reported findings include a QFT conversion rate of 12% and a reversion rate of 24%, and an IGRA conversion of 6%–8% with rates 6–9 times higher than TST. Multiple laboratory-related factors can cause variability around the cutoff, supporting the committee's recommendation that quantitative values be reported, and given varied sources of IGRA variability the committee thought that a positive test in a low-risk individual was likely to be a false-positive result and recommended repeat testing.

### Interferon-γ release assays versus tuberculin skin test for targeting people for tuberculosis preventive treatment: an evidence-based review [^114hyVaF]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether Interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) reduce the number of people considered for tuberculosis (TB) preventive treatment without increasing subsequent active disease.

Methods

Longitudinal studies with both tuberculin skin test (TST) and IGRAs were identified through a PubMed search. Reductions in diagnosis of TB infection and increases in incident TB in people considered not infected, using IGRAs either instead of TST or as a confirmatory test (two-step approach), were assessed.

Results

In comparison with TST alone, the pooled reductions in diagnosis of TB infection obtained with IGRAs were 16.7% and 5.8% at 5 and 10 mm cut-offs respectively, and 24.5% and 12.4% at 5 and 10 mm respectively with the two-step approach. Compared with TST alone, incident TB among people considered not infected increased with the two-step approach (0.94% with T-SPOT(®).TB and 1.1% with QuantiFERON(®)-TB Gold In-Tube) in one of seven studies in high-income countries. In middle- and low-income countries, two of four studies presented increases (0.08 and 0.03 per 100 patient-years respectively) with the two-step approach.

Conclusions

In high-income countries, the use of IGRAs, either instead of TST or as confirmatory test reduces the number of people considered for preventive treatment, without a significant risk of subsequent active disease.

Testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) — IGRA preferred over TST in specific adults and children: Our recommendations for diagnostic testing for LTBI are based upon the likelihood of infection with Mtb and the likelihood of progression to TB disease if infected, as illustrated in Figure 1. We recommend performing an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) rather than a tuberculin skin test (TST) in individuals 5 years or older who meet the following criteria: (1) are likely to be infected with Mtb, (2) have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, (3) it has been decided that testing for LTBI is warranted, and (4) either have a history of BCG vaccination or are unlikely to return to have their TST read (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Poor predictability of quantiFERON-TB assay in recipients and donors for tuberculosis development after kidney transplantation in an intermediate-TB-burden country [^112NWJNb]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, two cases of TB developed in recipients with negative QFT results. This suggested that the QFT, just like T-SPOT, is not adequately sensitive in immunosuppressed hosts. De novo post-KT TB infection can also occur in countries with a high-to-intermediate TB burden. Yet, latent TB in the donor may be transmitted to the recipient after KT. Actually, one case of TB in a patient with a negative QFT result received kidneys from a QFT-positive donor. Organ donation from donors with active TB is generally contraindicated; however, there is some controversy concerning isoniazid treatment for donors or recipients when the donor has positive IGRA results. Some guidelines recommend chemoprophylaxis for donors with a positive TST/IGRA before donation; however, it is challenging to treat all donors with positive IGRA results for the same reason as recipients. In our study, 31% of donors were QFT positive, and the QFT of the donor could not predict the development of TB. Although treatment of latent TB for KT recipients with QFT-positive donors is recommended in low TB-burden countries, routine treatment is still controversial in high-to-intermediate TB-burden countries, because drug toxicity and resistance may outweigh the benefits of treatment. Further large-scale, long-term follow-up studies are needed to confirm the necessity of treatment based on donor QFT. Before confirmative evidence is available, a careful approach is needed according to a center-specific policy, and we recommend close monitoring of KT patients with a positive donor IGRA result without routine treatment in our situation.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^115ZcUi2]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

7 Concluding remarks

Published evidence on the performance of IGRAs suggests that IGRAs maintain their diagnostic sensitivity for LTBI better than TST in patients with IMID, most of whom are on immunosuppressive DMARDs. Most of the available data to date is derived from QFT-Gold in-tube and the evidence-base for both this assay and T-SPOT. TB needs to be expanded to assess whether these new tests are definitely superior to TST in this important patient population. Also, next-generation IGRAs that incorporate new M. tuberculosis -specific antigens which significantly enhance diagnostic sensitivity without compromising specificity hold promise and should therefore be assessed in this population. The lack of a gold standard for diagnosis of LTBI means that prospective longitudinal clinical outcome studies to determine the prognostic value of positive IGRA results for subsequent development of active TB in this population are urgently required.

In the meantime, some practical recommendations for screening for TB infection prior to TNF blockade can be made. Most importantly, active TB must first be excluded by history and chest radiograph. Screening for LTBI should include checking for a history of untreated or partially treated TB, risk-stratification for exposure to cases of active TB and searching for evidence of residual changes indicative of untreated prior TB infection on a chest radiograph (e.g. calcified granulomas, Gohn focus or complex, apical scarring). In addition, given the apparent diagnostic superiority of IGRAs over TST, one or the other of the new blood tests should be performed. However, given the very limited size of the evidence-base in support of IGRAs to date and the vulnerability of these patients to develop severe and disseminated forms of TB on TNF blockade, it may be prudent to perform TST in parallel with IGRA to maximise the diagnostic sensitivity of screening, at least until the IGRA evidence-base in this population has expanded sufficiently. Since some patients with LTBI may have false-negative IGRA results and true-positive TST results, while others will have true-positive IGRA results and false-negative TST results, a dual-testing strategy should enable physicians to offer all patients with LTBI preventative treatment. IGRA results in patients already taking anti-TNF agents currently remain uninterpretable.

### Discordant quantiFERON-TB gold test results among US healthcare workers with increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection: a problem or solution? [^111dKzd3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

In late 2006, our hospital implemented use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) assay, a whole-blood interferon-gamma release assay, for detection of tuberculosis infection. All newly hired healthcare workers (HCWs) with positive Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) results were routinely tested with the QFT-G assay, to take advantage of its higher specificity. We then undertook a quality assurance review to evaluate the QFT-G test results in HCWs with multiple risk factors for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).

Methods

The clinical records for TST-positive HCWs tested with the QFT-G assay were reviewed. HCWs with 2 or more risk factors commonly associated with LTBI were classified as "increased risk" (IR). IR HCWs who had negative QFT-G test results underwent repeat QFT-G testing and were offered testing with a different interferon-gamma release assay (T-SPOT.TB) and with extended T cell stimulation assays.

Results

Of 143 TST-positive HCWs tested with the QFT-G assay, 26 (18%) had positive results, 115 (81%) had negative results, and 2 (1%) had indeterminate results. Of 82 IR HCWs, 23 (28%) had positive QFT-G test results, and 57 (70%) had negative results. Of the 57 IR HCWs with negative results, 43 underwent repeat QFT-G testing: 41 had negative results again, and 2 had positive results. These 43 HCWs were also offered additional testing with the T-SPOT.TB diagnostic, and 36 consented: 31/36 tested negative, and 5/36 tested positive. Extended assays using the antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 confirmed the positive results detected by the overnight assays and yielded positive results for an additional 7/36 (19%) of individuals; strikingly, all 36 HCWs had strongly positive test results with assays using purified protein derivative.

Conclusions

The extreme discordance between the results of our clinical diagnostic algorithm and the results of QFT-G testing raises concern about the sensitivity of the QFT-G assay for detection of LTBI in our HCWs. Results of extended stimulation assays suggest that many of our IR HCWs have indeed been sensitized to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is possible that the QFT-G assay identifies those at higher reactivation risk rather than all previously infected, but, in the absence of long-term follow-up data, we should interpret negative QFT-G results with some caution.

### Characterization of quantiFERON-TB-plus results in latent tuberculosis infected patients with or without immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [^111G6reX]. The Journal of Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnosis is mandatory in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) requiring biologics. QuantiFERON-TB-Plus (QFT-P), an LTBI diagnostic test, measures IFN-γ after M. tuberculosis-stimulation in TB1 and TB2 tubes in which a "CD4" or a "CD4 and CD8" response is respectively elicited. Aim of this study is to compare the response to QFT-P of IMID-LTBI patients candidates to a new biological therapy vs LTBI-subjects without IMID.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 167 subjects: 61 IMID-LTBI and 106 NON-IMID-LTBI.

Results

All subjects were mitogen-responders. IFN-γ production was significantly lower in IMID-LTBI-patients compared to NON-IMID-LTBI-subjects. We observed discordant TB1 and TB2 results in 6.5% of IMID-LTBI-patients and in 8% of NON-IMID-LTBI-subjects. Applying a logistic regression analysis, we found that IMID-LTBI patients had a higher probability (TB1 stimulation OR 3.32; TB2 stimulation OR 4.33) to have IFNγ results ≤ 0.7 IU/mL compared to NON-IMID-LTBI-subjects. Interestingly, IMID-treatment did not interfere with the distribution of IFNγ-values.

Conclusions

These results indicate that IMID-LTBI-patients have a low IFN-γ response to QFT-P, a high proportion of results ranging in the grey zone and a distribution of IFNγ-values independent from the IMID-treatment. These results are important for the management of LTBI screening in IMID patients.

Indeterminate/invalid IGRA responses — outcomes, causes, and immediate actions: IGRAs have a trichotomous outcome yielding a positive, negative, or indeterminate result; indeterminate/invalid results can result from either a high background (nil) response or from a poor response to positive control mitogen; indeterminate results are associated with immunosuppression, although they may occur in healthy individuals; when a poor mitogen response may be due to performance issues such as collection/processing errors, incubator malfunction, or technical errors, it is reasonable to simply repeat the assay, whereas a persistently diminished mitogen response may reflect anergy.

### Usefulness of quantiFERON ®-TB gold test in psoriatic patients under treatment with tumour necrosis factor blockers [^111NU7Ep]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Infliximab is a human/mouse chimeric anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α antibody that is effective in the management of psoriasis. Anti-TNF treatments may reactivate latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); therefore, screening for LTBI is mandatory before starting any anti-TNF-α therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold (QFT-G) test in psoriatic patients under treatment with infliximab.

Research Design and Methods

A retrospective study had been performed on patients affected by psoriasis who had been treated with infliximab from 2003 to 2012 at a single centre.

Main Outcomes Measures

QFT-G was tested by a standard TB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, based on detection of interferon-γ release from sensitized leucocytes exposed to the synthetic Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens at baseline and every 6 months until the end of treatment.

Results

A total of 140 patients were included. At baseline, 7 QFT-G tests were positive and 133 tests were negative. Of the 133 patients, 11 (8%) who were negative at baseline became QFT-G test positive during treatment. Of those 11 patients, 5 had a reversion during treatment. Of the 133 patients, 122 (92%) who were negative at baseline remained negative.

Conclusions

It was found that the development of positive QFT-G tests, observed in 8% treated with infliximab, was not associated with pulmonary or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnostic testing — IGRA vs TST and age thresholds: Guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection. We concur with this recommendation. If diagnostic testing is nevertheless performed in such individuals, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest a second diagnostic test if the initial test is positive in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When such testing is performed, the person is considered infected only if both tests are positive. We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children < 5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age. While both IGRA and TST testing provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent TB. Therefore, the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to starting on treatment for LTBI. This is typically done by determining whether or not symptoms suggestive of TB disease are present, performing a chest radiograph and, if radiographic signs of active TB are seen, then sampling is performed and the patient managed accordingly.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^1133anfw]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Interferon-gamma release-assays

IGRAs are immune-based blood tests for detecting Mtb infection by measuring T-cell responses (currently Interferon-gamma) to highly specific Mtb antigens (ESAT-6 and CFP-10) being the most well-established in commercial assays). They are not confounded by prior BCG vaccination and provide higher diagnostic specificity than the TST. Two assay platforms exist in current clinical practice: the T-Spot. TB, which utilises an ELISpot assay as its readout after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Mtb antigens; and the Quantiferon (QFN-GIT), which has an ELISA-based readout after a whole-blood stimulation. Both benefit from a single blood draw at a single clinic visit, in contrast to the TST. Now established as a standard-of-care for diagnosing LTBI, they offer a modest advantage over the TST for the prediction of progression from LTBI to active TB.

A large-scale prospective head-to-head comparison of diagnostic performance of IGRAs in routine practice has been performed in the UK, and neither existing IGRA, that is, the T-SPOT. TB nor QFN-GIT, have sufficient sensitivity nor negative predictive value to rule out a diagnosis of active TB (IDEA study 2019). IGRAs are therefore not recommended in the diagnosis of active TB.

In the setting of immunosuppression as a result of underlying disease or iatrogenic causes, both the TST and IGRAs are attenuated and hence are less sensitive in those settings.

With these general principles in mind, there is some limited literature on the utility of the TST and IGRAs in the diagnosis of OTB. In general, these studies do not consistently show a definite role for either approach to aid the diagnosis of OTB. Notably, a UK-based retrospective evaluation showed that of a group with clinically defined OTB, the sensitivity of the QFN was only 70.1%; in contrast, the increased rate of QFN positivity in unexplained uveitis in a low incidence setting indicates that the test may identify some cases of OTB but with uncertain sensitivity and specificity.

### QuantiFERON-TB gold cut-off value: implications for the management of tuberculosis-related ocular inflammation [^1114RPsc]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the accuracy of QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing in patients with presumptive tuberculosis-ocular inflammation.

Design

Prospective nonrandomized case series and clinical laboratory investigation.

Methods

Ninety-six consecutive patients presenting with ocular inflammation between January and October 2007 were tested using QuantiFERON-TB Gold. Positive patients received a 6-month anti-tuberculosis treatment. Patient follow-up ranged from 12 months to 24 months. Treatment was considered effective at the end of follow-up, in cases of no or a 2-point decrease of ocular inflammation (SUN criteria) and systemic corticosteroids stopped or tapered to 10 mg/day.

Results

Mean age was 51 ± 17 years. Types of ocular inflammation included scleritis (n = 7), panuveitis (n = 34), and posterior (n = 15), intermediate (n = 14), and anterior uveitis (n = 15). QuantiFERON-TB Gold was positive in 42 cases (44%), negative in 51 cases (53%), and undetermined in 3 cases (3%). Among positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold patients, 25 received a full anti-tuberculosis treatment, which was effective in 15 cases (60%). Associated systemic steroids were given to 6 patients and tapered to 10 mg/day or less in all cases. Median QuantiFERON-TB Gold value was significantly higher in the group with a successful therapeutic response (7.67 IU/mL [0.46 to 33.37]) compared to the group with treatment failure (1.22 IU/mL [0.61 to 4.4]), P = .026.

Conclusion

Results of anti-tuberculosis treatment were encouraging in QuantiFERON-TB Gold-positive ocular inflammation, especially with values over 2 IU/mL in our study, suggesting that a higher cut-off value than that given by the manufacturer should be considered to better identify ocular inflammation that can benefit from full anti-tuberculosis treatment.

### Immune profiling enables stratification of patients with active tuberculosis disease or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^115cL6bq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health problem, with an estimated 1.7 billion persons latently infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Most newly infected individuals mount an effective immune response that controls infection; however, the host response does not fully eliminate the bacteria, resulting in a clinically asymptomatic state. An estimated 5–10% of individuals with chronic infection progress to active disease at some point in their life, translating into approximately 10 million progressing to TB disease annually.

Due to the burden of infected persons in endemic regions and the high risk of reinfection, treatment strategies typically prioritize patients with active disease with the goal to limit transmission. As a result, there is a critical need to diagnose active disease and to distinguish it from latent infection. Diagnosis of active TB disease can be achieved by microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or culture-based detection of Mtb presence in sputum. However, many patients with TB cannot produce sputum and it is preferable to utilize blood-based clinical assays, but available methods cannot reliably stratify active disease from latent infection. Whole-blood assays can distinguish infected from uninfected persons, based on stimulation with Mtb antigens (Ag), followed by an interferon γ (IFNγ) assay. Such assays include the QuantiFERON–TB Gold (QFT), which utilizes Mtb -specific antigens ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB7.7 to stimulate immune cells in a blood collection tube with IFNγ secretion measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and T-SPOT.TB, which uses similar antigens with IFNγ measured by ELISPOT. Potential sources of technical variability with QFT may include the range of blood volumes (0.8–1.2 mL) and incubation times (16–24 hours) permitted in the manufacturer's protocol, and recent studies have addressed these sources of variance. Despite these improvements, QFT has limitations for use as a diagnostic in TB-endemic countries, although it has been recently used to measure the efficacy endpoint in a prevention of Mtb infection phase II vaccine trial and is used to assess inclusion/exclusion criteria.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

TB infection diagnosis in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children — testing modalities and interpretation: Latent TB infection (LTBI) can be diagnosed using the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), but a negative result with these tests cannot be used as exclusionary for M. tuberculosis infection (AII). The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) and the T SPOT®. TB assay are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved. An IGRA is preferred for BCG-vaccinated patients and when return rates for TST reading are poor, although studies in HIV-infected and very young children are limited and inconsistent. TST is preferred over IGRAs for children younger than age 5 years (AII). When increased sensitivity is desired, TST and an IGRA can be done simultaneously, with a positive result from either being diagnostic. Younger age, HIV infection, and reduced CD4 numbers increase indeterminate IGRA results, and reduced QFT sensitivity in young children has been reported with greatly reduced diagnostic utility in TB-endemic areas.

### Reducing the rates of indeterminate results of the quantiFERON-TB gold in-tube test during routine preemployment screening for latent tuberculosis infection among healthcare personnel [^115ZQs8B]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

We implemented the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) In-Tube test to identify latent tuberculosis infection among potential employees prior to employment. The rates of indeterminate QFT-G In-Tube test results were higher than expected and prompted an investigation that led to successful interventions (eg, manual vortexing before incubation and the use of a modified in-tube method). The tracking of indeterminate results is suggested as an important quality control measure.
