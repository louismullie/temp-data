## Question

If 15 and 9 are lengths of two medians of a triangle, what is the maximum possible area of the triangle to the nearest integer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the maximum possible area of a triangle given two medians of lengths 15 and 9, rounded to the nearest integer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric relationship between medians and area. Then, I should verify the formula that connects two medians and the included angle to the area. Next, I will determine the angle that maximizes the area. After that, I will compute the maximum area and round it appropriately. Finally, I should double-check the derivation and ensure no constraints are violated.

> Let me first confirm the core geometric principle. The area of a triangle can be expressed in terms of two medians and the sine of the angle between them. Specifically, if medians of lengths m and n intersect at angle θ, the area A is given by A = [4/3] × [1/2] × m × n × sin θ, which simplifies to A = [2/3]mn sin θ. Wait, let me verify that constant factor; yes, the standard derivation accounts for the centroid dividing medians in a 2:1 ratio, yielding the 4/3 factor when converting from the parallelogram formed by the medians to the triangle's area, so the formula is correct [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how to maximize the area given fixed median lengths. Since m and n are constants here, the area A is maximized when sinθ is maximized, which occurs when θ = 90 degrees. Hold on, I should verify that there is no hidden constraint preventing θ from reaching 90 degrees; in general, the angle between two medians can vary with the triangle's shape, so θ = 90 degrees is attainable and yields the maximum sinθ = 1 [^notfound].

> Now I will plug in the given values. With m = 15 and n = 9, the maximum area is Aₘₐₓ = [2/3] × 15 × 9 × 1 = [2/3] × 135 = 90. Let me double-check the arithmetic: 2/3 of 135 is indeed 90, so the exact maximum area is 90 square units [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to round to the nearest integer. Since 90 is already an integer, the answer is 90. I should confirm that no further adjustment is needed; yes, 90.0 rounded to the nearest integer remains 90 [^notfound].

The maximum area of a triangle with two medians of lengths 15 and 9 is **90 square units**. This occurs when the medians are perpendicular, maximizing the sine of the angle between them. The area is calculated using the formula (Area = [4/3] × [1/2] × m₁ × m₂ × sin θ), where (θ = 90°) and (sin 90° = 1). Thus, the maximum area is ([4/3] × [1/2] × 15 × 9 × 1 = 90).

---

## Geometric background

Medians are line segments from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, intersecting at the centroid, which divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. The area of a triangle can be expressed in terms of two medians and the sine of the angle between them [^notfound].

---

## Formula for area in terms of medians

The area (A) of a triangle with medians (m₁) and (m₂) and angle (θ) between them is:

A = [4/3] × [1/2] × m₁ × m₂ × sin θ

This simplifies to:

A = [2/3] × m₁ × m₂ × sin θ

---

## Maximizing the area

To maximize the area, we maximize (sin θ), which reaches its maximum of 1 when (θ = 90°). Thus, the maximum area is:

Aₘₐₓ = [2/3] × m₁ × m₂

---

## Calculation for given medians

Given m₁ = 15 and m₂ = 9, the maximum area is:

Aₘₐₓ = [2/3] × 15 × 9 = [2/3] × 135 = 90

---

## Conclusion

The maximum possible area of a triangle with medians of lengths 15 and 9 is **90 square units**.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^b7f5bc7d]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Hospital length of stay, by discharge status. Medians (square) are presented with interquartile range (IQR). Where estimates were reported as mean and standard deviation, equivalent quantiles have been calculated assuming a Weibull distribution (triangle); if no measure of variation was reported, only the original mean is presented (circle). The grey dashed lines represent the mean value across all point estimates within that setting, weighted by sample size. The studies are ordered by the study start date, with most recent at the top. Two studies (Shi et al. (2020-02-02) and Shi et al. (2020-01-23)) have multiple estimates for the same outcome which represent multiple treatment and comorbidity subgroups, respectively. Details of these are included in Table 1

Estimates for LoS amongst patients who died in hospital were generally shorter than those for patients who were discharged alive, with medians between 4 and 21 days compared to 4 and 53 days, respectively. This difference is apparent in Fig. 2, where median LoS was lower for those discharged alive in 6 out of 8 studies that reported both outcomes. In studies that reported total hospital LoS by disease severity (11 studies, Supplementary Fig. A), there was a trend towards more severe cases having longer LoS. However, the definition of different levels of severity was inconsistent between studies so it is not possible to draw any confident conclusion.

Visual inspection of the study estimates suggested some evidence of a difference between total hospital LoS reported within and outside China, but studies outside China were too few (5/48) for a formal comparison. However, LoS reported within the ISARIC report in particular (which includes contributed data from 25 countries, but with the majority of patients from the UK) gave a median and IQR (4 days (1–9)) substantially lower than the weighted mean from the studies from China (15.3 days).

The patient populations observed in these studies covered a wide range of ages, including three paediatric studies. Amongst patients discharged alive, there appears to be little difference in average LoS between studies with the youngest and oldest patients, but the longest estimates came from studies with average age in the upper end of the range (Wang et al. and Shi et al. with average age of 68 and 69, respectively; Supplementary Fig. B). The LoS estimates which included non-survivors tended to come from studies with older populations, as is to be expected given the well-documented, age-dependent fatality rate.

ICU length of stay

Median stay in ICU ranged from 5 (IQR 2–9) to 19 (no IQR reported) days. There appeared to be less of a difference according to discharge status (alive or dead) than there was for total LoS (Fig. 3). A total of 8 studies reported ICU LoS estimates, with the same number of studies reporting LoS estimates from China and outside of China, and the resulting overall estimates are very similar. There were too few studies to conduct any comparison by age or disease severity.

### A global map of travel time to access veterinarians [^ea45bd54]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In each subregion, we initialized the SPDE model by creating the mesh and assigning priors to the function used to capture the spatial autocorrelation of the outcome (i.e. counts of veterinary practices). First, we used subregions' shapefiles to define the mesh reticulate where to apply the SPDE algorithm. As suggested by Lindgren et al. we defined a regular mesh inside the whole study area where we sampled the outcome. Also, we defined a 2.5-decimal degree buffer zone outside the shapefile borders to capture spatial autocorrelation of the outcome present along borders while avoiding issues related to the edge effect. Then, we defined the mesh resolution of the study area (inner mesh), represented by the subregions, by setting a maximum length of the triangle vertices of 0.15 decimal degrees. In contrast, for the mesh in the buffer zone (outer mesh), we allowed for a maximum length of 10 decimal degrees since this area does not influence predictions' accuracy. We set the minimum length of triangle vertices of the inner mesh to 0.01 decimal degrees to cover every part of the study area. Then, we applied a Matérn covariance function to the mesh to capture the spatial autocorrelation of the outcome by specifying its hyperparameters. Since we lacked information about spatial dependence among veterinary practices, we assigned Penalized-Complexity priorsto the hyperparameters of the covariance function by setting a probability lower than 0.01 both for the range and its standard deviation of being higher, respectively, than 0.2 and 0.05 decimal degrees.

Red Blood Cell Aggregation

We calculated relative blood and plasma volume changes from hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements. 13 For red blood cell rheology measurements, sampled blood was anticoagulated using sodium heparin vacutainer. Measured red blood cell parameters (Sysmex Digitana KX‐21N, Sysmex, Switzerland) included red blood cell number, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and mean cellular hemoglobin concentration, a marker for intracellular viscosity. For red blood cell aggregation measurements, we adjusted hematocrit to 40% and fully oxygenated samples for 15 minutes with a Roller Mixer (Karl Hecht KG, Germany). We measured aggregation index (%) and shear rate balancing red blood cell aggregation and disaggregation (y at dIsc min [1/s]) using a laser‐assisted optical rotational cell analyzer (RR Mechatronics, Zwaag, The Netherlands). 14 We assessed red blood cell deformability by ektacytometry using the same device. 15 The samples were sheared in a Couette system at 9 consecutive shear stresses ranging from 0.3 and 50 Pa. We calculated the ratio of maximum deformability and shear stress required for one‐half of maximum deformability with lower values representing higher red blood cell deformability.

Recommendation strength and direction — criteria and wording: a strong recommendation requires no disagreement (voters are ≥ 70%), consensus at least very good (voters with ≥ 80% at one integer), and a median outside the 4–6 middle zone (in 7–9 or 1–3); the two classes are "Strong with" if median score is = 7–9 and "Strong against" if = 1–3. A conditional/weak recommendation requires no disagreement (voters are ≥ 70%) and either "good or some consensus" with any median or a median of 4–6 with any degree of consensus; direction is "Weak against" if the middle 50% interquartile range = 1 to less than or equal to 3 and "Weak with" if = 4–9. No recommendation applies with disagreement (voters are ≥ 70%), no consensus, or a median in the middle region (4–6) with any degree of consensus. Wording by consensus level maps as: "Perfect consensus — Strong — Recommend: must/to be/will" and "Very good consensus — Strong — Recommend: should be/can", while "Good consensus" and "Some consensus" correspond to "Weak/conditional — Suggest: to do" and "Weak/conditional — Suggest: may do", and "No consensus — No — No recommendation was made regarding".

Atrial septal defect three-dimensional echocardiography — measurement and morphology are specified as follows: Quantitative analysis of ASD using three-dimensional echocardiography should include the maximum length, width, and area measured at atrial end-diastole, and ASD dimensions should also be measured at atrial end-systole to determine dynamic changes. ASD shape can be defined as oval, round, triangular, egg- or pear-shaped, or slightly irregular, and orientation is defined by the long-axis as vertical, horizontal, oblique with an anterior tilt, or oblique with a posterior tilt; defects in which long- and short-axis dimensions are within 1 mm should be described as round. The initial echocardiographic assessment includes measurement of defect diameter in multiple orthogonal planes, the overall septal length, and defect rims, and if multiple defects are present, each should be characterized and the distance separating them measured.

Appendix 1: RAND rules for voting — Panel voting follows the RAND appropriateness method using a 9-point Likert Scale with Scale: 1–9, where 9 = extremely appropriate and 1 = extremely inappropriate, and three regions/zones: Inappropriate region: 1–3, Uncertain region: 4–6, and Appropriate region: 7–9. The Likert Scale is used for voting on Judgment about outcome importance (9 = critical; 1 = unimportant), Judgment about the transforming factors evidence-to-recommendation (EtR) or evidence-to-decision table, and Judgment about the overall appropriateness of draft recommendation (statement). From analysis of voting results the following is determined: Presence of disagreement/agreement, Degree of consensus, Direction of recommendation (with or against), and Strength of recommendation (weak or strong or No recommendation). Disagreement is defined by more than 30% of panelists have voted outside the three-point region containing the median, and the degree of consensus is driven from three factors: Presence or absence of disagreement, The median score, and The degree of dispersion of voters around the median (interquartile range and Integer needed to achieve majority percentage).

3.6.4 50

Analysis of CSA at 50 mL volume included data from three studies. The pooled median was 219.1 mm 2 (5th–95th percentile: 146.1–298.2 mm 2; 10th–90th percentile: 157.8–275.1 mm 2). Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (I 2 = 90.7%; Cochran's Q = 25.2, p < 0.001). Two of the three studies, fell outside the triangular 95% confidence region on the funnel plot, reflective of the high degree of heterogeneity in the studies (Figure S7 D).

3.6.5 60

Only one studyincluded data on CSA at 60 ml, with a reported median of 274.0 mm 2 (5th–95th percentile: 172.7–434.7 mm 2; 10th–90th percentile: 191.2–392.6 mm 2).

3.7 Maximum diameter

3.7.1 20

Data on maximum diameter measures at 20 mL distention volume were included from six studies,(Figure 5). The pooled median was 5.8 mm (5th–95th percentile: 3.8–8.8 mm; 10th–90th percentile: 4.2–8.0 mm; Figure S4). Notable heterogeneity was observed across studies (I 2 = 83.3%; Cochran's Q = 34.7, p < 0.001). The funnel plot appears asymmetric, with one study appearing as an outlier(Figure S8 A).

### Two-millimetre diameter operative arthroscopy of the ankle is safe and effective [^f6167f3d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Analysis

A Shapiro–Wilk test established the distribution of each set of distances between portal tracts and surrounding structures. In the case of normal distributions, mean distances and confidence intervals were reported. Otherwise, medians and interquartile ranges were presented. StataSE 15 was used for these analyses (StataCorp. 2017, College Station, Texas, USA). The pictures of the talar and tibial articular surfaces were uploaded into ImageJ graphic-analytic software (ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). In ImageJ, the line that was etched in the cartilage was traced. It was assumed that the articular surface anterior to this line was reached with the probe and that the surface posterior to this line was not reached. In ImageJ, the surface area that was reached was then calculated as a percentage of the entire articular surface area of either talus or tibia (see Fig. 3 for an example of the process in ImageJ). Percentages were rounded to the nearest integer. Finally, the average percentage surface area of the talar dome and the tibial plafond that could be reached was derived for the aggregate of specimens.

### Low atmospheric COlevels before the rise of forested ecosystems [^fa807534]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Atmospheric pCO 2 levels are derived from leaf carbon isotope fractionation (Δ leaf), Stomata Density (SD), and stomata pore length (p).

a Δ leaf is determined from the carbon isotope composition (δ 13 C) of the fossil flora (green), marine carbonates (blue) and calculated atmospheric CO 2 (light blue) (Supplementary Table 4). b Plants grown under higher ambient CO 2 levels yields a higher Δ leaf and/or lower stomata density. The curves represent gas-exchange model calibrated for modern lycophytes with a reference CO 2 assimilation rate at modern atmospheric levels (A 0) of 3.5 µmol m −2 s −1, an operational stomatal conductance efficiency (ratio of operational to maximal stomatal conductance) ζ = 0.2, stomata pore shape β = 0.6 and p = 18 ± 2 µm comparable to ancient and modern lycophytes (see supplement for details). Here, a fossil lycophyte from the Devonian is used as an example. Devonian lycophytes typically display Δ leaf values close to 20‰ and stomata densities between 15 and 25 mm −1 (Supplementary Data 1).

Fig. 2
Error propagation of the mechanistic pCO 2 proxy applied to Givetian Drepanophycus sp. from the Hamilton Group, NY, USA.

Probability distributions for model input parameters (Δ leaf, SD, p; upper row) are sampled (N = 10,000) to calculate model parameters (middle row: stomata area, a max, the maximal conductance at full daylight, g c, max, and ratio of CO 2 concentration in the substomatal cavities to atmospheric CO 2, c i /c a ;) and posterior probability distributions for the model output parameters (lower row: atmospheric CO 2, c a, CO 2 assimilation rate A n, and total conductance, g c, tot). Numerical solutions were obtained using Matlab's fsolve function (see details in supplementary information). The initial guess output parameters are marked with red triangles, and the results do not depend on the initial guess. The median values and errors represented by 1st and 3rd quartiles are reported above each panel for the calculated properties.

3 RESULTS

In the following sections, all reported values are medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). This choice was made based on the fact that distributions are often bounded and not Gaussian distributions. Captions of figures report results as (Q 2 [median]; Q 3 − Q 1 [IQR]), with a star (*) indicating if the distributions are significantly different. All explicit comparisons between groups are statistically significant using a Mann–Whitney rank nonparametric test for two independent samples (p < .01).

On average, experts produce " smaller " bundles than nonexperts, their volume, and streamline count being lower than nonexperts (−30% and − 60%), as it can be observed in Figure 6. This difference between groups is statistically significant (p < .01). The range of values for segmentation measures is wider for nonexperts, meaning that either intra‐rater or inter‐rater variability is likely higher. As mentioned earlier, this is useful insight about reproducibility but lacks nuance and context. For example, despite obvious variation in volume and somewhat poor spatial overlap in segmentations (as shown in Figures 7 and 8), the average FA measurement does not show large variation. The fact that segmentations with low spatial overlap have the same average FA shows that reporting this measurement to gain insight about reproducibility of bundle segmentation is far from optimal. Since bundles without any overlap could have the same average FA, this measure is very difficult to interpret in terms of reproducibility evaluation.

Figure 6
Measurements (Q 2; IQR) related to individual files for both groups. The Average FA distribution for experts (0.49; 0.01) and nonexperts (0.47;0.03) is not statistically different from each other. Similarly, the average length of experts (140.33 mm; 7.81 mm) and nonexperts (138.70 mm; 11.29 mm) cannot be distinguished. Streamlines count of experts (2,893; 3564*) has a significant difference of distribution from nonexperts (9,383; 12,368*). The same can be same from the volume distribution (34.00 cm 3; 16.43 cm 3 *) for experts and (48.74 cm 3; 24.57 cm 3 *) for nonexperts. The lower and higher fences for nonexperts are much wider, indicating more variation in results

### Grid-like entorhinal representation of an abstract value space during prospective decision making [^5ed26b49]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Furthermore, we performed exploratory analyses to investigate the relationship between the entorhinal grid system and the underlying value space. First, we wondered whether grid orientations would be anchored to a particular reference direction through the value space. We speculated that a direction of 45° constitutes a particularly informative reference direction because it indicates that values of both options change at the same rate and — given that it is parallel to the 45°-diagonal of the value space — that there will be no switch of the more valuable option. In line with this idea, participants' performance was higher for trajectories with directions approximately parallel to the 45°-diagonal in switch trajectories (Supplementary Fig. 2f; interaction effect direction and switch: F (2,86) = 7.18, p = 0.001; post-hoc test parallel vs. perpendicular in switch trajectories: t(43) = 2.90, p = 0.005, with α = 0.008, Bonferroni-corrected for 6 pairwise tests; all other pairwise comparisons n.s. p > 0.008). We thus examined whether grid orientations in the significant entorhinal cluster would cluster around 45°, which was indeed the case (Fig. 3f; V-Test for mean orientation of 45° across participants: p = 0.01; circular M ± SD: 48.18° ± 15.99°). Secondly, we wondered whether the grid-like representation of the value space might be modulated by value (i.e. reward magnitude) itself. Recent evidence in rodents demonstrated restructuring of grid cells in response to reward locations during spatial navigation, with movement of grid fields towards reward locations and higher firing rates for grid fields closer to reward locations. We, therefore, examined whether the magnitude of hexadirectional modulation differs between areas of the value space with relatively higher and lower values. To test this, we performed a median split of trajectories according to their mean value, i.e. contrasting trajectories in the lower left triangle of the space (low-value-area) with trajectories in the upper right triangle of the space (high-value-area). We note that this median split led to a substantial reduction of available trajectories per value condition and an unbalanced sampling of directions between the conditions, rendering this analysis less robust (Supplementary Fig. 4h; significant interaction between value condition and direction: F (35,1575) = 3.56, p < 0.001). Using the significant entorhinal cluster as ROI, we then repeated the cross-validated hexadirectional analysis separately for the two value conditions. The analysis suggested no difference in hexadirectional modulation between the two conditions (Supplementary Fig. 4i; t(45) = −1.30, p = 0.19). However, it is interesting to note that — contrary to our expectations based on the rodent literature — it suggested a hexadirectional modulation effect in low-value-areas but not in high-value-areas (Supplementary Fig. 4i; low-value: t(45) = 2.06, p = 0.02; high-value: t(45) = 0.30, p = 0.38; one-sided tests).

Left atrial (LA) volume — Two-dimensional LA images should be independently obtained and optimized; maximum volume at end-systole is identified, A4C and A2C endocardial borders are traced excluding atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length is measured in both views from the center of the mitral annulus to the inner edge of the furthest traced superior wall, the long-axis lengths should be within 5 mm of each other (otherwise the apical images should be reevaluated), and most systems calculate biplane volume using area-length and biplane disk summation where the shorter length is used for area-length and the longer length for method of disks, which is the preferred method, with laboratories advised to consistently use the same technique.

### A system for inducible mitochondria-specific protein degradation in vivo [^8006c26c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Image analysis

Images of mitochondrial GFP captured by widefield microscopy were processed to remove the background using the FAST deconvolution or Denoise.ai functions of NIS-elements imaging software (Nikon Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). All images were colorized in the Fiji software and shown as maximum-intensity Z-projections. The brightness and contrast values were set equally along all samples.

For quantification of fluorescent signals, yeast cell segmentation was performed by YeastSpotter. Cell quantification was performed in Fijion maximum intensity Z-projections. Cells that had an area less than 10 µm 2 or circularity less than 0.85 were excluded from the analysis. For mito-GFP/GFP-PDT and cyto-GFP/GFP-PDT expressing cells, the intensity was estimated using integrated density in the whole cell after background subtraction. To minimize experiment-to-experiment variability, the values were normalized to the median level displayed by cells expressing GFP only.

For nucleoid analysis after Syber Green I staining, the spots segmentation was performed in Fiji on maximum intensity Z-projections after computing Laplacian image using FeatureJ plugin. To exclude noise/debris and occasional weakly stained nucleus DNA, spots that displayed area less than 0.06 µm 2 or median integrated density less than 500 a.u. (arbitrary units) were excluded from the analysis. To adjust nucleoid number in occasional aggregates, we divided each spot integrated density by the median spot integrated density found on the image and rounded the result to the nearest integer above zero. To minimize experiment-to-experiment variability, values were normalized to the average level displayed by the wild-type cells (CB67). The outliers were excluded by IQR method. Statistical analysis was performed by Hierarch resampling Python-based module, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Graphical data presentation was done by GraphPad Prism 9.0.

### Location, location, location: what should be targeted beyond gross disease for localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma? Proposal of a standardized clinical tumor volume for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the head: the "Triangle volume" [^5ed3cd79]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (BRPC/LAPC), local failure rates after resection remain significant, even in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Suboptimal local control may relate to variable radiation target delineation, as no consensus exists around clinical tumor volume (CTV) design in this context. In the surgical literature, recent attention has been given to the "triangle" volume (TV) as a source of subclinical, residual disease. To understand whether the TV can inform optimal CTV design, we mapped locoregional failures after resection in a large cohort of patients with BRPC/LAPC and compared locations of failure to the TV.

Methods and Materials

Patients with BRPC/LAPC of the head or neck diagnosed between 2016 AND 2019 who developed locoregional failure after surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation were identified. Descriptive statistics were generated to report the frequency of locoregional failures located within the TV and the frequency of new vascular involvement at time of failure, compared with vascular involvement at diagnosis. Additionally, dosimetric coverage of the TV with the preoperative radiation plan that had been used was assessed.

Results

In 31 patients who experienced locoregional failure, the centroid of failure was located within the TV in 28 cases (90%). Extent of vascular involvement at time of locoregional failure included vasculature that had not been involved at diagnosis in 13 cases (42%). The preoperative radiation plan that had been used provided a median V33 Gy and V25 Gy of the TV of only 53% (interquartile range, 34%-72%) and 70% (IQR, 48%-85%), respectively.

Conclusions

The TV encompassed the vast majority of locoregional failures, but dosimetric coverage of the TV was poor when only targeting gross disease and the full circumference of involved vasculature. As such, the TV may better serve as a basis for CTV design in patients with BRPC/LAPC undergoing neoadjuvant radiation.

### Quantifying the impact of hospital catchment area definitions on hospital admissions forecasts: COVID-19 in england, September 2020-April 2021 [^ba8bb451]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

First, we compared the nearest and nearby heuristics. The characteristics of the nearby heuristic were very different for Trusts inside versus outside the London NHS region. In London, the distribution of weights was very homogeneous (median 0.037, IQR [0.037, 0.04]), each Trust had on average 38 UTLAs in its catchment area (IQR [38, 38]), and the median distance between Trusts and UTLAs was 14.4 km (IQR [13.4, 17.9]). This is because local authorities in London (boroughs) are small (all less than 10 km in diameter) and so the 40-km radius includes most other boroughs as well as other nearby local authorities. Outside of London, the distribution of weights was more heterogeneous, as was the median number of UTLAs per catchment area (median 7, IQR [3, 11]) and the median distance was higher (median 23.1 km, IQR [18.8, 29.5]). In comparison to the "nearby" heuristic, the nearest heuristic was very homogeneous and, by construction, constrained to a much smaller geographic area. The majority of Trusts (98/138) had a single UTLA in its catchment area (median 1, IQR [1, 2]). The median distance between Trusts and their nearest UTLA is very small (median 5.4 km and IQR [2.8, 14.7]; Additional file 1: Fig. S5A).

Table 2
The property covariance matrix

Lower triangle (white colored cells): Posterior median and 68th percentile range of property pair correlation coefficients at fixed weak-lensing mass. Upper triangle (light gray colored cells): Statistical significance (p -value) of the sign of the estimated property correlation, calculated as the cumulative posterior probability of having positive (negative) correlation values if the median is negative (positive). Diagonal (gray colored cells): Posterior median and 68th percentile range of the intrinsic scatter of each property at fixed weak-lensing mass

We first note the physically sensible result that the two independently measured properties reflecting a halo's stellar mass–total K-band luminosity, L K, tot, and optical richness λ – have a strong positive correlation. The probability of this value being negative is very small, 1.4%. Of these two measures, the quantity λ appears noisier, with median intrinsic scatter of 25% compared to only 9% for L K, tot, but this may also reflect the different measurement errors quoted for each property. The fractional statistical uncertainties in λ are a factor ~3 smaller than those in L K, tot. As we show in the Supplementary Fig. 2, bias and/or extra noise relative to the underlying halo population statistics will tend to dilute measured (anti-)correlations, and these effects can explain why some galaxy-hot gas property pairs yield weaker evidence of anti-correlation.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^09c333e5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management guideline — methods for evidence review and statement rating describe that two independent reviewers screened article abstracts and full texts, with comparative trials, systematic reviews, and qualitative articles evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, AMSTAR-2, and the AACODS Checklist for Grey Literature; draft statements were developed and a list of definitions for terms used in the statements was also developed. Panel ratings followed RAM with multiple rounds and a face-to-face meeting, and members rated each statement on a 1–9 scale using the literature review and clinical judgment; ratings were aggregated and analyzed by IRETA staff, and a two-day in-person Guideline Committee meeting took place in the D.C. area. Classification rules specified that a statement is deemed appropriate if the median rating is in the 7–9 range and no more than one-third of the experts rate outside that range; a statement is deemed inappropriate if the median rating is in the 1–3 range and no more than one-third of the committee rate outside this range; all other statements (those with a median rating of 4–6 or with at least one-third of the experts rating outside the median range) are labeled uncertain. After the meeting, one Guideline Committee member dropped out of participating and the Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry (IPRAS) method was used for the remainder of the project; the project expanded to ambulatory settings with an additional two Clinical Champions recruited, two rounds of ratings, a second meeting held remotely via webinar, and the project expansion started in August 2018 and returned to the original (although modified) timeline by May 2019. Within this framework, appropriateness refers to procedures where the health benefits sufficiently outweigh potential harms such that the procedure is worth doing.

### Long-term future risk of severe exacerbations: distinct 5-year trajectories of problematic asthma [^0579dba4]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

2.4 Identification of clinically distinct trajectories and comparisons between trajectories

A trajectory describes the change of a measured variable over time. To identify clinically distinct trajectories of severe exacerbation rates, we used the statistical method group‐based trajectory modeling, 14 which assumes that the population is composed of distinct groups, each with a different underlying trajectory of a variable measured repeatedly over time. It identifies trajectory shapes over time as well as subgroups of individuals with similar trajectories.

The Stata procedure Proc Traj was employed for this analysis. 15 The number of severe exacerbations was modeled as a zero‐inflated Poisson distribution or alternatively as a negative binomial distribution. Different models with varying number of groups and polynomial orders were compared to find the best‐fit model. The number of trajectories specified in the model was increased stepwise from 2 to 5, and the best‐fitting number of trajectories was selected using Bayesian information criterion (BIC). After identifying the number of trajectories, different shapes for trajectories (intercept‐only, linear, quadratic, cubic) were tested. Patients were classified according to a specific trajectory on the basis of the maximum estimated probability of assignment. A probability of 0.9 or higher was considered an excellent fit, whereas a value of less than 0.7 was considered a poor fit. 15

2.5 Derivation of the clinical risk score

To derive the clinical risk score, we used a univariate‐based method. 16 Baseline variables found to be significantly different in the most unfavorable trajectory compared to the other trajectories were selected for inclusion in the clinical risk score. Each variable was converted into a categorical variable, using cutoffs that were determined based on mean or median values of the different trajectory groups.

Each component of the risk score was then allocated a weight by first entering all the components into a multivariate logistic regression model predicting the probability of following the most unfavorable trajectory and then rounding up the regression coefficients to the nearest integers. The predictive accuracy of the final clinical risk score was expressed as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

2.6 Validation of the trajectories and clinical risk score

External validation of the derived trajectories and clinical risk score was performed on an independent cohort presenting in 2012 and 2013, using severe exacerbation data spanning three years.

### Surface area outcomes in EUS-guided liver biopsy: a comparative study of franseen and fork-tip needles [^f09ac431]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Histological analysis focused on the hepatic tissue surface area and portal tract counts. The Franseen-tip group had a total hepatic tissue surface area with median 22.0 mm² (IQR: 14.7–32.9 mm²), while the Fork-tip group had a median of 22.6 mm² (IQR: 11.3–26.5 mm²). The maximum tissue sample obtained per pass was 14.8 mm² (IQR: 9.2–19.9 mm²) for the Franseen-tip and 11.1 mm² (IQR: 7.28–14.8 mm²) for the Fork-tip, representing each needle's optimal tissue acquisition capability in a single pass. The total portal tract (PT) counts were 30 (IQR: 19–32) for the Franseen-tip and 20 (IQR: 15–25) for the Fork-tip group, with the maximum number of PTs per pass being 16 (IQR: 14–23) for the Franseen-tip and 13 (IQR: 10–17) for the Fork-tip group. No significant differences were found in the total and maximum tissue surface areas (P = 0.45, P = 0.23) or in the PT counts (P = 0.16, P = 0.15) between the two groups (Fig. 3). While there was an apparent difference in the proportion of acute hepatitis cases between groups (0% vs. 25%), this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.15). Importantly, the diagnosis of acute hepatitis was based not only on histological findings but also on clinical presentation, timing of liver injury onset, and laboratory data.

Round 1 voting — sleep-hour categories, domains, and rating scale: Panel members voted to indicate agreement with the statement about optimal health by age group, using predefined sleep-hour bins and a 9-point Likert scale, and medians were categorized into disagreement, uncertainty, or agreement; votes were submitted independently and compiled with distributions shared at the conference across eight specified health domains. Hours of sleep were categorized as: < 6 hours, 6 to < 7 hours, 7 to < 8 hours, 8 to < 9 hours, 9 to < 10 hours, 10 to < 11 hours, 11 to < 12 hours, 12 to < 13 hours, 13 to < 14 hours, 14 to < 15 hours, 15 to < 16 hours, 16 to < 17 hours, 17 to < 18 hours, ≥ 18 hours. The panel members voted using a 9-point Likert scale, where 1 meant "strongly disagree", 9 meant "strongly agree", and 5 meant "neither disagree nor agree", and panel median values were placed into three broader categories: 1–3 indicated disagreement, 4–6 indicated uncertainty, and 7–9 indicated agreement. Panel members were instructed not to discuss the evidence or their votes with each other to ensure independence, and votes were collected by email, compiled to determine median and distribution, and displayed anonymously to members; Round 1 voting spanned eight domains: cardiovascular health, developmental health, human performance, general health, immunology, longevity, mental health and metabolic health.

Mean density of the experimental data (red horizontal line) is on the lower end of the densities obtained from simulations even for low repulsion, indicating a small value for the parameter f s. For each parameter choice box plots are obtained from n = 100 simulations, with mean and median values denoted respectively by the plot markers and horizontal dashed lines (orange). The boxes are drawn from the first quartile Q 1 to the third quartile Q 3, and whiskers indicate 1.5 interquartile range (IQR ≡ Q 3− Q 1), i.e. max = Q 3 + 1.5 IQR, min = Q 1 − 1.5 IQR.

### Relationship between ventral hernia defect area and intra-abdominal pressure: dynamic in vivo measurement [^a844db0b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It is an acceptable concept that the ventral hernia defect area will increase with a rise in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). The literature lacks the evidence about how much this increase is in vivo. The aim of this study was to objectively measure the change in the ventral hernia defect area with increasing intra-abdominal pressure.

Methods

In a prospective study of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, the area of hernia defect was measured from inside the abdomen using a sterile paper ruler. The horizontal (width) and vertical (length) measurements of the defect were taken at two pressure points: (IAP = 8 mmHg) and (IAP = 15 mmHg). The hernia defect area was calculated as an oval shape using a standard formula.

Results

Eighteen consecutive patients with a ventral hernia were included in this study (8 males: 10 females). Median age was 60 years (30–81), body mass index (BMI) was 29.9 (22.6–37.6). Changing the IAP significantly, (P < 0.001) changed the values of horizontal and vertical measurements, and the calculated area of the ventral hernia defect. The median calculated defect area, as an oval shape, was 5.6 cm(2) (Q1-Q3 = 3.5–15.5) and 6.9 cm(2) (Q1-Q3 = 4.5–18.7) at 8 and 15 mmHg IAP, respectively. The calculated area of mesh required to cover the defect with a 5 cm overlap increased by a median of 5% (Q1-Q3 = 3–6%). The change in defect area did not differ significantly between obese and non-obese patients (P = 0.5).

Conclusions

Dynamic, rather than static, measurements of ventral hernia area during laparoscopy provide a simple way of in vivo objective measurement that helps the surgeon choose the appropriate area of mesh. When choosing mesh area, we support the trend toward a larger overlap of at least 5 cm if less precise methods of measuring defect area are been used.

(right) Spatial embedding of individual modules. The locations of the electrodes are shown with each electrode colored according to the community it was assigned to. b Modularity index across all MEAs. Across all MEAs the modularity of the real networks is significantly larger than for degree-matched random networks. c The stationarity across all MEAs is significantly larger than for degree-matched random networks. d The persistence across all MEAs is significantly larger than for degree-matched random networks. e Illustration of module spatial extent. The module diameter is estimated as 2 R g, where R g is the radius of gyration for a set of equal masses. f Illustration of module compactness. The module compactness is the number of nodes from a module that are within the module's convex hull divided by the total number of nodes within the hull. g Module spatial extent across all MEAs. The module diameter is consistent across all MEAs (1.31 ± 0.24 mm). For reference, the average module diameter for degree-matched random networks is closer to the size of the entire MEA (≈ 2–3 mm). h The mean compactness is near 1 and significantly larger than for degree-matched random networks, indicating that the modules are mostly contiguous in space. For all box-plots the whiskers cover points within 1.5 IQR (inter-quartile range) of the first or third quartile; values outside of this range are considered outliers and are represented by individual circles. The notches (triangles) are placed at the median, where n is the number of MEAs.

### Comprehensive assessment of a hotspot with persistent bancroftian filariasis in coastal Sri Lanka [^75a51c32]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Spatial distribution of filarial infections in humans and mosquitoes.

Figure 4 shows locations of HHs with one or more residents that tested positive for CFA and Mf and of mosquito trap sites that yielded pools that were positive for filarial DNA. Circulating filarial antigenemia and Mf were detected in residents of 15 of 140 (11%) and in six of 140 (4%) houses surveyed along the length of the PHI; filarial DNA was detected in mosquitoes collected in 49 of 50 traps placed in the study area.

Figure 4.
Distribution of households (HHs) and mosquito collection sites tested for filarial infection in the Balapitiya Public Health Inspector area. Blue and green triangles indicate HHs where at least one resident had a positive filarial antigen test or microfilaremia, respectively. Households with no positive filarial antigen test are shown in open black triangles. Trap locations with one or more mosquito pools positive for filarial DNA are shown with red circles. Filarial DNA was detected in mosquitoes from 49 of 50 trap sites. Thus, filarial infection was widespread in the study area at the time of the survey. This figure appears in color at.

The median distance from CFA-positive HHs (N = 15) to the closest positive mosquito trap was 88.9 meters (range 28–397 m), and the median distance from CFA-negative HHs (N = 124) to the closest positive trap was 128 m (range 8–401 m). This difference is not statistically significant (Wilcoxon rank sum test [P = 0.4]). It is possible that the number of positive houses in the study was too small to detect a spatial relationship between human infections and positive mosquito-trapping locations. However, prior studies by our group and others have also failed to document this type of spatial relationship even when infection rates were higher.– This suggests that Culex mosquitoes range widely in Sri Lanka during the interval between blood meals and oviposition. It is also possible that a significant amount of mosquito feeding occurs outside of the home environment.

### Identifying the index lesion with template prostate mapping biopsies [^ad857e05]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The natural history of prostate cancer might be driven by the index lesion. We determined the percent of men in whom the index lesion could be defined using transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies.

Materials and Methods

Included in study were consecutive men undergoing transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies with biopsies grouped into 20 zones. Men with clinically significant disease in only 1 prostate area were considered to have an identifiable index lesion. We evaluated the impact of using 2 definitions of clinically significant disease (Gleason grade pattern 4 and/or lesion volume 0.5 cc or greater) and 2 clustering rules (stringent and tolerant) to define the index lesion.

Results

Included in study were 391 men with a median age of 62 years (IQR 58–67) and a median prostate specific antigen of 6.9 ng/ml (IQR 4.8–10.0). Of the men 269 (69%) were previously diagnosed with prostate cancer. By deploying a median of 1.2 cores per mL (IQR 0.9–1.7) cancer was diagnosed in 82.9% of the men (324 of 391) with a median of 6 positive cores (IQR 2–9), a median maximum cancer core length of 5 mm (IQR 3–8) and a total cancer core length per zone of 7 mm (IQR 3–13). Insignificant disease was found in 26.3% to 42.9% of cases. When a stringent spatial relationship was used to define individual lesions, 44.4% to 54.6% of patients had 1 index lesion and 12.7% to 19.1% had more than 1 area with clinically significant disease. These proportions changed to 46.6% to 59.2% and 10.5% to 14.5%, respectively, when less stringent spatial clustering was applied.

Conclusions

Transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies enable the index lesion to be localized in most men with clinically significant disease. This information may be important to select appropriate candidates for targeted therapy and to plan a tailored treatment strategy in men undergoing radical therapy.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^79b1194c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

AAA rupture risk and size thresholds — Historically, rupture risk was 0.5% to 5% for aneurysms < 5 cm, 3% to 15% for 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥ 30% for ≥ 8 cm. Trials did not find a survival benefit for repair of aortic aneurysms measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm, and based on these data a threshold of ≥ 5.5 cm is acceptable for men with infrarenal AAA. The mean maximum aneurysm diameter at rupture was 5.0 cm in women and 6.0 cm in men. Indexing aneurysm size to body surface area using aneurysm size index (ASI equals aneurysm diameter [cm]/BSA [m²]) has in women been shown to be more predictive of rupture risk than maximum diameter.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive pediatric transthoracic echocardiogram: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^8ec10f9f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography — area and length-based LV measurements include end-diastolic area (EDA) obtained in 2DE: parasternal short-axis or subcostal sagittal (short-axis) view at maximum area at end-diastole for LV size; EDA is used for LV volume and mass calculation and is appropriate for abnormal LV shape but depends on good blood-endocardium border. End-systolic area (ESA) uses minimum area at end-systole and is used for LV volume calculation and is appropriate for abnormal LV shape. End-diastolic length (EDL) uses 2DE: apical four-chamber or subcostal coronal (long-axis) view and is measured just after MV closure at end-diastole; it is used for LV volume and mass calculation and is appropriate for abnormal LV shape, but depends on good blood-endocardium border, especially at apex, and foreshortening can limit accuracy.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^6a46fa06]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views", with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line", and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour". Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

After receiving the final data, RTI extracted all establishments from the DMI file where food processing, animal feed processing, pet food processing, and food additive production NAICS codes matched with at least one of the NAICS codes on. industry NAICS codes used in this study. To avoid double- counting in the data summaries, each establishment was assigned to only one NAICS code based on the importance of the assigned NAICS code in the establishment's business.

Because an establishment can have up to six NAICS codes, we assumed they appear in the DMI file in descending order of. employees. It is important to note that employment is just one of many ways to define the size of the establishment. For capital-intensive industries, another important dimension of establishment size is capital. However, employment is the only.

### Kinetic trapping organizes actin filaments within liquid-like protein droplets [^66702c1b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We also studied the role of actin addition through actin nucleation (Supplementary Fig. 6A). We simulated the effect of linear nucleator concentration whose kinetic parameters are similar to Arp2/3. Please refer to Supplementary Table 4 for a detailed description of the model parameters used. The total actin concentration is fixed and the growth rate is proportional to the amount of unpolymerized actin. Enhanced nucleation (Supplementary Fig. 6B) at high nucleator concentration reduces median filament length (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Further, we see that the network is made of a population of short and long filaments. The wider distribution of filament lengths leads to a well-bundled network with most of VASP tetramers bound to 3+ filaments (Supplementary Fig. 6D). While the concentration of the nucleator is less than 50 nM, we see an increase in actin-covered surface area (Supplementary Fig. 6E) suggesting that the droplet periphery acts as the zone of VASP-mediated bundling consistent with representative images shown in Supplementary Fig. 6A and the radial density profile shown in Supplementary Fig. 6F. When the nucleator concentration exceeds 50 nM, we see that the maximum filament length drops below(Supplementary Fig. 6C). Thus, we find that VASP-mediated bundling of these networks results in enhanced actin concentration at the droplet core (Supplementary Fig. 6A, F).

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

Left atrial and right atrial size measurement — pediatric echocardiography methods are illustrated and described: apical 4‑chamber and 2‑chamber views at ventricular end‑systole show left atrial major‑axis length and planimetered areas, and "Planimetered RA areas or RA volumes calculated from the product of RA area and major-axis length may be better at assessing RA size, though the sample sizes in most studies have been small". It also states that "As with LA volumes, 3D echocardiography may provide a useful means by which to measure RA volumes using the polyhedral surface algorithm". Additionally, "Raw values and indexed values on the basis of BSA in normal adults are available".

### Mesocolic lymph node number, size, and density: an anatomical study [^e81742ec]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Lymph nodes play a critical role in the staging, treatment, and prognosis of colon cancer. However, the normal number and morphology of lymph nodes in the normal mesocolon is unknown.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate the number and size of lymph nodes in the ascending and sigmoid mesocolons.

Design

This is a descriptive anatomical cadaver study of 10 sigmoid mesocolons and 5 ascending mesocolons, resected in a standardized manner and examined systematically after serial histological sectioning. The number, maximum length, and appearance of lymph nodes were analyzed, and the 2 mesocolons were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the χ test.

Patients

Ten cadavers (mean age, 82.9 years; 5 male) with no evidence of colorectal disease were examined.

Main Outcome Measure

The number, maximum length, and appearance of lymph nodes and fat-associated lymphoid clusters were the primary outcomes measured.

Results

The median number of lymph nodes in the sigmoid and ascending mesocolons was 71 (range, 24–116) and 61 (range, 33–71). More than 90% of lymph nodes were less than 5 mm in maximum length. Sigmoid mesocolic nodes were significantly smaller than ascending mesocolic nodes (median maximum lymph nodes length, 1.6 mm vs 2.1 mm; p < 0.001), but there was no statistically significant difference in the density of lymph nodes between the sigmoid and ascending mesocolon. Fatty replacement was seen in almost 30% of lymph nodes. A few fat-associated lymphoid clusters were observed in both mesocolons.

Limitations

Only 15 mesocolic specimens could be examined because of the detailed labor-intensive methodology, and younger cadavers were not available for analysis.

Conclusions

In this descriptive anatomical study, the median number of lymph nodes in the sigmoid and ascending mesocolon was 71 and 61. Ascending mesocolic nodes were significantly larger than sigmoid mesocolic nodes. These anatomical findings are relevant to the interpretation of lymph node yields after the surgical resection of colon cancer.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Mitral and tricuspid annuli — measurement guidance and recommendations — Acquisition guidance states that "The largest diameters during peak filling in early diastole should be measured at the frame after maximum excursion of the leaflets from inner edge to inner edge at the hinge points of the leaflet attachments". The document notes that "it is unreliable in the setting of congenital MV stenosis", and that "Compared with 3D planimetric assessment in patients with mitral stenosis, 2D planimetry overestimates MV area by as much as 88%, depending on valve geometry (domed vs funnel shape) and the position of the transducer relative to the valve orifice". Recommendations specify: "The recommended methods to assess MV and TV annular size include measurement of lateral diameters in apical 4-chamber views and anteroposterior diameters in parasternal long-axis views and calculation of areas using the area formula for an ellipse".

### Statistical considerations of nonrandom treatment applications reveal region-wide benefits of widespread post-fire restoration action [^5219d8f1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

Sources of selection bias in restoration treatments

In the dataset of randomly selected burned sagebrush habitat locations, treated and untreated sites systematically differed in their biophysical properties, indicating substantial potential for selection bias in the assessment of restoration treatment effects using observational datasets, such as RCMAP and LTDL (Fig. 2A, B, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). Within ecoregions where restoration on BLM land commonly occurred, managers tended to conduct post-fire seedings in areas that had low-to-moderate amounts of sagebrush before fire (treatment probability maximized at 12.5% cover; Fig. 3A) and in areas with less surviving, post-fire sagebrush cover (Fig. 3B). Burned sites with greater than 13.3% surviving sagebrush cover had less than a 50% chance of receiving treatment. The probability of burned BLM lands receiving seeding was also greatest in areas with relatively dry, warm springs, compared to the broader climatic range of sagebrush ecosystems (maximized where mean November-April total precipitation was 459 mm and mean spring temperature was 6.01 °C; Fig. 3C, D, respectively). Areas with mean spring temperatures less than 0.60 °C were more likely to remain untreated than receive seeding. Probability of receiving treatment also increased at sites with soils containing a greater proportion of fine clay particles (Fig. 3F).

Clustering results

PAM clustering revealed the optimal number of two clusters based on the highest average silhouette coefficient (width = 0.44) with high stability (mean Jaccard index of 0.94 for cluster 1 and 0.89 for cluster 2).

Composition analysis of the clusters reveals different patterns of the clusters. Thus, showed cluster 1 (n = 233, 67%) a significantly higher proportion of patients with high sphericity and elongation compared to cluster 2 (n = 115, 33%) (p -value < 0.001 each). On the other hand, cluster 2 showed a significantly higher proportion of patients with high maximum 3D diameter, surface area, minor axis length, major axis length, and least axis length (p -value < 0.001 each). There was no significant difference between the clusters in surface volume ratio and flatness Fig. 2.

Percentages of high imaging parameters within the two clusters in the training dataset (n = 348). Cluster 1 (n = 233) shows a significantly higher proportion of patients with high sphericity and elongation compared to cluster 2 (n = 115). On the other hand, cluster 2 showed a significantly higher proportion of patients with high maximum 3D diameter, surface area, minor axis length, major axis length, and least axis length (p -value < 0.001 each)

Both clusters exhibited a notable contrast in OS, with cluster 1 demonstrating a median OS of 18.8 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 16.3–20.6) and cluster 2 showing a median OS of 11.7 months (95% CI: 9.4–13.2) in the training dataset (log-rank test p < 0.001). This trend persisted in the test dataset, with cluster 1 displaying a median OS of 23.8 months (95% CI: 19.4–43.7) compared to 11.4 months (95% CI: 8.6–25.2) for cluster 2 (log-rank test p = 0.002). Similarly, in the UCSF dataset, cluster 1 exhibited a median OS of 20.1 months (95% CI: 16.4–21.7) while cluster 2 showed a median OS of 13.7 months (95% CI: 10.4–19.3) (log-rank test p = 0.001) (Fig. 3).

### Functional lumen imaging probe for the management of esophageal disorders: expert review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^01ac8e90]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) analysis — distensibility and topography metrics: The distensibility index (DI) is the typical measure of sphincter distensibility calculated by dividing the median narrowest cross-sectional area (CSA) within the anatomic zone of interest by the median intrabag pressure over a set timeframe or distention volume. FLIP diameter data can be rendered as a topography plot using interpolation and a color scale, which enables assessment of esophagogastric junction (EGJ) distensibility and simultaneous characterization of motor activity in the esophageal body, including achalasia patterns categorized into 3 distinct body patterns of repetitive antegrade contractions, repetitive retrograde contractions, or absence of activity. In eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the distensibility plateau is the primary metric, derived by plotting the narrowest CSA across the esophageal body as a function of pressure; it has been shown to be substantially different between asymptomatic control subjects and EoE patients both with and without stricture, and a comparative study suggests the maximal diameter approach may be the most accurate. There are limitations in current analysis techniques because most require postacquisition processing.

Latent tuberculosis infection — dosages for recommended regimens: For isoniazid and rifapentine for 3 mos, adults and children aged ≥ 12 yrs receive isoniazid 15 mg/kg rounded up to the nearest 50 or 100 mg; 900 mg maximum with rifapentine weight bands 10–14.0 kg, 300 mg; 14.1–25.0 kg, 450 mg; 25.1–32.0 kg, 600 mg; 32.1–49.9 kg, 750 mg; ≥ 50.0 kg, 900 mg maximum, and children aged 2–11 yrs receive isoniazid 25 mg/kg; 900 mg maximum with rifapentine as above, given once weekly for 12 total doses. For rifampin for 4 mos, adults take 10 mg/kg and children 15–20 mg/kg with maximum dose 600 mg, taken daily for 120 total doses. For 3 mos of isoniazid and rifampin, adults take isoniazid 5 mg/kg (300 mg maximum) plus rifampin 10 mg/kg (600 mg maximum), and children take isoniazid 10–20 mg/kg (300 mg maximum) plus rifampin 15–20 mg/kg (600 mg maximum), taken daily for 90 total doses. For isoniazid monotherapy, 6 mos daily uses adult 5 mg/kg and children 10–20 mg/kg with maximum dose 900 mg for 180 total doses; the twice weekly regimen uses adult 15 mg/kg and children 20–40 mg/kg with maximum dose 900 mg for 52 total doses and must be provided via directly observed therapy. For isoniazid 9 mos, daily adult 5 mg/kg and children 10–20 mg/kg with maximum dose 900 mg are given for 270 total doses, and twice weekly uses adult 15 mg/kg and children 20–40 mg/kg with maximum dose 900 mg for 76 total doses and must be provided via directly observed therapy.

### When is the vestibular aqueduct enlarged? A statistical analysis of the normative distribution of vestibular aqueduct size [^fcf54e83]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The size of vestibular aqueducts (VAs) seen on CT studies varies. The current practice of calling a VA enlarged when it exceeds a certain threshold (eg, 1.5 mm at the midpoint) is arbitrary. Our hypothesis was that statistical analysis of the range of VA widths in a normal-hearing population would lead to a mathematic definition of the upper-limit-of-normal VA width.

Materials and Methods

The VA midpoint and opercular widths were measured in 73 children with normal hearing. Statistical analysis yielded values of the 99 th, 97.5th, 95th, 90th, 75th, and 50th percentiles for this normal distribution.

Results

The upper-limit-of-normal (95th percentile) values for the VA midpoint and opercular widths were 0.9 and 1.9 mm, respectively. The VAs with greater widths may reasonably be considered enlarged.

Conclusion

The VAs with midpoint or opercular widths of 1.0 and 2.0 mm or greater, respectively, are enlarged.

### Microstructural parameter estimation in vivo using diffusion MRI and structured prior information [^8d3a55fa]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Figure 3 shows histograms of sampled axon radii from the synthetic data. At the low end of the scale, precision is too poor to distinguish radii of 1 and 3 μm (H = 0.84, using bins of width 0.25 μm); and at the high end, the influence of the prior forces underestimation of very large radii of above 15 μm. However, radii of 3, 5, 10, and 15 μm are clearly discriminable, with sample medians closely approximating the true, generative radius in each of these cases (H = 0.41 between 3 and 5 μm; H = 0.12 between 5 and 10 μm; H = 0.44 between 10 and 15 μm). When the synthetic substrate contains a gamma distribution of radii, as shown in the bottom part of the figure, there is a bias in the posterior distributions, but it remains possible to distinguish larger radii from smaller ones. Figure 4 demonstrates that much greater precision is available at 3 μm when gradient strengths increase to 300 mT m, but it improves still further when prior information is used.

Figure 3
Histograms of sampled posterior axon radius values from our synthetic data, using a single fixed cylinder radius (top) or a gamma distribution of radii (bottom). For the former, samples cover ten axon orientations at each radius. For the latter, the generative distributions (shown) have means of 3, 5, and 8 μm, and variances of 2.5 μm.

Figure 4

In each case, samples are shown from fits performed both with (blue) and without (red) applying the gamma prior distribution on R. The true generative axon radius was 3 μm, and samples cover ten axon orientations. Only samples below 8 μm are shown. Note that the y ‐axis in the upper plot is broken to accommodate a very tall bar.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^d070e387]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — minimum diagnostic evaluation: The clinician should engage in a diagnostic process to document the signs and symptoms that characterize Peyronie's disease, with the minimum requirements being a careful history to assess penile deformity, interference with intercourse, penile pain, and/or distress, and a physical exam of the genitalia to assess for palpable abnormalities of the penis. Assessment of sexual function is of particular importance and penile sensation, ejaculatory function, erectile function, difficulty/pain with penile penetration, and concerns regarding penile length and girth should be assessed; the goal of the examination is to provide baseline values that document the presence of deformity, the point of maximum curvature, presence/location/size of penile plaque(s), penile length, and areas of tenderness. For patients and/or partners with significant distress, consideration should be given for referral to a mental health professional with expertise in sexuality.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic evaluation of pulmonic regurgitation severity is challenged by limited data and visualization difficulty, with assessment incorporating standard color Doppler descriptors. The guideline notes, "There is a paucity of data regarding the quantification of PR. This stems partly from the difficulty in visualizing PR, the fact that minor degrees of PR are common and have no clinical impact, and the low incidence of clinically significant PR in the adult", and explains that "Most of the concepts for quantifying AR are applied to PR. The various parameters used and their advantages and limitations are listed in Table 15". For color flow imaging, "Color Doppler assessment of PR severity includes proximal jet width, color jet area, and jet length (Figure 32)".

"Vessel tortuosity can be determined by comparing the linear distance between two points on a vessel with the actual 3D path length", with this "distance metric" increased in pulmonary arterial hypertension and "correlated with mean PA pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and arterial and venous oxygen content and saturation". For fractal analysis, "the number of vessel-containing cubes is related to cube size on a double logarithmic plot; fractal dimension is the slope of the linear portion of the plot", or it "can be estimated from CT or MRI perfusion scans by calculating the relative dispersion (standard deviation/ mean)… and evaluating the slope of the relationship between log relative dispersion versus log number of voxels averaged".

Difficult airway — consensus-based evidence and survey scoring indicates validation by consensus from survey opinion from expert consultants, survey opinions from randomly selected samples of active members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and participating organizations, and internet commentary, with only findings from formal surveys reported. Survey responses were recorded using a five-point scale and summarized based on median values, with categories defined as: strongly agree median score of 5 (at least 50% of the responses are 5), agree median score of 4 (at least 50% of the responses are 4 or 4 and 5), equivocal median score of 3 (at least 50% of the responses are 3, or no other response category or combination of similar categories contains at least 50% of the responses), disagree median score of 2 (at least 50% of responses are 2 or 1 and 2), and strongly disagree median score of 1 (at least 50% of responses are 1). When an equal number of categorically distinct responses are obtained, the median value is determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the two middle values, and ties are calculated by a predetermined formula.

### Midterm to long-term longitudinal outcome of autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee joint: a multilevel analysis [^7efffdf0]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a cell therapeutic approach for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects in the knee joint. The authors previously reported on the histologic and radiologic outcome of autologous chondrocyte implantation in the short- to midterm, which yields mixed results.

Purpose

The objective is to report on the clinical outcome of autologous chondrocyte implantation for the knee in the midterm to long term.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Eighty patients who had undergone autologous chondrocyte implantation of the knee with mid- to long-term follow-up were analyzed. The mean patient age was 34.6 years (standard deviation, 9.1 years), with 63 men and 17 women. Seventy-one patients presented with a focal chondral defect, with a median defect area of 4.1 cm(2) and a maximum defect area of 20 cm(2). The modified Lysholm score was used as a self-reporting clinical outcome measure to determine the following: (1) What is the typical pattern over time of clinical outcome after autologous chondrocyte implantation; and (2) Which patient-related predictors for the clinical outcome pattern can be used to improve patient selection for autologous chondrocyte implantation?

Results

The average follow-up time was 5 years (range, 2.7–9.3). Improvement in clinical outcome was found in 65 patients (81%), while 15 patients (19%) showed a decline in outcome. The median preoperative Lysholm score of 54 increased to a median of 78 points. The most rapid improvement in Lysholm score was over the 15-month period after operation, after which the Lysholm score remained constant for up to 9 years. The authors were unable to identify any patient-specific factors (ie, age, gender, defect size, defect location, number of previous operations, preoperative Lysholm score) that could predict the change in clinical outcome in the first 15 months.

Conclusion

Autologous chondrocyte implantation seems to provide a durable clinical outcome in those patients demonstrating success at 15 months after operation. Comparisons between other outcome measures of autologous chondrocyte implantation should be focused on the clinical status at 15 months after surgery. The patient-reported clinical outcome at 15 months is a major predictor of the mid- to long-term success of autologous chondrocyte implantation.

### Submental intubation: clinical anatomy and video technical note [^e67f8f5b]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Clinical Anatomy

The anatomical basis of the submental intubation procedure concerns submental and retro‐symphyseal regions. The submental triangle, also referred to as the suprahyoid triangle, is defined as a sub‐region of the anterior cervical area. It is, with the submandibular triangle, the carotid triangle, and the muscular triangle, one of the four triangles forming the anterior triangle of the neck, which contains some important vascular structures. The submental triangle is a median suprahyoid area lying inferior to the chin. It is inferiorly limited by the body of the hyoid bone and laterally by the right and left anterior bellies of the digastric muscles. The digastric anterior bellies taper superiorly and forward towards the apex of the triangle. The apex of the submental triangle is located at the lower extremity of the mandibular symphysis. The hyoid bone forms the bas e of the triangle, while the roof is composed of the two mylohyoid muscles, joining in a median fibrous raphe.

Although the submental triangle is a superficial region, it houses some important structures such as:
Mylohyoid nerve
Lingual nerve
Submental lymph nodes
Small veins that drain into the anterior jugular vein
Submental branches of the facial artery
Submental branches of the facial vein

If surgeons ensure strict adherence to the median approach, the risk of injury is minimal. Mylohyoid muscles constitute the mouth floor's inferior limit. The mouth floor is limited forward and laterally by the inner part of the mandible, from the symphyseal to the retromolar regions. The upper part of the mouth floor is composed of oral mucosa and the base of the tongue. The anterior part of the mouth floor is devoid of significant structures, except for the orifices of submandibular and sublingual canals, on either side of the lingual frenulum.

### Graft inflow stenosis induced by the inflatable ring fixation mechanism of the ovation stent-graft system: hemodynamic and clinical implications [^ee3fb79b]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the observed inflow stenosis at the O-rings of the Ovation stent-graft and evaluate its hemodynamic and clinical impact.

Methods

The study involved 49 consecutive patients (48 men; mean age 71.2 ± 7.7 years) treated successfully with the Ovation abdominal aortic stent-graft between June 2011 and January 2014 at a single center. Cross-sectional area and radius measurements of the infrarenal aorta just proximal to the sealing mechanism, as well at the site of stenosis, were measured from 3D reconstructions of the 1-month postoperative computed tomographic angiograms. Based on Poiseuille's law, the predicted pressure drop was calculated for each patient based on the length of the stenosis. Invasive blood pressure measurements at 3 levels (proximal to the inflatable rings, halfway inside the stenosis, and distal to the stenosis) were obtained in 10 patients intraoperatively. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) values preoperatively were compared to those after the procedure for all patients to assess the clinical impact of this phenomenon.

Results

Median internal cross-sectional area at the site of the stenosis was significantly reduced compared to the area just proximal to the O-rings [57% reduction: 123 mm(2) (range 28–254) vs. 283 mm(2) (range 177–531), respectively; p < 0.001]. The same was observed for the radius [6.5 mm (range 3–9) vs. 9.5 mm (range 7.5–13), respectively; p < 0.001]. Based on the median 15 mm length of the stenosis (range 13–17) observed in the study population, a median pressure drop of 0.13 mmHg (range 0–0.25) along the stenosis was calculated. Invasive blood pressure measurements indicated a non-significant pressure change along the stenosis (e.g., 0.7 mmHg between the proximal level and halfway inside the stenosis). ABI remained practically unchanged postoperatively.

Conclusion

The advantages of the Ovation device's unique sealing mechanism come at the expense of a median area inflow stenosis of ∼ 60%. This stenosis does not cause a hemodynamically significant pressure drop. Future modification of the graft ring design may be needed in order to reduce this stenosis.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation imaging — significant secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) in dilated cardiomyopathy is shown with marked tenting of the mitral valve (MV) and parasternal short-axis color Doppler demonstrating regurgitation along the entire length of valve coaptation. Pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler at the tips of the MV leaflets shows high E velocity, and continuous-wave (CW) Doppler has a triangular spectral shape in significant MR. Proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) from apical three- and two- (commissural) chamber views shows nonhemispheric flow convergence and a noncircular vena contracta (VC), and the legend cautions that assumption of a hemispheric flow convergence or circular VC would underestimate MR.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### Quantitative lung morphology: semi-automated measurement of mean linear intercept [^fce1ecb8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Optimization of number of chords to sample to accurately estimate MLI actual

Application of the method yielded a data set of 118,716 chords measured across the computer-generated images of uniform-radius circles. A repeated random subsampling algorithm was implemented on this dataset to estimate MLI measured using N randomly sampled chords from the pool of all chords measured per image (numbering N max); N was an integer on the interval [2, N max] and for each N, 5 random subsamples were used. The number of chords sampled per image was then analyzed via ROC curve to determine the ability of N chords to accurately estimate MLI actual as p ≥ 0.05 by one-sample t-test, Fig. 3 a. AUC ROC is a nearly monotonic function of r stratum, Fig. 3 b. This non-monotonicity is likely due to higher relative noise when measuring smaller radii circles. We then used Youden's Index to estimate the optimal number of chords to sample to accurately measure MLI actual, Table 1. The optimal number of chords per r stratum was used to calculate MLI measured, Fig. 4. Finally, a reliability analysis was performed on MLI measured, stratified by r, using a two-way mixed effects model to determine the reliability of the measurements. We demonstrated excellent reliability, with ICC = 0.9998 and p < 0.0001, Fig. 4.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^d6d8fcbc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Spirometry reporting specifies that numerical values are given for the FEV1, the FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio; the latter should be reported as a decimal fraction and the space for percent predicted value left blank, and if bronchodilators are given the LLN column need not be repeated with absolute and percent change given only for FEV1 and FVC. Other numerical values such as the forced inspiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF75%) and FEF25–75% are not recommended for routine use. Graph requirements include that for the volume–time curve the volume scale should be at least 10 mm/L, the time scale at least 20 mm/s, and 1 second prior to the start of expiration should be displayed; on the flow–volume plot the flow display should be at least 5 l/min/L/s, and the ratio of flow to volume should be 2 L/s to 1 L, and linear and log scales where values are plotted as z-scores relative to the predicted value (z = 0) give an intuitive sense of severity.

### Can thoracic impedance monitor the depth of chest compressions during out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? [^c07b885e]. Resuscitation (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To analyze the relationship between the depth of the chest compressions and the fluctuation caused in the thoracic impedance (TI) signal in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The ultimate goal was to evaluate whether it is possible to identify compressions with inadequate depth using information of the TI waveform.

Methods

60 OHCA episodes were extracted, one per patient, containing both compression depth (CD) and TI signals. Every 5s the mean value of the maxima of the CD, Dmax, and three features characterizing the fluctuations caused by the compressions in the TI waveform (peak-to-peak amplitude, area and curve length) were computed. The linear relationship between Dmax and the TI features was tested using Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and univariate linear regression for the whole population, for each patient independently, and for series of compressions provided by a single rescuer. The power of the three TI features to classify each 5s-epoch as shallow/non-shallow was evaluated in terms of area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity.

Results

The r was 0.34, 0.36 and 0.37 for peak-to-peak amplitude, area and curve length respectively when the whole population was analyzed. Within patients the median r was 0.40, 0.43 and 0.47, respectively. The analysis of the series of compressions yielded a median r of 0.81 between Dmax and the peak-to-peak amplitude, but it decreased to 0.47 when all the series were considered jointly. The classifier based on the TI features showed 90.0%/37.1% and 86.2%/43.5% sensitivity/specificity values, and an area under the curve of 0.75 and 0.71 for the training and test set respectively.

Conclusion

Low linearity between CD and TI was noted in OHCA episodes involving multiple rescuers. Our findings suggest that TI is unreliable as a predictor of Dmax and inaccurate in detecting shallow compressions.

Each point represents a subject (N s u b = 70 subjects following exclusion for motion and data quality; FC and SC averaged over two scan sessions). In each boxplot, the "box" denotes interquartile range (IQR), the horizontal bar indicates the median value, and the whiskers include points that are within 1.5 × IQR of upper and lower bounds of the IQR (25th and 7th percentiles). Any points that fall beyond the whiskers are, by convention, considered outliers. b Spatial embedding of predictors. The coordinates were determined using the following procedure: 1) calculating the similarity of regional correlations for every pair of predictors, 2) thresholding this matrix to retain the k = 4 nearest neighbors for each predictor, and 3) performing a principal component analysis of the thresholded and symmetrized matrix. Coordinates represent the first two principal components, PC1 and PC2. Broadly, predictors that are near/distant to one another in principal component space exhibit similar/dissimilar patterns of regional correlations. In this plot, edges exist between predictors if they are nearest neighbors. Note that here the principal component analysis was carried out without z-scoring or centering the columns of the correlation matrix. The size of points is proportional to the mean variance explained across all brain regions. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

### Novel risk model to predict emergency department associated mortality for patients supported with a ventricular assist device: the emergency department-ventricular assist device risk score [^042f5612]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Additionally, we used a bootstrapping method of 200 simulations to generate 200 beta coefficients of the parameters in the final multivariable logistic regression model. As has been previously described for generating risk scores using complex survey data, median beta coefficients for each parameter were calculated and the lowest median coefficient value was assigned a value of 1. The remaining median coefficients were divided by this lowest median coefficient value and rounded to the nearest integer to derive a component risk score for each variable.

All reference categories were assigned a score of 0. Total risk scores were then summed for each encounter and associated probabilities of mortality were calculated for each score. Total scores were stratified into low‐risk, intermediate‐risk, and high‐risk strata. Weighted logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between risk score and death.

We assessed discrimination through the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) to estimate the predictive accuracy of the risk score model. An AUC > 0.7 has been considered a threshold for good discrimination. Discrimination was assessed similarly in the validation cohort. In addition, we calculated the Youden's J index to determine the optimal probability cutoff. Using this cutoff, we calculated positive predictive value and negative predictive value.

Furthermore, we evaluated the association between risk strata and admission to an inpatient setting, length of stay if admitted, and overall ED and inpatient charges. Weighted logistic regression was used to evaluate admission, whereas weighted linear regression was used for length of stay and charges. Charges were adjusted to 2017 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for this analysis.

### A multi-modal, asymmetric, weighted, and signed description of anatomical connectivity [^f321a700]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The shortest paths matrices for both networks are shown in Fig. 3 a, b. Strikingly, the number of steps in the least-costly paths was much greater for the fiber density matrix than for the asymmetric, weighted, and signed network (Fig. 3 e, f). This likely is a consequence of the heavy-tailed fiber density distribution; because a small number of connections exhibit orders of magnitude stronger weights than the others, the cost of including those edges in shortest path is exceptionally small. From the perspective of the shortest paths algorithm, it is optimal to direct paths through these ultra low-cost edges, possibly even at the expense of direct connections. Further evidence for this claim comes from the shortest paths usage; in the fiber density matrix, the fraction of edges that are used in at least one shortest path is only 14.2% (Fig. 3 c, d), whereas in the asymmetric, weighted, and signed networks, 97.5% of all edges get used at least once (Fig. 3).

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (2D based formulas, truncated ellipsoid) indicates partial correction for shape distortions and less dependence on geometrical assumptions than linear measurements; however, this approach requires good image quality and properly oriented parasternal short‑axis views without oblique planes and good epicardial definition, uses a cumbersome methodology with higher measurement variability, and is limited by few published normative data and limited prognostic data.

### Confidence bounds when the estimated ROC area is 1.01 [^28dc467d]. Academic Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In studies with small samples, the authors often encounter data sets in which the estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 1.0. In such cases, neither asymptotic nor resampling methods provide a means of estimating the standard error or constructing a lower confidence bound. The purpose of this study was to develop tables for determining the approximate 95% lower confidence bound when the estimated ROC area is 1.0.

Materials and Methods

Using Monte Carlo simulation, the authors generated 10,000 data sets for each specification of sample sizes, ROC curve shape, and data format (continuous and ordinal scale). For each of these combinations the authors determined the 95% lower confidence bound.

Results

When the estimated ROC area is 1.0, the 95% lower confidence bounds differ dramatically depending on the shape of the ROC curve and on whether the test results are ordinal or continuous. Four tables of 95% lower confidence bounds are provided, along with guidelines for their use.

Conclusion

Given the different shapes of ROC curves and the different formats in which ROC data are collected, it is not feasible to offer one simple method of constructing confidence bounds that works for all ROC curves. The tables provided in this article are useful for interpreting studies with estimated ROC areas of 1.0.

### Evidence-based guideline: neuromuscular ultrasound for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome [^65f7d7a5]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular ultrasound for carpal tunnel syndrome — diagnostic accuracy and recommendation: Median nerve cross-sectional area cut-offs to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) ranged from 8.5 to 10 mm2, with sensitivity from 65% to 97%, specificity from 72.7% to 98%, and accuracy from 79% to 97%; the panel considered diagnostic accuracy > 70% acceptable. Based on consistent Class I and Class II evidence, measurement of median nerve cross-sectional area at the wrist is established as accurate for the diagnosis of CTS, and if available it may be offered as an accurate diagnostic test for CTS (Level A). As clinical context, ultrasound of the median nerve at the wrist should be performed and interpreted by clinicians experienced with the technique.

Table 1
Patient Characteristics in the RP-PRIMARY Study

Table 2 shows the median values of visual parameters and inflammatory markers. ETDRS BCVA was 74.0 (interquartile range: 62.5–79.5) letters, and the median MD value was –16.2 (interquartile range: –21.4 to –13.2) dB. The median EZ length (horizontal) was 0.89 (interquartile range: 0.36–1.81) mm, and the hyper-AF ring area was 0.0 (interquartile range: 0.0–3.1) mm 2; there were 15 patients with a 0 mm EZ line and 46 patients with a 0 mm 2 hyper-AF ring area. One patient did not undergo hyper-AF ring area measurement because of an equipment malfunction. The aqueous flare value was 9.0 (interquartile range: 6.9–14.6) pc/ms. Median serum IL-8 was 12.0 (interquartile range: 9.2–15.4) pg/ml, and the median classical, intermediate, and nonclassical monocyte ratios were 83.8% (interquartile range: 78.3–86.9%), 7.4% (interquartile range: 5.5–10.0%), and 8.0% (interquartile range: 6.1–11.5%), respectively. One patient did not undergo flow cytometry analysis of monocyte subsets because of an equipment malfunction.

### Homologous recombination DNA repair defects inassociated breast cancers [^24384489]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Massively parallel sequencing and bioinformatics analysis

DNA of tumor and matched normal samples was subjected to WES (n = 14) or MSK-IMPACT(n = 8), which targets all exons and selected introns of 410 cancer genes. Sequencing data analysis was performed as described previously. Read alignment and mutation calling was performed as described in the Supplementary Methods.CNAs and regions of LOH were defined using FACETS. In brief, homozygous deletions correspond to regions with an absolute copy number of zero, hemizygous losses are regions with absolute copy number lower than the average ploidy rounded to the nearest integer value. Low copy number gains are regions with absolute copy number greater than the average ploidy rounded to the nearest integer value, and high-level copy number amplifications are regions with absolute copy number in excess of four relative to the average ploidy rounded to the nearest integer value. Regions of LOH and homozygous deletions were manually reviewed using plots of Log 2 ratios and B allele frequencies. The cancer cell fraction (CCF) of each mutation was inferred using ABSOLUTE (v1.0.6)and manually reviewed, (Supplementary Methods).

Large-scale state transitions, indel length and mutational signatures

The presence of LSTs, representative of genomic scars indicative of HRD, was assessed in breast cancers subjected to WES. A LST score cut-off of 15 was adopted to classify breast cancers as LST-high (≥ 15) or LST-low (< 15), as previously described. The length of indels was assessed in PALB2 -associated breast cancers analyzed by WES, given that deletion sizes of ≥ 5 bp have been associated with defective HR-based repair. Mutational signatureswere inferred from non-synonymous and silent somatic exonic SNVs (i) using deconstructSigsbased on the set of 30 mutational signatures represented in COSMICor (ii) on the 12 mutational signatures known to occur in breast cancersand (iii) using a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm (NMF)based on the 30 signatures from COSMIC, in samples with at least 30 somatic mutations, as previously described. The dominant mutational signature in each case was defined based on the consensus of at least two of the three methods.

### Enhanced detection of cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease using structural MRI with anatomically constrained longitudinal registration [^675e30a4]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

3.3 Individual atrophy maps

In order to identify patterns of atrophy within each diagnostic group, we first calculated individual atrophy maps for each subject. Figure 3 demonstrates maps of change in unsmoothed thickness, smoothed thickness, surface area, and volume for one subject in the AD group. Maps of unsmoothed thickness (Figure 3a) contained considerable noise, while maps of smoothed thickness (Figure 3b) demonstrated biologically feasible patterns of atrophy, illustrating the rationale for using smoothed thickness for group‐based analysis and calculation of cortical volume. The map for change in surface area (Figure 3c), produced using aMSM, provides a novel measure of longitudinal structural change. Change in volume (Figure 3d), which incorporates both change in smoothed thickness and change in surface area, demonstrates the greatest degree of atrophy. Figure 3e illustrates intrasubject variance associated with change in smoothed thickness, change in surface area, and change in volume. Within each subject, standard deviation was calculated for each measure using that measure's value at every vertex, excluding the medial wall. Standard deviation was then used to calculate variance. Figure 3e summarizes the variability of each metric (variance of all vertex values for a given subject) for all 50 subjects. The variability across vertices was lowest when considering change in surface area.

FIGURE 3

### Leveraging community mortality indicators to infer COVID-19 mortality and transmission dynamics in damascus, syria [^9037c1ca]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Estimates of under-ascertainment of deaths in Damascus.

In (a) the daily model-predicted COVID-19 deaths in Damascus are shown using the default model parameters and a range of values for the under-ascertainment of COVID-19 deaths. These are compared to the excess mortality reported by the government during 25 July–1 August, which is shown with point ranges, with estimates assuming a baseline of 32 and 64 deaths per day shown with a circle and triangle respectively. Trajectories with 0.05 and 0.1% of deaths reported are not shown above 200 daily deaths to ease viewing of other curves. In (b) the log likelihood for each level of under-ascertainment is shown for different assumed baseline mortality. Model log likelihoods presented reflect the mean model log likelihood across the full sensitivity analysis conducted (n = 14,000), suggesting that under-ascertainment is likely between 1 and 3% when viewed across both baseline mortality estimates. The box represents the median and interquartile range (IQR) and whiskers represent the IQR ± 1.5*IQR with points depicting values outside this range. In (c) the model-predicted hospital occupancy for the simulations in (a) are shown. The hospital capacity for Damascus is shown with a dashed horizontal line, with the 2-week period in which hospitals were reported to be first at capacity shown shaded in red. In both (a, c) the median of 100 draws from the posterior parameter space are presented for visualisation purposes.

Aortic root measurements — technique and modality recommendations specify that the aortic annulus should be measured at midsystole from inner edge to inner edge, whereas all other aortic root measurements (maximal diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva, the sino-tubular junction, and the proximal ascending aorta) should be made at end-diastole in a strictly perpendicular plane to the long axis of the aorta using the L-L convention; measurements of maximal diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva should be compared with age- and body surface area (BSA)-related nomograms or values calculated from specific allometric equations, and accurate measurement of the aortic annulus before TAVI or TAVR is crucial, with no established gold-standard technique to date; three-dimensional TEE and MDCT are emerging as reliable and possibly preferred methods for aortic annulus measurements.

### Aortoiliac morphologic correlations in aneurysms undergoing endovascular repair [^155fb305]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The feasibility of endovascular aneurysm repair depends on morphologic characteristics of the aortoiliac segment. Knowledge of such characteristics is relevant to safe deployment of a particular device in a single patient and to development of new devices for use in patients with a broader spectrum of anatomic variations.

Methods

We evaluated findings on computed tomography scans for 277 patients being considered for endovascular aneurysm repair. Aortic neck length and angulation estimates were generated with three-dimensional trigonometry. Specific centerline points were recorded, corresponding to the aorta at the celiac axis, lowest renal artery, cranial aspect of the aneurysm sac, aortic terminus, right hypogastric artery origin, and left hypogastric origin. Aortic neck thrombus and calcium content were recorded, and neck conicity was calculated in degrees. Statistical analysis was performed with the Spearman rank correlation. Data are expressed as median and interquartile range.

Results

Median diameter of the aneurysms was 52 mm (interquartile range, 48–59 mm) in minor axis and 56 mm (interquartile range, 51–64 mm) in major axis, and median length was 88 mm (interquartile range, 74–103 mm). Median proximal aortic neck diameter was 26 mm (interquartile range, 22–29 mm), and median neck length was 30 mm (interquartile range, 18–45 mm). The common iliac arteries were similar in diameter (right artery, 16 mm [interquartile range, 13–20 mm]; left artery, 15 mm [interquartile range, 11–18 mm]) and length (right, 59 mm [interquartile range, 50–69 mm]; left, 60 mm [interquartile range, 49–70 mm]). Median angulation of the infrarenal aortic neck was 40 degrees (interquartile range, 29–51 degrees), and median angulation of the suprarenal segment was 45 degrees (interquartile range, 36–57 degrees). By gender, sac diameter, proximal neck diameter, and iliac artery diameter were significantly larger in men. Significant linear associations were identified between sac diameter and sac length, neck angulation, and iliac artery diameter. As the length of the aneurysm sac increased the proximal aortic neck length decreased. Conversely, as the sac length decreased sac eccentricity increased. Mural thrombus content within the neck increased with increasing neck diameter.

Conclusions

There is considerable variability in aortoiliac morphologic parameters. Significant associations were found between various morphologic variables, links that are presumably related to a shared pathogenesis for aberration in aortoiliac diameter, length, and angulation. Ultimately this information can be used to develop new endovascular devices with broader applicability and improved long-term results.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^d027f21a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Understanding the effect of heterogeneity is fundamental to numerous fields. In community ecology, classical theory postulates that habitat heterogeneity determines niche dimensionality and drives biodiversity. However, disparate heterogeneity-diversity relationships have been empirically observed, generating increasingly complex theoretical developments. Here we show that spurious heterogeneity-diversity relationships and subsequent theories arise as artifacts of heterogeneity measures that are mean-biased for bounded continuous variables. To solve this, we derive an alternative mean-independent measure of heterogeneity for beta and gamma distributed variables that disentangles statistical dispersion from mean. Using the mean-independent measure of heterogeneity, true monotonic positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships, consistent with classical theory, are revealed in data previously presented as evidence for both hump-shaped heterogeneity-diversity relationships and theories of an area-heterogeneity trade-off for biodiversity. This work sheds light on the source of conflicting results that have hindered understanding of heterogeneity relationships in broader ecology and numerous other fields. The mean-independent measure of heterogeneity is provided as a solution, essential for understanding true mean-independent heterogeneity relationships in wider research.

Chamber quantification partition values and abnormality thresholds — For parameters other than left ventricular (LV) size, function, and mass as well as left atrial (LA) volume, only the mean and SD of gender-, age-, and body surface area (BSA)–normalized cutoffs are reported, and for these parameters, measurements exceeding ± 1.96 SDs (i.e., the 95% confidence interval) should be classified as abnormal; an alternative percentile-based approach (e.g., 95th, 99th) is described but applicable population data sets do not exist for most variables; the compromise provides experience-based partition values only for LV ejection fraction (EF) and LA volume with suggested values for LV size and mass in the Appendix, and any description of deviation remains at the laboratory's discretion because the writing group does not recommend specific partition values.

Table 1b — Minimum sample size for detecting geometric mean (GM) ratio k with α = 0.05 and W = 0.9 — presents required sample sizes by standard deviation (S) strata and defines parameters; α is significance level, W is power, GM is geometric mean, and S is standard deviation, noting that 1.2 is the standard deviation of national viral load (VL) data. Each jurisdiction will need to assess the standard deviation of their local VL data and then determine the appropriate sample size needed to assess VL, and if the sample size is inadequate to meet the recommended case inclusion criterion, an alternate method may need to be used, such as combining multiple years of data. For k = 3, sample sizes across S = 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 are 75, 91, 108, 127, 147, 169, and Table 1b uses power = 90%; jurisdictions may also explore differences in means of viral loads, including categorical differences in the proportion with undetectable or very low VL.

### Retrospective measurement of different size parameters of non-radiated rectal cancer on MR images and pathology slides and their comparison [^b0df7a62]. European Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

There are no non-invasive methods to assess the real tumor size in rectal cancer prior to surgery, especially following radio/chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging is gaining increasing acceptance as the primary modality at many centers for evaluation of pelvic malignancies including rectal cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the tumor size as assessed by stereological or metric means on MRI correlates to the corresponding pathologic findings. To our knowledge, no such previous work has been reported in the literature. From the Cancer Register Center, 18 patients in the age range of 39–90 years with rectal cancer who had complete preoperative MR with subsequent giant section pathological examinations of the resected bowel were included. The tumor size was measured on MR and histopathologic specimen using both a stereologic and a metric mode. The measured parameters included the maximum transverse area occupied by the tumor, thickness, width, and the length of tumor and the volume of the tumor measured in two different fashions by the product of area and length (al) or the product of thickness, width, and length (twl). The depth of tumor infiltration (T) and presence of local lymph node metastases (N) were also separately evaluated on the histopathologic specimen. There were 1, 4, 12, and 1 patients with tumor stages T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively. The mean thickness, width, length, area, and volumes, al and twl, were 1.62, 2.8, and 4.78 cm, and 4.72 cm2, 26.29 cm3, and 20.07 cm3, respectively. Regression curves were drawn for above-mentioned parameters. They showed some correlation with square correlation coefficient measuring between 0.38 and 0.82. The best correlation was seen for area (0.75) and volume measured by the product of area and length of the tumor (0.82). With the formula proposed from this material, we assume that rectal tumors can be measured on MR images using a metric model, especially area and the volume (the product of area and length), and then extrapolated to what we would expect from pathology, hence providing us with a tool where we could measure tumor response after neoadjuvant therapy.

### A nasal dermal sinus cyst involving the nasal septum [^4c6efcd5]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Nasal dermoid sinus cysts (NDSCs) are rare neoplasms in the median line of the nasofrontal area. Unlike other dermoid cysts, a NDSC can manifest as a cyst, sinus, or fistula, and may extend intracranially. They usually occur as a mass in the median nasofrontal area and may have a pit. As an extensive tract can appear in some cases, careful preoperative evaluation and complete excision are required. A 15-year-old boy presented with a fistula, present from birth, in the nasal soft triangle. This report describes a case of NDSC occurring in the nasal septum and a fistula opening in the soft triangle, which is very rare, without recurrence after 4 years.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^ac216cc0]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Acetabular version — normal orientation, prevalence, and pelvic tilt effects are described, with a normal acetabulum demonstrating approximately 20° of anteversion. The incidence of acetabular retroversion has been reported in up to 20% of patients undergoing a total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis and between 16%-30% of patients with dysplastic hips. Increased forward orientation of the acetabulum results in decreased coverage of the femoral head anteriorly, and mean global acetabular anteversion was reported as greater in females than males. Increased anterior pelvic tilt was associated with decreased acetabular anteversion. In an in silico finite element model comparing 3 positions of pelvic tilt between 21 hips with acetabular dysplasia and 21 normal hips, the mean contact area was 0.6 to 0.7 times smaller, the mean maximum contact pressure was 1.8 to 1.9 times higher, and the mean maximum equivalent cartilage stress was 1.3 to 2.8 times higher in dysplastic hips compared to normal hips. Transitioning from a 10° anterior tilt to a 10° posterior tilt decreased mean contact area and increased mean maximum contact pressure and median maximum equivalent stress for both dysplastic and normal hips, and these increases associated with posterior tilt were more significant in dysplastic hips than in normal hips.

### Quantifying the impact of hospital catchment area definitions on hospital admissions forecasts: COVID-19 in england, September 2020-April 2021 [^2082faf1]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Defining healthcare facility catchment areas is a key step in predicting future healthcare demand in epidemic settings. Forecasts of hospitalisations can be informed by leading indicators measured at the community level. However, this relies on the definition of so-called catchment areas or the geographies whose populations make up the patients admitted to a given hospital, which are often not well-defined. Little work has been done to quantify the impact of hospital catchment area definitions on healthcare demand forecasting.

Methods

We made forecasts of local-level hospital admissions using a scaled convolution of local cases (as defined by the hospital catchment area) and delay distribution. Hospital catchment area definitions were derived from either simple heuristics (in which people are admitted to their nearest hospital or any nearby hospital) or historical admissions data (all emergency or elective admissions in 2019, or COVID-19 admissions), plus a marginal baseline definition based on the distribution of all hospital admissions. We evaluated predictive performance using each hospital catchment area definition using the weighted interval score and considered how this changed by the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location. We also considered the change, if any, in the relative performance of each definition in retrospective vs. real-time settings, or at different spatial scales.

Results

The choice of hospital catchment area definition affected the accuracy of hospital admission forecasts. The definition based on COVID-19 admissions data resulted in the most accurate forecasts at both a 7- and 14-day horizon and was one of the top two best-performing definitions across forecast dates and locations. The "nearby" heuristic also performed well, but less consistently than the COVID-19 data definition. The marginal distribution baseline, which did not include any spatial information, was the lowest-ranked definition. The relative performance of the definitions was larger when using case forecasts compared to future observed cases. All results were consistent across spatial scales of the catchment area definitions.

Conclusions

Using catchment area definitions derived from context-specific data can improve local-level hospital admission forecasts. Where context-specific data is not available, using catchment areas defined by carefully chosen heuristics is a sufficiently good substitute. There is clear value in understanding what drives local admissions patterns, and further research is needed to understand the impact of different catchment area definitions on forecast performance where case trends are more heterogeneous.

### Optimal thresholds by maximizing or minimizing various metrics via ROC-type analysis [^a7fc8946]. Academic Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Based on imaging features, the optimal thresholds are typically determined as cutoff points to dichotomize the corresponding measurement scales.

Materials and Methods

Five metrics (ie, the Youden index, Euclidian distance, percent of correct diagnosis, kappa statistic, and mutual information) are individually maximized or minimized to derive the corresponding optimal threshold. These optimal thresholds are estimated under the parametric binormal assumption. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to compare the performances of these different methods. A published radiological example on the choice of treatment outcomes following ureteral stones is used to illustrate and compare the estimated thresholds both empirically and parametrically.

Results

The optimal threshold can be a "moving target" because it would depend on modeling assumptions, metrics, and variability in the data. Even with large samples, disease prevalence has an impact on the robustness of the metrics.

Conclusions

It is recommended that researchers compare different optimal cutoff points using several metrics and select one that is most clinically relevant. The ultimate goal is to maximize diagnostic performances that are clinically meaningful to achieve improved global health.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery: clinical practice guidelines for the surgical placement and maintenance of arteriovenous hemodialysis access [^6e47517f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Autogenous access surgical technique — arteriotomy length, anastomosis strategy, side branches, and exercise notes specify that in autogenous accesses originating from arteries proximal to the radial, the arteriotomy should be limited to a maximum length of 4 to 6 mm, using the smaller anastomoses for individuals at highest risk of steal; the anastomosis is performed with a continuous suture to prevent future increase of the anastomotic surface area, and these two maneuvers limit future increases in flow and decrease arterial steal; ligation or endovascular coiling of side branches can be delayed and performed only if the autogenous access does not mature; although evidence is not strong, some surgeons ask patients to perform hand exercises starting 24 to 48 hours postoperatively to increase blood flow and encourage early maturation.

### Perceived discharge quality and associations with hospital readmissions and emergency department use: a prospective cohort study [^65cb6a8a]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Correlates of CTM scores

Stratified median CTM-15 scores for patients were calculated based on age (age < 25 years — median 86.7 (IQR 66.7–796.7); age 85 years or older — median 68.9 (IQR 64.1–68.9)), health literacy (low health literacy — median 68.9 (IQR 66.7–90.5); high health literacy — median 80.5 (IQR 66.7–96.1)), sex (female — median 78.6 (IQR 66.7–97.8); male — median 80.0 (IQR 66.7–95.6) and length of stay (< 7 days — median 80.0 (IQR 66.7–95.6); > 30 days — median 66.7 (IQR 57.8–100.0). However, statistical testing showed no significant difference in the distributions of CTM scores based on these four variables (figure 1). Distributions of CTM-15 scores, however, did significantly differ based on number of comorbidities. CTM-15 scores for those with six or more comorbidities had a lower maximum score (93.3), a lower median and a narrower interquartile (median 66.7 (IQR, 65.6–73.3)) compared with those with fewer comorbidities (maximum score of 100, median score 83.9 (IQR 66.7–97.6) for those with 0–2 comorbidities).
