## Question

What about after first dose of vanc msintanace of 750 mg every 24 hours

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a vancomycin regimen of 750 mg every 24 hours is appropriate after the first dose, and if not, what the correct maintenance strategy should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets for serious MRSA infections. Then, I should verify whether a 750 mg every 24 hours regimen can plausibly achieve those targets. Next, I will review guideline-recommended dosing ranges and the role of loading doses. After that, I need to check special populations like obesity, renal impairment, and CRRT. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the PK/PD targets. For serious MRSA infections, the consensus target is an AUC/MIC of 400–600 mg·h/L assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L, with early attainment (within 24–48 hours) preferred. Trough-only monitoring is no longer recommended for serious infections, and AUC-guided dosing is preferred when feasible [^112CF5wr] [^111Y6jkr] [^111DR6UQ].

> Wait, let me verify the plausibility of 750 mg every 24 hours achieving those targets. Standard adult dosing for normal renal function is typically 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours, which for a 70 kg adult approximates 1,050–1,400 mg per dose, or about 3,150–4,200 mg/day. 750 mg every 24 hours totals only 750 mg/day, which is far below guideline-recommended exposure and would be expected to result in subtherapeutic AUC and troughs in most adults with normal renal function [^1162PCFm].

> Hold on, I should verify with modeling data. Monte Carlo simulations show that even with a 2 g loading dose, maintenance of 750 mg every 12 hours is often required to sustain troughs ≥ 15 mg/L and achieve AUC targets in critically ill patients. 750 mg every 24 hours would yield substantially lower exposures and a much lower probability of target attainment, reinforcing that 750 mg daily is inadequate for most adults with normal renal function [^112yekUV] [^112eqwrw].

> I need to check the role of a loading dose. Guidelines recommend a loading dose of 25–35 mg/kg (max 3 g) for serious infections to rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations; without a loading dose, attainment of PK/PD targets is delayed, which can compromise early bacterial kill in severe infections [^114jPWFw] [^113gmvdb].

> Let me consider special populations. In obesity, clearance is higher and empiric maintenance doses commonly approach 4,500 mg/day, with early and frequent AUC monitoring advised. In renal impairment, dosing must be reduced, but even then, 750 mg every 24 hours is generally reserved for severe dysfunction or anuria, not for patients with preserved renal function. In CRRT, typical maintenance is 7.5–10 mg/kg every 12 hours, again inconsistent with 750 mg every 24 hours for most adults [^115GrgBk] [^116vfKkA] [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could 750 mg every 24 hours ever be appropriate? I initially thought it might align with some pediatric regimens, but let me reconsider. Pediatric dosing is weight-based and higher per kilogram, often 60–80 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours, which for a 10 kg child is 600–800 mg/day — so 750 mg/day might approximate a pediatric daily total, but the interval and per-dose exposure differ, and extrapolating a fixed 750 mg every 24 hours from pediatrics to adults is not appropriate [^114S1LuE] [^115vxPVk].

> Next, I should review what to do if someone mistakenly started 750 mg every 24 hours. The safest, evidence-based correction is to administer a weight-based loading dose of 25–35 mg/kg (max 3 g) now, then transition to 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours based on renal function, and obtain early concentrations to guide AUC-targeted adjustments. If a loading dose was already given and 750 mg every 24 hours was intended as maintenance, I should confirm renal function and immediately escalate to guideline-concordant maintenance dosing, because 750 mg every 24 hours will underexpose most adults [^114jPWFw] [^1162PCFm] [^112AEN2J].

> I should double-check monitoring logistics. Early AUC estimation using Bayesian methods or two concentrations (post-distribution peak and trough) within the first 24–48 hours allows adaptive dosing before steady state; if AUC-guided monitoring is not available, a trough just before the fourth dose can be used as a pragmatic surrogate, recognizing that trough-only strategies risk under- or overdosing and are less precise for AUC targeting [^112AEN2J] [^114iDJvQ].

> Final recommendation: I need to ensure the regimen is corrected to 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours based on actual body weight and renal function, preceded by a 25–35 mg/kg loading dose (max 3 g) if not already administered. 750 mg every 24 hours is not an appropriate maintenance dose for most adults with normal renal function and risks persistent subtherapeutic exposure and treatment failure, so the maintenance dose should be escalated promptly and exposure verified with early TDM [^1162PCFm] [^114jPWFw] [^112AEN2J].

A 750 mg vancomycin dose every 24 hours is **likely subtherapeutic** for most adults with normal renal function, as it underdelivers the guideline-recommended 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours [^1162PCFm] and risks low troughs and treatment failure [^115K4F42]. This regimen may be appropriate only for patients with **severe renal impairment** or **intermittent hemodialysis**, where dose reduction is required [^notfound] [^notfound]. For patients with normal renal function, adjust to 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours [^1162PCFm] and monitor AUC-guided levels or troughs to ensure the AUC/MIC target of 400–600 is achieved [^113V1YCc] [^112CF5wr].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Vancomycin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, with dosing based on actual body weight and adjusted for renal function. The **standard adult dose** is 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours [^1162PCFm], targeting a trough concentration of 15–20 mg/L or an AUC/MIC of 400–600 mg·h/L [^112CF5wr] [^114z39rm].

---

## Clinical scenarios for 750 mg every 24 hours

A 750 mg every 24 hours regimen may be appropriate in **specific clinical scenarios**, including:

- **Severe renal impairment**: Patients with significantly reduced renal function (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) may require dose reduction to prevent accumulation and nephrotoxicity [^113AHXgS].

- **Intermittent hemodialysis**: Patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis typically require dose adjustments, with dosing often aligned with dialysis sessions to maintain therapeutic concentrations [^1144Bz8C] [^113MFBBr].

- **Pediatric patients**: In certain pediatric cases, lower doses may be considered based on weight and renal function, though standard pediatric dosing is typically 10 mg/kg every 6 hours [^113AHXgS].

---

## Risks and benefits of 750 mg every 24 hours

### Benefits

Potential benefits include a **reduced nephrotoxicity risk** with lower dosing in patients with impaired renal function or those at high risk of nephrotoxicity, and **simplified administration** with once-daily dosing that may improve adherence and reduce healthcare resource utilization.

---

### Risks

Key risks include **subtherapeutic exposure** — especially in patients with normal renal function, leading to low trough concentrations and increased risk of treatment failure and resistance [^115K4F42] — and **delayed achievement of therapeutic levels**, which may prolong time to effective bacterial killing and worsen clinical outcomes [^115K4F42].

---

## Comparison with standard dosing regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Standard dosing regimen** | **750 Mg every 24 hours** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal renal function | 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours [^1162PCFm] | Subtherapeutic |
| Severe renal impairment | Dose-adjusted based on renal function [^113AHXgS] | May be appropriate |
| Intermittent hemodialysis | Dose-adjusted based on dialysis schedule [^113GxoPb] | May be appropriate |
| Pediatric patients | 10 mg/kg every 6 hours [^113AHXgS] | May be appropriate in select cases |

---

## Monitoring and adjustment strategies

To ensure therapeutic efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity, **therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)** is recommended [^112CF5wr]:

- **AUC-guided monitoring**: Target an AUC/MIC ratio of 400–600 mg·h/L, particularly in patients with normal renal function or those at risk of nephrotoxicity [^112CF5wr] [^114b2RdS].

- **Trough monitoring**: Maintain trough concentrations between 15–20 mg/L for serious infections, adjusting the dose as necessary [^117Lxqfc].

- **Frequent monitoring**: In patients with fluctuating renal function or those receiving dialysis, monitor vancomycin concentrations regularly to guide dosing adjustments [^1144Bz8C].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Clinical outcomes with 750 mg every 24 hours vary by renal function and infection severity. In patients with normal renal function, this regimen is likely to result in **subtherapeutic exposure**, increasing the risk of treatment failure and resistance [^115K4F42]. In contrast, in those with severe renal impairment or on dialysis, it may maintain therapeutic concentrations while minimizing nephrotoxicity, provided TDM is performed [^1118Hzmz].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing** based on renal function, infection severity, and patient-specific factors. The 750 mg every 24 hours regimen is not a standard recommendation for most adult patients with normal renal function. It may be considered in specific scenarios, such as severe renal impairment or dialysis, with careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^1162PCFm] [^116joeur] [^116vfKkA] [^1118Hzmz].

---

A 750 mg vancomycin dose every 24 hours is **generally subtherapeutic** for most adults with normal renal function but may be appropriate for severe renal impairment or intermittent hemodialysis. Individualized dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring are essential to ensure efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity.

Obese adults — vancomycin dosing and AUC monitoring is addressed with specific thresholds and monitoring guidance. Empiric maintenance doses for most obese patients usually do not exceed 4,500 mg/day (B-II), and early and frequent monitoring of AUC exposure is recommended for dose adjustment, especially when empiric doses exceed 4,000 mg/day (A-II). Measurement of peak and trough concentrations is recommended to improve the accuracy of vancomycin AUC estimation and maintenance dose optimization in obese patients, aligning with recommendations 2 and 5 for nonobese adults.

Vancomycin treatment and measurements

In our surgical ICU, the use of CIV is at the discretion of the treating ICU physician and at a loading dose of 25–30 mg/kg, followed by maintenance doses adjusted based on CrCL or CVVH. Calculated CrCL was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation using ABW. To account for a falsely elevated CrCL estimate in patients > 65 years of age in whom low SCr values may indicate reduced muscle mass, SCr values < 0.8 mg/dL were adjusted up to 0.8 mg/dL. CG CrCL was used in the dosing nomogram because 24-hour urine creatinine cannot provide immediate results and rapid administration of antibiotic is often essential. Of note, 24-hour urine creatinine is not performed daily in the study center, instead it is collected on the first day of CIV therapy. The daily maintenance dose starts at 2000 mg for CG CrCL of 60 ml/minute; increases in CG CrCL of 10 ml/minute requires an increase in maintenance dose of 250 mg vancomycin. The maximum maintenance dose is started at 4250 mg. For patients who receive concomitant CVVH, the initial vancomycin dose is 1500 mg daily.

Doses were not changed during the first 24 hours of therapy; afterwards, the daily regimen was adapted using a specific approach: if serum vancomycin concentration was < 15 mg/L, an additional dose of 500 to 1000 mg was given as a bolus followed by an increased total daily dose proportional to the goal serum concentration. If the concentration was > 25 mg/L, the CIV was discontinued for 4 to 6 hours and resumed with the daily dose reduced proportionally. Serum vancomycin concentrations were determined every 24 hours until two serum concentrations were within target range (15–25 mg/L). If CVVH was stopped due to a clotted circuit, the CIV was stopped and the infusion resumes once CVVH was restarted.

Trough-only vancomycin monitoring — practice change indicates that trough-only monitoring with a target of 15 to 20 mg/L is no longer recommended for patients with serious infections due to MRSA (A-II), and there is insufficient evidence to recommend trough-only versus AUC-guided monitoring among patients with noninvasive MRSA or other infections.

The authors state it is reasonable to treat with the higher dose for the first 48–72 hours, then, if there is clinical improvement, the dose should be decreased to 125 mg every 6 hours and continued for an additional 10 days; if no response is seen after 48–72 hours on high-dose vancomycin, therapy should be reevaluated and an alternative approach considered.

Vancomycin loading dose administration and infusion parameters indicate that providing loading doses of 20 to 35 mg/kg based on actual body weight rapidly achieves targeted serum concentrations and reduces early subtherapeutic levels. Vancomycin should be administered in a dilute solution with concentrations of no more than 5 mg/mL and infused over not less than 60 minutes or at 10 to 15 mg/min, and an infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events. Loading doses of 25 to 35 mg/kg will require infusion times of at least 2 to 3 hours, and after completion of the loading dose the maintenance dose should begin at the next dosing interval, for example starting 6 hours after the start of the loading dose when the interval is every 6 hours.

Loading dose recommendations and obesity considerations specify that in order to achieve rapid attainment of targeted concentrations in critically ill patients with suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, a loading dose of 25 to 35 mg/kg can be considered for intermittent-infusion administration of vancomycin (B-II). Loading doses should be based on actual body weight and not exceed 3,000 mg, and dosing in obese patients should be based on actual body weight with doses capped at 3,000 mg, with more intensive therapeutic monitoring also advised in obesity.

Part II. Development of vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring strategy in patients with HHD

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is routinely performed for vancomycin therapy. Previously, we developed a technique to integrate TDM and subsequent vancomycin dose individualization into virtual patients receiving different types of renal replacement therapy. Using this technique, we modeled how TDM can be effectively utilized for HHD patients and attempted to develop a practical vancomycin dose adjustment protocol to guide clinicians. In the simulation, TDM in HHD patients used a single pre-dialysis concentration based on the current guideline recommendations and the initial vancomycin doses were adjusted to attain and/or maintain AUC 24h of 400–600 mg∙h/L.

The nomogram for dose adjustment protocol was developed based on the predicted vancomycin concentrations in virtual patients with HHD receiving one week of vancomycin dosing regimens recommended from Part I. A single pre-dialysis vancomycin concentration measured immediately prior to the last HHD session of the first week was used as the basis of TDM. The subsequent dose targeting to attain and/or maintain AUC 24h of 400–600 mg∙h/L were given after the first HHD of the second week. For example, in a setting where HHD occurs 5 times per week (Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri), a pre-dialysis concentration was measured prior to HHD session on Friday of the first week of vancomycin therapy, and the adjusted dose was given after the first HHD session of the following week. The decision to adjust the first dose of the next Monday was made for practical reasons. Patients receiving HHD at home would be unlikely to receive TDM results in a timely enough manner to adjust doses any faster. The virtual vancomycin assay results were assumed to be accurate and reflect the model-derived concentrations at that time point. Using the predicted pre-dialysis concentrations and pharmacokinetic profiles selected in the simulation of Part I, the second week of vancomycin concentrations with the adjusted dose was further constructed to estimate AUC 24h in each of 5,000 virtual patients. Finally, the equation was derived to individualize a subsequent dose achieving AUC 24h of 400–600 mg∙h/L in most patients.

Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) dosing parameters in critically ill patients commonly include a loading dose and higher daily maintenance to achieve target steady-state concentrations, with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets extrapolated rather than validated for CI. Most studies "employed a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg followed by daily maintenance infusions at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg (up to 60 mg/kg) to achieve a target steady-state concentration of 20 to 25 mg/L". By calculation, "a target steady-state concentration of 20 to 25 mg/L would equate to an AUC24/MIC of 480 to 600 (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L)". However, "the PK/PD target for CI has not been validated", and available PK/PD data supporting an AUC24/MIC " > 400" as correlating with outcomes "were derived from patients who received IV vancomycin dosing". Rapid attainment of target serum concentrations "has been cited as a potential advantage of CI over II when treating acute infections".

Recent clinical data on vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest a reevaluation of current dosing and monitoring recommendations. The previous 2009 vancomycin consensus guidelines recommend trough monitoring as a surrogate marker for the target area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). However, recent data suggest that trough monitoring is associated with higher nephrotoxicity. This document is an executive summary of the new vancomycin consensus guidelines for vancomycin dosing and monitoring. It was developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists vancomycin consensus guidelines committee. These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400–600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

CONCLUSION

Vancomycin used at currently recommended doses is minimally nephrotoxic when used in noncritically ill patients with less serious infections. In sicker patients with multiple risk factors for AKI, VANT occurs much more commonly, but it remains uncertain to what degree vancomycin is directly responsible. In our opinion, it is safe to initiate therapy with vancomycin in critically ill patients with multiple risk factors for AKI, pending culture results with use of TDM and antibiotic stewardship (Table 5). Trough levels should be obtained within 48–72 h, by which time initial culture results should be available. Decisions regarding continuation of vancomycin therapy can be individualized, based on culture result, MIC (if staphylococci are isolated), AKI risk, and side‐effect profile of alternative agents. Loading doses are safe. Trough levels with intermittent dosing should always be > 10 mg/L to prevent resistance. It remains uncertain whether Guideline‐based trough levels of 15–20 mg/L are more efficacious than 10–15 mg/L in serious infections. Trough levels of 15–20 mg/L, however, are clearly associated with greater VANT than levels < 15 mg/L, but it remains uncertain whether these levels are the cause or the result of the nephrotoxicity. Combination with PTZ should be avoided or duration minimized. In patients receiving vancomycin who develop AKI that is not easily correctible with fluid resuscitation or discontinuation of other agents, cessation of vancomycin should be considered. This very important issue clearly warrants a large, multicenter RCT to answer definitively. Further issues need research as well, preferably with RCTs (Table 6).

2.3 Dosage in Pediatric Patients (1 Month and Older) with Normal Renal Function

Use this formulation of Vancomycin Injection only in pediatric patients (1 month and older) who require the entire dose (500 mg, 750 mg, 1 g, 1.25 g, 1.5 g, 1.75 g or 2 g) of this single-dose flexible bag and not any fraction of it [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)].

The usual intravenous dosage of vancomycin is 10 mg/kg per dose given every 6 hours. Each dose should be administered over a period of at least 60 minutes. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be warranted in these patients.

2.4 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with renal impairment. The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg in patients with any degree of renal impairment.

In the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measure trough vancomycin serum concentrations to guide therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function.

For functionally anephric patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentration. A dose of 1.9 mg/kg/24 h should be given after the initial dose of 15 mg/kg.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) dosing and monitoring — For patients receiving CRRT at conventional, KDIGO-recommended effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h, loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg by actual body weight should be used (B-III), and initial maintenance dosing for CRRT with effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h should be 7.5 to 10 mg/kg every 12 hours (B-II). Maintenance dose and dosing interval should be based on serum concentration monitoring, which should be conducted within the first 24 hours to ensure AUC/MIC targets are met; in fluid overloaded patients, doses may be reduced as patients become euvolemic and Vd decreases, and the use of CI of vancomycin in patients receiving CRRT could be used in place of intermittent dosing especially when high CRRT ultrafiltrate/dialysate flow rates are employed (B-II).

Guideline on vancomycin monitoring — For neonates and infants up to 3 months old, doses recommended to achieve an AUC of 400 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L) range from 10 to 20 mg/kg every 8 to 48 hours, depending on postmenstrual age, weight, and SCr (A-II). AUC-guided therapeutic dosing and monitoring, preferably with Bayesian estimation, can best achieve the target vancomycin exposure likely to be required for a successful outcome of treatment for a MRSA infection for all neonates, regardless of gestational and chronological age.

Patients with Impaired Renal Function and Elderly Patients

Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with impaired renal function. In the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measurement of vancomycin serum concentrations can be helpful in optimizing therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function. Vancomycin serum concentrations can be determined by use of microbiologic assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, fluorescence immunoassay, or high-pressure liquid chromatography. If creatinine clearance can be measured or estimated accurately, the dosage for most patients with renal impairment can be calculated using the following table. The dosage of vancomycin per day in mg is about 15 times the glomerular filtration rate in mL/min:

The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg, even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. The table is not valid for functionally anephric patients. For such patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations. The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1.9 mg/kg/24 h. In patients with marked renal impairment, it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1,000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis. In anuria, a dose of 1,000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended.

When only the serum creatinine concentration is known, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to calculate creatinine clearance. Calculated creatinine clearances (mL/min) are only estimates. The creatinine clearance should be measured promptly.

Men: [Weight (kg) x (140-age in years)] / [72 x serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL)]

Women: 0.85 x above value

The serum creatinine must represent a steady state of renal function. Otherwise, the estimated value for creatinine clearance is not valid. Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions: (1) characterized by decreasing renal function, such as shock, severe heart failure, or oliguria; (2) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present, such as obese patients or those with liver disease, edema, or ascites; and (3) accompanied by debilitation, malnutrition, or inactivity. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administration by the intrathecal (intralumbar or intraventricular) route have not been established.

Intermittent infusion is the recommended method of administration.

### Vancomycin area under the curve-guided dosing and monitoring for adult and pediatric patients with suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: putting the safety of our patients first [^114b2RdS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The revised vancomycin consensus guidelines recommended area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing/monitoring for patients with serious invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections as a measure to minimize vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) while maintaining similar effectiveness. Data indicate that the intensity of vancomycin exposure drives VA-AKI risk. Troughs of 15–20 mg/L will ensure an AUC ≥ 400 mg × hr/L but most patients will have daily AUCs > 600. VA-AKI increases as a function of AUC, especially when > 600. In addition to minimizing VA-AKI risk while maintaining similar efficacy, AUC-guided dosing/monitoring is a more precise way to conduct therapeutic drug monitoring for vancomycin relative to trough-only control.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — adults and pediatrics: we recommend targeting an AUC/MICBMD ratio of 400 to 600 (assuming an MICBMD of 1 mg/L) for empiric dosing to maximize clinical efficacy and minimize AKI risk. Furthermore, the AUC should be therapeutically monitored using 1 or 2 postdose concentrations (ie, a peak concentration measured after the early vancomycin tissue distribution phase and a trough level measured prior to the next dose), preferably integrating the Bayesian approach. Future studies in all patient populations are necessary to address existing gaps, including efficacy data to support vancomycin use in specific patient populations (including immunocompromised and pediatric patients and patients with renal disease and obesity) and for other types of infections; efficacy data for specific pathogens, including coagulase-negative staphylococcus and Streptococcus species; robust pediatric efficacy data for MRSA and other gram-positive pathogens causing different types of serious infections; optimal loading and maintenance dosing regimens for patients with obesity and renal insufficiency; efficacy benefit and the need for a dosing algorithm (specifically incorporating a loading dose followed by maintenance infusion); and toxicodynamics of vancomycin CI in critically ill patients.

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis – A retrospective study [^113YeUCk]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the incidence of therapeutic target attainment using a three-times per week protocol for vancomycin therapy given during the last hour of intermittent hemodialysis (HD).

Methods

A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted of patient medical records in a remote dialysis center from January 2017 to July 2023. Adult patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 on ≥ 3 months of intermittent HD who had received a course of vancomycin therapy with ≥ 1 serum vancomycin concentration recorded were included. Demographic and dosing data were collected. Clinician adherence with the dosing protocol and attainment of the therapeutic target (trough concentration within 15–20 mg/L) following the loading and maintenance doses were assessed. Factors associated with target nonattainment following the loading dose were analyzed, and the 48- and 72-h maintenance dosing intervals were analyzed for target nonattainment.

Findings

A total of 98 vancomycin courses (67 patients) were available for analysis. Only 38% of the loading doses were prescribed as per protocol. Following the loading dose, 25% of trough concentrations achieved the therapeutic target concentration (15–20 mg/L), 25% returned a supra-therapeutic concentration (> 20 mg/L) and 50% were sub-therapeutic (< 15 mg/L). When compared with those achieving target, sub-therapeutic concentrations were associated with a lower loading dose (median 16.6 vs 20.0 mg/kg, P < 0.002), and supra-therapeutic concentrations had a shorter dosing interval between the loading dose and first maintenance dose (median 31.5 vs 39.0 h, P = 0.06). Of the 201 maintenance trough concentrations collected, 65% were therapeutic, 21% were sub-therapeutic and 14% were supra-therapeutic, with an overall median trough concentration of 17.3 mg/L. As the treatment duration increased, an increase was seen in the number of dose adjustments required to achieve the target trough concentration. The 48-h dosing interval was associated with more supra-therapeutic concentrations and the 72-h interval was associated with more sub-therapeutic concentrations (df = 2, P = 0.022).

Implications

We have identified a high rate of target nonattainment for HD patients on a three times a week vancomycin dosing regimen. We recommend a loading dose of 20 to 25 mg/kg irrespective of the indication and a better-defined dosing interval after the loading dose. A higher maintenance dose should be prescribed when the time to next dialysis session is 72 h. Further pharmacokinetic studies are needed to assess factors influencing target concentration attainment following the maintenance doses and to determine an optimal dosing regimen.

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^112EN5pH]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study demonstrated large variability in vancomycin pharmacokinetics and PK/PD target attainment in critically ill patients. Continuous infusion was associated with higher likelihood to achieving clinically relevant trough concentrations (of ≥ 15 mg/L) pharmacodynamic exposure (AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio > 400) in univariate analyses but not in multivariate analyses. These data support a re-evaluation of vancomycin dosing recommendations in critically ill patients with new approaches to more rapidly and consistently achieve clinically relevant PK/PD targets.

Intermittent hemodialysis — vancomycin exposure targets and dosing frequency emphasize concentration- and AUC-based goals and intradialytic losses. Predialysis vancomycin concentration to MRSA MIC ratios of > 18.6 have been associated with improved bacteremia patient outcomes. Dosing to achieve predialysis concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L results in a mean AUC24 ranging from 250 to 450 mg·h/L, and outcome studies validating the AUC24 goal of 400 to 600 mg·h/L used in other populations have not been conducted in the hemodialysis population, though this section aims to reach this AUC24 target (ie, 400–600 mg·h/L). For non-critically ill patients receiving hemodialysis, 2 or 3 days is the most common interdialytic period, and approximately 20% to 40% of an intradialytically administered dose is removed by simultaneous hemodialysis. Although the package insert states "In anuria, a dose of 1000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended", far more frequent doses are needed to maintain therapeutic serum concentrations in patients receiving hemodialysis. Consequently, maintenance vancomycin doses are recommended to be administered with each hemodialysis session to ensure therapeutic serum concentrations throughout the dosing interval.

### Decreasing the time to achieve therapeutic vancomycin concentrations in critically ill patients: developing and testing of a dosing nomogram [^115ujKnc]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

A recent study described a new regimen for CI of vancomycin during continuous renal replacement therapy, which allowed the achievement of target drug concentrations in 63% of patients at 24 h. Our study, using a dosing regimen guided by a dosing nomogram that is based on the 8 h CL CR and after an adequate loading dose, permitted us to reach the target drug concentration in most patients on day 1 (n = 21/25, 84%), providing optimal and early antibiotic exposure in the septic patient, with negligible secondary effects (only one patient with a minor increase in serum creatinine concentration, without evolution to renal failure or need for interruption of the treatment). Roberts et al. conducted a population pharmacokinetic analysis of vancomycin CI in a large cohort of critically ill patients, using a Monte Carlo dose simulation for different total body weight, for different creatinine clearances and for different weight-based dosing vancomycin CI regimens. The authors found that higher-than-recommended loading and daily doses of vancomycin seem to be necessary to rapidly achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in these patients. In addition, they state that a patient with a CL CR of 100 ml/minute/1.73 m 2 would require at least 35 mg/kg per day by CI to maintain target concentrations. Curiously, when we use the average weight of our 25 patients belonging to group 2 (75 kg), we found very similar results: 2.625 mg versus 2.600 mg (according to Table 3) in a period of 24 h, respectively. Both approaches seem to exhibit some complementarity: a retrospective development of a model and, on the other hand, a clinical prospective validation of a nomogram, respectively.

Vancomycin pediatric dosing — trough targets and AUC/MIC attainment are characterized as follows: Retrospective non-Bayesian studies targeted trough concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L in children. In preschool-aged children 2 to 5 years old, a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day achieved the target trough in only 17%. Other cohorts required higher doses, with dosages of 70 to 80 mg/kg/day necessary to achieve trough concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L, and dosages higher than 60 mg/kg/day necessary to achieve an AUC/MIC of ≥ 400 in children with cancer (mean age 6 [SD, 2.5] years). Separately, in children 2 to 12 years of age, a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day achieved AUC/MICss values between 386 and 583 (assuming a MICss of 1 mg/L).

### Correlation of calculated vancomycin trough concentrations and exposure: a monte carlo simulation [^116n3iKG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current recommendations are to dose vancomycin to target 24-hour area under the curve (AUC) of 400–600 mg·h/L to optimize efficacy and safety. Limited data support AUC monitoring, and some centers continue to use trough concentrations. A target of 10–20 mg/L has been proposed to reduce nephrotoxicity risk.

Objective

To use previously published pharmacokinetic equations in a Monte Carlo simulation relating AUC exposure to trough concentrations when targeting an AUC between 400 and 600 mg·h/L.

Methods

Previously published pharmacokinetic data were used as input parameters for a Monte Carlo simulation using previously published formulae to correlate AUC to simulated trough concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assumed to occur in a normal distribution pattern. We excluded irrelevant simulated cases. Maintenance doses of 15 mg/kg were rounded to the nearest 250 mg. Calculated trough concentrations for AUCs of both 400 and 600 mg·h/L were evaluated in each simulation.

Results

A total of 10000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed. Targeting an AUC of 400 mg·h/L resulted in a mean trough concentration of 10.3 ± 0.8 mg/L. Targeting an AUC of 600 mg·h/L resulted in a mean trough concentration of 15.4 ± 1.2 mg/L.

Conclusion and Relevance

We demonstrate that a lower trough concentration range may be supported by an AUC of 400–600 mg·h/L, which may reduce risk and rates of nephrotoxicity without compromising previously established efficacious target trough concentrations.

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^113kEbkh]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our single-centre, retrospective population analysis of PK of vancomyin following intermittent infusion in critically ill patients receiving CVVHDF suggests that, based on PTA plots, we could achieve acceptable trough concentrations early in treatment with a 2 g loading dose and maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly for the majority of patients. No continuous covariates explored resulted in a clinically significant improvement over the base pharmacokinetic model. Vasopressor use, RCA status and dialysis-related covariates are suggested for further analysis with richer data, to optimise covariate PK modelling of vancomycin in ICU patients on CVVHDF and support dose optimisation. It is crucial that an adequate vancomycin loading dose is administered early in therapy and followed by a suitable maintenance regimen to sustain adequate vancomycin levels.

Vancomycin loading doses in pediatrics — preliminary evidence: Loading doses of 25 to 30 mg/kg for critically ill adults have been suggested to achieve steady-state concentrations more quickly, but preliminary data on pediatric patients suggest that the benefit of a loading dose of 30 mg/kg is quickly lost if the maintenance dose is insufficient to provide adequate ongoing exposure. The concept of a loading dose accompanied by a daily maintenance dose sufficient to achieve the target exposure and initiated at a specified time after the loading dose should be investigated.

For Regimen 4 (2 g loading, then 1.5 g at 12 h, then 24 hourly), the approximate probability of a level of 15 mg/L was > 80% at 12 h and 70–80% at 36 h. The approximate probability of a level of 20 mg/L < 20% at 12 and 36 h. Plots at 24 and 48 h were not applicable due to the dosing regimen.

The probability of a level of 25 mg/L was negligible at all investigated time points for each of the simulated dosage regimens.

As target vancomycin trough concentrations are 15–20 mg/L, the results suggest that a 2 g loading dose would be required to achieve adequate trough concentrations (> 15 mg/L) early in treatment. A maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly results in a high probability of achieving at least 15 mg/L levels with approximately 20–30% of patients achieving a level of 20 mg/L and a very small percentage levels > 20 mg/L.

Additional file 1: Fig. S1 gives PTA plots for AUC/MIC of vancomycin at 24–48 h of treatment. This aligned with our advocated dose of 2 g vancomycin loading, followed by 750 mg 12 hourly, which resulted approximately in a 100% probability of attaining a target AUC of 400 mg/L * h for MIC 1 mg/L, in keeping with the recommended target AUC/MIC ratio for clinical efficacy from the guidelines. Additional file 1: Fig. S2 gives PTA plots for peak concentration after the 36 h dose, based on the timepoint (h) closest to when the peak would be measured in practice for each infusion. To mitigate risks of toxicity, it is recommended to avoid peaks in excess of 40 mg/L, and the simulated dosage regimens explored in the current work are not associated with a risk of toxic peak concentrations.

### Attainment of therapeutic vancomycin level within the first 24 h: authors' response [^114bQk23]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A nomogram for dosing vancomycin can be easily used at the bedside of the patient, providing rapidly personalized dosing. One of the key factors facilitating the nomogram is the fact that renal clearance of vancomycin is strongly correlated with the measured urinary creatinine clearance (CL CR). Unfortunately, it is more common in clinical practice to use the less accurate mathematical estimates of renal function in unstable patients, instead of measured CL CR. Such an approach serves to compromise the reliability of the nomogram in the critical care setting.

We appreciate and read with interest the comments of Honoré et al. regarding our study in 2014, where we developed and validated a dosing nomogram for vancomycin in CI in a population of critically ill patients. Some clarifications, however, are needed. First, we never intended to compare CI with a LD of vancomycin; instead, we used, sequentially, LD (between 1 and 1.5 g) followed by CI (30 mg/kg/day). Later, with nomogram-guided dosing using an 8 h-CL CR, we achieved target vancomycin exposures in 84% of patients in the validation group in the first 24 h. Of these, 40% had demonstrated augmented renal clearance (8 h-CL CR > 130 mL/min/1.73m 2). Secondly, patients with compromised renal function or needing of renal replacement therapy were excluded in our study, meaning that our nomogram should not be considered applicable to this group of patients. Third, the volume of distribution and the half-life of vancomycin increases significantly in critically ill patients with renal insufficiency. On the other hand, vancomycin (medium molecular size molecule) is effectively cleared by continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT). Considering the large inter-study variability, there is no clear recommendation about the optimal vancomycin regimen during CRRT. A vancomycin loading dose of 15–20 mg/kg actual body weight would likely be more appropriate in CRRT patients. Finally, future studies confirming our dosing protocol are welcome; however, the chosen target population should be similar (with exclusion of patients under CRRT) so that the obtained results can be extrapolated to different contexts.

### Membrane adsorption in vancomycin treatment is membrane type dependent in CVVHDF: dose correction is crucial [^115stkL6]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Kirwan et al. concluded that target attainment with acceptable trough vancomycin concentrations can be achieved early in treatment with a 2000 mg loading dose and maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly for patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). However, the Kirwan study was completed 7 years ago, using a polyarylethersulfone (PAES) which is well known to be a non-adsorptive membrane. In current practice, more than 95% of treatments with the Prismaflex take place with the adsorptive acrylonitrile 69 surface treated (AN69-ST), which also absorbs significant amounts of vancomycin. Accordingly, using a loading dose of 2000 mg and a maintenance dose of 750 mg/12 h in CVVHDF with the present day standard of practice, using a prismaflex with an AN69ST, could risk treatment failure. In a recent study comparing adsorption of vancomycin in AN69ST versus Polysulphone (PS) (with similar specifications to non-adsorptive membranes such as PAES), there was a significant adsorption of roughly 200 mg in 2 h by AN69ST compared to PS. In vitro, Tian studied vancomycin adsorption of AN69, polyamide, and PS membranes in a hemofiltration model. Vancomycin (36 mg) was added to a volume of a blood-crystalloid (target concentration 50 mg/l). Adsorption, calculated by the fall in concentration over 120 min, in the 0.6-m 2 AN69 filters was significantly greater (10.08 ± 2.26 mg) than in the 0.6-m 2 polyamide (5.20 ± 1.82 mg) or in the 0.7-m 2 PS (4.80 ± 2.40 mg) filters. Theoretically, an AN69ST membrane could therefore irreversibly take up almost one third of the initial dose. If proven in vivo, loading and maintenance vancomycin doses would have to be adapted accordingly. Because we routinely apply continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using the AN69 ST, we were able to retrospectively demonstrate that daily vancomycin maintenance doses close to 3,000 mg daily were needed during the first 3 treatment days. Choi demonstrated that, within the first hour after changing the membrane, a striking decline in vancomycin trough concentration occurred, which necessitated a considerable increase in the continuous infusion dose.

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^1162eSvn]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

This point-prevalence study shows that vancomycin dosing practice results in too many patients being underdosed even with the availability of TDM. In order to overcome the risk of inadequate concentrations, new approaches should be considered such as the use of weight-based loading doses as well as administration by continuous infusion. In one study by De Waele et al. administering a loading dose of 1000 mg (< 65 kg) or 1500 mg (> 65 kg) followed by a continuous infusion of 2000 mg/24 h, the authors found that 78% and 88% of critically ill patients reached a serum concentration ≥ 15 mg/L on day two and three respectively. In a dosing simulation analysis, Roberts et al. demonstrated that at least 35 mg/kg/24 h administered by continuous infusion is needed to maintain a concentrations ≥ 20 mg/L in some patients. Alternatively, some authors have proposed the use of a vancomycin dosing nomogram for ICU patients. One recent nomogram that takes into account body weight for loading and maintenance dosing, and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation for dosing frequency. Although the nomogram resulted in a significant increase in patients achieving the target trough concentration, still 28% of patients had sub-therapeutic vancomycin exposures. Given the high variability in vancomycin concentrations, TDM should be considered essential, but as shown from this data, does not guarantee achievement of target concentrations.

This study has some limitations. First, we could not evaluate clinical outcome data as only nine patients had documented Gram-positive infections, the remaining patients were administered empiric therapy. However, this data does provide good insight into the PK/PD exposures of vancomycin that occur with contemporary dosing approaches. Second, PD calculations used assumed MIC values. For detailed analyses an assumed MIC = 1 mg/L was used because in Europe only 8% of S. aureus MICs for vancomycin are > 1 mg/L. Third, no data about potential loading doses were available.

### A randomized controlled trial of a vancomycin loading dose in children [^114hCna6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its frequent use, the optimal dosing regimen of intravenous vancomycin remains controversial. Achievement of therapeutic trough early in the course of illness may be beneficial. Our objective was to assess whether a loading dose of vancomycin would increase the proportion of children reaching target trough concentrations 8 hours after initiation of therapy.

Methods

We enrolled hospitalized children aged 2–18 years prescribed vancomycin at Boston Children's Hospital between February 2011 and January 2012. Participants were randomized to receive a loading dose (30 mg/kg) or a conventional initial dose (20 mg/kg). These were followed by a 20 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours in both groups. Serum vancomycin concentrations were measured before the second and third doses. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using individual and population pharmacokinetic models.

Results

Two of nineteen (11%) loading dose recipients had a trough 15–20 mg/L before the second dose, compared with 0 of 27 in the conventional dose group (P = 0.17). However, the median area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration estimates (for a hypothetical minimum inhibitory concentration = 1 mg/L) were above 400 in both groups. Red man syndrome incidence was higher in loading dose recipients (48% vs. 24%, P = 0.06).

Conclusions

A vancomycin loading dose did not result in earlier achievement of therapeutic trough concentrations in this study. However, the systemic exposure to vancomycin in children administered 60 mg/kg/day was adequate, despite lower than recommended measured trough levels. Therefore, the need for higher target trough concentrations should be questioned.

Therapeutic monitoring practices — historically, monitoring centered on maintaining trough concentrations between 15 and 20 mg/L for serious infections due to MRSA, with previous expert guidelines recommending trough concentrations as a surrogate marker for the AUC/MIC ratio due to the historical difficulty in estimating AUC in clinical practice, and the guideline viewed trough-directed dosing as a more practical alternative to AUC/MIC-guided dosing in clinical practice.

Probability of target attainment (PTA) plots

PTA plots were generated by performing Monte Carlo simulations (n = 1000) using the final (base) model. Four exploratory dosing regimens were considered for determination of initial therapeutic vancomycin dosing: 2 g loading dose followed by either 750 mg or 500 mg every 12 h, 2 g loading followed by 1.5 g at 12 h and then 1.5 g 24-hourly thereafter, or 1.5 g loading followed by 750 mg every 12 h. The investigated target was trough concentration every 12–24 h as relevant up to 48 h post-first-dose. Our unit vancomycin trough target range is 15–20 mg/L. We considered at least an 80% probability of achieving a trough of 15 mg/L from 12 h onwards to be clinically acceptable. To consider potentially toxic peak concentrations, PTA plots for peak concentrations of 20–40 mg/L after the 36 h dose were generated.

As an additional sensitivity analysis, we produced PTA plots for AUC/MIC (area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration) of vancomycin at 24–48 h treatment, given the recent change in guidelines which now recommends AUC-guided dosing and monitoring of vancomycin, though not yet adopted in our clinical practice.

Key messages

Augmented renal clearance appears to be quite common in sub-populations of critically ill patients and can lead to very low serum concentrations of vancomycin on the first day of treatment
Clinicians are used to adjusting the dosing of antibiotics according to renal failure; however the adjustment to elevated function of the kidneys appears important to ensure target concentrations are achieved
This study prospectively validated a new vancomycin dosing nomogram based on the 8-hours renal clearance of creatinine and demonstrated that it is possible to increase the likelihood of target attainment in the first 24 h of treatment, particularly in patients with augmented renal clearance
Adequate serum concentrations of vancomycin should be confirmed with therapeutic drug monitoring, particularly in patients with extreme renal function alteration

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric vancomycin exposure targets — dosing in children should be designed to achieve an AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L); this PK target range, specifically a range closer to an AUC/ MIC of 400 rather than 600, has been widely used by investigators to model pediatric dosing and therapeutic monitoring. With inadequate PK studies and outcomes data to support the higher end of the AUC target range in pediatrics, it is prudent to aim for an AUC/MIC of 400 in pediatrics to limit the development of exposure-related AKI. In pediatrics, an AUC/MIC target of 400 is more readily achievable than it is in adults and correlates to trough concentrations of 7 to 10 mg/L rather than concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L as are reported in adults, and this wide variability in trough concentrations between these populations with regard to achieving an AUC/ MIC of 400 corroborates the need for an AUC-guided approach to dosing and monitoring.

Vancomycin MAG

Children with normal renal function are usually started on an initial dose of 40 mg/kg divided q6–8 hourly for mild to moderate infections. The guide involves no loading dose for any patient. Based on the estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl), using the bedside Schwartz equation, the interval of daily vancomycin dosing is selected. The goal trough concentration for treatment of general infection is 7–15 mg/L, and for severe infection is > 15–20 mg/dL. The guide also proposes a dosage adjustment based on the serum trough level and the dosage interval is extended by two hours (i.e. q6h is changed to q8h) for supratherapeutic trough levels. However, if the child has a subtherapeutic reading, the dose is increased by 2.5 mg/kg/dose (i.e. 10 mg/kg is changed to 12.5 mg/kg). According to the MAG, serum trough levels are usually obtained 15–30 min before the fourth dose for patients receiving the drug at an interval less than 24 h; otherwise, it is tested before the third dose if the dosing interval is 24 h or longer. The level is repeated every 5–7 days after achieving the target level.

Data collection

Data were collected using the hospital's electronic database where all patient records were checked daily for vancomycin orders. The baseline characteristics were sociodemographic variables, including weight, height, and gender. The clinical variables were comorbidities, type of cardiac lesion, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, the presence of fever, and laboratory values (i.e. WBC, platelets, ESR, CRP, culture, SCr, BUN). These values were recorded at baseline and daily whenever available. The SCr and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were monitored at baseline then every three to five days providing that the kidney function was stable, and no concomitant nephrotoxic medication was administered, otherwise, more frequent monitoring was required. The Jaffé method, specifically through the kinetic Alkaline Picrate reaction, is used in our hospital for the measurement of serum creatinine levels. Information related to the vancomycin therapy (i.e. indication, initial dose and frequency, first trough level at steady state, number of dose adjustments, and duration of therapy) were also collected. The serum vancomycin concentrations were measured and analyzed at the main laboratory of our institution using the particle-enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay method (Siemens Dimension; Dade Behring, Deerfield, Illinois, PETINIA).

### Should therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve Be standard for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections?-No [^116MYdo4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In this counterpoint we critically appraise the evidence supporting therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We reveal methodologically weaknesses and inconsistencies in the data and suggest that, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of benefit compared with modestly reducing trough targets, alternative strategies are more likely to result in superior safety and efficacy. These include focusing on fundamental antibiotic stewardship to limit vancomycin exposure overall, achieving earlier and more complete source control, and establishing alternative therapeutic options to vancomycin. Implementation of AUC24-based therapeutic drug monitoring will take resources away from these more promising, alternative solutions.

Vancomycin monitoring in intermittent hemodialysis — area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) guidance states that efficacy data are unavailable for AUC values of < 400 mg·h/L; monitoring based on predialysis serum concentrations and extrapolating these values to estimated AUC is most practical, maintaining predialysis concentrations between 15 and 20 mg/L to achieve the AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L in the previous 24 hours (C-III), and predialysis serum concentration monitoring should be performed not less than weekly and should drive subsequent dosing, with the recommended doses providing a useful starting point until serum concentrations have been determined (B-II).

Patients With Impaired Renal Function and Elderly Patients

Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with impaired renal function. In premature infants and the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measurement of vancomycin serum concentrations can be helpful in optimizing therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function. Vancomycin serum concentrations can be determined by use of microbiologic assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, fluorescence immunoassay, or high-pressure liquid chromatography.

If creatinine clearance can be measured or estimated accurately, the dosage for most patients with renal impairment can be calculated using the following table. The dosage of vancomycin per day in mg is about 15 times the glomerular filtration rate in mL/min (see following table).

The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg, even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.

The table is not valid for functionally anephric patients. For such patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations. The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1.9 mg/kg/24 hr. In patients with marked renal impairment, it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1,000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis. In anuria, a dose of 1,000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended.

When only serum creatinine is known, the following formula (based on sex, weight and age of the patient) may be used to calculate creatinine clearance. Calculated creatinine clearances (mL/min) are only estimates. The creatinine clearance should be measured promptly.

The serum creatinine must represent a steady state of renal function. Otherwise, the estimated value for creatinine clearance is not valid. Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions:

(1) characterized by decreasing renal function, such as shock, severe heart failure, or oliguria; (2) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present, such as in obese patients or those with liver disease, edema, or ascites; and (3) accompanied by debilitation, malnutrition, or inactivity.

The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administration by the intrathecal (intralumbar or intraventricular) routes have not been established.

Intermittent infusion is the recommended method of administration.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Infusion-related events are related to both the concentration and the rate of administration of vancomycin. Concentrations of no more than 5 mg/mL and rates of no more than 10 mg/min are recommended in adults (see also age-specific recommendations). In selected patients in need of fluid restriction, a concentration up to 10 mg/mL may be used; use of such higher concentrations may increase the risk of infusion-related events. An infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Infusion-related events may occur, however, at any rate or concentration.

Patients with normal renal function

Adults

The usual daily intravenous dose is 2 g divided either as 500 mg every 6 hours or 1 g every 12 hours. Each dose should be administered at no more than 10 mg/min or over a period of at least 60 minutes, whichever is longer. Other patient factors, such as age or obesity, may call for modification of the usual intravenous daily dose.

Pediatric patients

The usual intravenous dosage of vancomycin is 10 mg/kg per dose given every 6 hours. Each dose should be administered over a period of at least 60 minutes. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be warranted in these patients.

Neonates

In pediatric patients up to the age of 1 month, the total daily intravenous dosage may be lower. In neonates, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg is suggested, followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for neonates in the 1st week of life and every 8 hours thereafter up to the age of 1 month. Each dose should be administered over 60 minutes. In premature infants, vancomycin clearance decreases as postconceptional age decreases. Therefore, longer dosing intervals may be necessary in premature infants. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin is recommended in these patients.

Pediatric vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — AUC-guided therapeutic monitoring for vancomycin, preferably with Bayesian estimation, is suggested for all pediatric age groups based on developmental changes of vancomycin clearance (CL) documented from the newborn to the adolescent; the suggestion aligns with adults, including application of Bayesian estimation after 1 trough concentration or first-order pharmacokinetic (PK) equations with 2 concentrations (B-II). Both serum concentrations of vancomycin and renal function should be monitored since vancomycin CL and CLcr are not always well correlated in pediatrics, and aggressive dosing to maintain target AUC exposure and decrease the risk of potential acute kidney injury (AKI) in treatment of MRSA infection necessitates drug monitoring.

### Vancomycin advanced therapeutic drug monitoring: exercise in futility or virtuous endeavor to improve drug efficacy and safety? [^117SAic6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin is commonly prescribed to hospitalized patients. Decades of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic research culminated in recommendations to monitor the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to the minimum inhibitory concentration in order to optimize vancomycin exposure and minimize toxicity in the revised 2020 guidelines. These guideline recommendations are based on limited data without high-quality evidence and limitations in strength. Despite considerable effort placed on vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), clinicians should recognize that the majority of vancomycin use is empiric. Most patients prescribed empiric vancomycin do not require it beyond a few days. For these patients, AUC determinations during the initial days of vancomycin exposure are futile. This added workload may detract from high-level patient care activities. Loading doses likely achieve AUC targets, so AUC monitoring after a loading dose is largely unnecessary for broad application. The excessive vancomycin TDM for decades has been propagated with limitations in evidence, and it should raise caution on contemporary vancomycin TDM recommendations.

Vancomycin MIC assumptions and dosing — under most circumstances of empiric dosing, the vancomycin MIC should be assumed to be 1 mg/L. When the MICBMD is > 1 mg/L, the probability of achieving an AUC/MIC target of ≥ 400 is low with conventional dosing; higher doses may risk unnecessary toxicity, and the decision to change therapy should be based on clinical judgment. In addition, when the MICBMD is ≤ 1 mg/L, we do not recommend decreasing the dose to achieve the AUC/MIC target, and limitations in automated susceptibility testing methods include the lack of precision and variability in MIC results depending on method used (B-II).

### Adequacy of a vancomycin dosing regimen in patients receiving high-flux hemodialysis [^1167h1R9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Some investigators have recommended the convenient practice of administering vancomycin doses during the last hour of the hemodialysis treatment. Accepting that a greater amount of vancomycin is lost to dialysis with this recent approach, the objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and assess the adequacy of this dosing regimen in maintaining therapeutic predialysis concentrations.

Methods

A sampling of 22 consecutive patients administered intradialytic vancomycin, 1 g, intravenously (IV) and maintenance doses of 500 mg during the last hour of high-flux dialysis sessions was studied. A population-modeling program and Bayesian pharmacokinetic analysis were used to identify all global and unique pharmacokinetic parameters of interest based on measured vancomycin predialysis concentrations.

Results

For the 22 patients studied, this regimen achieved the targeted predialysis concentration range of 5 to 20 microg/mL for 96% of levels, whereas more narrowly within 5 to 15 microg/mL for 86% of levels. Average amount of vancomycin removed during a standardized 3- to 4-hour dialytic session ranged from 30% ± 7% to 38% ± 8%. Average elimination half-life of vancomycin on hemodialysis treatment was 5.4 hours (interquartile range, 5.0 to 5.9 hours). Patients showed an average predialysis plasma concentration of 11 ± 3 microg/mL for the first 7 days of therapy.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that intradialytic dosing with vancomycin using a 1-g IV load and 500 mg IV with subsequent high-flux dialysis sessions conveniently maintains adequate predialysis plasma concentrations. The lack of drug accumulation with this regimen provides convincing support for a limited blood sampling approach to plasma concentration determinations.

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^115Uy4Uq]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major pathogen in severe healthcare-associated infections. In the past decades, the anti-MRSA armamentarium has broadened. Still, vancomycin remains the most common first-line option for treating severe infections with parenteral therapy. Achievement of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices associated with maximal bacterial kill is recommended to increase the likelihood of clinical cure. To achieve target serum concentrations in life-threatening infections such as sepsis, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia, current guidelines recommend trough serum concentrations of vancomycin (C min) ranging 15 to 20 mg/L. Such serum concentrations should achieve an area under the concentration-time curve over a 24-hour period divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected bacteria (AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio) of > 400 (assuming an MIC ≤ 1 mg/L). This threshold was significantly associated with favourable clinical and bacteriological outcomes in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and therefore generally accepted as the appropriate PK/PD target. Other investigators confirmed that an AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio for optimizing clinical outcomes should be at least 400.

Pediatric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) vancomycin dosing based on area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) is anchored to an AUC target of 400 mg·h/L (but potentially up to 600 mg·h/L), assuming a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≤ 1 mg/L, and the initial recommended dosage for children with normal renal function and suspected serious MRSA infections is 60 to 80 mg/kg/day in divided doses given every 6 hours for children ages 3 months to less than 12 years, or 60 to 70 mg/kg/day in divided doses given every 6 to 8 hours for those ≥ 12 years old (A-II). The maximum empiric daily dose is usually 3,600 mg in children with adequate renal function (C-III), most children generally should not require more than 3,000 mg/day, and doses should be adjusted based on observed concentrations to achieve the AUC/MIC target; early monitoring of observed concentrations is recommended when doses exceed 2,000 to 3,000 mg/day (A-II), and close monitoring of observed concentrations and renal function is prudent in patients with poor or augmented renal clearance, as resolution of their renal function abnormalities may occur within the first 5 days of therapy.

Bayesian-derived AUC monitoring for vancomycin — dose optimization uses Bayesian software with minimal pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling to estimate AUC and provide AUC-guided dosing recommendations in real time, for example using 1 or 2 vancomycin concentrations, or alternatively using 2 concentrations (peak and trough) with simple analytic PK equations. The Bayesian method uses a vancomycin population PK model as the prior together with the patient's observed drug concentrations to calculate a Bayesian posterior, allows concentrations to be collected within the first 24 to 48 hours rather than after the third or fourth dose to enable adaptive feedback control, and can support front-loading doses with subsequent transition to a lower maintenance regimen to rapidly achieve target concentrations within the first 24 to 48 hours among critically ill patients; programs are now readily available and can be used in real time to identify the optimal vancomycin dosage that achieves the AUC target (assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L).

### Vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during short daily hemodialysis [^1139YmTG]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Short daily hemodialysis (SDHD) is an alternative to thrice-weekly HD because of its putative physiologic benefits. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SDHD on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vancomycin.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Six noninfected adults who had anuria and were treated with SDHD were studied and received four dialysis sessions over 4 days. After completion of the first SDHD, each patient received vancomycin 15 mg/kg by intravenous infusion. Blood samples were collected over the ensuing 3 days during each subsequent inter- and intradialytic period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. Serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for four vancomycin regimens with maintenance doses administered after every other SDHD. Area under the serum-concentration time curve (AUC) from 0 to 48 hours, 48 to 96 hours, and 96 to 144 hours were calculated, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the probability of target attainment at an AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio ≥ 800 for each 48-hour AUC at MICs ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 μg/ml.

Results

Median (range) systemic clearance was 7.2 ml/min (5.3 to 10.0 ml/min), and dialytic clearance was 104 ml/min (94 to 106 ml/min). The steady-state volume of distribution was 55.4 L (34.8 to 77.2 L). At MICs ≤ 1 μg/ml, probability of target attainment was > 90% for each 48-hour AUC when vancomycin was administered as a 20-mg/kg loading dose followed by 10 mg/kg after every other SDHD.

Conclusions

Vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters in SDHD are consistent with data from thrice-weekly HD. A loading dose of 20 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg after every other SDHD provides adequate exposure for pathogens with MICs ≤ 1 μg/ml.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Empiric maintenance regimen in children — published retrospective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data in children suggest that current vancomycin dosing of 45 to 60 mg/ kg/day (in divided doses administered every 6 to 8 hours) may be insufficient to achieve currently recommended target for adults of an AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L). In fact, higher dosages, ranging from 60 to 80 mg/kg/day and given in divided doses every 6 hours, may be needed to achieve these targets for MRSA strains with a vancomycin MIC of 1 mg/L or less, and for children infected by MRSA pathogens with a MIC of > 1 mg/L, it is unlikely that the target exposure can be reliably achieved with previously investigated dosages of vancomycin in children. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling indicated that to achieve an AUC/MIC of ≥ 400 in 90% of subjects, a dosage of 80 mg/kg/ day was necessary, particularly in those less than 12 years of age with normal renal function; at a dosage of 80 mg/ kg/day, the median AUC and median trough concentration were 675 mg·h/L and 16 mg/L, respectively. As expected, subjects 12 years of age or older achieved similar exposure at lower dosages of 60 to 70 mg/kg/day, and at a dosage of 60 to 70 mg/kg/day (divided doses administered every 6 hours), an AUC of 400 mg·h/L correlated to a mean trough of 8 to 9 mg/L.

### Decreasing the time to achieve therapeutic vancomycin concentrations in critically ill patients: developing and testing of a dosing nomogram [^116ZgYsF]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA) were measured. The DuBois and DuBois formula was used to calculate BSA as follows:

A daily 8 h CL CR was collected during the patient's ICU admission, between 23:00 h and 07:00 h, as part of the daily routine procedure in our unit. This measurement used a standard urinary collection (via indwelling catheter) for the 8-h period following measurement of creatinine concentration in urine (u) and blood (s) for calculation of 8 h CL CR (ml/minute/1.73 m 2), according to the formula:

Augmented renal clearance was defined as 8 h CL CR > 130 ml/minute/1.73 m 2. Exclusion criteria were the following: 1) need for renal replacement therapy; 2) serum creatinine concentration > 1.3 mg/dL; 3) known chronic kidney disease; 4) age under 18 years; 5) pregnancy, and 6) ICU stay of less than 48 h. Using a previously described methodology, we calculated the vancomycin plasma clearance (CL vanco) according to the formula:

Where IR represents infusion rate of vancomycin by CI and C ss represents the vancomycin serum concentration at pseudo steady-state. Relationship between CL vanco and 8 h CL CR was used to define a dosing nomogram for vancomycin for different 8 h CL CR that targets a target C ss of 25 mg/L. The rationale behind the choice of 25 mg/L as the ideal target was based on current recommendations and on the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) characteristics of vancomycin. The resultant dosing nomogram was then prospectively applied for vancomycin dosing by CI in the ICU (after adequate loading dose). Thereafter, we collected data on the serum drug concentration on day 1 on the first 25 treated critically ill septic patients (group 2). Vancomycin treatment was initiated at the discretion of the ICU physician. Inclusion criteria for the second cohort were as following: 1) evaluation of 8 h CL CR the day of initiation of vancomycin; 2) stable renal function; 3) administration of loading and maintenance dose per protocol, and 4) interval between loading dose and TDM for vancomycin > 12 h and < 24 h.

This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Coimbra University Hospitals (CHUC-114–13), which waived the need for informed consent.

Serious MRSA infections — daily vancomycin area under the curve (AUC) values (assuming a minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] of 1 mg/L) should be maintained between 400 and 600 mg·h/L to minimize the likelihood of nephrotoxicity and maximize efficacy; once invasive MRSA is ruled out by culture or clinical presentation, empiric vancomycin at guideline-recommended exposures should be de-escalated by decreasing vancomycin exposure or initiating alternative antibiotics, and extrapolation of these recommendations to noninvasive MRSA and other pathogens should be viewed with extreme caution.

Vancomycin maintenance dosing and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based monitoring in obesity rely on estimated clearance (CL), commonly using the Cockcroft-Gault equation with patient age, sex, Scr, and body size, though there is considerable controversy regarding the optimal body size metric. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) study in obese patients (n = 346) with BMI values of 30.1 to 85.7 kg/m2 and body weights of 70 to 294 kg proposed an equation to estimate vancomycin CL based on age, sex, Scr (IDMS traceable), and allometrically scaled body weight. The population model-estimated vancomycin CL multiplied by the target AUC estimates the initial daily maintenance dose; in obese patients an average CL of approximately 6 L/h equates to an AUC of approximately 500 mg*h/L with a daily dose of 3,000 mg, and empiric maintenance doses above 4,500 mg/day are not expected because vancomycin CL rarely exceeds 9 L/h. Population PK models cannot account for more than 50% of the interindividual variability, and AUC accuracy is improved by measuring both a peak collected at least 1 hour after the end of infusion and a trough, after which trough-only Bayesian estimation is achievable in physiologically stable patients.

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^1143htA5]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

As target concentrations are 15–20 mg/L, our PTA plots suggest that a 2 g loading dose would be required to achieve adequate trough concentrations (> 15 mg/L) early in treatment. The unit policy of a 25 mg/kg loading dose would result in a patient of average body weight in this cohort (82 kg) receiving a dose of approximately 2 g. This suggests that patients below average body weight might be inadequately loaded. Although there may be clinical reticence to prescribe substantial vancomycin doses to patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) on CRRT, the average trough concentration of 15.7 mg/L noted in Table 2 suggests that there is scope to revisit the loading doses used in this cohort. Given that many patients receive the first vancomycin dose prior to entering ICU, with 18/24 (75%) patients in our study commencing vancomycin treatment prior to CVVHDF, these results suggest a need to focus on adequate loading doses to ensure therapeutic concentrations are achieved. The PTA plots suggest that a maintenance dose of 750 mg commencing 12 h post dose results in a high probability of achieving at least 15 mg/L pre-dose levels but is also associated with a higher probability of achieving potentially undesirably high concentrations, with approximately 20–30% of patients predicted to achieve concentrations of 20 mg/L. Notwithstanding this, the proportion of patients with predicted concentrations of 25 mg/L is low when using this high dose. Use of a 500 mg 12 hourly maintenance dose could be considered in instances where there is a toxicity concern; though the model predicts decreasing proportions will have successful concentrations with this maintenance dose from 12 to 48 h, despite the initial loading dose.

### Vancomycin dosing in children: what is the question? [^116XqSRe]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been in clinical use for over 60 years, but it is still not clear what dose should be given to children. Effective treatment with vancomycin requires a serum concentration well above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bacteria being treated. This is predicted by the area under the concentration curve (AUC) divided by the MIC being > 400 (AUC/MIC). Recent concerns about increasing MIC in staphylococci have lead to recommendations to aim for higher trough vancomycin levels (15–20 mg/L). In current practice, most children do not achieve these trough levels. Modelling and pharmacokinetic studies in children suggest these trough levels may not be necessary if the MIC of the organisms is 1 mg/L or less. Further, large-scale studies are needed to determine the most appropriate dosing of vancomycin in children. While awaiting these, it is time to consider moving to 15 mg/kg 6 h as a standard starting regime for vancomycin. It is also vital to determine the MIC of the organism being treated, as this may give some guidance about suitable trough levels to be aimed for. There is currently little evidence to guide the use of loading doses or continuous vancomycin infusions in children.

### Standard operating procedures for antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of acute kidney injury: a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study [^116jzcKG]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

SOP evaluation for the therapy with vancomycin

Every consecutive day was evaluated for adherence of SOPs. Vancomycin therapy was separately evaluated for continued and intermittent therapy, each with a specific dosing concept based on renal function and pre-existing kidney damage. For vancomycin initiation in adults, a loading dose of 1 g intravenously is recommended. In the continuous dosing regimen this is followed by 2 g over 24 h (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/h with 1 g/24 h, < 20 ml/h with 500 mg/24 h). For intermittent dosing, maintenance doses are recommended with 0.5 g/6 h or 1 g/12 h. Regarding therapeutic drug monitoring in continuous therapy, first measurements are obtained after 24 to 36 h with target levels of 15 to 20 mg/l. In intermittent therapy the trough levels are to be obtained before the fourth application of vancomycin with a target level of 10 to 20 mg/l. During maintenance therapy, SOP conformity required adaptation of dosing regimen according to therapeutic drug monitoring.

SOP evaluation for the therapy with gentamicin and tobramycin

For management of gentamicin and tobramycin therapy, recommendations based on renal function and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were analysed. For initial therapy induction, doses with 3 to 6 mg/Kg body weight in gentamicin and 5 to 7 mg/Kg body weight for tobramycin are used. Maintenance therapy should be adapted to serum trough levels with a 2 mg/l cut off for each agent based on the laboratory reference. The recommendations include adjustment to blood trough levels for the two drugs or dosing adaptation based on elevated serum creatinine levels. Aminoglycosides were administered once daily after achievement of the results of the TDM. Dose adaption was performed according to the results; only if the results were extremely high one dose was omitted. Peak levels have no influence on the dosing and are for this reason not measured regularly.

Calculation of the adherence rate

To calculate adherence rates, each study day on which a patient was treated with either vancomycin, gentamicin or tobramycin was recorded and evaluated as described in detail elsewhere. For combination therapy all related SOPs had to be fulfilled. The binary variable of daily adherence was transferred into a relative variable. Therefore, in each patient the cumulative number of days with SOP conformity was divided by the total number of days with an application of these antibiotics.

Serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — For patients with suspected or definite serious MRSA infections, an individualized target of the AUC/MICBMD ratio of 400 to 600 (assuming a vancomycin MICBMD of 1 mg/L) should be advocated to achieve clinical efficacy while improving patient safety (A-II). Doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg (based on actual body weight) administered every 8 to 12 hours as an intermittent infusion are recommended for most patients with normal renal function assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L (A-II), and these doses may not achieve the therapeutic AUC/MIC target when the MIC is 2 mg/L.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin in serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — AUC-based targets and MIC considerations state that daily AUC values (assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L) should be maintained between 400 and 600 mg·h/L to maximize efficacy and minimize the likelihood of acute kidney injury (AKI). MIC utility is limited because the BMD MIC90 in most institutions is 1 mg/L or less, measurement is imprecise with dilution of ± 1 log and a variation of 10% to 20% considered acceptable, and results are typically not available within the first 72 hours even though the vancomycin AUC/MIC ratio needs to be optimized early in infection; additionally, trough-only monitoring may be insufficient to guide dosing in all patients.

### What proportion of vancomycin trough levels are drawn too early? frequency and impact on clinical actions [^112DRAJk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough levels are recommended to predict vancomycin efficacy, and inaccurate levels may lead to inappropriate clinical actions. However, the frequency of timing errors and associated clinical impact is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed vancomycin levels (n = 2,597) measured during 13 months at a large academic medical center. Of the specimens, 41.3% were drawn too early. These samples yielded significantly higher average ± SD vancomycin concentrations than correctly timed samples (22.1 ± 11.7 mg/L vs 15.5 mg/L ± 8.6 mg/L; P < .001), and, consequently, clinicians were more likely to decrease, discontinue, or hold a patient's vancomycin dose (25.6% vs 21.4%; P < .02) or repeat the vancomycin level (29.2% vs 20.0%; P < .001). A substantial proportion of specimens collected to assess vancomycin efficacy were drawn too early, leading to overestimation of patients' true trough level and possible underdosing of vancomycin or a high rate of repeat tests for vancomycin.

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^112oidFH]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic analyses

The pharmacokinetic values were calculated using non-compartmental methods. The apparent terminal elimination rate constant (kel) was determined from log-linear least squares regression analysis of concentrations from sample A and B. For intermittent infusions, the maximum concentration for the dosing period (C max) was calculated using the following equation:

Where C 0 is the concentration at sample A and τ is the dosing interval in hours. The minimum concentration for the dosing period (C min) was the observed value. Half-life (T 1/2) was calculated as ln(2)/ z. The area under the concentration time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC 0–12) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule with the derived C max estimate. The AUC from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0–24) was calculated using a doubling of AUC 0–12 with pharmacokinetic steady-state assumed for all patients. For patients receiving continuous infusion, the AUC 0–24 was calculated using the average of concentrations for sample A and B multiplied by 24 hours. Vancomycin clearance (CL) was calculated using the equation dose/AUC 0–12.

The AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio was calculated by dividing the AUC 0–24 by MICs 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/L.

Outcome variables

Vancomycin trough concentrations and AUC 0–24 /MIC ratios are the main PK/PD variables. The target trough concentration is defined as ≥ 15 mg/L and the target AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio is defined as > 400.

### A randomized trial of loading vancomycin in the emergency department [^114FZkrY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Optimizing vancomycin dosing may help eradicate bacteria while avoiding resistance. The guidelines recommend loading doses; however, there are no data to demonstrate that this may result in a more rapid achievement of therapeutic troughs.

Objective

To evaluate the percentage of troughs reaching therapeutic levels at 12, 24, and 36 hours following an initial vancomycin dose of 30 mg/kg compared with 15 mg/kg.

Methods

This prospective, randomized study was performed in a community academic medical center. Patients who were to receive vancomycin in the emergency department were randomized to an initial traditional dose of 15 mg/kg or a 30-mg/kg loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 doses. Patients weighing > 120 kg or with creatinine clearances < 50 mL/min were excluded.

Results

In total, 99 patients were enrolled; 12 hours after the initial dose of vancomycin, there was a significantly greater proportion of patients reaching target trough levels of 15 mg/L among the patients who received a loading dose as compared with a traditional dose (34% vs 3%, P < 0.01). This trend continued at 24 hours but was not statistically significant. At 36 hours, there was no difference in the percentage of patients reaching target levels between the 2 groups. No statistically significant difference in nephrotoxicity or adverse events among the 2 groups was demonstrated.

Conclusion

A loading dose of 30 mg/kg of vancomycin achieved a higher percentage of therapeutic levels at 12 hours when compared with the traditional dose of 15 mg/kg, without increased nephrotoxicity or adverse events.

### Trough concentrations of vancomycin: adult therapeutic targets are not appropriate for children [^113bwWTg]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the need for effective vancomycin therapy, there are few data guiding vancomycin monitoring in children. We reviewed retrospectively vancomycin use in children 1 month to 12 years of age. Initial and adjusted target trough vancomycin concentrations in serum were infrequently achieved regardless of the dosing schedule. Currently recommended trough concentrations need to be re-examined with a more detailed pharmacokinetic study in children.

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^113SYmFi]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Therapeutic antibiotic dose monitoring can be particularly challenging in septic patients requiring renal replacement therapy. Our aim was to conduct an exploratory population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis on PK of vancomycin following intermittent infusion in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF); focussing on the influence of dialysis-related covariates.

Methods

This was a retrospective single-centre tertiary level intensive care unit (ICU) study, which included patients treated concurrently with vancomycin and CVVHDF between January 2015 and July 2016. We extracted clinical, laboratory and dialysis data from the electronic healthcare record (EHR), using strict inclusion criteria. A population PK analysis was conducted with a one-compartment model using the PMetrics population PK modelling package. A base structural model was developed, with further analyses including clinical and dialysis-related data to improve model prediction through covariate inclusion. The final selected model simulated patient concentrations using probability of target attainment (PTA) plots to investigate the probability of different dosing regimens achieving target therapeutic concentrations.

Results

A total of 106 vancomycin dosing intervals (155 levels) in 24 patients were examined. An acceptable 1-compartment base model was produced (Plots of observed vs. population predicted concentrations (Obs–Pred) R 2 = 0.78). No continuous covariates explored resulted in a clear improvement over the base model. Inclusion of anticoagulation modality and vasopressor use as categorical covariates resulted in similar PK parameter estimates, with a trend towards lower parameter estimate variability when using regional citrate anti-coagulation or without vasopressor use. Simulations using PTA plots suggested that a 2 g loading dose followed by 750 mg 12 hourly as maintenance dose, commencing 12 h after loading, is required to achieve adequate early target trough concentrations of at least 15 mg/L.

Conclusions

PTA simulations suggest that acceptable trough vancomycin concentrations can be achieved early in treatment with a 2 g loading dose and maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly for critically ill patients on CVVHDF.

Vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — Given the narrow vancomycin AUC range for therapeutic effect and minimal acute kidney injury (AKI) risk, the most accurate and optimal way to manage vancomycin dosing should be through AUC-guided dosing and monitoring (A-II). We recommend to accomplish this in one of two ways. One approach relies on the collection of 2 concentrations obtained near steady-state — a postdistributional peak concentration at 1 to 2 hours after infusion and a trough concentration at the end of the dosing interval — and utilizing first-order pharmacokinetic (PK) equations to estimate the AUC (A-II). It is also highly preferred that concentrations are collected near steady-state conditions.

### An evaluation of the empirical vancomycin dosing guide in pediatric cardiology [^1118k2Ef]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vancomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An initial dose ranging between 40 and 60 mg/kg/day divided q6–8 h is usually sufficient and safe for most pediatric patients. The serum blood level, obtained at a steady state just before the fourth dose, is used as a robust pharmacodynamic marker to ensure drug safety and efficacy. A trough level ranging between 10 and 15 mg/L is often required for general indications, while a higher level ranging between 15 and 20 mg/L is recommended for more complicated infections.

Due to the emergence of bacterial tolerance and resistance, higher doses are currently prescribed to achieve the target vancomycin trough concentration (7–10 mg/L), a level desired for the majority of mild-moderate infections precipitated by MRSA. Major organizations, such as the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, endorses a total daily dose (TDD) of 60–80 mg/kg for children younger than 12 years old, and 60–70 mg/kg for children older than 12 years for MRSA strains with a MIC ≤ 1 mg/L.

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis [^115DwQm4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been a cornerstone antibiotic for the treatment of severe gram-positive infections in dialysis patients for decades. Whereas subtherapeutic vancomycin levels convey a risk of treatment failure and the further emergence of resistance in staphylococci, supratherapeutic vancomycin levels are associated with a dose-related incremental risk for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Consequently, a narrow therapeutic range with a trough-level target between 15 and 20 μg/ml is recommended. Vancomycin dosing in hemodialysis patients is mainly influenced by the timing of administration (during or after dialysis), the type of filter used, and the duration of dialysis. Actual body weight, the interdialytic interval, and residual renal function are also considerations. As in patients with normal kidney function, a weight-based loading dose of 20–25 mg/kg should be used in dialysis patients. While most fixed-dose maintenance regimens fail to reach target levels in the majority of hemodialysis patients, straightforward evidence on optimal maintenance dosing is lacking.

### Performance of a divided-load intravenous vancomycin dosing strategy for obese patients [^116C678q]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend vancomycin trough concentrations of 15 to 20 µg/mL in complicated infections and all trough concentrations > 10 µg/mL to avoid developing microbial resistance. To date, no published protocol reliably meets these recommendations for obese patients.

Objective

We assessed the performance of a novel, obese-specific, divided-load vancomycin protocol for attaining target trough concentrations within 12 to 24 hours of dosing initiation, and during maintenance dosing, in obese patients.

Methods

The protocol was evaluated through prospective medical record review in 54 consecutive obese patients. Vancomycin serum concentrations were drawn before the third and fifth dose after initiation. Steady-state concentrations were drawn after the third dose once maintenance dosing was achieved and periodically thereafter.

Results

Within 12 hours after dosing initiation, 48 (89%) study patients exhibited trough concentrations of 10 to 20 µg/mL averaging 14.5 ± 3.2 µg/mL; 51 (94%) study patients exhibited trough concentrations > 10 µg/mL within 12 hours after dosing initiation, and 3 (6%) had trough concentrations > 20 µg/mL. Thirty-one participants had second trough concentrations drawn within 24 hours of dosing initiation, averaging 15.0 ± 3.1 µg/mL; 24 patients had a total of 32 trough concentrations drawn during maintenance dosing, averaging 15.1 ± 2.5 µg/mL.

Conclusion

Obese-specific, divided-load dosing achieved trough concentrations of 10 to 20 µg/mL for 89% of obese patients within 12 hours of initial dosing and 97% of obese patients within 24 hours of initial dosing while preventing doses given during supratherapeutic trough levels; 97% of troughs measured during steady state were within target range.

Transition to AUC/MIC monitoring — targeting and timing states that clinicians should conservatively target AUC values for suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections assuming a vancomycin broth microdilution (BMD) minimum inhibitory concentration (MICBMD) of 1 mg/L or less, that targeted exposure should be achieved early preferably within the first 24 to 48 hours (A-II), and that Bayesian-derived AUC monitoring may be prudent because it does not require steady-state serum vancomycin concentrations for early assessment.

### Attainment of therapeutic vancomycin level within the first 24 h: authors' response [^115K4F42]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In sepsis, time is life. However, time is not the only variable of the complex equation of antibiotic therapy; the dose of antibiotic administered needs to be adequate. Subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations potentially lead to decreased microbial killing, treatment failure, and emergence of resistance and/or increased mortality. Early therapeutic drug monitoring and timely dose optimization, ideally during the first 24 h, minimize the likelihood of subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations and ineffective antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin remains a first-line option for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Of note, vancomycin is one of the antibiotics with the highest likelihood of under dosing. Continuous infusion (CI), after adequate loading dose (LD), seems to have pharmacological advantages in the critically ill and enables more consistent achievement of therapeutic exposures.

### Initial vancomycin dosing protocol to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113MFBBr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although recent consensus guidelines proposed more aggressive vancomycin troughs of > 10 or 15–20 mg/L for complicated Staphylococcus aureus infections, dosing information to achieve these targets in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is scarce.

Methods

We used Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods with a previously published population-pharmacokinetic model and relevant patient demographics to evaluate and revise our existing vancomycin dosing protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose, with doses infused during the last hour of dialysis). A new protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose for patients < 70 kg, 1250-mg followed by 750-mg for those 70–100 kg, and 1500-mg followed by 1000-mg for those > 100 kg) was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum troughs in patients undergoing high-flux HD.

Results

MCSs predicted that our existing protocol would be suboptimal in more than one-third of patients. Simulations predicted that the new vancomycin dosing protocol would achieve maintenance (pre-HD) troughs of 10–20 mg/L in 86.0% of cases including 15–20 mg/L in 35.2%. In prospective validation, the observed postload trough (pre-HD session 2) was 13.5 ± 3.4 mg/L with 76.9% of levels (20 of 26) between 10 and 20 mg/L. The observed maintenance trough was 17.3 ± 4.0 mg/L with 65.5% (19 of 29) between 10 and 20 mg/L and 89.7% (26 of 29) within 10% of the upper limit (ie, 10–22 mg/L).

Conclusions

In this study, a practical vancomycin dosing protocol for patients undergoing HD was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in the clinical setting.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The intent of the pharmacy bulk package for this product is for preparation of solutions for IV infusion only.

Infusion-related events are related to both the concentration and the rate of administration of vancomycin. Concentrations of no more than 5 mg per mL and rates of no more than 10 mg/min, are recommended in adults (see also age-specific recommendations). In selected patients in need of fluid restriction, a concentration up to 10 mg per mL may be used; use of such higher concentrations may increase the risk of infusion-related events. An infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Infusion-related events may occur, however, at any rate or concentration.

Patients With Normal Renal Function

Adults

The usual daily intravenous dose is 2 grams divided either as 500 mg every 6 hours or 1 gram every 12 hours. Each dose should be administered at no more than 10 mg/min or over a period of at least 60 minutes, whichever is longer. Other patient factors, such as age or obesity, may call for modification of the usual intravenous daily dose.

Pediatric patients

The usual intravenous dosage of vancomycin is 10 mg/kg per dose given every 6 hours. Each dose should be administered over a period of at least 60 minutes. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be warranted in these patients.

Neonates

In pediatric patients up to the age of 1 month, the total daily intravenous dosage may be lower. In neonates, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg is suggested, followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for neonates in the 1stweek of life and every 8 hours thereafter up to the age of 1 month. Each dose should be administered over 60 minutes. In premature infants, vancomycin clearance decreases as postconceptional age decreases. Therefore, longer dosing intervals may be necessary in premature infants. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin is recommended in these patients.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) compared with intermittent infusion (II) in critically ill patients is described as potentially usable when AUC targets cannot be met, as "such regimens may be a reasonable alternative to conventional II dosing when the AUC target cannot be achieved (B-II)". For CI, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg followed by daily maintenance CI of 30 to 40 mg/kg (up to 60 mg/kg) to achieve a target steady-state concentration of 20 to 25 mg/L may be considered (B-III), and AUC24 can be simply calculated by multiplying the steady-state concentration by a factor of 24. In two comparative studies, CI reached target steady-state concentrations of 20 to 25 mg/L faster than II with mean times of 36 (SD, 31) hours vs 51 (SD, 39) hours and 16 (SD, 8) hours vs 50 (SD, 21) hours. Nephrotoxicity with CI appears to be similar or lower than with II when targeting a steady-state concentration of 15 to 25 mg/L and a trough concentration of 10 to 20 mg/L (B-II), and incompatibility concerns in the ICU require the use of independent lines or multiple catheters when CI is considered (A-III).

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^114iDJvQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Standard vancomycin dosing as approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 1 g q12 h, a dose unlikely to give a ratio ≥ 400 unless the MIC is ≤ 0.5 mg/L. Hence, the Guidelines recommend weight‐based dosing (using actual body weight) at 15–20 mg/kg (not to exceed 2 g/dose) q12 h, with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM; trough levels checked at steady state prior to 4 th dose if normal renal function). With serious infections a loading dose of 25–30 mg/kg may be considered. A meta‐analysis confirmed a benefit to TDM with significantly higher rates of clinical efficacy and significantly reduced nephrotoxicity compared to no TDM. 29 The available evidence for attaining a trough ≥ 15 mg/L (vs. < 15 mg/L) may be questionable in terms of predicting an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 as well as for clinical efficacy, but values < 10 mg/L should be avoided to prevent resistance and to attain the target AUC/MIC. 24 TDM is especially necessary in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Many have decreased kidney function, but others have augmented renal clearance with lower than expected trough levels. 30

Alternative methods to guide vancomycin dosing by intermittent infusion have been published. One nomogram is based on population pharmacokinetics and is aimed at targeting a trough level of 15–20 mg/L. 31 Based on a priori methodology, individual patient data are not required, although one must be careful that a particular patient matches those used to generate the nomogram. Other nomograms are available. Linear regression analysis applying individual patient parameters (a posteriori) has been used but does require at least two measured serum concentrations and a log linear calculator. 32 Bayesian estimation methodology combines a priori population‐based data with a posteriori individual patient data (which may be limited to just a trough level 23) to calculate dose and interval most accurately, 32 and has higher predicative ability to achieve a specific AUC/MIC. 33 Bayesian methodology may be the fastest way to achieve therapeutic targets, but requires specific computer software and specialized practitioners and has had limited implementation.
