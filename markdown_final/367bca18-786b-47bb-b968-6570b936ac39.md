## Question

Anti anginal medication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anti-anginal medication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching goals of therapy and what guidelines say about symptom relief versus prognosis. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic choices and when to prefer β-blockers versus calcium channel blockers. Next, I will review immediate-relief therapy, escalation strategies, and drug-specific nuances like nitrate tolerance and ranolazine's role. After that, I should tailor therapy to pathophysiology such as vasospastic and microvascular angina. Finally, I will consider combination therapy principles, indications for revascularization, post-PCI de-escalation, and monitoring strategies, ensuring each step is grounded in contemporary evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and goals. In chronic coronary syndromes, antianginal drugs primarily improve symptoms and quality of life, while risk reduction is achieved with secondary prevention therapies; most antianginal agents do not reduce mortality, with exceptions such as β-blockers in the setting of prior MI or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, so I need to be careful not to over-attribute prognostic benefit to symptom-directed drugs [^115cwf4L] [^1173Lz3K]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize initiating optimal medical therapy before procedures; yes, contemporary evidence and recommendations align medical optimization as first line for symptom control and event prevention in stable disease [^1173Lz3K] [^114rj45N].

> Next, I should review first-line antianginal choices. The 2024 ESC guidelines recommend β-blockers and or calcium channel blockers as initial therapy to control heart rate and anginal symptoms in most patients, and I need to match the agent to comorbidities and physiology, favoring β-blockers after MI, in LV systolic dysfunction, or with tachyarrhythmias, and using CCBs when β-blockers are contraindicated or when vasospasm is suspected or confirmed [^115RUUQ3]. Wait, let me verify combination guidance; the same guidelines endorse β-blocker plus a dihydropyridine CCB when monotherapy is insufficient, which I should remember to consider if blood pressure permits and bradycardia is a concern [^116b7Pg2]. I will also keep in mind labeled CCB options such as diltiazem for exertional angina and vasospasm, titrated carefully and compatible with sublingual nitroglycerin for breakthrough episodes [^114qknn1] [^112Jhvog].

> I need to ensure every patient has immediate-relief therapy. Short-acting nitrates are recommended by ESC for acute symptom relief, and patients should be counseled on correct use and the absolute contraindication with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors given the risk of profound hypotension [^1128KimB] [^116rT4WC]. I initially thought all short-acting agents had a very brief duration of 3–5 minutes, but wait, let me verify; that short duration refers to amyl nitrite, whereas sublingual nitroglycerin is indicated for acute relief and typically provides relief over longer minutes, so I should not conflate the two when counseling on expected effect duration [^116XnRZG] [^117T4WWo].

> If symptoms persist on first-line therapy, I should escalate in a stepwise fashion. The ESC 2024 guidelines support adding long-acting nitrates or ranolazine in patients inadequately controlled on β-blockers and or CCBs, and selection should reflect blood pressure, heart rate, and tolerance considerations [^1168mabD]. Hold on, I should confirm nitrate pharmacology; continuous exposure leads to tolerance, so a daily 10–12 hour nitrate-free interval is essential with extended-release or transdermal formulations to preserve efficacy and limit endothelial dysfunction risk [^115JyrNV] [^11189iZx]. But wait, what if the patient has microvascular angina; long-acting nitrates are often ineffective or may even worsen symptoms in CMD or INOCA, so I should avoid routine nitrate escalation in that phenotype [^115Yhkq8] [^11189iZx].

> I will now examine ranolazine as a preferred add-on for persistent angina. Systematic reviews and pivotal trials demonstrate that ranolazine reduces angina frequency and nitroglycerin use and improves exercise duration when added to β-blockers or CCBs, with minimal hemodynamic effects that are advantageous in hypotension or bradycardia, though I must monitor for QT prolongation and drug interactions [^114LFjq7] [^112PDKft]. Let me double-check special populations; ESC cardiomyopathy guidance supports ranolazine use to improve angina-like chest pain in HCM without LVOTO or obstructive CAD, which can be useful when traditional vasodilators are undesirable, though I should still be cautious about off-target effects [^116L5y3N].

> I should confirm the role of ivabradine. For patients with LV systolic dysfunction and resting heart rate 70 bpm or higher despite β-blockers, ivabradine can reduce heart rate and improve anginal burden without lowering blood pressure materially, making it a useful add-on when rate control is incomplete or β-blocker dose is limited by side effects [^117PDqS6]. Hold on, I will not overextend its use outside the labeled and guideline-targeted phenotype, and I will consider equivalence among several antianginal classes for symptom relief when tailoring choices to the patient [^1138Vzvo].

> Let me consider other second- or third-line options. The ESC 2024 guidelines support nicorandil and trimetazidine as add-ons when symptoms persist on β-blockers and or CCBs, and these may be particularly helpful in vasospastic features for nicorandil or in patients where metabolic modulation is desirable for trimetazidine, acknowledging variable availability by region [^114Jckmt]. I should verify mechanistic nuances and evidence maturity; metabolic modulators have supportive but heterogeneous data, so patient selection and monitoring for side effects remain important [^117GW29f] [^117RCf1T].

> Now, I need to tailor therapy to the underlying pathophysiology rather than default to a one-size-fits-all approach. In vasospastic angina, calcium channel blockers are cornerstone therapy with high efficacy, and long-acting nitrates are effective adjuncts, whereas β-blockers, especially nonselective agents, may worsen spasm and should generally be avoided, so I must confirm the diagnosis and pick agents accordingly [^111aMDBp] [^117PCSod]. In microvascular angina or INOCA, I should prefer non-dihydropyridine CCBs or β-blockers if vasospasm is excluded, and I should avoid chronic nitrates given limited efficacy and potential detriment, considering ranolazine particularly when coronary flow reserve is reduced [^113anHSn] [^115Yhkq8] [^11189iZx]. But wait, what about diabetes with refractory angina; emerging randomized data suggest potential antianginal benefits with SGLT2 inhibitors like empagliflozin, so I can consider these when glycemic and cardiorenal benefits are aligned with symptom control goals, while recognizing this is an evolving area [^112zYGr2].

> I should confirm principles of combination therapy and dose optimization. Combining a β-blocker with a dihydropyridine CCB is guideline-endorsed and often synergistic for rate and afterload control without excessive bradycardia, and layering a third agent such as ranolazine or a long-acting nitrate can be necessary for refractory symptoms, provided I vigilantly monitor for hypotension and bradycardia during up-titration [^116b7Pg2]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about procedural solutions; the ORBITA program shows that truly optimal medical therapy can achieve high rates of multi-drug therapy and substantial symptom control, so optimizing at least two agents at effective doses is a meaningful threshold before considering revascularization [^113VFRxL]. I need to ensure my choices also respect equivalence across classes for symptom relief and are individualized to comorbidities and tolerability [^113iVktZ] [^1138Vzvo].

> Next, I should review when to consider revascularization versus continuing medical therapy. Large contemporary trials indicate that in stable CAD, PCI added to optimal medical therapy does not reduce death or MI, making medical therapy first-line; revascularization is primarily for persistent, lifestyle-limiting angina despite at least two optimally dosed antianginal agents or when medications are not tolerated [^115cwf4L] [^114rj45N]. Hmm, wait a minute, what about symptom gains from PCI; placebo-controlled data show PCI improves symptoms when background antianginal therapy is minimized, whereas its incremental benefit is attenuated on intensive medical therapy, which helps explain differences between trials and clinical impressions and reinforces the need to maximize medications before stenting for symptoms alone [^1136xb6b] [^115e6va8] [^112ETcgA].

> After successful PCI, I should consider de-escalation of antianginal medications once the patient is symptom-free. Since most antianginal drugs do not improve mortality, reducing or stopping them in low-risk patients with complete revascularization can decrease polypharmacy and side effects, but I must avoid premature withdrawal in those with residual ischemia, microvascular dysfunction, or vasospasm, and I should use a systematic, symptom-guided tapering approach [^112RYcci] [^112LGKmn]. Hold on, I should verify persistence of angina in some patients post-PCI; a meaningful minority have ongoing symptoms at six months, so close follow-up and readiness to reintroduce or re-titrate agents is prudent [^112RYcci].

> I will now outline monitoring and adjustment. I should track efficacy with structured tools like the Seattle Angina Questionnaire and exercise testing where appropriate, adjust therapy every 4–6 weeks toward symptom control and tolerance, and monitor class-specific adverse effects such as edema and constipation with CCBs, headaches and tolerance with nitrates, bradycardia with rate-control agents, and QT prolongation with ranolazine, adapting the regimen to patient response [^112igvxB] [^114qknn1] [^1164hs5p]. I need to check labeling cautions for specific dihydropyridines and ensure careful titration when combining with β-blockers or in heart failure to avoid decompensation or reflex angina exacerbation during initiation [^116qwpzP].

> Final synthesis, let me make sure this flows logically and aligns with evidence. Start with β-blocker and or CCB tailored to comorbidities, provide short-acting nitrates for acute relief, escalate to long-acting nitrates or ranolazine if symptoms persist, add ivabradine when LV systolic dysfunction with elevated heart rate limits control, consider nicorandil or trimetazidine as further add-ons, personalize to vasospastic or microvascular mechanisms, use combination therapy thoughtfully, reserve PCI for refractory symptoms after failure or intolerance of at least two optimal-dose agents, and de-escalate post-PCI if symptom-free and low risk, with ongoing monitoring to balance benefits and adverse effects [^115RUUQ3] [^1168mabD] [^114Jckmt] [^116b7Pg2] [^115cwf4L].

Anti-anginal medications relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in stable angina but do not reduce mortality or MI risk [^1145BBRj] [^1173Lz3K]. Beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are **first-line** [^115RUUQ3] [^113iVktZ]; if symptoms persist, add long-acting nitrates, ranolazine [^1168mabD], nicorandil, or trimetazidine [^114Jckmt], and use short-acting nitrates for acute relief [^1128KimB]. Ivabradine is reserved for **LVEF < 40%** with persistent symptoms [^117PDqS6]. Therapy should be individualized based on comorbidities, tolerability, and pathophysiology [^112kuiaZ]; avoid nitrates with PDE5 inhibitors or in HCM [^116rT4WC].

---

## Mechanisms of action

Anti-anginal medications work through **several mechanisms**:

- **Beta-blockers**: Reduce heart rate and contractility, lowering myocardial oxygen demand [^115RUUQ3].

- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Dilate coronary arteries and reduce afterload, improving oxygen supply and reducing demand [^111sJbYG].

- **Nitrates**: Vasodilate coronary arteries and reduce preload, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand [^115JyrNV].

- **Ranolazine**: Inhibits late sodium current, reducing intracellular calcium and myocardial oxygen consumption [^1164hs5p].

- **Ivabradine**: Selectively inhibits the If current, reducing heart rate without affecting contractility [^1138Vzvo].

- **Nicorandil**: Potassium channel opener causing vasodilation [^114Jckmt].

- **Trimetazidine**: Metabolic modulator improving myocardial energy efficiency [^117GW29f].

---

## Clinical indications

Indications include **chronic stable angina**, for which first-line therapy controls symptoms and improves quality of life [^115RUUQ3], and **vasospastic angina**, for which CCBs and nitrates are particularly effective [^117PCSod]. **Microvascular angina** is managed with beta-blockers and CCBs [^113anHSn], while **refractory angina** warrants add-on ranolazine [^1168mabD], nicorandil, or trimetazidine [^114Jckmt].

## Current clinical guidelines

The 2024 **ESC guidelines** recommend:

- **First-line therapy**: Beta-blockers and/or CCBs for initial symptom control [^115RUUQ3] [^116b7Pg2].

- **Add-on therapy**: Long-acting nitrates, ranolazine, nicorandil, or trimetazidine if symptoms persist [^1168mabD] [^114Jckmt].

- **Acute relief**: Short-acting nitrates for immediate symptom relief [^1128KimB].

- **Ivabradine**: Reserved for patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) and persistent symptoms [^117PDqS6].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel approaches

Emerging options include **metabolic modulators** such as trimetazidine and ranolazine for refractory angina [^114Jckmt], as well as **SGLT2 inhibitors**, which may confer anti-anginal benefits in patients with diabetes [^112zYGr2]. Novel interventional approaches include **coronary sinus reducers** and spinal cord stimulation for refractory angina [^117SauEo].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing medication choice

Medication choice is shaped by **comorbidities** such as heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and renal impairment [^112kuiaZ]; **tolerability**, including side-effect profiles and patient preferences, also guides therapy [^115cwf4L]; and the underlying **pathophysiology** (e.g. vasospastic or microvascular angina) determines the most appropriate class selection [^113anHSn] [^112kuiaZ].

---

## Potential side effects and contraindications

- **Beta-blockers**: Contraindicated in severe bradycardia, asthma, and severe peripheral vascular disease [^1138Vzvo].

- **CCBs**: Caution in heart failure and severe hypotension [^114qknn1].

- **Nitrates**: Contraindicated with phosphodiesterase inhibitors and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^116rT4WC].

- **Ranolazine**: Caution with QT-prolonging drugs [^1164hs5p].

---

## Impact on quality of life and long-term outcomes

Anti-anginal medications significantly **improve quality of life** by reducing angina frequency and improving exercise capacity [^1145BBRj] [^114LFjq7]. However, they **do not significantly reduce mortality or myocardial infarction risk** in stable angina, except for beta-blockers in patients with prior myocardial infarction or heart failure [^114rj45N] [^115cwf4L].

---

Anti-anginal medications are **essential** for managing angina symptoms and improving quality of life. Beta-blockers and CCBs are **first-line** [^115RUUQ3], with nitrates, ranolazine, nicorandil, and trimetazidine as add-on options [^114Jckmt]. Therapy should be individualized based on patient-specific factors and comorbidities [^112kuiaZ].

### Expert consensus document: A 'diamond' approach to personalized treatment of angina [^113iVktZ]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In clinical guidelines, drugs for symptomatic angina are classified as being first choice (β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, short-acting nitrates) or second choice (ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, trimetazidine), with the recommendation to reserve second-choice medications for patients who have contraindications to first-choice agents, do not tolerate them, or remain symptomatic. No direct comparisons between first-choice and second-choice treatments have demonstrated the superiority of one group of drugs over the other. Meta-analyses show that all antianginal drugs have similar efficacy in reducing symptoms, but provide no evidence for improvement in survival. The newer, second-choice drugs have more evidence-based clinical data that are more contemporary than are available for traditional first-choice drugs. Considering some drugs, but not others, to be first choice is, therefore, difficult. Moreover, double or triple therapy is often needed to control angina.

Patients with angina can have several comorbidities, and symptoms can result from various underlying pathophysiologies. Some agents, in addition to having antianginal effects, have properties that could be useful depending on the comorbidities present and the mechanisms of angina, but the guidelines do not provide recommendations on the optimal combinations of drugs. In this consensus statement, we propose an individualized approach to angina treatment, which takes into consideration the patient, their comorbidities, and the underlying mechanism of disease.

### Nifedipine [^117PCSod]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Nifedipine capsules, USP, are indicated for the management of vasospastic angina, confirmed by any of the following criteria: a classical pattern of angina at rest accompanied by ST segment elevation; angina or coronary artery spasm provoked by ergonovine; or angiographically demonstrated coronary artery spasm. In patients who have undergone angiography, the presence of significant fixed obstructive disease is not incompatible with a diagnosis of vasospastic angina, provided the criteria are met. Nifedipine capsules, USP, may also be considered where clinical presentation suggests a possible vasospastic component, but where vasospasm has not been confirmed. This includes cases where pain exhibits a variable threshold on exertion or when angina is refractory to nitrates or adequate doses of beta-blockers.

For chronic stable angina (classical effort-associated angina), nifedipine capsules, USP, are indicated for patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate doses of beta-blockers and/or organic nitrates, or who cannot tolerate these agents. In cases of chronic stable angina, nifedipine capsules, USP, have been effective in controlled trials of up to eight weeks in reducing angina frequency and increasing exercise tolerance. However, confirmation of sustained effectiveness and evaluation of long-term safety in these patients remain incomplete.

### Potent anti-ischaemic effects of statins in chronic stable angina: Incremental benefit beyond lipid lowering [^1156XceD]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Study population

Of 625 patients who were screened, 312 were randomized, and 311 (49.8%) received the study drug, including 103 assigned to amlodipine, 104 to atorvastatin, and 104 to combination therapy. Of these participants, 29 (9.3%) were excluded due to technical reasons. Consequently, 94 (91.3%) in the amlodipine arm, 92 (88.5%) in the atorvastatin arm, and 96 (92.3%) in the combination therapy arm completed the study with technically acceptable AECG data and minimal missing data. Overall, 4% or fewer patients had missing data on AECG, inflammatory biomarkers, bicycle exercise tests, lipids, and patient diary data at Week 18. An additional 5% or fewer had missing data at Week 26, with Week 18 values carried forward in analyses.

- **Flow of participants**:
	- Five patients had a prior history of statin use (≥ 4 weeks before screening), with two in the amlodipine arm, one in the atorvastatin arm, and two in the combination arm. No patient took a statin in the 4-week period before screening, suggesting that prior use is unlikely to influence results.
	- Discontinuation rates were similar across arms.

Patient baseline characteristics were comparable across the three arms. Most participants were receiving intensive cardiovascular drug treatment, including β-blockers (80.7%), vasodilators (e.g. long-acting nitrates) (62.4%), and aspirin (81.7%) at entry, with minimal changes to background treatment during the study.

### A placebo-controlled trial of percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina [^1136xb6b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Angina relief is the primary reason that patients with stable coronary artery disease undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The evidence that PCI reduces angina comes from unblinded clinical trials where the overall effect of PCI on symptoms is due to both physical and placebo components. The size of the physical component, calculated with placebo control, is essential knowledge in clinical decision-making, especially for procedures with non-negligible risk and cost.

ORBITA (Objective Randomized Blinded Investigation with Optimal Medical Therapy of Angioplasty in Stable Angina), a placebo-controlled trial of PCI that mandated the use of guideline-directed antianginal medications, found no effect of PCI on exercise time. However, it is possible that the absence of a difference between PCI and placebo was attributable to the high number of background antianginal medications. Intensive antianginal medical therapy can be difficult to achieve in clinical practice, in part due to side effects and non-adherence, and there are instances when patients may prefer PCI to medication escalation.

The ORBITA-2 trial was designed to determine the effect of PCI compared to placebo without background antianginal medication.

### The impact of de-escalation of antianginal medications on health status after percutaneous coronary intervention [^112RYcci]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Antianginal medications (AAMs) provide substantial angina relief and can be used along with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to optimally treat the symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Guidelines recommend initial treatment of stable angina with AAMs for the majority of patients, followed by revascularization if AAMs are insufficient at effectively managing symptoms. However, in patients eventually treated with PCI, there is little guidance on how to manage AAMs after revascularization. Although PCI can be markedly effective in providing substantial symptom relief, ongoing angina remains a residual issue for many patients, with 20% to 40% reporting angina at 6 months post-PCI.

After revascularization, physicians may elect to de-escalate AAMs, as they may no longer be necessary for symptom management. Since AAMs are not associated with a reduction in morbidity or mortality, except for beta-blockers after myocardial infarction or with heart failure, de-escalation may be a reasonable treatment strategy. However, the optimal timing of de-escalation is not known. Angina is associated with an impairment in quality of life and increased healthcare costs, making it crucial to understand factors — especially modifiable ones — associated with angina post-PCI. We used a multicenter US PCI registry that collected detailed health status data before and after PCI to examine the frequency of de-escalation of AAMs at discharge and the association of early de-escalation with long-term outcomes.

### Metabolic manipulation in ischaemic heart disease, a novel approach to treatment [^117GW29f]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Antianginal drugs that exert their anti-ischaemic effects primarily by altering myocardial metabolism have recently attracted attention. They have the potential to relieve symptoms in patients with refractory angina who are already on "optimal" medical therapy and have disease that is not amenable to revascularisation, making these drugs an attractive addition to therapy, particularly for the elderly population. In some cases, they may even be used as first-line treatment. These drugs increase glucose metabolism at the expense of free-fatty-acid metabolism, enhancing oxygen efficiency during myocardial ischaemia. Whilst they have been demonstrated to reduce ischaemia in several clinical trials, their use remains limited.

This review aims to draw attention to these "metabolic" antianginal drugs while surveying the evidence supporting their use and mode of action. Four metabolic antianginal drugs are reviewed: perhexiline, trimetazidine, ranolazine, and etomoxir. We also discuss the metabolic actions of glucose-insulin-potassium and beta-blockers and describe myocardial metabolism during normal and ischaemic conditions. The potential of these metabolic agents may extend beyond the treatment of ischaemia secondary to coronary artery disease. They offer significant promise for the treatment of symptoms occurring due to inoperable aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic heart failure.

### Stable angina pectoris: Antianginal therapies and future directions [^111sJbYG]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Advances in pharmacotherapy for stable angina have produced a wide choice of drugs with various mechanisms of action, potentially enabling individualized, patient-specific treatment strategies to be developed. This review discusses the various treatment options for patients with stable angina. Data from randomized clinical trials of established and novel drugs are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the proposed mechanisms of action, benefits of therapy, and adverse-effect profiles. The role of coronary revascularization in conjunction with optimal medical therapy as a treatment strategy is discussed, although drug therapy might reduce the need for prompt revascularization if the procedure is being considered solely for the purpose of alleviating angina. Finally, trials to investigate stimulation of angiogenesis using growth-factor, gene, and cell therapy are used to illustrate the challenges of chemically inducing the growth of adequate, durable blood vessels.

### Management of persistent angina after myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention: Insights from the TRANSLATE-ACS study [^113nnyeE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, physicians may fail to recognize the importance of treating angina or the effectiveness of existing antianginal medications, as evidenced by consistent lack of treatment even in the face of very frequent or persistent symptoms. Despite guidelines recommending the use of at least two classes of antianginal medications (a β‐blocker plus one additional agent) for patients with chronic angina, there is no evidence that non–β‐blocker antianginal medications reduce cardiovascular mortality or clinical events in the post‐myocardial infarction setting. However, all three classes of non–β‐blocker antianginal medications increase exercise duration and time to electrocardiographic ischemia in patients with stable angina.

We found that patients with angina have a worse quality of life across multiple domains than those without angina, and antianginal medications may help patients increase activity levels and exercise capacity, and, in turn, improve quality of life. Angina is also the factor most strongly associated with hospitalization within the 12 months following an index myocardial infarction. Furthermore, there may be cost or logistical barriers to the prescription of ranolazine, which is not yet available in generic form; however, low rates of prescription of nitrates and calcium channel blockers argue against cost being a major driver of this finding. Lastly, treatment inertia may be playing a role: among patients with angina over the entirety of the study period, those who were treated with a non–β‐blocker antianginal medication at the time of their index myocardial infarction discharge were 30-fold more likely to continue this treatment.

### Management of refractory angina: an update [^117SauEo]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the use of anti-anginal drugs and/or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting, the proportion of patients with coronary artery disease who have daily or weekly angina ranges from 2% to 24%. Refractory angina refers to long-lasting symptoms (for over three months) due to established reversible ischaemia, which cannot be controlled by escalating medical therapy with the use of second- and third-line pharmacological agents, bypass grafting, or stenting. While there is uncertain prognostic benefit, the treatment of refractory angina is important to improve the quality of life of the patients affected.

This review focuses on conventional pharmacological approaches to treating refractory angina, including guideline-directed drug combinations and dosages. The symptomatic and prognostic impact of advanced and novel revascularization strategies, such as chronic total occlusion PCI, transmyocardial laser revascularization, coronary sinus occlusion, radiation therapy for restenosis, and spinal cord stimulation, are also covered. Recommendations of the 2019 ESC Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Coronary Syndromes are discussed.

Finally, the potential clinical use of angiogenetic and stem cell therapies in reducing ischaemia and/or pain is evaluated.

### International observational analysis of evolution and outcomes of chronic stable angina: The multinational CLARIFY study [^1145BBRj]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Angina pectoris is a common manifestation of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and negatively affects quality of life. Lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatment, and coronary revascularization can improve symptoms. However, in most randomized trials exploring antianginal strategies or drugs in stable CAD, the burden of angina improved over time in the control group. Although this improvement could be a result of optimization of medical treatments and cardiovascular risk factors during the trial, it could also reflect the natural history of the condition.

Angina pectoris is also associated with poor outcomes. However, antianginal treatments have not been proven to improve outcomes in chronic stable angina. Even β-blockers, largely used on the basis of a mortality reduction after myocardial infarction, have not been associated with improved outcomes in stable angina. Likewise, invasive management with a view to coronary revascularization does not reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina or myocardial ischemia, although it improves symptoms.

In the era of effective antianginal treatments, evidence-based secondary prevention therapy, and widespread use of coronary revascularization, we sought to describe the prevalence and time course of angina in patients with stable CAD as well as the effect of changes in anginal status on outcomes.

### The usefulness of ranolazine for the treatment of refractory chronic stable angina pectoris as determined from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^114LFjq7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Despite the use of traditional antianginal medications — such as β blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates — and revascularization therapies, symptoms of chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) persist in more than 25% of patients. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ranolazine for the treatment of CSAP. We systematically searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and MEDLINE through July 2013 for RCTs comparing ranolazine with placebo or antianginal medications administered as part of usual care for the management of CSAP.

End points of interest included exercise stress test performance (duration, time to angina, and time to ST-segment depression), frequency of angina attacks per week, nitroglycerin use per week, and quality of life. We identified seven RCTs (n = 3,317) of patients with CSAP due to coronary artery disease. Comparators included placebo, amlodipine, and atenolol. All but one trial showed a statistically significant improvement in all three exercise stress test parameters with ranolazine compared with placebo. Ranolazine also reduced angina frequency and nitroglycerin use compared with placebo. These findings were consistent whether or not patients were also prescribed traditional antianginal pharmacotherapy. In conclusion, ranolazine reduces anginal symptoms among patients with symptomatic CSAP despite their use of traditional antianginal medications.

### Nitro-time [^117HUwat]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Nitroglycerin extended-release capsules are indicated for the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. The onset of action of oral nitroglycerin is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with beta-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112SHeD7]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The study design is depicted in Figure 1. Before randomization, patients were requested to return to the study centers on two occasions. During the "inclusion visit", the criteria listed above were evaluated, and therapy with long-acting nitrates and calcium-channel antagonists was suspended for at least four half-lives. During the "selection visit", the first exercise treadmill test was performed. All patients were then administered placebo tablets to be taken b.i.d. (single-blind placebo run-in period) for one week, after which ("randomization visit", V0) a second exercise treadmill test (ETT) was performed. At this point, patients were randomized to receive PETN 80 mg or placebo b.i.d. (8 a.m. and 1 p.m.).

Background anti-anginal therapy with beta-blockers, ivabradine, ACE inhibitors, and/or angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, and diuretics was continued as indicated. Patients, investigators, central readers of the ETT data, and the sponsor were blinded to the treatment received by the patients. After 6 weeks and 12 weeks of therapy, a third (6-week ETT, "control visit", V1) and fourth ETT (12-week ETT, "end of trial visit", V2) were performed. At each visit, data on the frequency of angina attacks and consumption of short-acting nitrates were collected from patient diaries and standard questionnaires. Patients also underwent a physical examination as well as sampling of blood chemistry and hematology prior to randomization (selection visit) and at the end of the trial (V2). Twelve-lead ECGs at rest were performed on each visit.

### Cardizem [^114qknn1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Exertional angina pectoris due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease or angina pectoris at rest due to coronary artery spasm: Dosage must be adjusted to each patient's needs. It is advisable to start with 30 mg four times daily, before meals and at bedtime. The dosage should be increased gradually (administered in divided doses three or four times daily) at 1- to 2-day intervals until the optimum response is obtained. Although individual patients may respond at any dosage level, the average optimum dosage range appears to be 180 to 360 mg/day. There are no available data concerning dosage requirements in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. If the drug must be used in such patients, titration should be carried out with particular caution.

- **Concomitant use with other cardiovascular agents**: Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during Cardizem (diltiazem hydrochloride) therapy.
	- **Prophylactic nitrate therapy**: Cardizem may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates. However, there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination.
	- **Beta-blockers**: (see warnings and precautions).

For 30 mg tablets, Cardizem tablets may be swallowed whole, crushed, or chewed. Do not split Cardizem tablets. The 60 mg, 90 mg, and 120 mg tablets may also be swallowed whole, crushed, or chewed.

### A placebo-controlled trial of percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina [^115e6va8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In this placebo-controlled trial in patients with stable angina on little or no antianginal medication, with coronary artery stenoses causing ischemia, PCI improved the angina symptom score. Reduction in the angina symptom score appeared to result from a reduction in daily angina episodes. Assignment to the PCI group was associated with more than a three-fold greater odds of becoming free from angina at the 12-week follow-up. The reduction in angina following PCI was observed immediately and persisted throughout the blinded follow-up period.

The results from ORBITA-2 differed from ORBITA because the studies were designed to answer different questions. In ORBITA, patients adhered to guideline-directed antianginal medications, with PCI as add-on therapy. The small effect size of PCI on exercise time was surprising in the context of larger effects seen in clinical practice and previous clinical trials. One plausible explanation is that the previous experience was unblinded and therefore augmented by the placebo effect. While guidelines recommend escalating antianginal medications for symptoms, approximately half of patients undergoing PCI are on zero or one antianginal medication. Achieving the high levels of antianginals applied in ORBITA is challenging. In fact, patients enrolled in ORBITA-2 had been referred for PCI while taking an average of just one full-dose antianginal medication. Analogous to renal denervation trials, measurement of the efficacy of PCI on angina in a setting that is free from both placebo and the attenuating effect of background antianginal therapy is essential.

### Angina: Contemporary diagnosis and management [^115jNMT6]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

The management of angina requires comprehensive understanding and approach. Around half of angina patients exhibit no obstructive coronary disease, and many among them have microvascular and/or vasospastic angina. Clinicians can enhance diagnosis accuracy through tests of coronary artery function, which serve to rule-in or rule-out conditions, providing a complement to coronary angiography.

Key aspects of effective management include physician and patient education, lifestyle modifications, medication adherence, and revascularization procedures.

### Ranolazine: A contemporary review [^112PDKft]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In the Combination Assessment of Ranolazine in Stable Angina (CARISA) trial, 823 patients receiving antianginal therapy at enrollment were evaluated for EST performance, angina frequency, and nitroglycerin use. Patients were stratified according to antianginal therapy (atenolol 50 mg, diltiazem 180 mg, or amlodipine 5 mg daily) and randomized to receive ranolazine extended‐release 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo BID. Each treatment arm had similar background antianginal medications. After 12 weeks of therapy, both doses increased exercise capacity, with exercise duration increased by 115.6 seconds (pooled from both doses) versus 91.7 seconds in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Angina frequency and nitroglycerin use were reduced by approximately one per week compared to placebo (P < 0.02).

CARISA supported a benefit of ranolazine as an add‐on therapy in CSAP. However, patients were not on the maximum recommended doses of antianginals, which may influence the external validity of the results. This was addressed in the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine in Chronic Angina) trial. Five hundred sixty‐five patients were randomized to extended‐release ranolazine 500 mg BID or placebo. All patients were taking 10 mg of amlodipine and were allowed to continue long‐acting nitrates. Eighty percent of patients had a history of MI, 11% had a history of previous CABG, and 10% had a history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The primary endpoint was the frequency of self‐reported angina episodes during the 6‐week treatment phase. Secondary outcomes included weekly nitroglycerin use and change in the S.

### Testing the effectiveness of converting patients to long-acting antianginal medications: The Quality of Life in Angina Research Trial (QUART) [^112igvxB]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that converting patients with stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications would improve their functional status, symptom control, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life.

- **Methods and results**: A single-blind randomized trial of 100 patients with stable coronary artery disease was performed in the outpatient clinic of a Veterans Affairs Health System. Outpatients with chronic stable angina taking at least two antianginal medications were studied. Patients were randomized to one of two treatments: optimal adjustment of their usual antianginal medications or conversion to solely long-acting medications (long-acting diltiazem ± nitroglycerin patches ± atenolol) with subsequent optimization. The primary outcome was the 3-month change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. Although no differences in physical limitation scores were noted, patients randomized to receive long-acting medications had improved symptom control (3-month improvement in anginal stability [19.1 vs 5.6, P = 0.02] and anginal frequency [17.8 vs 5.5, P = 0.006]), more treatment satisfaction (3-month improvement of 8.2 vs 3.0, P = 0.057), and better quality of life (3-month improvement of 11.2 vs 5.6, P = 0.09) compared with patients whose pretrial medications were optimized. The improvement in symptom control was statistically significant.

Converting patients with chronic, stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications resulted in substantial improvements in symptom control with a trend toward better treatment satisfaction and quality of life.

### Angina: Contemporary diagnosis and management [^111aMDBp]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Epicardial spasm (vasospastic angina)

The poor nitrate response or tolerance seen in microvascular angina (MVA) contrasts with patients with vasospastic angina (VSA), in whom nitrates are a cornerstone of therapy, and beta-blockers (BB) are relatively contraindicated. Dual pathologies (VSA with underlying microvascular disease) are increasingly recognized. A diagnosis of VSA facilitates treatment using non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (e.g. diltiazem-controlled release up to 500 mg daily). Overall, calcium channel blockers (CCB) are effective in treating over 90% of patients. High doses of calcium antagonists (both non-dihydropyridine and dihydropyridine) may be required either alone or in combination. Unfortunately, ankle swelling, constipation, and other side effects may render some patients intolerant. In these cases, long-term nitrates may be used with good efficacy in this group.

In about 10% of cases, coronary artery spasm may be refractory to optimal vasodilator therapy. Japanese VSA registry data shows that nitrates were not associated with major adverse cardiac event (MACE) reduction in VSA. Importantly, when added to nicorandil, nitrates were potentially associated with higher rates of adverse cardiac events. Alpha-blockers (e.g. clonidine) may be helpful in selected patients with persistent vasospasm. In patients with poor nitrate tolerance, the potassium-channel opener nicorandil (5–10 mg twice a day) can be tried. Consider secondary causes in refractory VSA (e.g. coronary vasculitis) and, in selected patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentations, coronary angioplasty may be considered as a bailout option.

- **Management: Obstructive CAD**: Continue to consider additional treatment strategies and interventions.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with beta-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113m7L9K]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

At the end of the treatment, in both groups, the median percentage of tablets taken by subjects was 100, with a mean of 99.4% (range 98.8–126%) under PETN and a mean of 99.6% (range 98.8–123%) under placebo.

- **Efficacy**: The data are presented in the accompanying tables and figures. There was no difference between groups in any of the parameters before randomization. In the ITT population, total exercise duration (TED) improved after 12 weeks of treatment with PETN 80 mg b.i.d. by 77.7 ± 119.1 seconds and after placebo by 67.9 ± 108.5 seconds. ANCOVA on treatment differences, including the variables described above as covariates, showed no difference between treatments on the change in TED (P = 0.423). However, the covariates baseline TED and country significantly affected the change in TED, specifically in patients with baseline TED < 10 minutes, which represented the median value. Patients included with lower TEDs at baseline showed more pronounced changes over the 12-week treatment with PETN and placebo compared to those with higher TEDs at baseline.

### Antianginal medications and long-term outcomes after elective catheterization in patients with coronary artery disease [^114KHi8q]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Antianginal medications are a class I recommendation by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for stable ischemic heart disease. We sought to better understand guidance in drug selection and real-life outcomes of antianginal medication use.

- **Hypothesis**: In patients with stable ischemic heart disease, antianginal medications lower mortality.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 5608 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing elective cardiac catheterization, following up with them through self-administered questionnaires. Patients were classified as being prescribed a particular medication if they received that medication at index catheterization, or within 3 months post-catheterization. The association between antianginal medication use and outcomes was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models.

- **Results**: Compared with the 11% not prescribed any antianginal medication, patients prescribed antianginal medication were more likely to be older and female; have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, or 3-vessel CAD; and have lower adjusted mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63–0.89) as well as experience mortality or myocardial infarction (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.71–0.98). Compared with patients not taking β-blockers (17%), those taking β-blockers had a lower risk of mortality (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66–0.88). Patients prescribed calcium channel blockers or long-acting nitrates had a higher risk of mortality compared with nonusers (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04–1.29; HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08).

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^116b7Pg2]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, particularly concerning antianginal therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a combination of a β-blocker and a dihydropyridine CCB. This combination is advised unless contraindicated, especially if anginal symptoms are not successfully controlled by initial treatment with a β-blocker or a CCB alone.

### Trials and tribulations associated with angina and traditional therapeutic approaches [^114X2r15]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Ischemic heart disease is the foremost cause of death in the United States and other developed countries. Stable angina is the initial manifestation of ischemic heart disease in half of the patients and becomes a recurring symptom in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) and other forms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Multiple therapeutic modalities are currently available for the treatment of anginal symptoms in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). These include anti-anginal drugs and myocardial revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Anti-anginal drug therapy is primarily based on treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. A newly approved anti-anginal drug, ranolazine, is undergoing phase III evaluation. Not infrequently, combination therapy is necessary for adequate symptom control in some patients with stable angina. However, there has not been a systematic evaluation of individual or combination anti-anginal drug therapy on hard clinical endpoints in patients with stable angina. Most revascularization trials that have evaluated treatment with CABGS, PTCA, or PCI in patients with chronic CAD and stable angina have not shown significant improvement in survival or decreased incidence of non-fatal MI compared to medical treatment.

In the CABGS trials, various post-hoc analyses have identified several smaller subgroups at high risk in whom CABGS might improve clinical outcomes. However, there are conflicting findings in these analyses.

### Stable coronary syndromes: Pathophysiology, diagnostic advances and therapeutic need [^115Yhkq8]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacological symptomatic therapy: A detailed review of therapy for the different disorders of coronary artery function is beyond the scope of this review. A summary of currently available therapies aligning with the different SCS disease endotypes is shown in Table 2 (see additional references in online supplementary file 1).

Robust evidence for the treatment of SCS is lacking. The treatment effect in many studies is potentially diluted by the enrolment of heterogeneous groups of patients with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms of CMD that may respond differently to specific treatment modalities. European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines provide recommendations for patients with CMD, suggesting β-blockers as first-line therapy, with calcium antagonists recommended if the former is not tolerated or efficacious. Unlike in patients with angina and obstructive CAD, nitrates are not generally effective for treating SCS due to CMD.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of ranolazine led by the WISE investigators, although there were no overall improvements in angina and MPRi with ranolazine, benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with a reduced CFR (< 2.5) at baseline. Patients with VSA may benefit symptomatically from treatment with both nitrate and calcium channel antagonists, while the latter may have prognostic benefit. Rho-kinase inhibitors and endothelin-receptor antagonists represent potential future therapeutic options.

Secondary prevention: ESC guidelines support the use of secondary prevention measures in the treatment of SCS.

### Nitro-time [^115JyrNV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Controlled trials of single oral doses of nitroglycerin have demonstrated that nitroglycerin capsules can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 5 hours. Anti-anginal activity is present about 1 hour after ingestion of a capsule.

- **Clinical trials**: Controlled trials of multiple-dose oral nitroglycerin have shown statistically significant anti-anginal efficacy 2½ and 4 hours following a dose when oral nitroglycerin had been administered four times a day for 2 weeks or three times a day for 1 week. As noted above, careful studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels of nitroglycerin results in insurmountable tolerance. Presumably, the studied 1-week and 2-week regimens of oral nitroglycerin therapy achieved adequate nitrate-free intervals by non-uniformity of dosing interval, with longer intervals overnight. The investigators did not report how subjects interpreted their dosing instructions, and they similarly did not report which dose of the day was the one after which they obtained the end-of-trial exercise results.

Thus, these studies of oral nitroglycerin should be interpreted as demonstrations that these regimens provide round-the-clock anti-anginal protection. From large, well-controlled studies of other nitroglycerin formulations, it is reasonable to believe that the maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal effect from nitroglycerin extended-release capsules is about 12 hours.

In some controlled trials of other organic nitrate formulations, efficacy has declined with time.

### Treatment of refractory angina in patients not suitable for revascularization [^114HMdGw]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A growing number of patients, particularly those with advanced, chronic coronary artery disease, experience symptoms of angina that are refractory to treatment with β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates, despite revascularization. The management of patients with refractory angina who are unsuitable for further revascularization varies significantly across the world and is contingent on local resources and available expertise. Mortality in this patient population has decreased, but enhancing quality of life remains a challenge.

New treatment principles are emerging in practice, such as metabolic modulation, therapeutic angiogenesis, and novel interventional techniques (e.g. coronary in-flow redistribution and approaches to chronic total occlusion). The contemporary management of refractory angina encourages individualized, patient-centered care in interdisciplinary, specialized clinics. Global initiatives are required to address complex clinical problem-solving for patients with refractory angina.

In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of refractory angina and provide an update on the pharmacological, noninvasive, and interventional options that are available to these patients or are under development.

### Prevalence of angina and use of medical therapy among US adults: A nationally representative estimate [^115GSvau]. American Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Recent results from the ISCHEMIA trial highlight the importance of medical management for patients with stable ischemic heart disease. We determine the prevalence of angina in the United States, as well as the use of first-line goal-directed therapy by US patients with angina. We used individual patient-level data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2007–2016. Using the complex survey weights, we create projections for the US population with angina as well as those using β-blockers, antiplatelet agents, or statins — three first-line medications for patients with angina.

Among adults aged 40 years and older, 4,469,934 US adults are estimated to have physician-diagnosed angina. Of the patients with angina:

- **Β-blockers**: 2,757,171 (61.7%) were on β-blockers.
- **Statins**: 2,984,902 (66.8%) were on statins.
- **Antiplatelet medication**: 2,433,088 (54.4%) were on any antiplatelet medication.
- **All three medications**: 1,457,983 patients were on all three medications, representing an overall proportion of 32.6% of angina patients taking all three first-line medications in the United States.

While the prevalence of angina in the US is high, the use of goal-directed medical therapy remains low. Strategies to improve the use of medications for preventing secondary events are urgently needed.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with beta-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114WG567]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

All the data were collected using an electronic case report form and analyzed by an independent statistician based on a pre-defined statistical analysis plan. The analysis of efficacy was performed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with regard to primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. All patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement were included in the ITT population, with non-completers included using the last-observation-carried-forward approach. In addition, all analyses were performed on the per-protocol population as secondary efficacy analyses. Safety data were presented for the safety population, which includes all patients who received at least one dose of study medication.

The primary efficacy endpoint, 'change in TED after 12 weeks', and the secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). This included country, treatment, use of anti-anginal background therapy as fixed class effects, and baseline TED (ETT before randomization) as a covariate.

Subgroup analyses were carried out on the ITT population, restricted to the change in TED, TAP, and TST from randomization to week 12. Subgroup analyses included country and anti-anginal background therapy, gender, age (65 years), TED at baseline (divided in quartiles), co-morbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking habits. The protocol version was also analyzed, with version 1 allowing inclusion of patients with a baseline TED ≤ 9 min only.

### Achieving optimal medical therapy: Insights from the ORBITA trial [^113VFRxL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In stable coronary artery disease, medications are used for two purposes: cardiovascular risk reduction and symptom improvement. In clinical trials and clinical practice, medication use is often not optimal. The ORBITA (Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation With Optimal Medical Therapy of Angioplasty in Stable Angina) trial was the first placebo-controlled trial of percutaneous coronary intervention. A key component of the ORBITA trial design was the inclusion of a medical optimization phase aimed at ensuring that all patients were treated with guideline-directed, truly optimal medical therapy. In this study, we report the medical therapy that was achieved.

- **Methods and results**: After enrollment into the ORBITA trial, all 200 patients entered a six-week period of intensive medical therapy optimization, with initiation and uptitration of risk reduction and antianginal therapy. At the prerandomization stage, the median number of antianginals established was three (interquartile range, 2–4). A total of 195 patients (97.5%) reached the prespecified target of ≥ 2 antianginals; 136 (68.0%) did not stop any antianginals because of adverse effects, and the median number of antianginals stopped for adverse effects per patient was 0 (interquartile range, 0–1).

Amlodipine and bisoprolol were well tolerated, stopped for adverse effects in 4/175 (2.3%) and 9/167 (5.4%) patients, respectively. Ranolazine and ivabradine were also well tolerated, stopped for adverse effects in 1/20 (5.0%) and 1/18 (5.6%) patients, respectively. Isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil were stopped for adverse effects in…

### Interventional versus conservative treatment for patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: The British Heart Foundation RITA 3 randomised trial. Randomized intervention trial of unstable angina [^114yWLWa]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines suggest that, for patients at moderate risk of death from unstable coronary-artery disease, either an interventional strategy (angiography followed by revascularisation) or a conservative strategy (ischaemia-driven or symptom-driven angiography) is appropriate. We aimed to test the hypothesis that an interventional strategy is better than a conservative strategy in such patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised multicentre trial involving 1810 patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (mean age 62 years, 38% women). Patients were assigned to either an early intervention or a conservative strategy. The antithrombin agent used in both groups was enoxaparin. The co-primary endpoints were a combined rate of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or refractory angina at 4 months; and a combined rate of death or non-fatal myocardial infarction at 1 year. Analysis was by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: At 4 months, 86 (9.6%) of 895 patients in the intervention group had died or experienced a myocardial infarction or refractory angina, compared with 133 (14.5%) of 915 patients in the conservative group (risk ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.51–0.85, p = 0.001). This difference was mainly due to a halving of refractory angina in the intervention group. Death or myocardial infarction was similar in both treatment groups at 1 year (68 [7.6%] vs 76 [8.3%], respectively; risk ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.67–1.25, p = 0.58). Symptoms of angina improved, and the use of antianginal medications was significantly reduced with the interventional strategy (p < 0.0001).

- **Interpretation**: In patients presenting with…

### Angina: Contemporary diagnosis and management [^113ZdeaB]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Pharmacological management

Although NICE guidelines offer either BB or CCB as first-line treatments, we support BB initially because they are generally better tolerated. Long-term evidence of efficacy is limited between BB and CCB, and there are no proven safety concerns favoring one over the other. Dihydropyridine calcium may be added to BB if blood pressure permits. NICE CG126 states that third-line options can either be added on or substituted if BB/CCB is not tolerated. These include nitrates (e.g. isosorbide mononitrate 30–120 mg controlled release), ivabradine (e.g. 2.5–7.5 mg twice a day), nicorandil (5–30 mg twice a day), or ranolazine (375–500 mg twice a day). These third-line medications can be used in combination with BB and/or CCB depending on comorbidities, contraindications, patient preference, and drug costs.

The RIVER-PCI study found that anti-ischaemic pharmacotherapy with ranolazine did not improve the prognosis of patients with incomplete revascularisation after percutaneous coronary intervention. This serves as a reminder that alleviation of ischaemia may not improve 'hard' endpoints in patients with chronic coronary syndromes, but it helps us to remain focused on improving their quality of life.

### Achieving optimal medical therapy: Insights from the ORBITA trial [^115cwf4L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The treatment goals for patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and to improve angina symptoms. Reducing the risk of future cardiovascular events is achieved by slowing disease progression, reducing plaque instability, and reducing thrombus aggregation. This can be accomplished with lifestyle modification, high‐intensity statin therapy, and antiplatelets. Large randomized controlled trials in stable CAD have demonstrated that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not confer a survival benefit or a reduced risk of myocardial infarction, when added to optimal medical therapy. In the ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial, even in the context of moderate or severe ischemia, PCI did not prevent myocardial infarction or death.

The second aim of treatment is symptom relief. National and international guidelines recommend the initial use of antianginal medications, which can be used in combination to reduce symptoms. If a patient's angina is not well controlled with short‐acting nitrates alone, the recommended first‐line therapy is either a β blocker or a calcium channel antagonist. Second‐ and third‐line agents, including long‐acting nitrates, nicorandil, ivabradine, and ranolazine, should be chosen according to comorbidities, contraindications, patient preference, and medication cost. Revascularization is considered for patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with at least two antianginal agents or are intolerant of medical therapy.

Impaired coronary vasodilator capacity (reduced CFR)

Bairey Merz et al. performed a randomized controlled trial of ranolazine in the WISE population. Notably, there was no net benefit effect on the INOCA population as a whole; however, in patients with reduced CFR (< 2.5), there was a suggestion of improved myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRi) after established treatment. Lanza and Crea highlight that subjects with reduced CFR might preferentially be treated with drugs that reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, such as beta-blockers (e.g. nebivolol 1.25–10 mg daily). There is accumulating evidence that long-acting nitrates are ineffective or even detrimental in MVA. Lack of efficacy may relate to poor tolerability, steal syndromes through regions of adequately perfused myocardium, and/or the reduced responsiveness of nitrates within the coronary microcirculation. Furthermore, chronic therapy with nitrate may induce endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, predominantly via endothelin-dependent pathways.

Increased microvascular constriction (structurally increased microvascular resistance or functional propensity to microvascular spasm)

Subjects with increased microvascular vasoconstriction may be treated with vasodilator therapies acting on the microcirculation. These include calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine 2.5–10 mg daily) or nicorandil (e.g. 5–30 mg twice a day). Hyper-reactivity to constrictor stimuli resulting in a propensity to microvascular spasm may be provoked by endothelial dysfunction. This was first described in…

### The initial management of stable angina in Europe, from the Euro Heart Survey: A description of pharmacological management and revascularization strategies initiated within the first month of presentation to a cardiologist in the Euro Heart Survey of Stable Angina [^116RXu3X]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In order to assess adherence to guidelines and international variability in management, the Euro Heart Survey of Newly Presenting Angina prospectively studied medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and surgery in patients with new-onset stable angina in Europe.

Consecutive patients, 3779 in total, with a clinical diagnosis of stable angina by a cardiologist were enrolled. After initial assessment by a cardiologist, 78% were treated with aspirin, 48% with a statin, and 67% with a beta-blocker. ACE inhibitors were prescribed by the cardiologist in 37% overall. Revascularization rates were low, with only 501 (13%) patients having PCI or coronary bypass surgery performed or planned. However, when restricted to patients with coronary disease documented within four weeks of assessment, over 50% had revascularization performed or planned. Among other factors, the national rate of angiography and availability of invasive facilities significantly predicted the likelihood of revascularization, with odds ratios of 2.4 and 2.0, respectively.

This survey shows a shortfall between guidelines and practice with regard to the use of evidence-based drug therapy and evidence that revascularization rates are strongly influenced by non-clinical, in addition to clinical, factors.

### A placebo-controlled trial of percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina [^112ETcgA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

On the day of randomization, all antianginal medications initiated in the pre-randomization period were stopped. Patients then entered the 12-week blinded follow-up phase, continuing daily symptom reporting via a smartphone application. During this period, the initiation and uptitration of antianginal medication were triggered by patient contact and managed by staff blinded to study group allocation. They followed an identical protocol to the pre-randomization phase.

At the end of the blinded follow-up period, patients returned for an exercise stress test, dobutamine stress echo, and symptom and quality of life questionnaires. After completing these tests, patients and research and medical teams were unblinded, marking the study's conclusion, and patients returned to usual clinical care. Actions or decisions made after unblinding did not contribute to study endpoint data.

- **End points**: The primary endpoint is the angina symptom score, an ordinal clinical outcome scale calculated daily from the number of angina episodes and units of antianginal medication used. More angina episodes and antianginal medication usage resulted in a higher score. A patient with no angina and no antianginal medication use scored zero. This ordinal scale also incorporated high-level category overrides for unblinding due to intolerable angina (requiring unscheduled coronary angiography), acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or myocardial infarction meeting the fourth universal definition), or death.

- **Secondary endpoints**: Included self-reported angina frequency obtained via smartphone application and antianginal medication initiation.

### The impact of de-escalation of antianginal medications on health status after percutaneous coronary intervention [^112LGKmn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Antianginal medications (AAMs) effectively treat angina and are recommended as first-line therapy in most patients with stable coronary artery disease. Managing these medications after revascularization can be challenging. AAMs are not associated with a decrease in morbidity or mortality in the majority of patients and therefore should be used only for symptom relief. As such, after revascularization, it makes sense to try to de-escalate AAMs.

It is not uncommon for patients to be angina-free for several months and yet remain on intensive AAMs. This therapeutic inertia can contribute to polypharmacy and side effects from medications that are not providing any therapeutic benefit. However, it is important to recognize that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not eliminate angina in all patients, and there is a subset of patients at high risk for recurrent angina who may benefit from continued AAMs or at least a more cautious de-escalation.

Examples of this include patients who have functional mechanisms for angina, such as microvascular dysfunction and coronary spasms, which are not impacted by revascularization and are best treated with AAMs. Thus, having a systematic method for de-escalation may be of benefit. One strategy could be to de-escalate AAMs in patients with low risk of residual angina and complete revascularization at discharge, followed by symptom-guided de-escalation of other patients over time during follow-up.

De-escalation should occur in the majority of patients, but it is shown that doing this too early in high-risk patients may have adverse consequences on long-term anginal control.

### Nicardipine hydrochloride [^116qwpzP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Warnings

- **Increased frequency of angina**: Approximately 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials experienced increased frequency, duration, or severity of angina with the initiation of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules or upon dosage increases, compared to 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta-blockers show a higher frequency of increased angina, 4% versus 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see adverse reactions).

- **Use in patients with congestive heart failure**: Preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure indicate that nicardipine hydrochloride capsules reduce afterload without impairing myocardial contractility. However, it does have a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution is advised when using this drug in congestive heart failure patients, especially in conjunction with a beta-blocker.

- **Beta-blocker withdrawal**: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are not beta-blockers and do not offer protection against the risks of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Any withdrawal should be conducted through a gradual reduction of the beta-blocker dose, preferably over 8 to 10 days.

### Anti-anginal drugs-beliefs and evidence: Systematic review covering 50 years of medical treatment [^1138Vzvo]. European Heart Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic stable angina is the most prevalent symptom of ischaemic heart disease, and its management is a priority. Guidelines recommend pharmacological therapy with drugs classified as first line, such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and short-acting nitrates, or second line, including long-acting nitrates, ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, and trimetazidine. Second line drugs are indicated for patients who have contraindications to first line agents, do not tolerate them, or remain symptomatic. The evidence that one drug is superior to another has been questioned.

Between January and March 2018, we performed a systematic review of English-written articles from the past 50 years in Medline and Embase, following preferred reporting items and the Cochrane collaboration approach. We included double-blind randomized studies comparing parallel groups on the treatment of angina in patients with stable coronary artery disease. These studies had a sample size of at least 100 patients (50 patients per group), with a minimum follow-up of one week, and an outcome measured on exercise testing, with the duration of exercise being the preferred outcome. Thirteen studies fulfilled our criteria. Nine studies involved between 100 and 300 patients (2818 in total), and a further four enrolled more than 300 patients. Evidence of equivalence was demonstrated for the use of beta-blockers (atenolol), calcium antagonists (amlodipine, nifedipine), and a channel inhibitor (ivabradine) in three of these studies. Taken together, none of the studies showed evidence that one drug was superior.

- **Temporal patterns of antianginal medication use**: When stratified by angina frequency, only 15.6% of patients who reported monthly angina at 6 weeks were treated with non–β‐blocker antianginal medications; 2.1% of these patients were on two or more non–β‐blocker antianginal medications. Among patients with daily or weekly angina, 24.0% were treated with non–β‐blocker antianginal medications, and 5.0% were taking two or more medications. Over the course of follow-up, the proportion of patients taking one, two, or three non–β‐blocker antianginal medications increased modestly for both patients with monthly and daily/weekly angina.

- **Sublingual nitroglycerin use**: When stratified by sublingual nitroglycerin use, 104 of 303 patients (34.4%) who reported using sublingual nitroglycerin ≥ 1 time per week at six weeks were treated with at least one non–β‐blocker antianginal medication, compared with 449 of 2873 patients (15.6%) who used it less than once per week. Over the course of follow-up, the proportion of patients taking one, two, or three non–β‐blocker antianginal medications increased modestly for patients who used sublingual nitroglycerin both under and over one time per week.

### Antianginal effects of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and refractory angina; a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial (EMPT-ANGINA Trial) [^112zYGr2]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of antianginal drugs in patients with both stable angina and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is not well-studied. Some antianginal medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, can worsen glycemic control in these patients. Therefore, it is crucial to choose antianginal drugs that have a neutral or positive impact on glycemic levels. Some non-antianginal agents, such as thiazolidinediones and metformin, have been evaluated for treating angina in these patients. Etomoxir, a carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1 inhibitor, was initially introduced as an antidiabetic agent with potential antianginal properties suggested in some studies.

One animal study showed that canagliflozin decreased myocardial infarct size in both diabetic and non-diabetic rats, independent of glucose concentration at the time of ischemia or reperfusion injury over a four-week period. Moreover, another study revealed some coronary vasodilation properties of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, such as empagliflozin and canagliflozin, in healthy mouse hearts.

Large randomized controlled trials on SGLT2 inhibitors in T2DM have shown remarkable benefits on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs). Recent guidelines recommend administering SGLT2 inhibitors as second-line therapy after metformin, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, switches energy substrate preference from fatty acids (FAs) to glucose, reduces lactate production, and improves myocardial work efficiency and function.

Due to the possible antianginal effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, we…

### Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of complete angina relief in symptomatic patients in the ISCHEMIA trial [^112dNf6X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

To further contextualize the angina outcomes, we examined the total number of antianginal medications used among patients stratified by angina-free status at 1, 3, and 5 years. At 1 year, patients who were angina-free tended to be on slightly fewer antianginal medications compared with those with persistent angina, though this difference was not statistically significant in either the MED group (0.92 ± 1.1 versus 0.99 ± 1.2, P = 0.25) or the REV group (0.86 ± 1.1 versus 0.87 ± 1.1, P = 0.84).

At 3 years, mean antianginal medication use remained similar between those with and without angina. In the MED group, patients who were angina-free were on an average of 0.99 ± 1.1 medications compared with 1.0 ± 1.1 in those with persistent angina (P = 0.86). In the REV group, medication use was also comparable between patients who were angina-free and non-angina-free (0.92 ± 1.1 versus 0.85 ± 1.1, P = 0.52).

By 5 years, medication use remained stable across groups, with no significant difference in the number of antianginal drugs between patients who were angina-free and those with residual angina. In the MED group, mean medication use was 0.83 ± 1.1 among patients who were angina-free versus 0.87 ± 1.0 in those with angina (P = 0.78). In the REV group, these values were 0.81 ± 1.0 and 0.86 ± 1.1, respectively (P = 0.80).

### Ranolazine for chronic stable angina [^1164hs5p]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Ranolazine is a new and unique antianginal drug that has been approved for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. The drug is administered as a sustained-release formulation. Although the drug's mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it is believed that ranolazine, a selective inhibitor of late sodium influx, attenuates the abnormalities of ventricular repolarization and contractility associated with ischaemia. Three randomized trials have shown efficacy for ranolazine in increasing exercise testing or reducing anginal episodes or use of glyceryl trinitrate. Side effects include dizziness, constipation, nausea, and the potential for prolongation of the QT(c) interval. Ranolazine seems to be a safe addition to traditional drugs for chronic stable angina, especially in aggressive multidrug regimens.

Regarding medical management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, specifically in the context of managing chest pain, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ranolazine to improve symptoms in patients with angina-like chest pain, even in the absence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) or obstructive coronary artery disease.

### Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of complete angina relief in symptomatic patients in the ISCHEMIA trial [^112ZZeU5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Despite initial differences in angina relief favoring revascularization at one year, the gap between groups narrowed over time, with the MED strategy demonstrating a progressive improvement in angina relief. Notably, antianginal medication use remained relatively stable across follow-up periods, with no significant reduction in medication burden among those who achieved angina relief. These findings suggest that although both strategies ultimately result in comparable long-term angina control, the role of antianginal medications remains an important consideration in the overall management of patients with coronary artery disease (CCD).

Our findings build upon those of the COURAGE trial in several ways. First, in the analysis, revascularization provided more short-term angina relief than medical therapy alone. COURAGE reported a comparable trajectory, where initial differences in angina relief favoring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) diminished over time, accompanied by a substantial increase in angina-free rates in the medical therapy group. Second, the MED group shows substantial improvement in angina over time. By five years, the difference in angina-free rates between the two strategies had narrowed, with 66.7% of patients in the REV group and 61.2% in the MED group reporting freedom from angina.

In COURAGE, it was hypothesized that antianginal medications, as well as potential disease-modifying effects of therapies such as statins, may have contributed to improved symptoms over time in the medical group. However, our findings suggest that total antianginal medication use remains important in symptom management.

### Clinical practice variations in the management of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease [^113mvNQT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

More than half of the 130 cardiologists treating patients with INOCA always or often prescribe statins (68%), aspirin (66%), calcium channel blockers (63%), nitrates (60%), or β blockers or α/β blockers (55%). However, consistent across all tenure levels, only one of four respondents prescribe or recommend angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE‐Is/ARBs) (25%; 33/130). About one-fourth regularly prescribe or recommend ranolazine (27%; 35/130) or cardiac rehabilitation (24%; 31/130) to their patients. Consistent across all tenure levels and scopes of practice, cardiologists rarely or never use third‐ or fourth‐line therapies, including ivabradine, L‐arginine, or enhanced external counter pulsation.

Early career cardiologists are less inclined to prescribe nitrates (47%; 61/130) compared with their more tenured colleagues (mid career, 68%; late career, 63%). Early career (68%; 88/130) and mid career (71%; 92/130) cardiologists are twice as likely to use β blockers or α/β blockers compared with their peers (late career, 33%; 43/130).

Similarly, cardiologists who feel most confident in managing patients with INOCA more often prescribe statins, aspirin, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and β blockers or α/β blockers compared with those with less confidence. Of those respondents who do not feel very confident managing patients with INOCA, only 7% (1/15) routinely prescribe ACE‐Is/ARBs and 0% (0/15) prescribe cardiac rehabilitation.

### The ABCs of the 2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease [^1173Lz3K]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

In the management of patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD) and stable angina, three primary goals should be at the forefront of any therapeutic strategy: the relief of angina symptoms, the prevention of nonfatal occurrences like myocardial infarction (MI), and improving long-term survival rates.

Contemporary strategies for managing CCD include revascularization, pharmacological treatment, or a synergistic approach that integrates both modalities. A systematic review has identified key survival predictors in CCD, such as the anatomical and functional severity of the condition, left ventricular (LV) function, and comorbidities like diabetes and renal impairment. Management strategies should be customized to each patient's unique clinical profile. Some individuals may benefit from an integrated approach combining multiple therapeutic interventions, while for others, a single treatment modality may be more advantageous. For instance, in patients with CCD with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35%) or significant left main stenosis, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been shown to offer a survival advantage compared with medical therapy alone.

Revascularization approaches, including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG, as well as pharmacologic approaches, reduce symptoms of angina-related CCD. However, medical optimization is always recommended as the first-line intervention before procedural interventions. This was previously emphasized by the results of three major randomized controlled trials (RCTs): COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) and ISCHEMIA (The International Study of Comparative Effectiveness with Revascularization).

This article about currently available antiplatelet drugs is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of aspirin, reversible cyclooxygenase inhibitors, thienopyridines, and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 receptor antagonists. The relationships among dose, efficacy, and safety are thoroughly discussed, with a mechanistic overview of randomized clinical trials. The article does not provide specific management recommendations; however, it does highlight important practical aspects related to antiplatelet therapy, including the optimal dose of aspirin, the variable balance of benefits and hazards in different clinical settings, and the issue of interindividual variability in response to antiplatelet drugs.

### Revascularization in stable coronary artery disease [^114rj45N]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Management of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) centers on medication to prevent myocardial infarction and death. Many anti-anginal medications are beneficial for reducing symptoms and have been proven effective against placebo control. Before effective preventive medications were available, patients with stable CAD often underwent revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), based on the assumption that these procedures would prevent adverse events and reduce symptoms. However, recent randomized controlled trials have cast doubt on these assumptions.

Considering results from the recent ISCHEMIA trial, we discuss the evidence base that underpins revascularization for stable CAD in contemporary practice. We also focus on patient groups at high risk of myocardial infarction and death, for whom revascularization is often recommended. We outline areas of uncertainty, unanswered research questions, and key areas of potential miscommunication in doctor-patient consultations.

### Trimetazidine for stable angina [^117RCf1T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with stable angina not controlled by monotherapy with nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers are often treated with combinations of these drugs. There may be adverse effects from, or contraindications to, the use of these drug combinations. In low-risk groups, medical treatment appears to be as good an option as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in terms of averting myocardial infarction, death, or subsequent revascularization. Revascularization procedures are too costly or inaccessible for many patients in developing countries; therefore, effective and safe medical treatment is needed. Trimetazidine is a less well-known anti-anginal drug that controls myocardial ischaemia through intracellular metabolic changes. Some studies have reported that trimetazidine is better tolerated than combined anti-anginal therapy; however, it is not considered in published guidelines.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of trimetazidine in patients with stable angina.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and SCISEARCH, without language restriction, from inception to October 2003. Experts in the field were contacted to locate unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised studies comparing trimetazidine with placebo or other anti-angina drugs in adults with stable angina.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-three studies (1378 patients) met.

### Pharmacologic treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease [^111oC9oF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Half of women and one-third of men with angina and ischemia on stress testing have ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA). These patients experience a quality of life (QoL) impairment comparable to those with obstructive coronary artery disease. Clinicians generally treat INOCA with traditional antianginal agents, despite previous studies demonstrating variable responses to these medications.

We performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of available pharmacologic therapies for INOCA. We systematically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in July 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pharmacologic agents for INOCA. The primary outcome of interest was QoL. Secondary outcomes included subjective and objective efficacy measures and safety outcomes.

We included 35 RCTs from 333 identified studies.

- **Moderate-quality evidence includes**: Interventions that improved QoL were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (± statin) and ranolazine.

- **Low-to-very-low-quality evidence suggests**: ACE inhibitors, β blockers, calcium-channel blockers, nicorandil, ranolazine, and statins may decrease angina frequency and delay ischemia on stress testing. Other interventions, notably nitrates, did not significantly improve any outcome.

In conclusion, evidence for pharmacologic treatment of INOCA is generally poor, and higher-quality RCTs using a standardized definition of INOCA are needed.

### Diagnosis of patients with angina and non-obstructive coronary disease in the catheter laboratory [^113anHSn]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

While the evidence base for antianginal therapy in coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is less mature than for other conditions, notably obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), sufficient evidence exists, as outlined in contemporary guidelines, to make informed, personalized decisions for patients with ongoing symptoms and demonstrable ischemia.

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are efficacious in both CMD and coronary vasospasm and should therefore be used as first-line treatment for CMD where coronary vasospasm has not been ruled out. Beta-blockers can be beneficial in CMD but may potentiate coronary vasospasm due to unopposed α-receptor agonism. Therefore, they should only be used as first-line therapy for CMD if coronary vasospasm has been ruled out by vasoreactivity testing with acetylcholine. Nicorandil and ranolazine should be used as second-line and third-line therapies for CMD if symptoms persist.

- **Therapies for coronary vasospasm**: The clinical manifestations of coronary vasospasm include sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and syncope. Therapies such as calcium channel blockers and statins have been shown to improve this adverse prognosis. Calcium channel blockers are highly efficacious for treating coronary vasospasm, with long-acting nitrates being suitable second-line agents. Statins augment the effect of both and should also be considered a first-line agent. Novel therapeutics are being investigated for coronary vasospasm, and these studies indicate the paradigm shift in therapeutics that needs to be considered for patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD).

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^114Jckmt]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of coronary artery disease, and more specifically with respect to antianginal therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of nicorandil or trimetazidine. This recommendation applies as an add-on therapy in patients whose symptoms are inadequately controlled while on treatment with β-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or as part of the initial treatment strategy in properly selected patients.
