## Question

How is 4:00 pm expressed in military time?

Answer Choices:
A. 1600
B. 4
C. 400
D. 4:00

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to express 4:00 PM in military time and to choose the correct option among A. 1600, B. 4, C. 400, and D. 4:00. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic rule for converting PM times to 24-hour format. Then, I should verify the specific calculation for 4:00 PM. Next, I will check the formatting conventions for military time, including whether to include a colon and whether to use leading zeros. Finally, I will compare each option against the correct conversion and confirm the answer.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: military time uses a 24-hour clock, so PM times are converted by adding 12 to the 12-hour clock hour, and minutes are kept as-is. For example, 1:00 PM becomes 1300, 2:00 PM becomes 1400, and so on, which means 4:00 PM should be 4 + 12 = 16, followed by the minutes, giving 1600 [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the specific case of 4:00 PM. Adding 12 to 4 yields 16, and since there are 00 minutes, the military time is 1600. I initially wondered if I should write 16:00, but hold on, I should verify the formatting convention: military time typically omits the colon and uses four digits, so 1600 is correct, not 16:00 [^notfound].

> Next, I should review each option against this standard. Option A is 1600, which matches the 24-hour conversion and the correct formatting. Option B is 4, which is just the hour without the 12-hour adjustment and is incorrect. Option C is 400, which is missing the 12-hour addition and has an extra zero, so that is wrong. Option D is 4:00, which retains the colon and the 12-hour format, so it does not conform to military time conventions either [^notfound].

> I should double-check that I'm not overlooking any edge cases. There are none here; 4:00 PM is a straightforward PM conversion, and the correct military expression is 1600 without a colon, confirming that Option A is the right choice [^notfound].

---

The correct military time for 4:00 PM is **1600**. Military time uses a 24-hour clock, so PM times are converted by adding 12 to the hour; thus, 4:00 PM becomes 16:00, written as **1600** without a colon. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they either omit the 12-hour offset or use civilian formatting.

---

## Conversion of 4:00 PM to military time

- **Standard time**: 4:00 PM (12-hour clock)
- **Military time**: 16:00 (24-hour clock)
- **Military format**: 1600 (four digits, no colon)

---

## Explanation of military time

Military time is a **24-hour clock** that runs from 0000 (midnight) to 2359 (11:59 PM). Hours 1–12 correspond to 0100–1200, and hours 13–24 correspond to 1:00 PM–12:00 AM. To convert PM times, add 12 to the hour and remove the colon.

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Expression** | **Correctness** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | 1600 | Correct | Proper military format for 4:00 PM |
| B | 4 | Incorrect | Missing the 12-hour offset and minutes |
| C | 400 | Incorrect | Missing the 12-hour offset |
| D | 4:00 | Incorrect | Uses civilian colon format |

---

## Conclusion

The correct military time for 4:00 PM is **1600**.

### Melatonin for the prevention and treatment of jet lag [^fca271f4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

: Jet-lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones. It results from the body's internal rhythms being out of step with the day-night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re-align them with the outside world.

Objectives

: To assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jet-lag after air travel across several time zones.

Search Strategy

: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit and Science Citation Index electronically, and the journals 'Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine' and 'Sleep' by hand. We searched citation lists of relevant studies for other relevant trials. We asked principal authors of relevant studies to tell us about unpublished trials. Reports of adverse events linked to melatonin use outside randomised trials were searched for systematically in 'Side Effects of Drugs' (SED) and SED Annuals, 'Reactions Weekly', MEDLINE, and the adverse drug reactions databases of the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the US Food & Drug Administration.

Selection Criteria

: Randomised trials in airline passengers, airline staff or military personnel given oral melatonin, compared with placebo or other medication. Outcome measures should consist of subjective rating of jet-lag or related components, such as subjective wellbeing, daytime tiredness, onset and quality of sleep, psychological functioning, duration of return to normal, or indicators of circadian rhythms.

Data Collection and Analysis

: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. All compared melatonin with placebo; one in addition compared it with a hypnotic, zolpidem. Nine of the trials were of adequate quality to contribute to the assessment, one had a design fault and could not be used in the assessment. Reports of adverse events outside trials were found through MEDLINE, 'Reactions Weekly', and in the WHO UMC database.

Main Results

: Nine of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet-lag from flights crossing five or more time zones. Daily doses of melatonin between 0.5 and 5mg are similarly effective, except that people fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 0.5mg. Doses above 5mg appear to be no more effective. The relative ineffectiveness of 2mg slow-release melatonin suggests that a short-lived higher peak concentration of melatonin works better. Based on the review, the number needed to treat (NNT) is 2. The benefit is likely to be greater the more time zones are crossed, and less for westward flights. The timing of the melatonin dose is important: if it is taken at the wrong time, early in the day, it is liable to cause sleepiness and delay adaptation to local time. The incidence of other side effects is low. Case reports suggest that people with epilepsy, and patients taking warfarin may come to harm from melatonin.

Reviewer's Conclusions

: Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet-lag, and occasional short-term use appears to be safe. It should be recommended to adult travellers flying across five or more time zones, particularly in an easterly direction, and especially if they have experienced jet-lag on previous journeys. Travellers crossing 2-4 time zones can also use it if need be. The pharmacology and toxicology of melatonin needs systematic study, and routine pharmaceutical quality control of melatonin products must be established. The effects of melatonin in people with epilepsy, and a possible interaction with warfarin, need investigation.

### Insufficient sleep and behavioral health in the military: a 5-country perspective [^aa99e078]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Measures

Surveys from each country were comprised of a wide range of questions that varied depending on the study purpose and specific population being surveyed. We focus on relevant survey questions that were similar across countries. Specifically, three of the countries (Canada, New Zealand, and the US) had an item assessing average daily duration of sleep, with 5–6 response options (e.g. 3 h or fewer, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 8 h, or more). All five countries included questions taken from the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a seven-question scale designed to assess the severity of both nighttime and daytime components of insomnia. Due to individual survey requirements, there was variability in terms of which questions were included, so we focused this paper on responses to four of the ISI questions in order to encompass the most countries. Below, we examine responses to the first two ISI questions, which asked participants to rate their “difficulty falling asleep” and “difficulty staying asleep” over the past two weeks. Items were rated using 5 response options from None to Very Severe. We also examine the ISI question that asked how satisfied/dissatisfied respondents were with their current sleep pattern. Items were rated using 5 response options from Very Satisfied to Very Dissatisfied. Finally, we review responses to the ISI question that asked to what extent respondents considered their sleep problem interfered with daily functioning. This item was rated on a 5-point scale from Not at All/No Sleep Problem to Very Much Interfering. Australia provided answers to the first two ISI questions (see Table 1); Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US provided answers to all four questions.

### COVID-19 pandemic containment: following the example of military submariners [^210965a6]. BMJ Military Health (2020). High credibility.

Since its initial description at the end of December 2019, the new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2 epidemic has become a rapidly evolving pandemic.Following the WHO recommendation, governments worldwide declared quarantine status and containments to prevent the spreading of the disease. At the time of writing, more than 3.5 billion people (half of humanity) are under containment because of coronavirus restrictionsin either their movement, or limitations in the availbility of everyday items. The 20th century saw massive international treaties favouring both circulation of goods (eg, North American Free Trade Agreement, Association of South East Asian Nations and Economic Community Of West African States) and people (Schengen Area). The number of international air travellers has multiplied by 10 in less than 50 years. In this context, containment imposed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is triggering psychological distress.We believe that military submariners are a potential population for which to study quarantine and containment measures against. They sleep under the ocean usually between 2 and 3 months at a time, which is currently much longer than the usual containment period undertaken by most countries. Looking at evidence-based data regarding submariners, the specific containment of submariners provides conflicting results for stress. Even if a first study showed higher stress levels in the Royal Navy submariners than in the Royal Navy surface fleet,a 2-year cohort study did not confirm those results.Moreover, despite not seeing the natural sunlight that synchronises the circadian rhythm, there was no alteration of the sleep and wake patterns during a 70-day routine mission, with sleep monitored by polysomnography.Furthermore, and maybe the most important, the Royal Naval submariners between 1960 and 1989 seemed to have been a healthy group with low mortality overall.

### Objective model to facilitate designation of military-civilian partnership hospitals for sustainment of military trauma readiness [^00c2a221]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The seasonal effect on trauma can impact the experience obtained at an institution if courses are held year-round with a set expectation of case experiences. If an institution has large differences in peaks and troughs of urgent trauma cases, the number of urgent trauma cases experienced during a rotation may vary substantially. Not considered in this study, but potentially important, are the time of day and day of the week when urgent trauma cases occur. It is known that day of the week has some effect using this type of predictive model.For surgeons who are able to access trauma center call in their local area, knowledge of the most active trauma days may improve their ability to schedule call and obtain a higher volume of urgent cases. Likewise, if urgent trauma cases most commonly happen at night, a rotation could be established to have rotating surgeons on call only at night and resting in the day. This would eliminate prolonged downtime and shorten the length of the course. However, paradoxically, intermittent involvement without immersion into the other educational opportunities and the lack of covering the full spectrum of trauma care to focus only on operative cases may reduce the level of responsibility given to rotating surgeons and reduce educational and mentorship opportunities.

### Daylight saving time: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^e4268bb6]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Position statement: daylight saving time—conclusions state that existing data support the elimination of seasonal time changes in favor of a fixed, year-round time. Daylight saving time (DST) can cause misalignment of the human circadian biological clock and environmental clock, resulting in significant health and public safety-related consequences. A change to permanent standard time is best aligned with human circadian biology and has the potential to produce beneficial effects for public health and safety.

### A case-crossover study of ambient particulate matter and cardiovascular and respiratory medical encounters among US military personnel deployed to southwest Asia [^126dfc44]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of ambient particulate matter (PM) on acute cardiorespiratory morbidity among US military personnel in southwest Asia.

Methods

We linked ambient PM data collected between December 2005 and June 2007 with personnel, medical, and meteorological data. We implemented a case-crossover analysis to estimate base-specific associations and pooled those estimates using meta-analytic methods.

Results

The adjusted odds ratios for a 10-μg/m increase in ambient PM2.5 and a qualifying medical encounter were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77 to 1.11) and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.07) for the current (lag_0) and previous (lag_1) days. The estimates for a 10-μg/m increase in PM10 were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.03) at lag_0, and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.02) at lag_1.

Conclusions

No statistically significant associations between PM and cardiorespiratory outcomes were observed in this young, relatively healthy, deployed military population.

### Evidence-based principles of time, triage and treatment: refining the initial medical response to massive casualty incidents [^69121de4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The overall approach to massive casualty triage has changed little in the past 200 years. As the military and civilian organizations prepare for the possibility of future large-scale combat operations, terrorist attacks and natural disasters, potentially involving hundreds or even thousands of casualties, a modified approach is needed to conduct effective triage, initiate treatment, and save as many lives as possible.

Methods

Military experience and review of analyses from the Department of Defense Trauma Registry are combined to introduce new concepts in triage and initial casualty management.

Results

The classification of the scale of massive casualty (MASCAL) incidents, timeline of life-saving interventions, immediate first pass actions prior to formal triage decisions during the first hour after injury, simplification of triage decisions, and the understanding that ultra-MASCAL will primarily require casualty movement and survival needs with few prehospital life-saving medical interventions are discussed.

Conclusion

Self aid, bystander, and first responder interventions are paramount and should be trained and planned extensively. Military and disaster planning should not only train these concepts, but should seek innovations to extend the timelines of effectiveness and to deliver novel capabilities within the timelines to the greatest extent possible.

### Management of acute stress reactions in the military: a stepped care approach [^c58a0273]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1 
Key questions in the field of Acute Stress Reaction (ASR) management

Relatedly, the lack of knowledge of the extent to which specific ASR symptoms reflect activity, reactivity, or lack of activity in specific neural circuits leaves key questions unanswered. Do passive and active symptoms involve distinct neural pathways or are the same pathways differentially recruited? Will different medications be needed to target specific ASR symptoms and/or subtypes? Another key gap in knowledge is related to the time course of ASR symptom presentation. Given that our stepped care approach is based upon the emergence of ASR symptoms rather than time elapsed from the traumatic event, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions discussed could be used whenever ASR symptoms emerge rather than time-locked to the event itself. However, the efficacy of medications might vary as a function of time since trauma exposure, especially because the engagement of underlying physiological processes probably changes over time. Similarly, the frequency at which putatively resolved ASR symptoms re-emerge at levels sufficient to impair performance requires further investigation. If re-emerging symptoms are found to be common, medication development efforts will need to determine the safety and efficacy parameters for repeated dosing of one medication, or sequential dosing of two or more medications to fully manage symptoms and restore operational performance. Finally, the relationship between ASRs, possible ASR subtypes, and the likelihood of chronic psychiatric symptoms must be assessed since this information will define the scope of medication development and may provide evidence supporting early treatment approaches to prevent ASD/PTSD.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 7 travel by air, land, and sea [^13898b60]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

CDC Yellow Book—melatonin timing for circadian adjustment emphasizes dosing and scheduling details. Take melatonin 90 min before bed to assist your natural rise in melatonin, and taking melatonin when it is already naturally high is not effective. Not recommended to take high-dose melatonin (>5mg) because this can cause excess melatonin to be present at the wrong time of day as it is metabolized. Because melatonin is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, the amount of melatonin may vary from what is printed on the label. Similar to timed light exposure, recommendations on timing and duration of melatonin for eastward and westward flights is based on the number of time zones crossed, and jet lag calculators often offer recommendations on melatonin usage based on trip schedules.

### Validation of a predictive model for operative trauma experience to facilitate selection of trauma sustainment military-civilian partnerships [^ad07b04e]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

An ideal scenario would be to test a similar predictive model for individual types of cases. As the military adopts a knowledge Skills Abilities metric for readiness, which places a “point” value on specific types of cases, this model may help predict the timeline to skills or abilities readiness. Unfortunately, this prediction is not very practical for specific types of cases. As an example, earlier research at Saint Louis University identified 76 urgent operative vascular cases over the course of 731 days, an overall rate of 0.1 vascular cases per day.Other institutions may have much higher volume of urgent operative vascular cases that make predictive modeling for a course practical, but this is unlikely. Specific experience with complex vascular trauma cases, and other cases that improve combat casualty care readiness will likely have to be obtained through training courses such as ACS ASSET and Emergency War Surgery course which is being modified to support a military trauma needs.

The most significant weakness in this model is the lack of data on specific times of the day or night for operative cases. Using a calendar day, patients could in theory arriving shortly after midnight on 1 day and be operated on shortly before midnight the following day and count for the first day. Though this possible scenario is an uncommon event, it remains an uncertainty. This inherent inaccuracy in the calculation could account for the decreased accuracy of the model with orthopedic cases, as orthopedic injuries are seldom life threatening and interventions are more likely to be delayed to the following day or beyond for definitive treatment. This illustrates that the practical application or predictive methodology can be challenging, and consistent data measurement is imperative. The data in this analysis were from trauma registries which can be recorded using different software and accessed by different personnel at different times. Any variation in data collection or retrieval methods can alter predictions and outcomes. Therefore, there would be further improvement in this model if higher fidelity timelines were possible, including accurate times for patient arrival and OR start times to better predict the number of surgical cases during a rotation. Additional analysis of factors that affect orthopedic operative case timing would also be prudent to improve orthopedic accuracy.

### Permanent standard time is the optimal choice for health and safety: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^425078bf]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position statement—permanent standard time is advocated based on circadian biology and public health, and “the United States should eliminate seasonal time changes in favor of permanent standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology.” The statement explains that “the yearly change between standard time and daylight saving time introduces misalignment, which has been associated with risks to physical and mental health and safety, as well as risks to public health,” and affirms that “evidence supports the distinct benefits of standard time for health and safety, while also underscoring the potential harms that result from seasonal time changes to and from daylight saving time.” Mechanistically, it notes that “the human biological clock is regulated by the timing of light and darkness, which then dictates sleep and wake rhythms,” and that “when the solar clock is misaligned with the social clock, desynchronization occurs between the internal circadian rhythm and the social clock,” with the evidence “suggesting that evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time.”

### Normative values for circadian and ultradian cardiovascular rhythms in childhood [^396a4518]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the prevalence and characteristics of physiological circadian (24-hour) and ultradian (12-, 8-, and 6-hour) rhythms of mean arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), we analyzed 24-hour ambulatory BP profiles from 938 healthy school children aged 5 to 18 years. Cosine harmonics were fitted by Fourier analysis, and an amplitude and acrophase (time of peak) were calculated for each rhythm. Ninety percent of children displayed circadian rhythmicity of BP, independent of age, whereas circadian HR rhythmicity decreased with puberty from 96% to 87% (P<0.0001). Puberty had marked effects on the prevalence of ultradian rhythmicity: 12- and 6-hour rhythms increased for BP (27% to 47%, P<0.0001; 18% to 25%, P=0.01) and HR (36% to 47%, 17% to 31%, both P=0.001), whereas 8-hour BP rhythms decreased (34% to 23%, P=0.002). Median amplitudes were 10.1, 5.9, 5.6, and 5.2 mm Hg for the 24-, 12-, 8-, and 6-hour BP rhythms, respectively, and 13.4, 7.7, 6.8, and 6.4 bpm for HR. The acrophase occurred at approximately 14:00 hours, 8:00 hours, 5:30 hours, and 2:00 hours (military time) for the four BP rhythms, and at 13:30 hours, 08:30 hours, 01:50 hours, and 02:00 hours for HR. For the combined curve, the peak-trough difference was 25.9 mm Hg and 35 bpm for BP and HR, respectively, with the peaks occurring at 13:50 hours and 13:10 hours. There was marked association between BP and HR rhythms, both for prevalence (P<0.0001 for coupling of BP and HR rhythms of the same period length) and timing, with a median time lag of BP after HR acrophase of only 21, 16, 13, and 5 minutes for the four rhythms, respectively.

### Daylight saving time: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^7e669fe9]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

None

The last several years have seen intense debate about the issue of transitioning between standard and daylight saving time. In the United States, the annual advance to daylight saving time in spring, and fall back to standard time in autumn, is required by law (although some exceptions are allowed under the statute). An abundance of accumulated evidence indicates that the acute transition from standard time to daylight saving time incurs significant public health and safety risks, including increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, mood disorders, and motor vehicle crashes. Although chronic effects of remaining in daylight saving time year-round have not been well studied, daylight saving time is less aligned with human circadian biology-which, due to the impacts of the delayed natural light/dark cycle on human activity, could result in circadian misalignment, which has been associated in some studies with increased cardiovascular disease risk, metabolic syndrome and other health risks. It is, therefore, the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that these seasonal time changes should be abolished in favor of a fixed, national, year-round standard time.

Figure 1. 
Summary of Factor Analyses

The nondeployment questionnaire consisted of 29 questions and items. Nine items were removed due to low factor loading (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

The analysis included 5 exposure categories (combustion and ground dust, aircraft maintenance, heavy equipment maintenance, construction, and incineration byproducts) with their corresponding 20 questionnaire items along with their prevalence and duration. For participants with any exposure, we quantified intensity based on the duration of occurrences expressed in person-days of exposure, which was converted to person-months by multiplying months exposed with days per month and dividing the product by 30. To calculate a summary score for each exposure category, we assigned a 3-level score to each exposure based on the median duration (0, no exposure; 1, moderate exposure [duration >0 but less than or equal to the median or any positive response without duration data]; ≥2, more frequent exposure [duration greater than the median]). We calculated summary scores in the 5 exposure categories by adding the values contributed by each respondent (0, 1, or 2) for each item in the category. We scaled each cumulative domain score to a possible maximum of 100 to standardize the scores among the exposure domains, which allowed for consistent comparisons across domains with different numbers of questions in each category. We categorized missing item responses (none exceeded 2.3%) as no, indicating no exposure. An ordinal score of level 1 was assigned to yes responses with missing intensity data.

### Permanent standard time is the optimal choice for health and safety: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^70e872ea]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute effects of spring transition to daylight saving time (DST)—the 1-hour time shift reduces sleep and induces circadian misalignment with physiologic consequences. The 1-hour time shift in the spring results in the loss of 1 hour of sleep opportunity, and this sleep loss accrues daily, resulting in ongoing sleep debt; later-evening light and morning darkness delay the circadian clock. The major acute effect of the time change in the spring is reduced sleep, with additional effects including lower vagal tone with higher heart rate and blood pressure, immune system alterations, and cellular derangements such as altered myocyte gene expression, epigenetic and transcriptional profile of core clock genes, and increased inflammatory markers, all observed with the 1-hour spring time shift.

### Management of acute stress reactions in the military: a stepped care approach [^dea8cd5c]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1 
Timeline of post-traumatic event symptoms. Post-trauma symptoms can occur at any time following a traumatic event. Symptoms may resolve at any point, spontaneously or with treatment. The presence of symptoms at one point does not necessarily predict future symptoms. Theoretically, interventions to manage symptoms can be applied at any point during or following the traumatic event. Although an ASR can be present up to 30 days following trauma exposure, the first 72 hours are of critical importance for military operations, are the least well- understood or studied, and occur within a period that ASD or PTSD cannot be diagnosed

Unlike PTSD and ASD, ASRs do not constitute a diagnosable condition and are generally believed to resolve without intervention. Accordingly, the 11th ICD edition now designates ASRs as normal reactions that scale to the severity of the precipitating event and the individual’s perception of it. Additionally, although an ASR can present up to 30 days following trauma, the classification also captures a period that is not captured by ASD or PTSD diagnoses. This period starts from the moment of traumatic stress exposure to 72 hours afterwards. ASRs can also cause significant distress and disrupt functioning, and their contribution to the onset of additional symptoms indicative of ASD or PTSD remains an open question.

### Permanent standard time is the optimal choice for health and safety: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^45f08566]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Chronic effects of daylight saving time (DST)—naturalistic comparisons within single time zones where solar exposure differs indicate that an extra hour of evening natural light is linked to reduced sleep and other harms: in the United States, solar light/dark exposure differs by about 1 hour or more, an extra hour of natural light in the evening reduced sleep duration chronically by an average of 19 minutes and increased self-reported insufficient sleep; westward position shows increased cancer risk with even a 5° westward position, and economic models indicate productivity losses equivalent to 4.4 million lost days of work. Under DST, chronic misalignment between internal circadian timing and social schedules results in significant sleep differences between workdays and days off (“social jet lag”); adolescents and young adults are most impacted due to later bed/wake times and longer sleep needs, and persistent, augmented social jet lag and mood disturbance have been demonstrated with permanent DST, with those having an evening chronotype potentially more impacted.

Jet lag—timed melatonin use notes that melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland in the brain during darkness and it is suppressed during the day with light exposure. Under a typical sleep-wake schedule without rapid travel across time zones, melatonin is secreted for approximately 12 hours at night—melatonin secretion starts to increase in the early evening about 2 hours before normal bedtime and peak plasma concentration occurs at approximately 3–4 a.m. Taking melatonin when the internal clock thinks it is morning will result in a phase delay which can facilitate adaptation to westward travel, whereas taking it when the internal clock thinks it is early evening will result in a phase advance which can facilitate adaptation to eastward travel. It is important to appropriately plan melatonin as taking it at the wrong time can increase misalignment, and taking melatonin when endogenous melatonin is high (body clock time 12–5 a.m.) is not as effective. Melatonin dosages vary, but 0.5–1 mg is often sufficient to produce a circadian shift.

### 24-hour activity cycle behaviors and gray matter volume in mild cognitive impairment [^4f07a64a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Each 24‐HAC day started at the first minute of sleep (i.e. bedtime) and ended at the last minute of a PA or SB (i.e. the last minute before the participant pressed the event marker). For example, if a participant went to bed at 11:00 PM, woke up at 7:00 AM, and went to bed at 12:00 AM, we considered the 24‐hour day as the window between 11:00 PM and 11:59 PM of the next day, a total of 24 hours and 59 minutes. This approach captures each individual's unique 24‐hour cycle and accommodates variations in sleep patterns, and aligns with the understanding that 24‐HAC behaviors are co‐dependent and should be analyzed within an individual's entire day instead of setting a fixed start and end time for all participants. Next, we averaged the time spent in each 24‐HAC behavior across the recording period (i.e. consecutive and valid days), with values of 24‐HAC behaviors reflecting the average time spent per day. We only included participants with ≥5 consecutive days of wear time to provide reliable estimates of PA, SB, and sleep(eFigure S1). As compositional data analysis requires a constant‐sum constraint (i.e. 1440 minutes for a day or 100%),we rescaled the participants’ average time spent in each 24‐HAC behavior to sum up to 1440 minutes using the closure function from the compositions R package (version 2.0‐4). Next, we transformed the average rescaled time spent on each behavior into a proportion (%) of the day.

We applied a compositional data analysis (compositions R package version 2.0‐6) approach to treat 24‐HAC behaviors.Compositional data analysis expresses time spent (or proportion of time) in behaviors (e.g. PA, SB, and sleep) during a finite period (i.e. 1440 min of the day or 100%) in relative terms as a set of isometric log‐ratio (ilr) coordinates.We used a set of coordinates that enable one part of the composition (i.e. the pivot coordinate) to be considered relative to the remaining parts of the composition (Equations (1), (2), (3), (4)):

Jet lag—timed light exposure guidance explains that intentional light exposure (or avoidance) at appropriate times of day can help facilitate circadian adaptation to the destination time zone, and when crossing time zones, light can play a key role in decreasing the duration of circadian desynchrony. Exposure to bright light in the morning following the circadian nadir (approximately 2–4 hours prior to habitual wake time) promotes phase advances, while exposure in the evening generally promotes phase delays. The optimal timing for light exposure is based on the direction of travel and the number of time zones crossed; consider using a jet lag calculator for individualized recommendations, and appropriately timed light exposure in combination with melatonin may further facilitate adaptation.

### Objective model to facilitate designation of military-civilian partnership hospitals for sustainment of military trauma readiness [^9ff183a3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

After non-human research determination, data from trauma registries at four participating institutions were obtained and analyzed. These institutions were identified based on military association and willingness of their trauma registries to provide information based on study criteria. Identities have been withheld to prevent any bias in further military partnerships. Previously used methods were replicated with several definitions made a priori.

Urgent surgical operation in traumatically injured patients was selected as the intervention of interest most closely representing the role of forward-deployed surgeons.The most common scenario for deployed forward surgical teams includes a general and an orthopedic surgeon with a small team consisting of four to eight additional personnel in an austere far-forward, resource-constrained environment with little or no patient holding capacity. These ‘damage control’ surgical units are used strategically on the battlefield to bridge the time/space gap between wounding and definitive care; they provide initial resuscitation, hemorrhage control, contamination control, and long-bone fracture stabilization for patients transferring to higher levels of care. For the purposes of this analysis, an urgent operation was defined as an operation that occurred on the day or the following day (one calendar day) of admission. A calendar day instead of a strict 24-hour separation between admission and operations was used to define an urgent case during a 24-hour shift due to uncertainty in the accuracy of time of day measurements in trauma registries.

### No evidence for decision fatigue using large-scale field data from healthcare [^557df0bf]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

a) Overlap AM-PM shift. Here we want as much separation as possible in time spent at work (long for the AM shift, short for the PM shift) but also as large a sample as possible. For example, choosing only those nurses who start very early would mean increased separation (longer time until the overlap period) but at the cost of getting a smaller sample, because those who start later but are still in the AM shift would be excluded. We used the following main rules: Consider only decisions taken between 13:00–17:00 on Mon–Fri for workers who either take their first call 6:00–9:00 and their last call after 13:00 (AM worker), or take their first call 13:00–18:00 and their last call after 19:00 (PM worker). Then also exclude workers who take <12 calls because they are likely working on other tasks (e.g. admin) that we do not have data on. Further, we divide the relevant time window (13:00–17:00) in 30 min time bins (thus eight in total) and keep only those bins with >100 observations for each category of workers (AM and PM shifts, respectively). Applied to the pilot data these rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 9730 calls to k = 166 nurses; applied to the target data (stage 2), using these rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 9648 calls to k = 143 nurses.

b) Intense call sequences before vs. after breaks. Here we want sufficiently long and intense sequences, meaning many calls with little time in-between for rest, but also as large a sample as possible. We used the following main rules: Consider only sequences where a nurse handled at least five calls before and five calls after a break 8–40 min, and there are at most five min between each call. The exact values used here are arbitrary (unless changed substantially), e.g. using 7 or 9 min instead of 8 min as lower cutoff for a break should not make a difference; the important part for us was to decide on and specify these values exactly and in advance, in order to credibly restrict analytic flexibility later on when analyzing the new data. These rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 5120 calls to k = 116 nurses in the pilot data; and n = 4940 calls to k = 77 nurses in the target (stage 2) data.

### Holistically assessing dismounted warfighter military performance: bridging science and operational relevancy [^9e53be8f]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

Phase 1 used Exercise Cambrian Patrol, a 48-hour, 60 km patrolling event where eight-person patrols complete a succession of scored tasks assessing military skills and physical and mental endurance. Five patrols completed an extensive range of physiological, psychological, biochemical and psychophysiological measurements. Phase 1 provided the research team with information on the practicality and effectiveness (ie, did they work and did they show anything) of the data collection methods used, the variables measured and the data ingestion and analysis techniques utilised, allowing them to be down-selected for Phase 2.

Phase 2 used Exercise Long Reach, completed by British Army Officer Cadets, where patrols cover ~50 km, navigating 13 checkpoints within a 36-hour cut-off time. 59 officer cadets completed the down-selected Phase 1 measures, including an extended baseline duration (1 vs 5 days). Streamlined data handling processes allowed direct ingestion into an interrogable database for cleaning and analysis. Techniques used included exploratory machine learning analysis, where physical performance predictions were approached as a regression problem, while psychological performance predictions were approached as a classification problem. Phases 1 and 2 generated the following key recommendations:

Given their relatedness to the physical performance indicator measured, physical performance, sleepiness and/or sleep should be monitored prior to and during FTX.
Due to associations observed with changes in physical performance, future wearable devices to monitor and predict warfighter physical performance should quantify movement distance, duration and physical activity levels. Wearable devices should allow for raw data extraction to facilitate data analysis and modelling.
Due to the associations seen with cognitive performance, indicators of stress, anxiety and sleepiness and/or sleep should be monitored prior to and during FTX, and consideration should be given to training stress reactivity and enhancing sleep quality.
Given their support from the existing literature, future research predicting warfighter performance should continue to develop and include robust and field-deployable heart rate and HRV measurement approaches.
Future studies should build on this approach, focusing on live data ingestion to provide real-time actionable outcomes during data collection.
Future research should involve larger-scale studies and the implementation of continuous and integrated data capture to quantify ‘predictor’ and ‘performance’ variables. This could be achieved through bespoke military exercises, looped ‘courses’ and repeated data collections on regularly scheduled FTX.

### Dietary rhythmicity and mental health among airline personnel [^ab4508d5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Measures

Meal Timing and Daily Eating Window

Work shifts for airline crew members are irregular. During a typical week, they may operate early flights on some days (morning-shift days) and late flights on other days (night-shift days). To capture the variability of breakfast and dinner times during different work shifts, we relied on this survey question: What time do you usually have breakfast and dinner when working morning shifts (takeoff before 09:00), night shifts (landing after 22:00), and on rest days, respectively? Daily eating window time is typically defined as the interval between the first and last caloric intake each day.In this study, we used the interval between the first and the last meal of the day (ie, between breakfast and dinner). Breakfast times were grouped as before 8, between 8 and 9, and after 9, and dinner times were grouped as before 8and after 8These time thresholds were chosen because they were considered to be associated with metabolism.A daily eating window of 12 hours was widely used in time-restricted eating studies. Following the literature, we grouped eating windows as over 12 hours and 12 hours or less.

Meal Jet Lag and Eating Jet Lag

Dietary jet lag, defined as the variability of eating time, was estimated using the method for calculating social jet lag.For meal jet lag, we took the difference between mealtime on workdays (morning-shift days and night-shift days) and on rest days. Breakfasts and dinners were calculated separately.

For eating jet lag, we defined the eating midpoint as the intermediate time between the first and the last meal. Similar to the method of estimating the sleep midpoint,we then took the difference between eating midpoint on weekdays (early-shift days and late-shift days) and on rest days.Following the literature on social jet lag,we grouped eating jet lag as 1 hour or more or less than 1 hour.

Finally, we defined meal jet lag and eating jet lag as delayed, advanced, or maintained according to the timing of each meal on weekdays. Specifically, if the value was less than 1 hour, mealtime was considered to be advanced; if the value was more than 1 hour, mealtime was considered to be delayed; and if the value was within 1 hour, mealtime was considered to be maintained.

### Dietary rhythmicity and mental health among airline personnel [^c1f7821d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Misaligned dietary rhythmicity has been associated with metabolic diseases; however, its association with mental health remains largely unexplored.

Objective

To examine the association between dietary rhythms and the mental health condition of shift workers, specifically airline crew members.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected from the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China, an ongoing large-scale health survey of pilots, flight attendants, and air security officers employed by major airline companies in China. Participants aged 18 to 60 years were invited through text messages to complete a web-based survey. The data collection period was December 2022 to March 2023. Statistical analysis was performed from July 24, 2023, to April 12, 2024.

Exposure

Data on timing of breakfast and dinner on workdays and rest days, daily time windows for food intake, and meal and eating jet lags were collected and calculated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the associations of anxiety and depression with meal timing, eating window time, meal jet lag (ie, delayed meals), and eating jet lag (ie, delayed eating). All models were adjusted for individual socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle characteristics.

Results

Of the 22 617 participants (median [IQR] age, 29.1 [26.3-33.7] years; 13 712 males [60.6%]), 1755 (7.8%) had anxiety and 2768 (12.2%) had depression. After controlling for confounding factors, having dinner after 8 pm on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.05) and depression (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.78-2.27), compared with consuming dinner before 8 pm. Similar results were observed on night-shift days and rest days. An eating window of less than 12 hours was associated with reduced odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93) and depression (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.89) on morning-shift days; the results remained significant on rest days. Delayed dinner on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54) and depression (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.58). On night-shift days, delayed dinner was associated with higher odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39) and depression (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08-1.36). On morning-shift days, delayed eating rhythms were associated with higher odds of depression (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.61), whereas advanced eating rhythms were associated with lower odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.87).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study found that meal timing, long eating window, and meal jet lags were associated with increased odds of depression and anxiety. These findings underscore the need for interventions and supportive policies that help mitigate the adverse implications of shift work and irregular working hours for the mental health of shift workers.

### Respiratory health after military service in southwest Asia and afghanistan. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^51fa9b6b]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

PM2.5 and long-term pulmonary health effects in nonmilitary cohorts—Population-based studies of ambient particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) report that chronic exposure (10–14 yr in duration) at concentrations lower than those experienced during deployment results in reduced pulmonary function by spirometry, and the Taiwan MJ Cohort Study reported an increased risk of incident COPD with greater exposure. Consistent with a 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) review, there was limited/suggestive evidence linking exposure to combustion products with long-term effects causing reduced pulmonary function and weaker evidence of an association between chronic PM exposure and new-onset adult asthma. Considering age at exposure, lung growth as assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) occurs through the mid-20s, and a lower FEV1 in early adulthood is a risk factor for future COPD. Deployment durations for Southwest Asia and Afghanistan are described as relatively short, with an estimated mean [standard deviation (SD)] of 10.6 [6.6] mo.

### Respiratory health after military service in southwest Asia and afghanistan. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^6fcb44dc]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

Future lung disease risk from particulate matter—workshop findings regarding estimated PM2.5 concentrations during deployment raise concerns about the future respiratory health of previously deployed personnel because adverse respiratory health effects have been observed at PM concentrations much lower than those experienced during deployment. Although multiple sources contributed to PM during deployment, the predominant contribution was desert dust; epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between acute desert dust exposure and increased hospitalization for asthma, pneumonia, and other respiratory causes, and desert dust exposure may also have contributed to acute respiratory illness during deployment. The report notes little currently available data to guide assessment of long-term effects of repeated PM or other air pollutant exposures during deployment and no prior literature quantifying chronic pulmonary health effects attributable to substantially higher but shorter exposures, usually months up to several years.

### Time of day is associated with postoperative morbidity: an analysis of the national surgical quality improvement program data [^ab3603ba]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association between surgical start time and morbidity and mortality for nonemergent procedures.

Summary Background Data

Patients require medical services 24 hours a day. Several studies have demonstrated a difference in outcomes over the course of the day for anesthetic adverse events, death in the ICU, and dialysis care. The relationship between operation start time and patient outcomes is yet undefined.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of 144,740 nonemergent general and vascular surgical procedures performed within the VA Medical System 2000-2004 and entered into the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database. Operation start time was the independent variable of interest. Logistic regression was used to adjust for patient and procedural characteristics and to determine the association between start time and, in 2 independent models, mortality and morbidity.

Results

Unadjusted later start time was significantly associated with higher surgical morbidity and mortality. After adjustment for patient and procedure characteristics, mortality was not significantly associated with start time. However, after appropriate adjustment, operations starting between 4 pm and 6 pm were associated with an elevated risk of morbidity (OR = 1.25, P < or = 0.005) over those starting between 7 am and 4 pm as were operations starting between 6 pm and 11 pm (OR = 1.60, P < or = 0.005).

Conclusions

When considering a nonemergent procedure, surgeons must bear in mind that cases that start after routine "business" hours within the VA System may face an elevated risk of complications that warrants further evaluation.

Jet lag management—general tips state to choose a flight that arrives at a time that gives the traveler the optimal amount of timed light exposure and consider use of a jet lag calculator to personalize recommendations on the timing of bright light, avoidance of light, and administration of melatonin. Additional tips include if possible, adjust sleep time to more closely match the sleep period at the destination for a few days prior to the trip; time activities (e.g., meals, sleep, light exposure) based on the destination time zone; stay hydrated because volume depletion can worsen physical symptoms of jet lag; avoid excess alcohol; avoid sedative medications with long half-lives; maximize natural light exposure at the destination; and avoid lengthy naps during the day at the destination because this will make it more difficult to sleep at night; short naps may improve alertness.

### The golden hour of casualty care: rapid handoff to surgical team is associated with improved survival in war-injured US service members [^8c331aee]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine time from injury to initiation of surgical care and association with survival in US military casualties.

Background

Although the advantage of trauma care within the "golden hour" after an injury is generally accepted, evidence is scarce.

Methods

This retrospective, population-based cohort study included US military casualties injured in Afghanistan and Iraq, January 2007 to December 2015, alive at initial request for evacuation with maximum abbreviated injury scale scores ≥2 and documented 30-day survival status after injury. Interventions: (1) handoff alive to the surgical team, and (2) initiation of first surgery were analyzed as time-dependent covariates (elapsed time from injury) using sequential Cox proportional hazards regression to assess how intervention timing might affect mortality. Covariates included age, injury year, and injury severity.

Results

Among 5269 patients (median age, 24 years; 97% males; and 68% battle-injured), 728 died within 30 days of injury, 68% within 1 hour, and 90% within 4 hours. Only handoffs within 1 hour of injury and the resultant timely initiation of emergency surgery (adjusted also for prior advanced resuscitative interventions) were significantly associated with reduced 24-hour mortality compared with more delayed surgical care (adjusted hazard ratios: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.14-0.82; P = 0.02; and 0.40; 95% CI: 0.20-0.81; P = 0.01, respectively). In-hospital waits for surgery (mean: 1.1 hours; 95% CI; 1.0-1.2) scarcely contributed ( P = 0.67).

Conclusions

Rapid handoff to the surgical team within 1 hour of injury may reduce mortality by 66% in US military casualties. In the subgroup of casualties with indications for emergency surgery, rapid handoff with timely surgical intervention may reduce mortality by 60%. To inform future research and trauma system planning, findings are pivotal.

### A glial circadian gene expression atlas reveals cell-type and disease-specific reprogramming in response to amyloid pathology or aging [^36918fc7]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

Disease signatures in glia depend on the time of day

Numerous groups have generated transcriptomic signatures of microglia and astrocytes in AD models,, ; however, it remains unclear whether such signatures are stable when mice are collected at different times of day. To examine this, we binned time points together to represent general times of day (6–10 a.m. as AM versus 4–8 p.m. as PM) and compared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between WT and APP/PS1 microglia and astrocyte samples, respectively. We included only cell-specific transcripts (significantly upregulated in TRAP/RiboTag versus Pre-IP). In microglia, we identified 506 upregulated genes in the AM in APP/PS1 mice (adjusted P < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5; Fig. 8a and Extended Data Fig. 10), while identical analysis of mice killed in the PM revealed a ~20% increase in the number of upregulated genes (627 genes total; Fig. 8b). The time-of-day effect was especially prominent among genes with lower fold changes (Fig. 8c). Several important microglial genes were only differentially expressed in the PM, including the low-density lipoprotein receptor Ldlr, interferon-inducible protein Aim2 and phagocytic regulator Cd209a (Fig. 8d,e). Other genes, including inflammatory mediators Ccl9 and Ly96, and AD GWAS genes Spi1 and Ighm, were also only differentially expressed at one time of day in microglia (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). When analyzing the statistically significant upregulated genes in the AM compared to the PM time bin, we found that more than 25% of the identified genes were specific to a particular time of day (Extended Data Fig. 10d).

### Objective model to facilitate designation of military-civilian partnership hospitals for sustainment of military trauma readiness [^e16304f9]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The number of call days needed for a surgeon to experience a variable number of urgent cases and the average number of urgent cases per 24-hour call period were estimated using bootstrap resampling methods, and scenarios hypothesizing a number of shifts and expected number of cases, along with 95% CI, were listed. For scenarios requiring a preset number of cases and asking how many days were required, the number of days required was determined to be the number at which the minimum number of a one-sided 95% CI was the preset number of cases. The upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI was estimated and determined to be the maximum expected number of days it would take to see X number of cases with a 95% level of confidence.

### Objective model to facilitate designation of military-civilian partnership hospitals for sustainment of military trauma readiness [^3545cafc]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

It has been previously confirmed that seasonality may affect the frequency of urgent operations, but it may not impact all specialties.For each surgical specialty examined, seasonality was tested for each institution and, where appropriate, further analysis was done to determine the anticipated number of days required to experience a certain number of cases and to estimate how many cases would be experienced during a specified number of days. Given there are little data to discern adequate case volume for a general surgeon to be ‘proficient’ in trauma, we chose 10 operative trauma cases as an initial benchmark, the number mandated by Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for general surgery graduation, but considered other possible case volumes above and below this number.Additional case volume scenarios were analyzed, defining competency as exposure to ‘X’ cases per year, where ‘X’=5, 10, 12, or 20 cases, respectively. Since a training program and readiness metric require some level of certainty for course planning, predictions were made with a goal of 95% confidence. The initial data that sought from institutions were data from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2017. One institution (Institution 3) did not have available data from this exact time frame, and instead a set from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, was used.

Non-parametric bootstrap simulation methods were used to evaluate the distribution of the observed data set, which is assumed to represent the population and future years. The observed data were resampled with replacement 10,000 times to estimate a sampling distribution. Given that the precision of the bootstrap estimates is determined by the precision of the original sample, 10 000 resamples were determined to be sufficient, and additional samples were unlikely to change the estimates. Poisson regression was used to investigate whether seasonal variation existed in the observed 2-year data for general/trauma surgery, orthopedic, and neurosurgery cases at each hospital and to investigate whether seasons, days of the week, and the interactions of seasons and years and days of the week and year were significantly associated with counts of surgical cases. If overdispersion was observed in the data, a negative binomial model was used instead. All models met the goodness of fit criteria for Poisson and negative binomial regression. For the variable season, spring was defined as March, April, and May, summer was defined as June, July, and August, fall was defined as September, October, and November, and winter was defined as December, January, and February.

### The effect of a golden hour policy on the morbidity and mortality of combat casualties [^a6f72df9]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The term golden hour was coined to encourage urgency of trauma care. In 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates mandated prehospital helicopter transport of critically injured combat casualties in 60 minutes or less.

Objectives

To compare morbidity and mortality outcomes for casualties before vs after the mandate and for those who underwent prehospital helicopter transport in 60 minutes or less vs more than 60 minutes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective descriptive analysis of battlefield data examined 21,089 US military casualties that occurred during the Afghanistan conflict from September 11, 2001, to March 31, 2014. Analysis was conducted from September 1, 2014, to January 21, 2015.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Data for all casualties were analyzed according to whether they occurred before or after the mandate. Detailed data for those who underwent prehospital helicopter transport were analyzed according to whether they occurred before or after the mandate and whether they occurred in 60 minutes or less vs more than 60 minutes. Casualties with minor wounds were excluded. Mortality and morbidity outcomes and treatment capability-related variables were compared.

Results

For the total casualty population, the percentage killed in action (16.0% [386 of 2411] vs 9.9% [964 of 9755]; P<.001) and the case fatality rate ([CFR] 13.7 [469 of 3429] vs 7.6 [1344 of 17,660]; P<.001) were higher before vs after the mandate, while the percentage died of wounds (4.1% [83 of 2025] vs 4.3% [380 of 8791]; P=.71) remained unchanged. Decline in CFR after the mandate was associated with an increasing percentage of casualties transported in 60 minutes or less (regression coefficient, -0.141; P<.001), with projected vs actual CFR equating to 359 lives saved. Among 4542 casualties (mean injury severity score, 17.3; mortality, 10.1% [457 of 4542]) with detailed data, there was a decrease in median transport time after the mandate (90 min vs 43 min; P<.001) and an increase in missions achieving prehospital helicopter transport in 60 minutes or less (24.8% [181 of 731] vs 75.2% [2867 of 3811]; P<.001). When adjusted for injury severity score and time period, the percentage killed in action was lower for those critically injured who received a blood transfusion (6.8% [40 of 589] vs 51.0% [249 of 488]; P<.001) and were transported in 60 minutes or less (25.7% [205 of 799] vs 30.2% [84 of 278]; P<.01), while the percentage died of wounds was lower among those critically injured initially treated by combat support hospitals (9.1% [48 of 530] vs 15.7% [86 of 547]; P<.01). Acute morbidity was higher among those critically injured who were transported in 60 minutes or less (36.9% [295 of 799] vs 27.3% [76 of 278]; P<.01), those severely and critically injured initially treated at combat support hospitals (severely injured, 51.1% [161 of 315] vs 33.1% [104 of 314]; P<.001; and critically injured, 39.8% [211 of 530] vs 29.3% [160 of 547]; P<.001), and casualties who received a blood transfusion (50.2% [618 of 1231] vs 3.7% [121 of 3311]; P<.001), emphasizing the need for timely advanced treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

A mandate made in 2009 by Secretary of Defense Gates reduced the time between combat injury and receiving definitive care. Prehospital transport time and treatment capability are important factors for casualty survival on the battlefield.

### Management of acute stress reactions in the military: a stepped care approach [^75da34e3]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Development of Medications for Operational Use in the Far Term (15–20 Years)

In parallel to the development of medications for the near term, basic science efforts to develop novel medications that meet optimal criteria are ongoing. Basic preclinical science studies to identify the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASRs can potentially identify targets of opportunity for the development of ASR-specific medications. Capturing ASRs in people as they are occurring can be costly in terms of both resources and time, thereby complicating the process of collecting biosamples to cultivate new medication targets. Likewise, clinical trials of candidate medications to establish efficacy are expensive. Preclinical investigations are cost- and time-effective for providing these insights through the use of virtual, synthetic, cellular, and animal models, with the ability for medications to be evaluated in parallel or sequentially over a relatively short period of time.

Animal models have been integral to the understanding of the effects of a variety of stress exposures on neurophysiological and neurobehavioral processes. Many models rely on one form of stress presented in a single exposure or over repeated exposures to provoke measurable responses, typically behavioral, endocrine, or physiological in nature. To best model traumatic events, animal models must have ecological validity for inducing perceptions of a direct threat to life. For example, our group has developed a single-day stress procedure called Military-Relevant Complex Traumatic Stress (MRCTS) to model a military-relevant traumatic event by incorporating the perception of a direct threat to life with additional elements of traumatic events that service members may encounter in operational settings. As part of far-term development, medications that are found to restore behavioral performance, improve surrogate endpoints after traumatic stress exposure, and that have favorable pharmacological characteristics can be transitioned to advanced testing and development. Throughout this process, emerging technologies can be applied to enhance down-selection decisions and speed progress. The ultimate objective is to deliver novel FDA-approved medications that fully restore performance, rapidly alleviate ASR symptoms, and reduce the risk of PTSD symptom onset so that service members can remain safe and maintain performance during high-stress operations.

### Respiratory health after military service in southwest Asia and afghanistan. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^f03965ff]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

Exposure overview—particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) exposures during deployments were assessed by the Enhanced Particulate Matter Surveillance Program (EPMSP) at 15 sites mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and 2007, with sampling approximately four times per month at each location. Despite limitations that the equipment was not designed to collect PM during the highest exposure days, the mean 24-hour PM2.5 values were consistently high at each site (~40 μg/m3 to nearly 120 μg/m3) and considerably exceeded the current U.S. annual PM2.5 exposure standard (12 μg/m3) and the 24-hour U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 μg/m3). Other estimates were similar, including daily sampling in Kuwait City in 2004–2005 where the annual average PM2.5 value was 53 μg/m3. At Joint Base Balad, PM2.5 concentrations upwind and downwind of the burn pit were similar, indicating significant contributions from off-base sources, and a Kuwait source apportionment attributed ambient PM2.5 to 54% from sand dust, 18% from oil combustion, 12% from the petrochemical industry, 11% from traffic, and 5% from other anthropogenic sources. The 2011 Institute of Medicine report noted that a broader consideration of air pollution than exposure only to burn pit emissions might be associated with long-term health effects, particularly in highly exposed or susceptible populations.

### Existence of an endogenous circadian blood pressure rhythm in humans that peaks in the evening [^76b88afe]. Circulation Research (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale

Blood pressure (BP) usually decreases during nocturnal sleep and increases during daytime activities. Whether the endogenous circadian control system contributes to this daily BP variation has not been determined under appropriately controlled conditions.

Objective

To determine whether there exists an endogenous circadian rhythm of BP in humans.

Methods and Results

In 28 normotensive adults (16 men), we assessed BP across 3 complementary, multiday, in-laboratory protocols performed in dim light, throughout which behavioral and environmental influences were controlled and/or uniformly distributed across the circadian cycle via: (1) a 38-hour "constant routine," including continuous wakefulness; (2) a 196-hour "forced desynchrony" with 7 recurring 28-hour sleep/wake cycles; and (3) a 240-hour forced desynchrony with 12 recurring 20-hour sleep/wake cycles. Circadian phases were derived from core body temperature. Each protocol revealed significant circadian rhythms in systolic and diastolic BP, with almost identical rhythm profiles among protocols. The peak-to-trough amplitudes were 3 to 6 mm Hg for systolic BP and 2 to 3 mm Hg for diastolic BP (always P<0.05). All 6 peaks (systolic and diastolic BP in 3 protocols) occurred at a circadian phase corresponding to ≈9:00 pm (ie, the biological evening). Based on substantial phase differences among circadian rhythms of BP and other variables, the rhythm in BP appeared to be unrelated to circadian rhythms in cortisol, catecholamines, cardiac vagal modulation, heart rate, or urine flow.

Conclusions

There exists a robust endogenous circadian rhythm in BP. The highest BP occurred at the circadian time corresponding to ≈9:00 pm, suggesting that the endogenous BP rhythm is unlikely to underlie the well-documented morning peak in adverse cardiovascular events.

Acclimatization at high altitude—time course and physiologic changes are described: the human body can adjust to moderate hypoxia at altitudes up to approximately 5,200 m (17,000 ft) but requires time to do so, with some acclimatization continuing for weeks to months and an acute process occurring over the first 3–5 days following ascent. The acute phase is associated with a steady increase in ventilation, improved oxygenation, and changes in cerebral blood flow; increased red cell production does not play a role in acute acclimatization, although a decrease in plasma volume over the first few days does increase hemoglobin concentration. Altitude illness can develop before the acute acclimatization process is complete, but not afterward, and acclimatization improves sleep.

### Physical activity and sleep changes among children during the COVID-19 pandemic [^bbc20921]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Data/statistical analysis

Step data were aggregated at the daily level for each participant by summing the step count within each epoch for each day only for epochs with an associated MMI ≥1. The average daily steps per month were calculated for each participant, and then averaged across all participants to calculate the average daily step count per month for the entire cohort. These average values and their standard deviations were reported for each of the three time periods: pre-closure, during-closure and post-closure (n = 93, 53, and 8, respectively), to enable comparison of PA during each period and to explore whether a relationship would emerge between PA and closures. For analysis of PA during school times, step count observations beginning from 7:00 AM and before 4:00 PM on weekdays, for all months except June, July and August, were included. Daily step count (averaged by month) for school times were calculated in the same way as the overall step count analysis described above (n = 93, 52 and 8, respectively for pre-closure, during-closure and post-closure).

For the sleep analysis, we used the time stamp of the earliest sleep epoch recorded after 6:00 PM on that day and 8:00 AM the following day to define the sleep start time, or bedtime. Similarly, we defined waketime as the latest sleep end time among all such epochs. If the bedtime was after midnight, the bedtime date was adjusted to be the date for the previous day. Total daily sleep duration per participant was calculated as the sum of the durations of all sleep epochs for each day. Average bedtime, waketime, and sleep duration per participant were calculated for each month, and these values were averaged for all participants to obtain the overall population average. Average bedtime, and waketime were each rounded to the nearest 15 min and were reported, along with the standard deviations, for each of the three time periods: pre-closure, during-closure and post-closure. Additionally, we report summer bedtime and waketime values separately to emphasize similarities in trends during typical summer pre-closure and both school-year and summer months during-closure.

### Objective model to facilitate designation of military-civilian partnership hospitals for sustainment of military trauma readiness [^5aeb2784]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A major dilemma of the military surgeon is the requirement for battlefield trauma expertise without regular exposure to a traumatically injured patient. To solve this problem, the military is partnering with civilian trauma centers to obtain the required trauma exposure. The main objective of this article is to quantify institutional differences and develop a predictive model for estimating the number of 24-hour trauma shifts a surgeon must be on call at civilian centers to experience urgent trauma cases.

Methods

Trauma databases from multiple institutions were queried to obtain all urgent trauma cases occurring during a 2-year period. A predictive model was used to estimate the number of urgent surgical cases in multiple specialties surgeons would experience over various numbers of 24-hour shifts and the number of 24-hour shifts required to experience a defined number of cases.

Results

Institution 1 had the lowest number of required 24-hour shifts to experience 10 urgent operative cases for general/trauma surgery (10 calls) and orthopedic surgery (6 calls) and the highest number of predicted cases over 12 days, 18.3 (95% CI 11 to 27), with 95% confidence. The expected trauma cases and 24-hour shifts at Institution 1 were statistically significant (p<0.0001). There were seasonal effects at all institutions except for Institution 3.

Discussion

There are significant variabilities in trauma center volume and therefore, the expected number of shifts and cases during a specific period of time is significantly different between trauma centers. This predictive model is objective and can therefore be used as an extrapolative tool to help and inform the military regarding placement of personnel in optimal centers for trauma currency rotations.

The Wilderness Medical Society recommends avoiding ascent to a sleeping altitude of 2,750 m (≥9,000 ft) in a single day; ascending at a rate of no greater than 500 m per night in sleeping altitude once above 3,000 m; and allowing an extra night to acclimatize for every 1,000 m of sleeping altitude gain, while acknowledging these recommendations can still be too fast for some travelers and too slow for others.

### Perceived barriers and facilitators to implementation of injury prevention programs in the military: feedback from inside the trenches [^6def8a89]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Musculoskeletal injuries enact a substantial burden in military settings, incurring high costs, long-term disability, and impacting military readiness. This has led to a prioritization of injury prevention programs. Understanding the challenges faced by those trying to implement these programs could help standardize and better inform future efforts. The purpose was to capture perceptions of barriers and facilitators to implementation of injury prevention programs in the US Armed Forces.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey with open-ended questions was circulated to relevant stakeholders; key themes were derived using conceptual content analysis. Four questions were asked concerning injury prevention programs: 1) barriers, 2) facilitators, 3) how can leadership best support, and 4) how can subject matter experts best collaborate to make these programs successful?

Results

The survey reached at least 300 individuals working with the armed services worldwide; 91 completed the survey. The mean (SD) time working with military service members was 11.5 (8.2) years; 93 % worked with active-duty service members, 71.4 % were licensed healthcare providers, and 55 % worked in settings with established injury prevention programs. Only 45.2 % of participants believed an appropriate, clear way to measure program success currently exists. Nearly 85 % believed that lacking standardization of definitions and metrics hinders program assessment. Wide variability existed in opinions regarding who should be primarily responsible for promoting/supporting injury prevention efforts. Key themes included resources as both a facilitator (when present) and barrier (when absent), organizational culture, and leadership support. Leadership can best help by prioritizing the programs and valuing the programming through modeling the desired behavior. Program staff can collaborate by focusing on enabling change, integrating into organizational/unit culture and collaborating with leaders to change policy.

Conclusions

Factors leading to incidence and recovery of musculoskeletal injuries are multifactorial, requiring collaborative multidisciplinary approaches for optimal injury prevention program development and implementation. Leadership support/prioritization, unit-level cultural acceptance and sufficient resources are essential facilitators to implementing prevention programs. Developing standardized, relevant metrics for assessing program effectiveness and establishing organizational best practices are necessary for long term program viability and lasting change.

Despite the established evidence for an elevated risk of work injury in non-standard work schedules, there is limited surveillance capacity in most countries to monitor and describe the risk of work injury by time of day.To address this surveillance deficit, the objective of this observational study was to describe the incidence of work injury in Ontario over the period 2004–2008 by hour of the 24 h clock in two population-based administrative data sources. Consistent with the evidence summarised in the introduction, the study expected to document an elevated risk of work injury during evening and night periods in both data sources.

### Effects of the internal circadian system and circadian misalignment on glucose tolerance in chronic shift workers [^155e06b4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Shift work is a risk factor for diabetes. The separate effects of the endogenous circadian system and circadian misalignment (ie, misalignment between the central circadian pacemaker and 24-hour environmental/behavioral rhythms such as the light/dark and feeding/fasting cycles) on glucose tolerance in shift workers are unknown.

Objective

The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the endogenous circadian system and circadian misalignment separately affect glucose tolerance in shift workers, both independently from behavioral cycle effects.

Design

A randomized, crossover study with two 3-day laboratory visits.

Setting

Center for Clinical Investigation at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Patients

Healthy chronic shift workers.

Intervention

The intervention included simulated night work comprised of 12-hour inverted behavioral and environmental cycles (circadian misalignment) or simulated day work (circadian alignment).

Main Outcome Measures

Postprandial glucose and insulin responses to identical meals given at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm in both protocols.

Results

Postprandial glucose was 6.5% higher at 8:00 pm than 8:00 am (circadian phase effect), independent of behavioral effects (P = .0041). Circadian misalignment increased postprandial glucose by 5.6%, independent of behavioral and circadian effects (P = .0042). These variations in glucose tolerance appeared to be explained, at least in part, by different insulin mechanisms: during the biological evening by decreased pancreatic β-cell function (18% lower early and late phase insulin; both P ≤ .011) and during circadian misalignment presumably by decreased insulin sensitivity (elevated postprandial glucose despite 10% higher late phase insulin; P = .015) without change in early-phase insulin (P = .38).

Conclusions

Internal circadian time affects glucose tolerance in shift workers. Separately, circadian misalignment reduces glucose tolerance in shift workers, providing a mechanism to help explain the increased diabetes risk in shift workers.

### Monitoring responses to basic military training with heart rate variability [^e8f4bf14]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart rate variability (HRV) has shown sensitivity to the acute stressors experienced by defense personnel. This study examines the suitability of overnight HRV as a repeated measure of allostatic load in defense personnel.

Methods

Daily measures of sleep, cognitive load, and perceived exertion were reported for the 12-wk duration of basic military training (BMT) in 48 recruits. Physical activity, subjective well-being, and HRV were measured weekly. The natural log of the root mean square of successive differences of interbeat intervals (Ln RMSSD) and the Ln RMSSD to interbeat interval ratio (Ln RMSSD:RRi ratio) during predicted slow wave sleep were used for HRV. Physical performance was assessed via the 20-m shuttle run and maximal push-up test in weeks 2 and 8 of BMT with predicted V̇O 2 peak values calculated.

Results

Predicted V̇O 2 peak increased from 42.6 ± 4.5 to 48.0 ± 2.7 mL·kg -1 ·min -1 ( P < 0.001). Ln RMSSD was elevated in weeks 7 and 10, and the Ln RMSSD:RRi ratio was elevated in week 10 above all other weeks ( P < 0.05). An increase in perceived exertion ( F = 9.10, P = 0.003) and subjective fatigue ( F = 6.97, P = 0.009), as well as a reduction in V̇O 2 peak ( F = 7.95, P = 0.009), individually predicted an increase in Ln RMSSD. The best predictive model of Ln RMSSD included perceived exertion ( F = 8.16, P = 0.005), subjective fatigue ( F = 8.49, P = 0.004), the number of awakenings during sleep ( F = 7.79, P = 0.006), and the change in V̇O 2 peak ( F = 19.110, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

HRV was predicted by subjective recruit responses to BMT workloads rather than objective measures of physical activity. Improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness depicted recruits who experienced enough stress to facilitate physiological adaptation, which was reflected by a reduction in HRV during BMT. Monitoring HRV and HRV in relation to interbeat interval length may provide a better tool for determining allostatic load than HRV alone.

### Seasonal timing and interindividual differences in shiftwork adaptation [^ee1ac8d6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Millions of shift workers in the U.S. face an increased risk of depression, cancer, and metabolic disease, yet individual responses to shift work vary widely. We find that a conserved biological system of morning and evening oscillators, which evolved for seasonal timing, may contribute to these interindividual differences. In this study, we analyze seasonality in medical interns working shifts, revealing that summer-winter variation correlates with increased circadian misalignment after shift work. Mathematical modeling suggests that seasonal timing influences the rate of adaptation to new schedules, predicting differential effects on morning and evening oscillators. Additionally, we examine genetic polymorphisms linked to seasonality in animals and find that human variants can impact how quickly circadian rhythms respond to schedule changes. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the vast interindividual differences in shift work adaptation-critical for shift worker health-can in part be explained by biological mechanisms for seasonal timing.

### Assessing aeromedical risk: a three-dimensional risk matrix approach [^b465e534]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Using a set of assumptions pertaining primarily to commercial civil aviation operations including average duration of flights (1 hour), critical phases of flight (limited to landing and take-off, representing 10% of flight time; ie, 6 min) and the presence of a copilot able to take over in the case of sudden incapacitation (which reduces risk by a factor of 100), it was calculated that only 1 pilot incapacitation in 1000 would be likely to lead to a fatal accident. For a target accident rate of 1 in 10 9 hours, if only 1 in 1000 incapacitations is likely to lead to an accident, the acceptable medical incapacitation rate is 1 in 10 6 hours. Since there are 8760 hours in a year (~10 4), the acceptable annual medical event rate to meet this target is 1% per year (10 4 ×10 2 =10 6). This formed the basis of the ‘1% rule’, widely used in assessing medical risk in aviation.The 1% rule provided a useful, objective tool towards assessing acceptable aeromedical risk in evaluating aircrew with established medical problems, cardiovascular or otherwise. For example, in assessing aircrew after revascularisation, or after myocardial infarction (MI), data from clinical trials can provide risk estimates to define subsets of individuals whose annual event rate is less than 1% per year.

However, the 1% rule has significant limitations. It is based on a series of assumptions relevant to short (1 hour) commercial flights with critical flight times limited to take-off and landing (6 min). Medical events are assumed to result in complete incapacitation of one pilot and it is assumed that a copilot could safely deal with incapacitation of the other pilot, occurring during a critical period of landing and take-off, 99 times out of 100.

It assumes that an incapacitation occurring outside this critical 6 min poses no safety risk with the other pilot expected to take over and land the aircraft safely in all cases. Despite these constraints, the ‘1% rule’ (or a variant of it) has become an important tool for aeromedical risk assessment in flying operations in general and is widely used by air forces when assessing acceptable aeromedical risk.However, the assumptions underlying the 1% rule remain contentious and it has been argued that a 2% risk per year (or up to 5% per year in certain circumstances) may be acceptable.

### Military inhalational exposures outside the theater of conflict and chronic respiratory symptoms [^a4a32b98]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The prevalence and duration of different exposures reported across the 5 exposure categories identified by the exploratory factor analysis are summarized in Table 2. The most commonly reported exposure categories were combustion and ground dust (1014 participants [59.2%] endorsing exposure to ≥1 item), aircraft maintenance (812 participants [47.4%]), and heavy equipment maintenance (783 participants [45.7%]). Exposure to items in either the construction or incineration byproducts categories was less common (213 participants [12.4%] and 123 participants [7.2%], respectively). The median duration of exposures ranged from 0.47 person-months (IQR, 0.13-2.67 person-months) for heavy direct exposure to smoke or fumes from burning vehicles or fires caused by explosives or other weapons to 20.27 person-months (IQR, 6.00-40.00 person-months) for maintenance of aircraft.

Deployment-associated exposures—military personnel deployed to Afghanistan and Southwest Asia experienced a complex mixture of exposures, with ambient PM2.5 exposures known to be greater than U.S. concentrations and sources including desert dust, waste incineration from burn pits, and local industrial and vehicular pollution. Quantitative assessment of PM2.5 using airport visibility and NASA satellite AOD data is described as an advance that should reduce misclassification, and future studies are urged to characterize specific exposures by job duties or deployment locations using estimates of PM2.5. Banked serum samples using selected biomarkers related to burn pit or other military sources may be feasible to better characterize exposure status.

Visits 2 and 3

These visits will be scheduled in counterbalanced order (Day A and B), with approximately 14 days between sessions, to reduce carryover effects in the neurobehavioral testing. Day A starts at 9 am and consists of neurobehavioral testing in the morning session, questionnaires and free time mid-day (quiet laboratory activities such as watching TV or reading) and circadian phase assessment, (dim light melatonin onset, DLMO), in the evening. Participants will be discharged at their habitual bedtime. For Day B, participants arrive at the University of Utah Center for Clinical and Translational Science outpatient location at 8:30 am. Participants will be instructed to fast for the 8 h prior to their visit. Participants will undergo a frequently sampled IV glucose tolerance test from 9:00 am to approximately 12:30 pm. After this test, participants will go to the behavioral sleep medicine laboratory and will be provided with lunch. The afternoon will consist of completing self-report questionnaires and then participants will have free time for quiet activities in the laboratory. Snacks will be provided ad libitum. The neurobehavioral testing will start at 7:45 pm and discharge will occur around 9:30 pm.

Follow-up visits

Participants will complete wrist actigraphy, HbA1c, BMI and body fat assessments at 6 months (visit 4) and 12 months (visit 5). Visit 5 will also include a circadian phase assessment (DLMO).

Phone follow-ups: We will conduct follow-up surveys at 3 and 9 months to maintain engagement with the participants.

Procedure adaptations during COVID-19 Pandemic

In order to reduce risk for COVID exposure among participants and staff, we made the following adaptations in our procedure: We will minimize time in the room with the participant, for example instructing the participant to self-collect and store saliva samples with the use of a two-way video monitor, requiring KN95 or N95 facemasks by staff and participants at all times except when alone in a room with a closed door and finally, and offering the option for a limited contact at the 12-month follow-up visit: In order to reduce in-person exposure and preserve our primary outcome measures for visit 5 (HbA1c, body measurements collected in the lab, wrist actigraphy and questionnaires completed at home).

Compensation

Participants will be paid up to $850 for study participation if they complete all elements of the study. They will also receive additional compensation based on performance on the neurobehavioral tests (up to $30 per session).

### Work injury risk by time of day in two population-based data sources [^df5cc5ee]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1 
Rate of work injury per 200 000 h worked in Ontario (2004–2008) by data source and hour. ED visits, emergency department visits (National Ambulatory Care Reporting System); LT claims, lost-time claims (WSIB). Each hour interval corresponds to one full hour interval. For example, 1:00 includes all injuries between 1:00 and 1:59. Rates are based on a 3 h weighted average. Note that 97 860 lost-time claims are excluded due to missing information on time of injury.

There are differences in the characteristics of injury events associated with work-related emergency department visits and lost-time compensation claims. In the emergency department data, the incidence rate for injuries arising from contact with objects or equipment is elevated relative to injuries arising from bodily reaction or exertion (see online supplemental figure S2). The opposite pattern is found in the characteristics of injury events in the lost-time claim data (see online supplemental figure S3). In all four injury risk estimate series, the risk of injury is elevated in the evening hours and the early morning hours.

A comparison of male and female incidence rates for work-related emergency department visits and for lost-time claims over the 24 h clock are presented in online supplementary figures S4 and S5. For both men and women, the risk of injury is elevated in the evening hours and the early morning hours. This pattern is particularly strong for men presenting to emergency departments.

Table 3 presents incidence rates and relative risk estimates for lost-time claims over the 24 h clock for men and women in three occupational groups: occupations with substantial exposure to manual work, occupations with a mix of manual and non-manual tasks, and occupations predominantly engaged in non-manual tasks. The relative risk of a lost-time claim is elevated in the evening hours and the early morning hours for all three occupational groups and as expected, the incidence of lost-time compensation claims among workers in manual and mixed occupations is elevated relative to non-manual occupations.

### Sleep timing, chronotype, and posttraumatic stress disorder: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^852a273e]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Sleep disturbance is a major component of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of circadian disruption is largely overlooked, though many PTSD studies collect proxy markers of circadian timing. This individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis examined the correlation between sleep timing / chronotype and PTSD severity among individuals diagnosed with PTSD, the standardized mean difference in sleep timing / chronotype for individuals with and without PTSD, and moderators of these relationships. A systematic search was conducted; authors provided IPD for 27 studies and aggregate data for 16 studies (3,011 participants with PTSD; 2,703 participants without PTSD). Two-step meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects multivariate approach with robust variance estimation. Bedtime and wake time were not significantly associated with PTSD symptoms or diagnosis. Less total sleep time / time in bed was weakly associated with greater PTSD symptoms. Moderator analyses revealed that effect sizes were stronger in certain populations and when using wrist actigraphy to measure sleep timing; however, gap maps revealed few studies in moderator categories with the strongest effects. Only two studies measured chronotype, prohibiting strong conclusions. Our findings indicate that the relationship between sleep timing and PTSD is weak; however, key gaps in the literature warrant further study.

### Can air pollution negate the health benefits of cycling and walking? [^758501e2]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Our approach followed a general active travel HIM method. Air pollution exposures due to active travel were quantified by estimating the differences in the inhaled dose of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) air pollution. We selected PM 2.5 because it is a commonly used indicator of air pollution in active travel HIM studies, and because of the large health burden caused by PM 2.5. For both air pollution and PA we used all-cause mortality as the health outcome because there is strong evidence for its association with both long-term exposure to PM 2.5 and long-term PA behaviour.

The reduction in all-cause mortality from active travel was estimated by converting the time spent cycling or walking to metabolically equivalent of task (MET) and calculating the risk reduction using dose–response functions (DRFs) adapted from Kelly et al.'s 3 meta-analysis. From the different DRFs reported in Kelly et al. we chose the one with the “0.50 power transformation” as a compromise between linear and extremely non-linear DRFs. Non-linearity in a DRF means that the health benefits of increased active travel would level out sooner and a tipping point would be reached earlier than with more linear DRFs. See supplementary material for the sensitivity analysis with different DRFs. To convert cycling and walking time to PA we used the values of 4.0 METs for walking and 6.8 METs for cycling, based on the Compendium of Physical Activities. The walking and cycling levels used in this study are assumed to reflect long-term average behaviour.

### Anesthesia workload nationally during regular workdays and weekends [^d946aef8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We analyze data from the American Society of Anesthesiologist's (ASA) Anesthesia Quality Institute (AQI) to report the U.S. anesthesia workload by time of day and day of the week. We consider the extent to which first case starts, rather than durations of workdays and weekend cases, influence the number of anesthesia providers nationally.

Methods

The ASA AQI data were from all the U.S. anesthesia groups that submitted cases to the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry (NACOR) for all 12 months of 2013. For each of the n = 2,075,188 cases, we identified the local date and time of the start of anesthesia care, duration of anesthesia care, and the local time zone. Anesthesia workload was measured as the time from the start to the end of continuous anesthesia care. Data are reported as mean ± SEM with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Half (53.0% ± 0.6%) of the ASA AQI-reported weekly anesthesia workload was completed by 1:00 PM, local time, on regular workdays. The busiest 8-hour interval was from 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM and accounted for 70.3% ± 0.7% of anesthetic minutes. Although most facilities completed the majority of their weekly anesthesia workload in the mornings of regular workdays (P < 0.0001; 62.3%; CI, 58.6%-66.1%), just 24.4% of the University and large community hospitals did so (P = 0.0008 relative to half; CI, 13.8%-38.4%).

Conclusions

The results are inconsistent with widespread use of surgical facilities (i.e., anesthesia providers) in mornings only, especially at University and large community hospitals. The observed national work hours match with what would be expected if most anesthesiologists work at least 8 hours on regular workdays. Opportunity for greater use of the capital (building and equipment) probably would involve the use of additional anesthesia providers representing a second shift or use of weekends.

### Pectoralis major injuries in the military: a surveillance approach to reduce an underestimated problem [^e8aab154]. BMJ Military Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple studies report increasing cases of surgically treated pectoralis major (PM) muscle and tendon ruptures in military populations. Studies associate this with a growing popularity of weight-training and bench press exercises. Mild-to-moderate non-surgical PM traumas and overuse injuries have not been included in these studies despite evidence that these types of outpatient injuries account for the majority of the military's injury medical burden.

Methods

To assess rates of all PM injuries (ruptures, tears, strains, overuse), regardless of form of treatment, a PM injury surveillance definition was derived from International Classification of Disease (ICD) diagnostic codes used in routine US Army injury surveillance. A detailed clinical examination of 2016 Active Duty Army medical records was used to identify ICD codes commonly associated with PM injuries. Cost data were calculated and the definition applied to medical data from 2016 through 2018to assess trends.

Results

The estimated incidence of PM cases among soldiers was over 95% greater than if only considering severe surgical cases. Over 96% of army annual PM injury costs (direct medical and indirect from lost labour) were for outpatient services. PM injury incidence rates were not statistically different from 2016 to 2018.

Conclusions

The PM injury surveillance definition provides a consistent means to monitor trends over time and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. PM injuries have a larger military impact than previously recognised and prioritised prevention strategies are needed to reduce them. Future interventions could focus on the bench press given its observed association with PM injuries.

Exercise training and group classification

Over the 10-month (40 weeks) exercise intervention, participants were asked to complete 200 exercise sessions. Exercise sessions were supervised in a university exercise facility that was open from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm Monday–Friday and 8:00 am to 12:00 pm Saturdays. Exercise sessions consisted of primarily treadmill walking/jogging 5 days/week. Alternate activities (stationary biking, walking/jogging outside) were permitted for one day/week to provide variety and to decrease the risk of overuse injuries. Exercise progressed from 150 kcal/session to the target exercise energy expenditure of 400 or 600 kcal/session (original study groups of the MET-2 trial) at the end of month four and remained at target for the final six months. Weekly exercise logs were maintained by research staff to track exercise session start times, intensity, and duration and were verified by heart rate monitors. Exercise session start times from participant daily exercise logs were used to determine when during the 24-hour day participants completed each session. Proportion of sessions completed during each hour the exercise facility was open were aggregated into early, mid-day, and late sessions over the 10-month intervention. Early sessions were defined based on exercise being completed in the morning hours of 7:00–11:59 am. The remaining facility operation hours were then dichotomized into mid-day (early afternoon) hours of 12:00–2:59 pm and late (late afternoon) hours of 3:00–7:00 pm. Participants were then classified as an early exerciser (Early-Ex; n = 21) if they completed ≥50% of their total sessions between the hours of 7:00–11:59 am, mid-day exerciser (n = 11) if completing ≥50% of their total sessions between the hours of 12:00–2:59 pm, a late exerciser (Late-Ex; n = 25) if completing ≥50% of their total sessions between the hours 3:00–7:00 pm, or a sporadic exerciser (Sporadic-Ex; n = 24) if they did not complete ≥50% of their total sessions in any time category. This categorical scheme was based off of previous exercise timing research. Owing to small sample size for the mid-day exercisers this category was removed from further analyses.

The 1.5-mile best-effort run is used in the British Army to assess the fitness of all recruits and trained service personnel by means of the physical fitness assessment (PFA). The 1.5-mile run is a basic measure of fitness and slower times have been associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal injury (MSkI), particularly during this early stage of training. The aim of this study was to establish whether 1.5-mile run times were associated with subsequent MSkIs among female recruits during their 14-week basic training.

Method

Retrospective data were analysed from female recruits who had undertaken basic military training between June 2016 and October 2017. This included retrieving the results of their week 1 PFA; recording the type, cause and week of MSkI if they had sustained one; and noting down their outcome from basic training. Run times were statistically analysed in relation to MSkI occurrence of 227 female recruits using binomial logistic regression with an accepted alpha level of p value <0.05.

Results

1.5-mile run time predicted risk of MSkI (χ 2 (1)=12.91, p<0.0005) in female recruits. The mean run time for injury-free recruits was faster than for injured recruits (12min 13s compared with 12min 43s). Every 10s increase in run time was associated with an 8.3% increase in risk of injury.

Conclusion

Slower 1.5-mile best-effort run time, as a surrogate of aerobic fitness, is associated with increased risk of MSkI in female recruits during basic training.

### Hypothetical behavioral interventions for mitigating the cardiovascular effects of long-term fine particulate matter exposure: analyses from 2 prospective cohorts [^fab0e6f1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

SO 4 2− is primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, which produces sulfur oxides that gradually react in the atmosphere to form SO 4 2−.NO 3 − is mainly generated by atmospheric nitrogen oxides emitted from fossil fuels, vehicle exhaust, and biomass combustion.Fossil fuel combustion, vehicle exhaust, and livestock contribute to ammonium.Metals in PM 2.5, especially the transition metals, come mainly from industrial emissions (such as coal combustion, metallurgy, and metal processing) and traffic emissions (exhaust gas, vehicle arrester, and tire wear). The OM in PM 2.5 are complex, including PAHs and their derivatives,, organophosphorus, and so on.PAHs have been recognized as significant forms of PM 2.5 because of their health risk, and they primarily originate from traffic emissions, coal combustion, fossil fuel combustion, and biomass burning.To minimize the disease burden caused by PM 2.5 exposure, the fundamental measure is to reduce pollutant emissions, and the society should focus primarily on control these toxic components at the source.

Moreover, global air quality is unlikely to be reduced to a safe level any time soon, and PM 2.5 will remain a serious threat to global health for a long time to come. In addition to further strengthening emission controls, individual‐level measures can serve as an interim strategy to complement emission control policies. Our results suggest that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be an effective way for individuals to minimize the harm of PM 2.5.

### Laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer: why don't all patients go home the day after surgery? [^5f7e9431]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To identify risk factors for hospital length of stay (LOS) longer than 1 postoperative day in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy because of endometrial cancer.

Design

Retrospective observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).

Setting

Tertiary-care university hospital.

Patients

One hundred thirty-three patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy because of endometrial cancer between August 2006 and August 2010.

Interventions

One hundred thirty-three women underwent traditional laparoscopy. In 101 of these patients, lymph node sampling was performed.

Measurements and Main Outcomes

Seventy-four women (55%) were discharged on postoperative day 1. The percentage of women discharged on postoperative day 1 (POD1) vs after POD 1 did not differ by extent of staging. Risk of perioperative complications was associated with hospital LOS longer than POD1 (odds ratio [OR], 11.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-94.39). Procedure start time after 3:00 pm (OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.14-9.04) and procedure end time after 5:00 pm (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.17-5.20) were independent factors associated with hospital LOS beyond POD1. There was a nonsignificant tendency toward later hospital discharge with administration of intravenous narcotic agents.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic surgery to treat endometrial cancer should be preferentially scheduled early in the day to facilitate discharge on POD1. The extent of staging lymphadenectomy performed does not increase hospital stay beyond POD1.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD)—aspirin desensitization protocols list timed dose-escalation options and safety steps, including an aspirin (60 min) schedule with doses at 9:00 AM 81 mg, 9:30 AM 120 mg, 11:00 AM 162 mg, and 2:00 PM 325 mg, and a ketorolac/aspirin pathway that continues on Day 2 with 8:00 AM 150 mg oral aspirin followed by 11:00 AM 325 mg oral aspirin; not all protocols suit all patients, reactions should prompt repeating the triggering dose before up-dosing, and if a reaction occurs the protocol is paused and resumed only after the reaction largely resolves, noting most patients will react between 40.25 mg and 120 mg of aspirin.

### Workers' activity profiles associated with predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk [^75e54593]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Cluster 3: “Fluctuations of Moderate Activity” (N=1194)

Fluctuating levels of moderate PA on both weekdays and weekends, with moderate activity starting at ≈8 am on weekdays and weekends, fluctuating to highest levels of moderate activity at 9 am, noon, and 5 pm on weekdays, and fluctuating to highest levels at 11 am, 2 pm, and 4 pm on weekends, and steadily decreasing for the rest of the evening.

This cluster included the second highest proportion of self‐respondents with recreational PA and weekly recreational PA time. Similar to cluster 2 and 6, the proportion of respondents and weekly time in other PA was low, whereas the proportion of respondents reporting active transportation were similar to clusters 2, 4, and 6 and weekly time spent was the second highest among clusters.

Cluster 4: “High Daytime Activity” (N=713)

Most PA occurred from ≈8 am on weekdays and 10 am on weekends, with high levels of activity occurring from 9 am to 6 pm on weekdays and 10 am to 5 pm on weekends. Activity levels were higher on weekdays compared with weekends.

This cluster reported the highest proportion and most time spent in other PA and time spent in active transportation. The proportion and time spent in recreational PA were third highest among clusters.

Cluster 5: “Moderate Evening Activity” (N=225)

PA occurred from ≈8 am on weekdays and 10 am on weekends, with activity levels on weekdays steadily increasing to moderate levels up to midnight and then steadily decreasing in the early morning up to 5 am. Activity on weekends also continued up to midnight but peaked at 4 pm and then gradually decreased.

This cluster self‐reported the most weekly time spent in other PA and active transportation. The proportion reporting recreational PA was lowest among clusters and the time spent was second lowest.
