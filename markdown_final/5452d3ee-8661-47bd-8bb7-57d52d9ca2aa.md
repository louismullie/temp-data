## Question

Broad spectrum antibiotics to use for sepsis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis, with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate risk stratification by severity and likelihood of infection. Then, I should verify the timing targets for antibiotic administration. Next, I will consider likely infection source and local epidemiology to choose an empiric regimen. After that, I need to check whether to include MRSA and Pseudomonas coverage. I will then review combination therapy versus monotherapy, dosing and PK/PD optimization, and finally plan for de-escalation, duration, and special populations, while continuously validating each step against guidelines and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification framework because everything hinges on it. Patients with septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis warrant immediate broad-spectrum therapy, whereas patients with possible sepsis without shock may tolerate a brief diagnostic window before committing to antibiotics, and I should double-check that this aligns with SSC 2021 and contemporary consensus statements, which indeed support immediate antimicrobials within 1 hour for shock and allow up to 3 hours for careful assessment in non-shock presentations to avoid overtreatment [^117TtP7Y].

> Wait, let me verify the timing targets because there is ongoing controversy. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends antimicrobials ideally within 1 hour for septic shock and for confirmed or very likely sepsis, while for possible sepsis without shock it supports a rapid 3-hour assessment to clarify infection before antibiotics, and I should confirm that IDSA cautions against blanket 1-hour mandates for all suspected sepsis due to overtreatment risks, which it does, reinforcing the need to individualize timing to severity and diagnostic certainty [^117QDK5q] [^117TtP7Y] [^116Nh8HK].

> Next, I should review the likely source of infection and local epidemiology because empiric coverage should mirror the most common pathogens at the suspected site. Lung, abdomen, urinary tract, and catheter-related infections predominate in sepsis, with gram-negatives more common than gram-positives overall, so I need to ensure my initial agent covers likely gram-negatives while I keep an eye on gram-positive risks and local antibiograms to avoid both under- and overtreatment [^111MGDuG] [^111W8GHj].

> Hold on, I should verify MRSA risk factors before adding vancomycin or linezolid. High-risk features include prior MRSA colonization or infection, severe pneumonia, healthcare-associated infection, chronic hemodialysis, and high local MRSA prevalence, whereas low-risk patients should generally avoid empiric MRSA coverage to mitigate harm, and I need to remember that MRSA accounts for roughly 5% of ICU infections with notable regional variation, so indiscriminate vancomycin use is often unnecessary and potentially harmful [^1162ySZU] [^1155zdpN].

> I will now examine Pseudomonas risk because that drives antipseudomonal beta-lactam selection. Risk factors include recent broad-spectrum antibiotics, prior Pseudomonas colonization or infection, structural lung disease, neutropenia, mechanical ventilation, and high local prevalence, and I should double-check that overt antipseudomonal therapy without true risk is common and often unnecessary, with resistant gram-negatives isolated in only about 13% of culture-positive community-onset sepsis, underscoring the need to tailor rather than default to broad coverage [^1119r6Zk] [^116w41Ck].

> Let me think about combination therapy versus monotherapy. For septic shock or high MDR risk, SSC suggests two gram-negative agents for empiric coverage, but for low MDR risk, monotherapy is preferred, and I should confirm that routine beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside combination does not improve mortality and increases nephrotoxicity, so I should avoid that strategy unless there is a specific indication such as proven or strongly suspected MDR gram-negative infection or severe beta-lactam allergy limiting options [^114jogr7] [^111MvVsy] [^115PQKEn].

> I need to ensure dosing is optimized for critical illness. In sepsis, altered volumes of distribution and augmented renal clearance are common, so beta-lactams should be front-loaded with an adequate bolus and then administered via prolonged or continuous infusion to maximize time above MIC, and I should confirm that SSC endorses PK/PD-optimized dosing as a best practice statement, which it does, while also remembering to adjust for renal function and extracorporeal therapies to avoid under- or overdosing [^114nT67s] [^1125ktTY].

> Next, I should review de-escalation and duration because minimizing unnecessary exposure is essential. Obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible without delaying life-saving therapy, reassess at 24–48 hours with microbiology and clinical response, narrow or stop antibiotics if infection is excluded or a pathogen is identified, and prefer shorter courses with adequate source control, with SSC suggesting 7–10 days for most sepsis and allowing shorter durations when response is rapid and control is achieved, and I should double-check that daily reassessment is recommended over fixed-duration therapy [^111mfgHu] [^1122xiuH] [^111NPCkz].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has special risk states? In pediatrics, immediate broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for septic shock within 1 hour, whereas children with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction without shock may have up to 3 hours for evaluation, and I should confirm that neonatal early-onset sepsis typically uses ampicillin plus gentamicin, with broader agents reserved for critically ill term infants until cultures return, which aligns with pediatric SSC guidance [^116L6nd7] [^11645cvy] [^111kup3D].

> I should double-check the balance of harms from under- versus overtreatment. Large cohort data show both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy are associated with higher mortality, with overtreatment linked to AKI, C. difficile, and selection of resistance, and contemporary analyses suggest that suspected sepsis drives about half of hospital anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal use despite resistant organisms being identified in fewer than 10% of treated patients, reinforcing the need for stewardship and diagnostic precision [^1119r6Zk] [^116EQf2D] [^116w41Ck].

> Let me reconsider the role of rapid diagnostics and biomarkers. Given the lag of cultures, molecular assays can accelerate pathogen identification and susceptibility, enabling earlier de-escalation, and procalcitonin combined with clinical assessment can support shorter antibiotic duration in appropriate contexts, though I should confirm that these tools complement rather than replace clinical judgment and source control [^1167Nrun] [^113JyKUf].

> Finally, I should confirm that my approach remains dynamic and evidence-aligned. Guidelines emphasize tailoring to patient-specific risk, local epidemiology, and severity, and I need to ensure that my initial regimen is broad enough to cover likely pathogens in high-risk patients while committing to rapid narrowing once data return, thereby balancing the competing risks of delayed effective therapy and unnecessary broad-spectrum exposure [^111W8GHj] [^111mfgHu].

For sepsis, **immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics** [^114zHw6V] should be started within 1 hour of recognition [^117QDK5q], ideally after obtaining cultures, to cover likely Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including MRSA and Pseudomonas when risk factors are present [^1162ySZU] [^114jogr7]. Use **piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime** for Gram-negative coverage, add vancomycin for MRSA risk, and use a carbapenem (e.g. meropenem) for severe beta-lactamase producers or high MDR risk [^1162ySZU] [^112f2Nh3]. De-escalate to narrower therapy within 48–72 hours based on cultures and clinical response [^111mfgHu], and limit duration to 7–10 days if source control is adequate [^114zHw6V]. Avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum agents to reduce harm and resistance [^113GYXjG] [^1142tZvG].

## Indications for broad-spectrum antibiotics in sepsis

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated for **initial empiric therapy** in sepsis to ensure coverage of unknown pathogens and prevent early mortality [^111MGDuG]. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines recommend **immediate administration** of broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition of septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis [^117TtP7Y]. For patients with possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment should be completed within 3 hours to determine the need for antibiotics [^117TtP7Y].

---

## Common broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens

Empiric antibiotic selection should be guided by patient-specific factors, local epidemiology, and the likely source of infection [^111W8GHj]. Commonly used regimens include:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Coverage** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| β-lactam antibiotics | - Piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Cefepime <br/> - Meropenem | - Gram-negative <br/> - Gram-positive <br/> - Anaerobes | - Empiric therapy <br/> - Severe sepsis <br/> - Septic shock |
| Glycopeptides | Vancomycin | MRSA | - High risk of MRSA <br/> - Severe pneumonia <br/> - Healthcare-associated infections |
| Aminoglycosides | - Gentamicin <br/> - Amikacin | Gram-negative | - Combination therapy <br/> - Severe gram-negative infections |
| Carbapenems | - Meropenem <br/> - Imipenem | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - MDR gram-negative | - Severe infections <br/> - ESBL producers <br/> - High MDR risk |

---

## Timing of antibiotic administration

Early administration of antibiotics is critical in sepsis management. The SSC guidelines recommend **immediate administration** of broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition of septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis [^114qFyMu]. Delays beyond this window are associated with increased mortality and morbidity [^115MGPEt].

---

## Risks and benefits of broad-spectrum antibiotics

Broad-spectrum antibiotics provide essential coverage in sepsis but carry risks of overtreatment, antimicrobial resistance, and adverse effects [^113GYXjG]. Balancing these risks and benefits is crucial:

- **Benefits**: Rapid pathogen coverage, reduced mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock, and prevention of treatment failure [^111z2J9G].

- **Risks**: Antibiotic resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, nephrotoxicity, and other adverse effects [^1178MT7z].

---

## Strategies for antibiotic de-escalation

Antibiotic de-escalation is essential to minimize the risks associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The SSC guidelines recommend **daily reassessment** of antibiotic therapy and de-escalation based on culture results, clinical response, and biomarkers such as procalcitonin [^111mfgHu] [^113JyKUf]. De-escalation typically occurs within 48–72 hours after obtaining culture results and clinical stabilization [^notfound].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy in sepsis should be individualized based on clinical response, source control, and culture results. The SSC guidelines recommend a **duration of 7–10 days** for most cases of sepsis with adequate source control [^115tq8DD]. Shorter courses (5–7 days) may be considered in specific scenarios, such as rapid clinical improvement and adequate source control [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **specialized antibiotic regimens**:

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Require broader empiric coverage, including antifungal and antiviral agents, due to higher risk of opportunistic infections [^notfound].

- **Pediatric patients**: Empiric therapy should consider age-specific pathogens and local epidemiology [^11645cvy].

- **Patients with allergies**: Alternative agents should be selected based on allergy profiles and clinical context [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential in the initial management of sepsis, providing coverage against unknown pathogens and reducing early mortality [^114yBDo1]. However, their use must be balanced with the risks of overtreatment, resistance, and adverse effects. Early administration, **timely de-escalation**, and individualized therapy are critical to optimizing outcomes in sepsis patients [^111W8GHj].

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^114stj1t]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial clinical guidance for managing sepsis in resource-limited settings should recognize that

When there is a high likelihood of sepsis or septic shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately, ideally within one hour.
For adults with possible sepsis without shock, where investigations (such as laboratory or imaging) to exclude a non–infectious cause of acute illness are not readily available and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be administered without delay.
Administration of antiparasitic agents should not be delayed in patients with suspicion of sepsis of parasitic origin.
In patients with sepsis and where the source has been adequately controlled, clinical improvement with an improving trend in white blood cell count can be used to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Providing appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy in sepsis is central to improving outcomes. However, in resource-limited settings, achieving this goal must be balanced against providing other aspects of care, especially to the sickest patients. Providing timely antimicrobial therapy should also be balanced with concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance where infections are commonly caused by resistant organisms and empiric therapy is likely to include broad-spectrum antibiotics. While the World Health Assembly recognises the need to promote 'judicious use of antimicrobials' in sepsis management, how best to do this in patients with sepsis is unclear and likely will need significant improvements in both diagnostics and antimicrobial stewardship programmes. The WHO's global research agenda for antimicrobial resistance includes research priorities of context-specific optimization of antimicrobial stewardship and empiric antimicrobial regimens and new rapid point-of-care diagnostics which would be of great value in addressing this complex issue.

### Trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis in US hospitals [^114pHXkw]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The increasing mismatch between empiric prescribing and identified pathogens constitutes a patient-safety risk. Prior investigations suggest that overly broad antibiotics are associated with similarly poor outcomes as inappropriately narrow antibiotics. Among 17 430 adults treated for community-onset sepsis in 104 hospitals, for example, both overly broad and overly narrow antibiotics were associated with a 20% increase in the odds of hospital death; overly broad regimens were further associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury and Clostridioides difficile infections.

We stress that our results should not be interpreted as critical of prescription standards of front-line providers, nor should our description of certain antibiotics courses as unnecessary in retrospect be taken to mean inappropriate at the time of prescribing, because in many cases they were guideline compliant. Additionally, front-line clinicians often must make treatment decisions with incomplete information. This leads many to err on the side of broader coverage, particularly when patients are severely ill. Our analysis was also not designed to identify clinical factors or algorithms that clinicians can use to determine which patients can safely tolerate narrow-spectrum antibiotics and which require broad-spectrum treatment. Our study was rather designed to gather epidemiologic data to inform guideline and policy deliberations around finding the balance between minimizing undertreatment of patients with serious infections vs minimizing overuse of antibiotic at both the individual and population levels. Several professional societies, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have recently encouraged regulators and guideline developers to provide more specific direction about which patients with possible sepsis require immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can safely be managed with narrower spectrum regimens, and which can be managed without antibiotics while obtaining further data to clarify their diagnoses.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^1177m1d5]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

To operationalize the antibiogram, we need to know what threshold of coverage to target with empiric treatment. In one physician survey, the median preferred thresholds for adequate coverage were 80% for mild sepsis and 90% for severe sepsis. Using a 90% minimum threshold, for infections like VAP and CLABSI, we will potentially need to recommend toxic (e.g. aminoglycoside), reserved (e.g. carbapenem), or toxic and reserved (e.g. colistin) combinations of antibiotics for almost every patient, further driving antibiotic resistance. The solution is to use known predictors of antimicrobial resistance to individualize empiric antibiotic treatment so that we can use narrower spectrum monotherapy regimens when they will suffice, and limit broader spectrum combination therapy regimens to those who most need them (Fig. 2). Decision support models for empiric treatment of gram-negative bacteremia can incorporate risk factors for resistance (patient demographics, recent hospital exposure, recent antibiotic use, prior microbiology culture results) and promote rapid de-escalation of antibiotics without compromising time-to-adequate treatment. As discussed for pneumonia, patient's prior microbiology results provide powerful information to predict resistance for current infections. With Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, a prior positive MRSA surveillance swab result necessitates use of anti-MRSA empiric treatment. With gram-negative bacteremia, identification of a prior gram-negative organism resistant to a specific drug within the last year should preclude use of that antibiotic.

Fig. 2
The rapidity of empiric therapy and the choice of specific agents are determined by the clinical scenario of the patient with suspected sepsis. Immediate therapy is given to those with a high likelihood of infection, and severe illness and or shock. If biomarkers like procalcitonin are not elevated, and the patient is not severely ill, immediate therapy is not necessary, and some patients may not even have infection. Specific agents are chosen with a consideration of the most common site of infection (lung > abdomen > catheter-associated infection > urinary tract infection). Each site has a group of likely pathogens, but these can vary, depending on patient-specific risk factors for resistance, and local ICU patterns of drug-resistant organisms. In sepsis, gram-negatives are more common than gram-positive, but some patients may also have fungal infection

### Characteristics of surgical patients receiving inappropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy [^1115bDT8]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inappropriate antibiotics have been observed to result in an increased duration of antibiotic treatment and hospital length of stay, development of multidrug-resistant organisms, and mortality rate compared with appropriate antibiotic treatment. Few studies have evaluated independent risk factors associated with inappropriateness. The purpose of this study was to identify independent predictors of inappropriate, empiric antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of severe sepsis.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all surgical/trauma patients admitted to a tertiary care center from 1996 to 2007 and treated for sepsis. "Appropriate" empiric antibiotic treatment was determined by sensitivity testing. Demographics and comorbidities, infection sites, infection organisms, and outcomes between strata were compared. Differences in outcome were estimated using relative risk and 95% confidence intervals for correlated data.

Results

A total of 2,855 patients (7,158 infections) were identified. Independent predictors of inappropriate, empiric antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of severe sepsis included site of infection and organism type. Severity of illness, age, medical conditions, and community versus health care-associated infections were not associated with inappropriate therapy. Although inappropriate empiric therapy was associated with a longer length of stay and duration of antimicrobial use, it did not result in higher mortality.

Conclusion

Our study observed that inappropriate empiric antibiotic selection is related to site of infection and pathogen. Other clinical variables do not appear to predict inappropriateness of antibiotic treatment. Efforts should be focused on early broad-spectrum therapy and more rapid microbiologic methods.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic/care management study, level II.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^115tq8DD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobials

The 2016 guidelines recommend administering empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials that cover all likely pathogens, including bacteria and potentially viruses/fungi (depending on the risk factors of the patient). The initial empiric antibiotic regimen for patients in septic shock should include at least two antibiotics from different classes (combination therapy) directed toward the most likely pathogens. Treatment should be narrowed once the pathogen and its antimicrobial sensitivities are ascertained or when the patient demonstrates clinical improvement. However, patients with bacteremia, neutropenic sepsis or sepsis without shock do not require combination antibiotic therapy. This is a notable difference from the 2012 recommendation that neutropenic sepsis be treated with empiric combination antimicrobials. The authors note, however, that these recommendations do not preclude the use of multiple antibiotics if the goal is to expand the spectrum of pathogens covered.

With respect to antibiotic duration, combination therapy (either empiric or targets) in patients with septic shock should be de-escalated to monotherapy within a few days if clinical improvement or with evidence of infection resolution. This is slightly different than the 2012 guidelines, which recommend that no more than 3–5 days of empiric combination therapy and de-escalation as soon as the responsible organism and susceptibilities are known. Total treatment duration should be 7–10 days for infections with sepsis or septic shock; however, some patients may warrant a prolonged course if they respond slowly to treatment, do not have source control, have bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus or have immunological deficiencies or fungal/viral infections.

One new recommendation in 2016 is that shorter antibiotic courses are indicated in patients whose sepsis resolves rapidly after source previously, the 2016 authors recommend daily assessments for potential de-escalation of antimicrobials. Failure to normalize procalcitonin levels has recently been shown in a prospective multicenter study to be a significant predictor of mortality. For those who initially appear septic, but do not subsequently have clinical evidence of infection, it can also be used to shorten or discontinue antimicrobial therapy. It is important to note that blood cultures can be negative in up to one-third of all patients suffering from sepsis. Lastly, the campaign does not recommend prophylactic antibiotics for non-infectious inflammatory states such as burns or severe pancreatitis.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^116ADsJL]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study of a large US cohort, we found that most patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis did not have resistant organisms; however, empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting these organisms were frequently prescribed. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy were associated with higher mortality. These findings underscore the need for better diagnostic tests to rapidly identify resistant pathogens and an increased focus on judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for the empiric treatment of sepsis.

### Antibiotic strategies in severe nosocomial sepsis: why do we not de-escalate more often? [^1145bUQL]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the use of antibiotic de-escalation in patients with hospital-acquired severe sepsis in an academic setting.

Design

We reviewed all episodes of severe sepsis treated over a 1-yr period in the department of intensive care. Antimicrobial therapy was considered as appropriate when the antimicrobial had in vitro activity against the causative microorganisms. According to the therapeutic strategy in the 5 days after the start of antimicrobial therapy, we classified patients into four groups: de-escalation (interruption of an antimicrobial agent or change of antibiotic to one with a narrower spectrum); no change in antibiotherapy; escalation (addition of a new antimicrobial agent or change in antibiotic to one with a broader spectrum); and mixed changes.

Setting

A 35-bed medico-surgical intensive care department in which antibiotic strategies are reviewed by infectious disease specialists three times per week.

Patients

One hundred sixty-nine patients with 216 episodes of severe sepsis attributable to a hospital-acquired infection who required broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics alone or in association with other anti-infectious agents.

Measurements and Main Results

The major sources of infection were the lungs (44%) and abdomen (38%). Microbiological data were available in 167 of the 216 episodes (77%). Initial antimicrobial therapy was inappropriate in 27 episodes (16% of culture-positive episodes). De-escalation was applied in 93 episodes (43%), escalation was applied in 22 episodes (10%), mixed changes were applied in 24 (11%) episodes, and there was no change in empirical antibiotic therapy in 77 (36%) episodes. In these 77 episodes, the reasons given for maintaining the initial antimicrobial therapy included the sensitivity pattern of the causative organisms and previous antibiotic therapy. The number of episodes when the chance to de-escalate may have been missed was small (4 episodes [5%]).

Conclusion

Even in a highly focused environment with close collaboration among intensivists and infectious disease specialists, de-escalation may actually be possible in < 50% of cases.

### Impact of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment on outcome of non-critically ill children with bacterial infections [^113CypGA]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Empiric antimicrobial therapy is the initial choice of antimicrobials pending microbiological results, and should cover the pathogens that are likely to cause the infection, taking into account the patient's age, the site of infection, medical history and other factors. Adequate antibiotic use is commonly defined as the use of an antimicrobial agent that is correct based on all available clinical, pharmacological, and microbiological data. Broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for initial empiric therapy of critically ill children with sepsis. There are guidelines for the empirical antibiotic treatment in several common pediatric situations, including the management of young infants < 60 days with fever, management of fever without source in infants and children < 3 years before and after the engagement of the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine into the routine immunization program, and management of urinary tract infections in children < 24 months. However, selecting adequate empirical antibiotic therapy for children with suspected bacterial infections in other circumstances can be challenging and requires a number of considerations, including past medical history and comorbidities, site of infection and local antibiotic susceptibility patterns.

Inadequate therapy can influence patient outcomes, while broad-spectrum treatment can lead to antibiotic resistance and can influence gut microbiome. One of the consequences of the rise in antibiotic resistance is the growing rate of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment of bacterial infections. Adequate empirical antibiotic therapy improves the outcomes for patients with severe sepsis, pediatric patients with severe pneumonia, children with nosocomial bloodstream infection, neonates with gram positive and gram negative bacteremia and more. However, the significance of adequate empirical antibiotic treatment in children with milder infections is debatable and may be influenced by many factors, such as infection severity, the source of infection, the patient's immune status, and the pathogenicity of the causative organism. Little is known about the implications of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections in not critically ill children.

### Antibiotic use in sepsis: how and why less can really mean more (survival) [^116U1QLx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Do these new data mean that PCT-guided antibiotics should be used in all patients with sepsis? Certainly the findings are provocative, but the success of the PROGRESS trial was likely dependent on high adherence to biomarker-recommended early discontinuation of therapy in a setting where most patients received initially appropriate therapy. In hospitals in which patients with sepsis have a high rate of resistant pathogens, leading to frequent inappropriate therapy, and longer durations of therapy, this benefit may be less clear. Still, the findings are important and clearly demonstrate that in patients with sepsis, less antibiotic use can equate with more survivors.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^111mfgHu]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — antimicrobial de-escalation states that for adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest daily assessment for de-escalation of antimicrobials over using fixed durations of therapy without daily re-assessment for de-escalation, which is a weak recommendation with very low quality of evidence. The rationale notes that antimicrobial exposure is linked to the development of antimicrobial resistance and efforts to reduce both the number of antibiotics administered and their spectrum.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^111Dk1ff]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis antimicrobials — timing and spectrum: We support early antibiotics once sepsis is diagnosed or deemed likely, with the strongest support for initial intravenous antibiotics in those with suspected diagnosis of septic shock — that is, patients with infection and any hypotension or hypoperfusion; shorter time to antibiotics is preferred, but the precise time frame to optimally support outcomes remains to be defined, and antivirals are less clearly time sensitive in the earliest phases of disease. For sepsis patients without an identified pathogen, we recommend initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria according to local susceptibility patterns. Most sepsis patients receive initial doses of antimicrobials in the ED prior to the availability of culture results, and clinicians should base the initial selection of antimicrobials on the most likely and most harmful potential pathogens rather than targeting a specific pathogen, unless the clinical presentation directs such a focused approach; narrow-spectrum therapy is uncommon and should not be anticipated in usual practice. Whereas some data suggest that an earlier administration of antibiotics is associated with better survival, other data suggest that small variations in the timing of a first dose of antibiotics are not associated with mortality differences; we agree that once the diagnosis of sepsis is established, rapid and comprehensive therapy — not just antibiotic administration — is optimal, but the current data do not recommend a singular time.

### Early sepsis recognition: how difficult can this be? [^113hyQaZ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

One third concern by Paliwal et al. is the impact of the lack of study power on the interpretation of the findings. The significance of the early meropenem intervention is confirmed by our logistic regression model and this limits the uncertainty coming from the inability to enroll a fully powered cohort. Their fourth concern is ethical issues coming from the use of placebo medication. SUPERIOR is designed for a patient population with suspicion of infection where no guidance for early intervention exists. As such, no ethical issues are raised. Meropenem was selected as an intervention due to the broad-spectrum coverage including both pathogens producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases and anaerobes making the drug appropriate for a broad range of infections in settings with high levels of antimicrobial resistance. However, the essence of the intervention is not for the specific drug but for early start of antibiotics which may be selected by local antimicrobial surveillance teams.

The SUPERIOR trial frames a patient population without defined sepsis but at risk of progression into organ dysfunction. No guidance exists for these patients and results of SUPERIOR introduce the need of large-scale RCTs to verify findings, as Paliwal et al. agreed.

### A practical approach to antibiotic use in critically ill obstetric patients [^115RRMRd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent years, several new antimicrobials have become available that are safer and more effective compared with older agents commonly used in obstetrics. Basic knowledge of these agents is of paramount importance to obstetricians and maternal fetal medicine specialists, as administration of early adequate broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic coverage plays a pivotal role in the management of septic patients. Of particular importance is the critically ill pregnant patient with life-threatening infectious processes in whom poor initial antibiotic selection may result in higher mortality and significant side effects from antibiotics themselves. In this article we aim to provide a guide for clinicians to select an adequate empirical antibiotic regimen for the most common severe infections that may affect pregnant individuals.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^115LsogN]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Rapid administration of appropriate antimicrobials is essential for reducing mortality in sepsis. As causative pathogens are not usually confirmed when initiating antibiotics, updated knowledge is strongly required on the efficacy associated with the initial empiric use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. This nationwide multicenter study compared carbapenems with other broad-spectrum beta-lactams as initial therapy and revealed the following: 1) initial use of carbapenems was not associated with significantly lower mortality overall in patients with sepsis, 2) a survival benefit associated with carbapenem was observed in patients with septic shock, in ICUs, or with mechanical ventilation, and 3) carbapenem therapy was associated with a significantly higher risk of MRSA/MRCNS infection and longer use of antibiotics.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012 [^114qFyMu]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Bench-to-bedside review: appropriate antibiotic therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock – does the dose matter? [^116Eys35]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Appropriate antibiotic therapy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock should mean prompt achievement and maintenance of optimal exposure at the infection site with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents administered in a timely manner. Once the causative pathogens have been identified and tested for in vitro susceptibility, subsequent de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy should be applied whenever feasible. The goal of appropriate antibiotic therapy must be pursued resolutely and with continuity, in view of the ongoing explosion of antibiotic-resistant infections that plague the intensive care unit setting and of the continued decrease in new antibiotics emerging. This article provides some principles for the correct handling of antimicrobial dosing regimens in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, in whom various pathophysiological conditions may significantly alter the pharmacokinetic behaviour of drugs.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Time-to-antibiotics and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study [^112NEHMR]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by physiological, pathological, and biochemical abnormalities that are induced by infection and associated with multiorgan failure and high mortality. Compelling evidence has shown that delay in the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is a risk factor for mortality; therefore, administration of antibiotics is recognized as a key component in the early treatment of sepsis. In this regard, antibiotic administration has been included in the hour-1 bundle of the previous Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, and the implementation of the hour-1 bundle was highly recommended to reduce mortality and morbidity. Indeed, several multinational studies reported that compliance to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign bundle was associated with mortality in patients with sepsis.

Nevertheless, considerable controversy still exists regarding the association between the time of antibiotic administration and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis/septic shock, and whether the administration of antibiotics within 1 h could improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that the aggressive administration of antibiotics within 1 h might not be beneficial in sepsis and may result in unintentional exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. The American College of Emergency Physicians also noted a lack of evidence to recommend a strict time threshold for antibiotic administration in cases with sepsis. In addition, organizing timely administration of antibiotics requires considerable effort and resources, and it may not be feasible to administer antibiotics within 1 h of presentation in all patients with sepsis.

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of time-to-antibiotics on in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was performed to assess whether the effect of time-to-antibiotics was significantly different between the sepsis and septic shock groups.

### Appropriate antibiotic dosing in severe sepsis and acute renal failure: factors to consider [^111Zuy3G]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis and septic shock cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early appropriate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and advanced resuscitation therapy are the cornerstones of treatment for these conditions. In prescribing an antibiotic regimen in septic patients with acute renal failure treated with continuous renal replacement therapy, several factors should be considered: pharmacokinetics, weight, residual renal function, hepatic function, mode of renal replacement therapy (membrane and surface area, sieving coefficient, effluent and dialysate rate, and blood flow rate), severity of illness, microorganism, minimum inhibitory concentration, and others. Studies that determine the serum antibiotic concentrations are very useful in establishing the correct dosage in critical patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^116L6nd7]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy — timing and empiric coverage — In children with septic shock, we recommend starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible, within 1 hour of recognition (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In children with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction but without shock, we suggest starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after appropriate evaluation, within 3 hours of recognition (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend empiric broad-spectrum therapy with one or more antimicrobials to cover all likely pathogens (BPS), and once the pathogen(s) and sensitivities are available, we recommend narrowing empiric antimicrobial therapy coverage (BPS). If no pathogen is identified, we recommend narrowing or stopping empiric antimicrobial therapy according to clinical presentation, site of infection, host risk factors, and adequacy of clinical improvement in discussion with infectious disease and/or microbiological expert advice (BPS).

### Revising sepsis definitions to better target and tailor sepsis care [^112HH8jE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

How we define sepsis has significant implications for clinical care, quality improvement, and regulatory policies. Current sepsis criteria identify heterogenous patients that vary widely in their clinical syndromes, triggering pathogens, and prognoses; one-third have viral or non-infectious processes and crude mortality rates vary 30-fold. Nonetheless, clinicians have been trained to treat all patients with possible sepsis immediately, aggressively, and uniformly with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evidence continues to mount, however, that immediate antibiotics are critical for patients with septic shock or multiorgan dysfunction but short delays can safely be tolerated by patients with single organ dysfunction without shock. This allows time to clarify whether these patients are infected or not. We suggest modifying sepsis operational definitions to flag just those patients in whom short antibiotic delays are associated with worse outcomes. This will help focus sepsis care where it is needed, aid antibiotic stewardship, and increase the validity of sepsis quality measures.

### Broad-spectrum antimicrobials and the treatment of serious bacterial infections: getting it right up front [^1134wiE9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of serious bacterial infections is complicated by the fact that time to initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy is a strong predictor of mortality. Therefore, therapy must be initiated before the causative pathogen is identified. However, inappropriate or inadequate initial empirical therapy is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay. Initial empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antimicrobials attempts to address this dilemma by "getting it right up front". The goal is to provide treatment active against the most likely pathogens until culture/susceptibility test results are obtained. After the causative pathogen is identified, streamlining to more-precise therapy of the shortest acceptable duration is implemented. In this way, the risks of death, morbid complications, increased duration of hospital stay (as a result of ineffective initial treatment), and emergence of resistance (due to extended treatment with broad-spectrum agents) are lowered. Improved clinical and economic outcomes after such an approach have been demonstrated.

### Antibiotics in critically ill children-a narrative review on different aspects of a rational approach [^114DUoRd]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Especially critically ill children are exposed to antibiotic overtreatment, mainly caused by the fear of missing out a severe bacterial infection. Potential adverse effects and selection of multi-drug resistant bacteria play minor roles in decision making. This narrative review first describes harm from antibiotics and second focuses on different aspects that could help to reduce antibiotic overtreatment without harming the patient: harm from antibiotic treatment, diagnostic approaches, role of biomarkers, timing of antibiotic therapy, empiric therapy, targeted therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Wherever possible, we linked the described evidence to the current Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Antibiotic stewardship programs should help guiding antibiotic therapy for critically ill children. IMPACT: Critically ill children can be harmed by inadequate or overuse of antibiotics. Hemodynamically unstable children with a suspicion of infection should be immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In contrast, in hemodynamically stable children with sepsis and organ dysfunction, a time frame of 3 h for proper diagnostics may be adequate before starting antibiotics if necessary. Less and more targeted antibiotic treatment can be achieved via antibiotic stewardship programs.

### Increasing evidence of the nephrotoxicity of piperacillin / tazobactam and vancomycin combination therapy-what is the clinician to Do? [^1178MT7z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Early administration of appropriate empiric antibiotics is essential for achieving the best possible outcomes in sepsis. Yet the choice of antibiotic therapy has become more challenging due to recent reports of nephrotoxicity with the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, the "workhorse" regimen at many institutions. In this article we assess the evidence for nephrotoxicity and its possible mechanisms, provide recommendations for risk mitigation, address the advantages and disadvantages of alternative antibiotic choices, and suggest areas for future research.

### Outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use… [^113GYXjG]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The light bars indicate the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics directed at resistant organisms who had that organism recovered from any clinical site within the first 2 days of hospitalization. Question What is the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in community-onset sepsis, and is there risk associated with the receipt of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Findings In this cohort study of 17 430 adults with culture-positive sepsis admitted to 104 US hospitals, 67. 0% received empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, but resistant gram-positive organisms were isolated in only
13. 6% of patients and resistant gram-negative organisms in 13. 2%. Both undertreatment and overtreatment were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment.

Meaning In this study, broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered to patients with community-onset sepsis without resistant organisms, and these therapies were associated with worse outcomes. Importance Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected sepsis to minimize the risk of undertreatment. However, little is known regarding the net prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens across all patients with community-onset sepsis or the outcomes associated with unnecessarily broad empiric treatment. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, most patients with community-onset sepsis did not have resistant pathogens, yet broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality.

These findings underscore the need for better tests to rapidly identify patients with resistant pathogens and for more judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric sepsis treatment. Sepsis, the syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction complicating severe infection, is a leading cause of death in hospitalized patients. 1 Early active antibiotic therapy is associated with better outcomes. 2–5 Therefore, national quality measures and international guidelines recommend immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for all patients with suspected sepsis. 6, 7. Inadequate antibiotic therapy was not significantly associated with hospital death in the subgroup of patients with septic shock, but there was an association between inadequate antibiotics and hospital death when considering patients with sepsis who had positive blood cultures alone.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^111uW8Hs]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Prior studies have estimated the national and global burden of antimicrobial resistance, but our study is among the first to estimate the net prevalence of antibiotic resistance across all culture sites in patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis. We found that approximately 1 in 8 patients had resistant gram-positive organisms (primarily MRSA and rarely VRE) and 1 in 8 had resistant gram-negative organisms (primarily ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative organisms and rarely ESBL or CRE). More than two-thirds of patients received broad-spectrum therapy directed at resistant organisms, but MRSA was only isolated in 1 in 6 patients treated with vancomycin or linezolid, P aeruginosa or other ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative organisms in 1 in 6 patients treated with anti- Pseudomonal agents, VRE in 1 in 16 patients treated with linezolid or daptomycin, and ESBLs in 1 in 70 patients treated with carbapenems. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment.

Our findings almost certainly overestimate the prevalence of resistant pathogens across the entire spectrum of patients treated for possible sepsis given the following: (1) we limited our analysis to bacterial, culture-positive sepsis, and between 30% and 50% of all patients with sepsis are culture negative; (2) viruses are often implicated in severe pneumonia (the most common cause of sepsis), and (3) there are many noninfectious mimickers of sepsis that are treated as sepsis. All told, the net fraction of patients with sepsis who would benefit from broad-spectrum therapy, including agents active against both MRSA and Pseudomonas, is small. This may be an acceptable trade-off given the increased risk of death associated with inadequate therapy, but it underscores the need for rapid tests to more efficiently identify the small fraction of patients who truly need broad spectrum therapy. Alternatively, predictive models may soon allow clinicians to effectively select and tailor antibiotic regimens at the point of care.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^1122wKTk]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Compared with the noncarbapenem broad-spectrum antibiotics, carbapenems as initial empiric therapy were not associated with significantly lower mortality overall in patients with sepsis. Scientific evidence on the benefits of carbapenem therapy as initial therapy in sepsis is still limited, and further prospective studies need to be performed.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Optimal antibiotic use in the intensive care unit [^113qkY3D]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial empiric treatment and combination therapy

Given the high prevalence of sepsis and septic shock, intensivists frequently face the decision of initiating antibiotic therapy and selecting the appropriate regimen. Empiric therapy is started when an infection is suspected before microbiology results are available. Once the pathogen has been identified and susceptibility testing performed, the empiric regimen can be tailored to directed or definitive therapy. Concordant therapy refers to an antibiotic choice that is active against the isolated bacterium(a) based on in vitro susceptibility testing. In the ICU, recognizing an infectious process is crucial. No absolute constellation of signs and symptoms or tests can unequivocally diagnose sepsis, thus clinicians must rely on the available clinical information and decide under uncertainty if empiric antibiotics will be beneficial or harmful. Typical symptoms can suggest an infectious syndrome, but older patients with multiple comorbidities often present ambiguously, with a wider differential diagnosis and higher mortality absent appropriate treatment. Up to a third of patients with presumed sepsis may ultimately have a sepsis mimic and potentially experience harm from broad-spectrum antibiotics. Critically ill patients have higher sepsis prevalence than non-ICU patients, therefore increasing the pretest probability of life-threatening infection.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) SEP-1 measures recommend immediate antibiotics — typically broad spectrum with MRSA and pseudomonal coverage — within 1 to 3 hours of sepsis recognition. Kumar et al described that each hour of delay in starting antibiotics led to a 7.6% decrease in survival for patients with septic shock. Other studies, examining timely antibiotic administration alone or as part of a sepsis care bundle, supported these findings, with the greatest benefit of early antibiotic initiation in patients with septic shock. Seymour et al.'s study of 50,000 patients treated for sepsis found that the 7% increased hourly risk of death was not present in those not requiring vasopressors. This differentiation led IDSA to caution against blanket recommendations for Rapid antibiotics in all sepsis cases, favoring a Rapid evaluation within the first 3−5 hours. This way, uninfected patients may be protected from the side effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Even in critically ill patients suspected of having a hospital-acquired infection, too rapid initiation of antibiotics in the absence of shock can result in adverse consequences, including higher mortality.

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^116tRBaf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^115axtRo]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The randomized prospective MERINO trial, that compared therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to meropenem in patients with severe bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumonia e, supported early appropriate therapy. Non-inferiority of the piperacillin-tazobactam arm could not be established with 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam dying at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 patients (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6%).

Delayed administration of appropriate therapy can be due to both delays in recognition of infection and administration of the antibiotics, but the optimal timing of therapy depends on the population studied. A recent review suggested that a reasonable timeframe would be no later than three to five hours after infection onset, but immediately for patients with septic shock. The administration of early appropriate therapy must be balanced against the unnecessary use of antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum agents, in the absence of proven infection, with excess mortality associated with this practice, and an increased risk of colonization and infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Thus, the use of rapid, broad-spectrum empiric therapy, especially in emergency settings, must come with a commitment to de-escalation, meaning shorter duration, less broad-spectrum therapy and fewer drugs, once clinical and microbiologic data become available (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The need for immediate broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy for selected patients with severe sepsis may be life-saving, but may also put pressure to overuse antibiotics and drive antibiotic resistance. Thus, this approach comes with the obligation to try to control resistance by de-escalating therapy once serial clinical, microbiologic and laboratory data become available. De-escalation can be in the form of shorter duration of therapy, less broad-spectrum agents, fewer drugs, or a combination of these interventions

### Trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis in US hospitals [^116EQf2D]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Among 6.3 million adults admitted to 241 US hospitals between 2017 and 2021, half of all anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal β-lactam prescribing was for suspected community-onset sepsis but only 7% of patients with community-onset sepsis overall, and 9.5% of patients treated with broad-spectrum agents, had positive cultures for MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or other resistant organisms early in their hospitalization. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use for patients with suspected community-onset sepsis rose over time but the percentage of cases with resistant organisms decreased. There was a decrease in patients receiving inappropriately narrow therapy but the absolute number who received unnecessarily broad treatment was nearly 50-fold higher than the number who were undertreated. The increase in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing was not associated with improvements in mortality for patients with suspected community-onset sepsis during the study period.

Others have also documented that MRSA and ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative organisms constitute a small minority of culture-positive community-onset sepsis cases. Our study extends these investigations by evaluating trends over time, quantifying the contribution of empiric broad-spectrum prescribing to overall antibiotic use in hospitals, and adding data about patients with culture-negative sepsis and those with clinically suspected but unconfirmed sepsis. Including these patients is critical to provide a comprehensive picture of antibiotic use for suspected sepsis because approximately one-third of patients initially treated for possible sepsis end up having noninfectious diagnoses and culture-positive sepsis accounts for a minority of cases (only 24% in our study). Documenting the large contribution of suspected sepsis to overall broad-spectrum antibiotic utilization underscores the importance of efforts to steward empiric antibiotic therapy in this population for whom broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing has been strongly encouraged.

### Implementation of earlier antibiotic administration in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in Japan: a descriptive analysis of a prospective observational study [^113oGiUJ]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Time to antibiotic administration is a key element in sepsis care, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines (2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016) have repeatedly recommended initiating empirical broad-spectrum therapy within 3 h from triage or sepsis recognition. However, the updated 2018 SSC guidelines recommend a 1-h window for antibiotic administration following the recognition of sepsis as a reasonable approach; this update has been significantly debated, and it remains controversial. Although it would be impossible to argue against appropriate and timely antibiotic therapy for sepsis considering its time-sensitive nature, sepsis is different from other emergent conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or trauma. Specifically, its recognition by healthcare providers within 1 h of presentation may be difficult to achieve in real-life settings because of vague presenting symptoms and the fact that its exact onset is mostly unobservable. Further, the only randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated early antibiotic use in patients with suspected infection failed to reduce mortality, although this was in the pre-hospital setting.

We prospectively evaluated the characteristics and management of patients with severe sepsis in the Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis, and Trauma (FORECAST) study in Japan. We then used the FORECAST database to describe the association between time to antibiotic administration and outcomes in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock treated in real-world clinical settings.

### Rapid molecular assays versus blood culture for bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1167Nrun]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. If not recognized and treated early, it can lead to septic shock, multiorgan failure, and death. The global burden of sepsis is increasing in terms of morbidity, mortality, and financial costs, with 48.9 million cases and 11 million deaths annually. Early appropriate antimicrobial therapy (AMT) is the cornerstone of management and is associated with improved patient outcomes. Hourly delays in the initiation of appropriate AMT decrease survival in septic shock. However, ineffective or unnecessarily broad-spectrum empiric AMT is associated with several problems, including extended hospital stay and increased healthcare costs.

Blood culture (BC) is the current gold standard method for identifying bloodstream infections (BSI), but it has limitations, including its long turnaround time (TAT) and lower detection rates in patients on empiric AMT. Moreover, slow-growing, fastidious organisms are often difficult to detect, and this, alongside AMT, decreases BC's sensitivity. These factors can delay the initiation of targeted AMT. Due to the long TAT and the urgency of AMT, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABs) are often initiated. This presents the risk of inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, which is associated with worse clinical outcomes, increased antimicrobial resistance, and higher financial costs. Thus, there is an unmet need for rapid pathogen diagnostics, which would allow clinicians to adjust targeted AMT promptly.

### Characteristics and outcomes of culture-negative versus culture-positive severe sepsis [^115JpSNU]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications of our study's findings? Early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines in an effort to improve outcomes in sepsis, culture-positive or culture-negative. Kumar and colleagues showed that every hour of delay in the administration of effective antibiotics from the onset of septic shock resulted in an increase in mortality. This association occurred even among culture- negative patients, for which antimicrobial therapy was deemed appropriate if they were consistent with national guidelines modified to local flora for the clinical syndrome. In contrast, similar to the majority of studies in the literature, our study defined the administered antibiotics to be inappropriate only if they did not match the in vitro susceptibility of the identified pathogens, that is, only in culture-positive patients. In so doing, we found the mortality rate to be much higher among culture-positive patients who were administered inappropriate antibiotics than culture-negative patients (55.5% versus 35.9%). There was also a trend toward higher mortality among culture-positive patients who received appropriate antibiotics (41.9%) than culture-negative patients. These findings do not invalidate the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's recommendation, especially since it is impossible to accurately predict one's culture status at presentation. On the clinical front, we echo the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines' advice for cautious consideration of antimicrobial therapy using clinician judgment and available clinical information when cultures are unrevealing. On the research front, we propose that it is time for more in-depth studies of culture-negative sepsis. Such investigations could come in the form of multiplex PCR amplification techniques for the quantification of bacteria, fungi, and viruses to elucidate the false-negative and true-negative rates of cultures, and interventional trials comparing algorithms to escalate, continue, narrow, or cease antibiotics coupled with a search for noninfectious etiologies when pathogens are not detected.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111W8GHj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected sepsis requires thoughtful and individualized care. Initial empiric therapy should be immediate for those with a high likelihood of infection, severe illness and/or shock. Specific empiric antimicrobial therapy should be chosen with consideration of the likely site of infection, common pathogens for these sites, and with modification made by consideration of patient-specific risk factors for resistance and knowledge of local microbiology. While timely and appropriate therapy is necessary to reduce mortality, it must be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate once we get culture and serial clinical and laboratory data, since indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy is a driving force for antimicrobial resistance. Key recommendations for management are summarized in Table 1.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Appropriate antibiotic therapy [^116SMsfR]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotics is an essential component of initial therapy in sepsis. Early antibiotics are an important component of therapy, but speed of administration should not overshadow the patient-specific characteristics that determine the optimal breadth of antimicrobial therapy. Cultures should be drawn before antibiotic therapy if it does not significantly delay administration. Combination antibiotic therapy against gram-negative infections is not routinely required, and combination therapy involving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam is associated with an increase in acute kidney injury. Emergency practitioners should be aware of special considerations in the administration and dosing of antibiotics in order to deliver optimal care to septic patients.

### Pediatric sepsis diagnosis, management, and sub-phenotypes [^116rU31P]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs for children worldwide, including > 3 million deaths annually and, among survivors, risk for new or worsening functional impairments, including reduced quality of life, new respiratory, nutritional, or technological assistance, and recurrent severe infections. Advances in understanding sepsis pathophysiology highlight a need to update the definition and diagnostic criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock, whereas new data support an increasing role for automated screening algorithms and biomarker combinations to assist earlier recognition. Once sepsis or septic shock is suspected, attention to prompt initiation of broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy, fluid resuscitation, and vasoactive medications remain key components to initial management with several new and ongoing studies offering new insights into how to optimize this approach. Ultimately, a key goal is for screening to encompass as many children as possible at risk for sepsis and trigger early treatment without increasing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics and preventable hospitalizations. Although the role for adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids and other metabolic therapies remains incompletely defined, ongoing studies will soon offer updated guidance for optimal use. Finally, we are increasingly moving toward an era in which precision therapeutics will bring novel strategies to improve outcomes, especially for the subset of children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and sepsis subphenotypes for whom antibiotics, fluid, vasoactive medications, and supportive care remain insufficient.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^116niESf]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis — evidence comparing monotherapy versus combination therapy: A Cochrane review evaluating beta-lactam monotherapy versus beta-lactam and aminoglycoside combination regimens included 69 trials accounting for 7,863 participants and found no difference in clinical outcomes when the same beta-lactam was used in both arms, while broader-spectrum monotherapy showed a possible benefit for all-cause mortality (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71–1.01) and a significant advantage for clinical failure (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67–0.84); indirect adult sepsis evidence including 13 RCTs suggests outcomes are not improved by empiric combination therapy, therefore many children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction do not require empiric multi-drug therapy and clinicians should continually reevaluate local epidemiology and resistance rates to ensure monotherapy remains appropriate.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^1131bxvi]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths of This Study

This study has several strengths. First, there is little evidence so far of the efficacy of carbapenems as an initial choice of antibiotic therapy against an overall sepsis population that includes various sites of infection and pathogens. Therefore, this study provides a novel insight into empiric antibiotic therapy at the time of initiating antibiotics when causative pathogens are not usually identified. Second, the large sample size allowed us to explore the efficacy of carbapenem by taking a large number of confounding factors into account, which enhanced the robustness of the methods and minimized biases.

### Antimicrobial treatment duration in sepsis and serious infections [^115kkPFN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis mortality has improved following advancements in early recognition and standardized management, including emphasis on early administration of appropriate antimicrobials. However, guidance regarding antimicrobial duration in sepsis is surprisingly limited. Decreased antibiotic exposure is associated with lower rates of de novo resistance development, Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, antibiotic-related toxicities, and health care costs. Consequently, data weighing safety versus adequacy of shorter treatment durations in sepsis would be beneficial. We provide a narrative review of evidence to guide antibiotic duration in sepsis. Evidence is significantly limited by noninferiority trial designs and exclusion of critically ill patients in many trials. Potential challenges to shorter antimicrobial duration in sepsis include inadequate source control, treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms, and pharmacokinetic alterations that predispose to inadequate antimicrobial levels. Additional studies specifically targeting patients with clinical indicators of sepsis are needed to guide measures to safely reduce antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk population while preserving clinical effectiveness.

### Bench-to-bedside review: sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock-does the nature of the infecting organism matter? [^1125kNdh]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

International guidelines concerning the management of patients with sepsis, septic shock and multiple organ failure make no reference to the nature of the infecting organism. Indeed, most clinical signs of sepsis are nonspecific. In contrast, in vitro data suggest that there are mechanistic differences between bacterial, viral and fungal sepsis, and imply that pathogenetic differences may exist between subclasses such as Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These differences are reflected in different cytokine profiles and mortality rates associated with Gram-positive and Gram-negative sepsis in humans. They also suggest that putative anti-mediator therapies may act differently according to the nature of an infecting organism. Data from some clinical trials conducted in severe sepsis support this hypothesis. It is likely that potential new therapies targeting, for example, Toll-like receptor pathways will require knowledge of the infecting organism. The advent of new technologies that accelerate the identification of infectious agents and their antimicrobial sensitivities may allow better tailored anti-mediator therapies and administration of antibiotics with narrow spectra and known efficacy.

### Trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis in US hospitals [^116w41Ck]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Little is known about the degree to which suspected sepsis drives broad-spectrum antibiotic use in hospitals, what proportion of antibiotic courses are unnecessarily broad in retrospect, and whether these patterns are changing over time.

Objective

To describe trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used clinical data from adults admitted to 241 US hospitals in the PINC AI Healthcare Database. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or more and were admitted between 2017 and 2021 with suspected community-onset sepsis, defined by a blood culture draw, lactate measurement, and intravenous antibiotic administration on admission.

Exposures

Empiric anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and/or antipseudomonal β-lactam agent use.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Annual rates of empiric anti-MRSA and/or antipseudomonal β-lactam agent use and the proportion that were likely unnecessary in retrospect based on the absence of β-lactam resistant gram-positive or ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative pathogens from clinical cultures obtained through hospital day 4. Annual trends were calculated using mixed-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics.

Results

Among 6 272 538 hospitalizations (median [IQR] age, 66 [53–78] years; 443 465 male [49.6%]; 106 095 Black [11.9%], 65 763 Hispanic [7.4%], 653 907 White [73.1%]), 894 724 (14.3%) had suspected community-onset sepsis, of whom 582 585 (65.1%) received either empiric anti-MRSA (379 987 [42.5%]) or antipseudomonal β-lactam therapy (513 811 [57.4%]); 311 213 (34.8%) received both. Patients with suspected community-onset sepsis accounted for 1 573 673 of 3 141 300 (50.1%) of total inpatient anti-MRSA antibiotic days and 2 569 518 of 5 211 745 (49.3%) of total antipseudomonal β-lactam days. Between 2017 and 2021, the proportion of patients with suspected sepsis administered anti-MRSA or antipseudomonal therapy increased from 63.0% (82 731 of 131 275 patients) to 66.7% (101 003 of 151 435 patients) (adjusted OR [aOR] per year, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03–1.04). However, resistant organisms were isolated in only 65 434 cases (7.3%) (30 617 gram-positive [3.4%], 38 844 gram-negative [4.3%]) and the proportion of patients who had any resistant organism decreased from 9.6% to 7.3% (aOR per year, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.87–0.88). Most patients with suspected sepsis treated with empiric anti-MRSA and/or antipseudomonal therapy had no resistant organisms (527 356 of 582 585 patients [90.5%]); this proportion increased from 88.0% in 2017 to 91.6% in 2021 (aOR per year, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11–1.13).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of adults admitted to 241 US hospitals, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis accounted for half of all anti-MRSA or antipseudomonal therapy; the use of these types of antibiotics increased between 2017 and 2021 despite resistant organisms being isolated in less than 10% of patients treated with broad-spectrum agents.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111MGDuG]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a common consequence of infection, associated with a mortality rate > 25%. Although community-acquired sepsis is more common, hospital-acquired infection is more lethal. The most common site of infection is the lung, followed by abdominal infection, catheter-associated blood steam infection and urinary tract infection. Gram-negative sepsis is more common than gram-positive infection, but sepsis can also be due to fungal and viral pathogens. To reduce mortality, it is necessary to give immediate, empiric, broad-spectrum therapy to those with severe sepsis and/or shock, but this approach can drive antimicrobial overuse and resistance and should be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalation and antimicrobial stewardship. Biomarkers such a procalcitonin can provide decision support for antibiotic use, and may identify patients with a low likelihood of infection, and in some settings, can guide duration of antibiotic therapy. Sepsis can involve drug-resistant pathogens, and this often necessitates consideration of newer antimicrobial agents.

### Recommendations for infection management in patients with sepsis and septic shock in resource-limited settings [^113aHge2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Large variations in disease etiology and high rates of antimicrobial resistance combined with restricted choice of antibiotics and limited microbiological data pose significant challenges in the management of septic patients in resource-limited settings. Increased use of combination therapy and broad spectrum antibiotics risks increasing antimicrobial resistance. Enhanced surveillance necessitates better collaboration between stakeholders and improved microbiological facilities, which in turn requires significant investment. However, newer technologies which negate the need for specialist staff and equipment may become more available. This would not only improve the management of individual patients but, by providing high-quality epidemiological data, may help combat the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### Improved empirical antibiotic treatment of sepsis after an educational intervention: the ABISS-edusepsis study [^1155ERDm]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to infection, is common and its incidence seems to be increasing. About a quarter of patients with sepsis go on to develop septic shock. Sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), an international effort to optimize treatment for sepsis through evidence-based guidelines, has resulted in sustained continuous quality improvement associated with decreased mortality. In Spain, a nationwide effort based on the SSC, the EDUSEPSIS intervention, succeeded in improving process-of-care and outcome measures.

Infection control is the cornerstone of treatment, and both the timeliness and appropriateness of empirical antibiotic treatment are considered essential aspects of sepsis management. The SSC guidelines recommend administering empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 h of identification of sepsis. This recommendation is supported by a secondary analysis of the Edusepsis study, which showed that early administration of broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics was the component of the SSC bundles most strongly associated with increased survival. Several studies have identified worse outcomes associated with delays in administering appropriate antibiotic treatment and with inappropriate antibiotic therapy. The SSC guidelines also recommend reassessing antibiotic treatment to determine whether de-escalation is possible, and failure to de-escalate might be associated with worse outcomes and could lead to development of resistant microbes.

Given the importance of infection control in sepsis management, we designed a multifaceted educational intervention to improve antimicrobial therapy in patients with sepsis: the Antibiotic Intervention in Severe Sepsis (ABISS) study. We hypothesized that the intervention would decrease the time to the administration of empirical antibiotics, increase the proportion of patients receiving appropriate empirical antibiotics, favor de-escalation, and decrease mortality.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^1119r6Zk]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected sepsis to minimize the risk of undertreatment. However, little is known regarding the net prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens across all patients with community-onset sepsis or the outcomes associated with unnecessarily broad empiric treatment.

Objective

To elucidate the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and the outcomes associated with both undertreatment and overtreatment in patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included 17 430 adults admitted to 104 US hospitals between January 2009 and December 2015 with sepsis and positive clinical cultures within 2 days of admission. Data analysis took place from January 2018 to December 2019.

Exposures

Inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy (ie, ≥ 1 pathogen nonsusceptible to all antibiotics administered on the first or second day of treatment) and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy (ie, active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]; vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE]; ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative [CTX-RO] organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa; or extended-spectrum β-lactamase [ESBL] gram-negative organisms when none of these were isolated).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence and empiric treatment rates for antibiotic-resistant organisms and associations of inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy with in-hospital mortality were assessed, adjusting for baseline characteristics and severity of illness.

Results

Of 17 430 patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [57–81] years; 9737 [55.9%] women), 2865 (16.4%) died in the hospital. The most common culture-positive sites were urine (9077 [52.1%]), blood (6968 [40.0%]), and the respiratory tract (2912 [16.7%]). The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (5873 [33.7%]), S aureus (3706 [21.3%]), and Streptococcus species (2361 [13.5%]). Among 15 183 cases in which all antibiotic-pathogen susceptibility combinations could be calculated, most (12 398 [81.6%]) received adequate empiric antibiotics. Empiric therapy targeted resistant organisms in 11 683 of 17 430 cases (67.0%; primarily vancomycin and anti-Pseudomonal β-lactams), but resistant organisms were uncommon (MRSA, 2045 [11.7%]; CTX-RO, 2278 [13.1%]; VRE, 360 [2.1%]; ESBLs, 133 [0.8%]). The net prevalence for at least 1 resistant gram-positive organism (ie, MRSA or VRE) was 13.6% (2376 patients), and for at least 1 resistant gram-negative organism (ie, CTX-RO, ESBL, or CRE), it was 13.2% (2297 patients). Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment (inadequate empiric antibiotics: odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03–1.37; p = 0.02; unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics: odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06–1.40; p = 0.007).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, most patients with community-onset sepsis did not have resistant pathogens, yet broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality. These findings underscore the need for better tests to rapidly identify patients with resistant pathogens and for more judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric sepsis treatment.

### Timing of antibiotic therapy in the ICU [^111z2J9G]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe or life threatening infections are common among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most infections in the ICU are bacterial or fungal in origin and require antimicrobial therapy for clinical resolution. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy for infected critically ill patients. However, antibiotics are often not optimally administered resulting in less favorable patient outcomes including greater mortality. The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important determinants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for β-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggressive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimization as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unnecessary use of these agents. Such approaches will increasingly be linked to advances in molecular microbiology testing and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Such advances should help identify patients needing empiric antibiotic therapy at an earlier time point as well as the specific antibiotics required in order to avoid unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111uSmjV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common and life-threatening illness in the ICU, requiring timely and effective antimicrobial therapy. The aims of this review are to identify the most common sites of sepsis, the likely pathogens, and the optimal approach to antimicrobial therapy. Effective therapy must be balanced by the need to avoid overuse of broad spectrum agents and thus must be accompanied by a commitment to antimicrobial stewardship. Using experts in this topic, we reviewed the literature relevant to antimicrobial management of sepsis and recommend key principles for management.

### Patterns, predictors, and intercenter variability in empiric Gram-Negative antibiotic use across 928 United States hospitals [^116QTjZy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the potential overuse of broad-spectrum therapy when not indicated is problematic, the potential underuse of broad-spectrum therapy when it is indicated may be even more concerning. In our cohort, 23% of patients with sepsis did not receive broad-spectrum empiric gram-negative therapy. Although ceftriaxone is a reasonable therapeutic option for many septic patients depending upon their individual risk factors and presumed infection source, 6% of septic patients received narrow-spectrum antibiotics other than ceftriaxone. Moreover, patients with additional resistance risk factors or, depending upon institutional antimicrobial resistance patterns, with more severe clinical presentations should ideally receive broader-spectrum therapy with antipseudomonal coverage. Yet, 10% of septic patients did not receive broad-spectrum therapy even though they had already received inpatient broad-spectrum gram-negative antibiotics in the previous 3 months, nor did 12% of septic patients who were in the ICU, mechanically ventilated, and/or who received vasopressors while receiving empiric therapy — together representing > 32 000 patients. This is particularly concerning, because we identified patients with sepsis using a set of explicit diagnosis codes, which tend to select for the most severe cases and have a high sensitivity for identifying patients with septic shock. Thus, the sepsis patients in our cohort likely comprise a severely ill subpopulation, for whom each additional hour of inadequate antibiotic therapy can increase mortality. Taken together, both the potential overtreating of patients without clear risk factors and the potential undertreating of patients with invasive infections underscores the need for more standardized guidelines, and ideally the development of validated risk-assessment tools, to inform empiric therapy selection.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^112KSqzp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

At its core, the narrow-focused debate surrounding the timing of antimicrobial therapy is inherently flawed. The appropriate treatment of the septic patient requires a rapid multimodal response including fluid resuscitation, source control, and pressors (if required). Antimicrobials are only one part of this equation. In cases of life threatening septic shock, broad-spectrum empiric therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. However, the harmful effects of inappropriate antimicrobials should be mitigated, whenever possible, by using culture-guided therapy and delayed initiation. In all cases, resuscitation and source control should be the highest priority. Bloos and colleagues' study is a reminder that antimicrobials, while important, are not the only tools in our arsenal against infectious disease.

### Empirical antibiotic therapy for sepsis: save the anaerobic microbiota [^115xsgnW]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotics are fundamental in sepsis management; however, the optimal empirical treatment remains debated. Despite anaerobes rarely being the causative pathogen of sepsis, antibiotics targeting them are frequently used, which might lead to unintended consequences. Multiple studies have shown that depletion of commensal anaerobic gut microbes by anti-anaerobic antibiotics influences systemic immunity and is associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis. However, this knowledge has not yet been translated into clinical practice. When considering empirical coverage of anaerobic pathogens in sepsis, most physicians advocate for a better-safe-than-sorry approach. In this Viewpoint, we argue that anti-anaerobic antibiotics could often result in being sorry rather than safe. We provide an overview of the limited necessity of anaerobic coverage and the potential detrimental effects of anaerobic depletion in sepsis. We aim to raise anaerobic awareness to reduce the unnecessary use of anti-anaerobic antibiotics in empirical sepsis treatment and improve patient outcomes.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^115GugGe]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis — definitions of antimicrobial therapy types are as follows: Empiric antimicrobial therapy is "initial antimicrobial therapy started for suspected infection in the absence of definitive microbiologic pathogen identification", and "may consist of single or multiple agents but should be broad spectrum in nature" and "should be based on local, regional, or national pathogen epidemiology and patient risk factors". Targeted/definitive antimicrobial therapy is "antimicrobial therapy targeted to specific pathogen(s), usually after microbiologic identification", and "may consist of single or multiple agents, but should not be broader than required to treat the specific pathogen(s) after microbiologic identification". Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is "an antimicrobial regimen with activity against multiple different groups of bacteria or other pathogens considered to be likely causes of the clinical presentation", and "may consist of single or multiple agents". Multiple-drug antimicrobial therapy is indicated when "more than one antimicrobial agent is needed to either 1) expand the spectrum of coverage…; 2) decrease the likelihood of resistance…; or 3) provide synergy to treat a suspected or known pathogen".

### Management of neonates born at ≥ 35 0 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^111kup3D]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to neonates, management, AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to administer ampicillin plus gentamicin as the first choice for empirical therapy for early-onset sepsis, as this regimen is effective against group B streptococcus, most other streptococcal and enterococcal species, and L. monocytogenes. Recognize that although two-thirds of E. coli early-onset sepsis isolates and most other Gram-negative early-onset sepsis isolates are resistant to ampicillin, the majority remain sensitive to gentamicin. Consider administering additional broad-spectrum agents in term infants who are critically ill until appropriate culture results are known.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics ≤ 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy ≤ 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain and the severity of illness is lesser, they suggest the diagnosis be clarified before antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize unnecessary antibiotic agent use and unintended harms to the individual and the population. Clarifying steps can include assessing the patient's response to the treatment of noninfectious conditions and comorbidities (e.g. fluids, diuresis, bronchodilators, heart rate control, pain control, opioid antagonists, anticoagulation) and/or obtaining additional diagnostic studies (e.g. cross-sectional imaging, respiratory viral panels) and administering antimicrobial agents only if the concern for infection persists for > 3 hours.

### Considerations for empiric antimicrobial therapy in sepsis and septic shock in an era of antimicrobial resistance [^114h6N1R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with sepsis present across a spectrum of infection sites and severity of illnesses requiring complex decision making at the bedside as to when prompt antibiotics are indicated and which regimen is warranted. Many hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis and low acuity of illness may benefit from further work up before initiating therapy, whereas patients with septic shock warrant emergent broad-spectrum antibiotics. The precise empiric regimen is determined by assessing patient and epidemiological risk factors, likely source of infection based on presenting signs and symptoms, and severity of illness. Hospitals should implement quality improvement measures to aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of septic patients and to ensure antibiotics are given to patients in an expedited fashion after antibiotic order.

### Frequency of antibiotic overtreatment and associated harms in patients presenting with suspected sepsis to the emergency department: a retrospective cohort study [^111XhHvp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment guidelines recommend rapidly treating all patients with suspected sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This may contribute to antibiotic overuse. We quantified the incidence of antibiotic overtreatment and possible antibiotic-associated harms among patients with suspected sepsis.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 600 adults treated for suspected sepsis with anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and/or antipseudomonal β-lactam antibiotics in the emergency departments of 7 hospitals, 2019–2022, to assess their post hoc likelihood of infection, whether narrower antibiotics would have sufficed in retrospect, and possible antibiotic-associated complications. We used generalized estimating equations to assess associations between likelihood of infection and hospital mortality.

Results

Of 600 patients, 411 (68.5%) had definite (48.0%) or probable (20.5%) bacterial infection and 189 (31.5%) had possible but less likely (18.3%) or definitely no (13.2%) bacterial infection. Among patients with definite/probable bacterial infection, 325 of 411 (79.1%) received antibiotics that were overly broad in retrospect. Potential antibiotic-associated complications developed in 104 of 600 (17.3%) patients within 90 days, most commonly new infection or colonization with organisms resistant to first-line agents (48/600 [8.0%]). Mortality was higher for patients with less likely/definitely no bacterial infection versus definite/probable bacterial infections (9.0% vs 4.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.25 [95% confidence interval{CI}, 1.70–2.98]), but antibiotic-associated complication rates were similar (14.8% vs 18.5%; aOR, 0.79 [95% CI, .60–1.05]).

Conclusions

Among 600 patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible sepsis, 1 in 3 most likely did not have a bacterial infection, 4 in 5 of those with bacterial infections were treated with regimens that were broader than necessary in retrospect, and 1 in 6 developed antibiotic-associated complications.

### Reevaluating piperacillin-tazobactam mortality… [^116BxEzt]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor With keen interest, we read the retrospective cohort study by Chanderraj et al, 1 which investigated the mortality influences posed by different classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics among patients with suspected sepsis, based on data collected during a period of specific antibiotic shortage. Their findings indicated that the use of piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with a significant increase in 90-day mortality and a decrease in organ failure–free days compared to cefepime. They suggested that the extended anaerobic coverage provided by piperacillin-tazobactam might be responsible for these outcomes. We agree that this is an important factor; however, we propose that other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues related to piperacillin-tazobactam may also contribute to its adverse outcomes.

### Timing of antibiotic therapy in the ICU [^116ueyJ6]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Appropriate therapy optimization — bacterial infections

When initiating antimicrobial treatment in ICU patients, the choice of agents is most often empirical based on the site of infection, clinical severity and patient comorbidities. Another key element for guiding appropriate empirical therapy is identifying risk factors for infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB), so as to rationalize the empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and prevent their unnecessary utilization. Recent literature suggests that initial antimicrobial therapy that is too broad is associated with poor outcomes. Webb et al. examined 1995 patients with community acquired pneumonia of whom 39.7% received broad-spectrum antibiotics, but MDRB were recovered in only 3%. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was associated with an increased mortality risk even after adjusting for prognostic covariates. Antibiotic-associated events were found in 17.5% of dying patients in the broad-spectrum group and may explain in part the worse outcomes for this cohort. The absence of bacteriological documentation in the majority of patients receiving broad-spectrum therapy suggests that other disease processes mimicking pneumonia and requiring alternative treatments may also have been missed.

Rhee et al. conducted a multicenter cohort study of 17,430 adults with sepsis and positive clinical cultures. Among the 15,183 cases where antibiotic susceptibility testing was available, 12,398 (81.6%) received appropriate antibiotics. Less than 30% of cases were due to MDRB. Unnecessarily broad-spectrum treatment (defined as coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, VRE and ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) when none of these were isolated) occurred in 8405 (67.8%) cases. The adjusted odds ratio for in-hospital death was 1.27 (1.06–1.4) when comparing unnecessarily broad-spectrum and not unnecessarily broad-spectrum initial antibiotic therapy. Unnecessarily broad antibiotic therapy was also associated with increases in acute kidney injury and Clostridium difficile infections.

### Surviving sepsis in the intensive care unit: the challenge of antimicrobial resistance and the trauma patient [^112cFVJc]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) presents a great challenge to any critical care clinician. Patients admitted to the ICU are especially vulnerable to sepsis due to the nature of the underlying pathology that warranted admission to the ICU and deranged physiological function coupled with invasive procedures. Nosocomial infections are common in patients admitted to the ICU, and with these infections come the burden of multidrug-resistant organisms. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is now a global emergency that warrants the attention of every health-care professional. AMR has escalated to epic proportions and solutions to this problem are now a matter of "life and death". The ICU also represents the "breeding ground" of antibiotic-resistant organisms due to the high broad-spectrum antibiotic consumption. Many would argue that broad-spectrum antimicrobials are overprescribed in this patient population, but do all patients admitted to the ICU warrant such therapy? Is there evidence that narrower-spectrum antimicrobial agents can be employed in specific ICU populations coupled with surveillance strategies? The aims of this review are to focus on strategies with the aim of optimizing antimicrobial use within ICUs, and to highlight the importance of differentiating ICU populations with regard to the use of antimicrobial agents.

For patients with possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious etiologies should be undertaken to determine, within 3 hours, whether antibiotics should be administered or deferred while monitoring closely. Administer antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition; perform rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness; and administer antimicrobials within 3 hours if concern for infection persists.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^1142tZvG]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis, the syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction complicating severe infection, is a leading cause of death in hospitalized patients. Early active antibiotic therapy is associated with better outcomes. Therefore, national quality measures and international guidelines recommend immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for all patients with suspected sepsis.

However, it is unclear how many patients presenting with sepsis require coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other potentially resistant pathogens. Most existing epidemiologic studies present rates of resistance to selected antimicrobials per pathogen rather than quantifying overall resistance rates across all patients and syndromes associated with sepsis. These data are needed to inform the rational use of antibiotics, given that overuse of broad-spectrum therapy may also confer harm by selecting for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, increasing the risk of adverse events, such as Clostridioides difficile infections, and raising costs. Overtreatment has also been associated with higher mortality rates in some populations. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis and the risks of both inadequate and unnecessarily broad antibiotic treatments in US hospitals.

### Effect of antibiotic choice on reNal outcomes (ACORN) (ACORN) [^114E8puR]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Sepsis is a common condition associated with high mortality and morbidity. Antibiotics are an integral component of the management of patients with sepsis. Each hour delay in antibiotic administration in sepsis is associated with an increase in mortality. Clinical guidelines recommend early management bundles, including early broad-spectrum antibiotics, for patients with presumed sepsis in the emergency department and intensive care unit. Since the specific organism causing an infection is rarely known at clinical presentation, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are commonly prescribed. For patients at risk for resistant organisms, the most common regimens include vancomycin and an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal penicillin.

Cephalosporins and penicillins are beta-lactam antibiotics that act by inhibiting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. They are commonly used for a variety of infections including empiric broad spectrum coverage for sepsis and suspected nosocomial infections. Several cephalosporins and penicillins have anti-pseudomonal activity, including cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin, and piperacillin-tazobactam, an extended-spectrum penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitor. Anti-pseudomonal penicillins are the preferred agents for empiric broad spectrum coverage at many centers, and piperacillin-tazobactam, specifically, has the added benefit of treating anaerobic organisms.

As the primary treatment for the underlying cause of sepsis, antibiotics are a critical treatment for acutely ill patients, but antibiotics may cause renal injury, and renally-cleared antibiotics may reach supratherapeutic levels in the setting of AKI. Vancomycin has long been associated with AKI. Recently, a number of retrospective observational analyses have examined a potential association between the concurrent administration of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam and the development of AKI, compared with vancomycin alone. These data, however, are likely to be confounded by indication bias and studies evaluating whether piperacillin-tazobactam causes more AKI than other anti-pseudomonal antibiotics have been inconclusive.

### Beta lactam antibiotic monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside antibiotic combination therapy for sepsis [^115PQKEn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal antibiotic treatment for sepsis is imperative. Combining a beta lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside antibiotic may provide certain advantages over beta lactam monotherapy.

Objectives

Our objectives were to compare beta lactam monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy in patients with sepsis and to estimate the rate of adverse effects with each treatment regimen, including the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

Search Methods

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (1966 to 4 November 2013); EMBASE (1980 to November 2013); LILACS (1982 to November 2013); and conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1995 to 2013). We scanned citations of all identified studies and contacted all corresponding authors. In our previous review, we searched the databases to July 2004.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing any beta lactam monotherapy versus any combination of a beta lactam with an aminoglycoside for sepsis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, superinfections and adverse events. Two review authors independently collected data. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the fixed-effect model. We extracted outcomes by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included 69 trials that randomly assigned 7863 participants. Twenty-two trials compared the same beta lactam in both study arms, while the remaining trials compared different beta lactams using a broader-spectrum beta lactam in the monotherapy arm. In trials comparing the same beta lactam, we observed no difference between study groups with regard to all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.30) and clinical failure (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29). In studies comparing different beta lactams, we observed a trend for benefit with monotherapy for all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01) and a significant advantage for clinical failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.84). No significant disparities emerged from subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including assessment of participants with Gram-negative infection. The subgroup of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections was underpowered to examine effects. Results for mortality were classified as low quality of evidence mainly as the result of imprecision. Results for failure were classified as very low quality of evidence because of indirectness of the outcome and possible detection bias in non-blinded trials. We detected no differences in the rate of development of resistance. Nephrotoxicity was significantly less frequent with monotherapy (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.39). We found no heterogeneity for all these comparisons. We included a small subset of studies addressing participants with Gram-positive infection, mainly endocarditis. We identified no difference between monotherapy and combination therapy in these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of an aminoglycoside to beta lactams for sepsis should be discouraged. All-cause mortality rates are unchanged. Combination treatment carries a significant risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^11645cvy]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — empiric antimicrobial coverage and de-escalation in pediatric sepsis specifies: We recommend empiric broad-spectrum therapy with one or more antimicrobials to cover all likely pathogens (BPS); once the pathogen(s) and sensitivities are available, we recommend narrowing empiric antimicrobial therapy coverage (BPS); and if no pathogen is identified, we recommend narrowing or stopping empiric antimicrobial therapy according to clinical presentation, site of infection, host risk factors, and adequacy of clinical improvement in discussion with infectious disease and/or microbiological expert advice (BPS). Empiric therapy should cover a broad range of pathogens that are likely to cause the infection, and broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for initial empiric therapy of children with septic shock or sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. The initial choice of empiric antimicrobials should take into account the specific clinical history, and patients with recent or current hospital exposure should receive empiric therapy that considers known infection or colonization and any recent antimicrobial exposure. Institutions or regions should identify the most appropriate first-line single-agent antimicrobial, when available an infectious diseases clinician should be consulted, and other nonbacterial pathogens suspected as a cause of infection should also be targeted on a case-by-case basis.

### Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics issues relevant for the clinical use of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients [^115MGPEt]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobials are among the most important and commonly prescribed drugs in the management of critically ill patients and beta-lactams are the most common antibiotic class used because of their broad spectrum of activity and high tolerability.

Early and appropriate antibiotic administration improves clinical outcome of septic patients. In the presence of septic shock, besides conflicting results, each hour delay is associated with a measurable increase in mortality and other negative endpoints (e.g. length of stay in ICU, acute kidney injury, acute lung injury, and global organ injury assessed by the Sepsis-Related Organ Assessment score).

Choosing the appropriate antimicrobial for the bacterial activity spectrum is crucial but the correct dosage regimen (both dose and frequency) is, at least, of the same importance for successful clinical cure and microbiological eradication.

Unlike organotropic drugs, where it is easy to titrate dose to achieve a clinical response, antibiotics may take 24–72 h to present signs of resolution of infection, making it difficult to determine the most appropriate dosage.

We conducted a comprehensive bibliographic search in the PubMed database of all English language articles published from January 2000 to December 2017, using the following keywords: critical care or intensive care or critically ill and sepsis or septic shock and antibiotics and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Articles not addressing beta-lactam pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) in critically ill patients were excluded. A small number of articles derived from references in the articles selected were also reviewed. In the end, 214 studies were included in our review (Fig. 1).

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^111G46AL]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

In our cohort, inadequate therapy was associated with a 20% to 40% higher odds of death depending on whether all cultures or only blood cultures were analyzed. Our estimates are in the range of the results of a meta-analysis of 48 studies that reported a pooled odds ratio of 1.6 for death associated with inadequate therapy in patients with sepsis. We also found that patients with antibiotic-resistant pathogens received inadequate empiric therapy 4 times as often compared with patients with nonresistant organisms; patients with resistant pathogens who received inadequate therapy had higher mortality rates. However, we did not find an association between antibiotic-resistant organisms and mortality after adjusting for baseline and clinical characteristics as well as adequacy of empiric antibiotics. This suggests that the higher crude mortality rates in patients with resistant organisms could be mediated by their higher comorbidity burden, greater severity of illness, and inadequate antibiotic therapy rather than intrinsic virulence of resistant organisms.

While clinicians, guidelines, and policies understandably emphasize broad-spectrum antibiotics to ensure adequate empiric treatment, our findings suggest that the risk of inadequate therapy needs to be weighed against the risks of unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics. Among patients who received adequate therapy, overtreatment was associated with a 20% increase in the odds of death. Other studies have also reported that more aggressive antibiotic regimens may be associated with higher mortality rates in critically ill patients. In our cohort, we found an association between overtreatment and mortality only among patients without shock. This may be because the morbidity of acute severe illness in patients with septic shock outweighs the possible morbidity of excessively broad antibiotic therapy, whereas in less critically ill patients, the morbidity of excessively broad antibiotics may be more significant. Another possibility is residual confounding among patients without shock because of the wide array of infections and organ dysfunction in this group that may make it more difficult to adequately adjust for all gradations in illness. The possibility of residual confounding is supported by the observation that more severely ill patients were more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^1175TafH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

All told, this valuable study bespeaks the complexity of sepsis. Sepsis is not a discrete disease or a one-size-fits-all syndrome. It is a complicated mosaic of diseases with protean manifestations in diverse patients. Our current tools to differentiate these conditions are crude, particularly in real time at the bedside. This study and others suggest that there is ample room, and clinical necessity, to add more nuance to how we risk-stratify and manage patients with suspected sepsis. Patients with septic shock should continue to be prioritized for immediate treatment. Additional populations such as those with metastatic cancer or at least three organ failures may also benefit from earlier antibiotic treatment. Most importantly, the study of Hechtman and colleagues puts the onus on us to further refine our understanding of which combinations of host, comorbidity, clinical presentations, illness severity, and pathogen are most likely to benefit from early broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and which combinations may presage increased risk of harm from immediate antibiotic treatment; and to develop the tools clinicians need to better differentiate between these phenotypes in real time at the bedside.

### Trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis in US hospitals [^116rcXQQ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis changing over time?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 6.3 million adults admitted to 241 US hospitals between 2017 and 2021, half of all anti–methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and antipseudomonal β-lactam antibiotics were prescribed for suspected community-onset sepsis but only 9.5% of suspected community-onset sepsis cases treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics had resistant organisms identified.

Meaning

These results suggest that more attention is needed toward balancing early broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for patients with sepsis with limiting overuse for the majority who do not have antibiotic-resistant infections.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^116Gg1GK]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

As causative pathogens are not usually identified at the time of initiating antibiotics in sepsis, carbapenems are commonly used as an initial treatment. To reduce indiscriminate use of carbapenems, the efficacy of alternative empiric regimens, such as piperacillin–tazobactam and the fourth-generation cephalosporins, should be elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate survival effect associated with carbapenems as initial therapy for sepsis compared with these antibiotics.

DESIGN:

Multicenter retrospective observational study.

SETTING:

Tertiary hospitals in Japan.

PATIENTS:

Adult patients diagnosed as having sepsis from 2006 to 2019.

INTERVENTIONS:

Administration of carbapenems as initial antibiotic therapy.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:

This study used data of adult patients with sepsis extracted from a large-scale database in Japan. Patients were divided into two groups as follows: patients receiving carbapenems and patients receiving noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial treatment. In-hospital mortality was compared between the groups by a logistic regression model adjusted by an inverse probability treatment weighting using propensity scores. To evaluate heterogeneity of effects according to patient characteristics, we also fitted logistic models in several subgroups. Among 7,392 patients with sepsis, 3,547 patients received carbapenems, and 3,845 patients received noncarbapenem agents. The logistic model showed no significant association between carbapenem therapy and lower mortality (adjusted OR 0.88, p = 0.108). Subgroup analyses suggested that there were significant survival benefits associated with carbapenem therapy in patients with septic shock, in ICUs, or with mechanical ventilation (p for effect modifications: < 0.001, 0.014, and 0.105, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS:

Compared with the noncarbapenem broad-spectrum antibiotics, carbapenems as an initial therapy for sepsis were not associated with significantly lower mortality.

### Syndromic analysis of sepsis cohorts using large language models [^112rYBsb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis contributes to 20% of all deaths globally. It also plays a major role in broad-spectrum antimicrobial use, in part because treatment guidelines and quality metrics recommend broad-spectrum antibiotics for all patients with possible sepsis within 1 to 3 hours of recognition. Empiric treatment often includes coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDRGN) bacteria, but only 5% to 14% of patients with positive cultures have evidence of any of these resistant organisms. Overly broad or unnecessary antibiotic use is potentially harmful. Up to 20% of hospitalized patients experience antibiotic adverse effects, and overly broad antibiotic regimens are associated with increased mortality.

Clinicians seeing patients with possible sepsis or septic shock typically have little information on which to base initial treatment decisions, as definitive diagnostic information typically takes hours or days to return. Consequently, clinicians often rely on patients' presenting signs and symptoms to decide whether and which antibiotics to use. Notwithstanding the importance of signs and symptoms to inform initial antibiotic choices, most large cohort studies assessing the associations between antibiotic choice, timing, and outcomes have not included presenting signs and symptoms as potentially informative variables. This gap is likely because signs and symptoms are usually recorded in unstructured clinical notes and require laborious and subjective medical record reviews to extract. Smaller studies that did use medical record review have found that certain symptoms are associated with lower SEP-1 (Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle) complianceand higher mortality, but scalable approaches to extract these data have been lacking. International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes capture some symptom data (eg, codes R00-R99), but these codes are inconsistently applied and typically superseded by more specific diagnoses whenever possible. The lack of large-scale symptom data has also complicated efforts to find subphenotypes of sepsis that could guide more individualized care. To date, sepsis subphenotyping studies either describe clusters of vital signs and laboratory data not recognizable to clinicians, or require the collection of biomarkers and trajectory data not routinely available within the first few hours of presentation.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^111pLVtd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Early versus late pre-intensive care unit admission broad spectrum antibiotics for severe sepsis in adults [^113dexyg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Severe sepsis and septic shock have recently emerged as particularly acute and lethal challenges amongst critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). There are no existing data on the current practices of management of patients with severe sepsis comparing early versus late administration of appropriate broad spectrum antibiotics as part of the early goal-directed therapy that is commenced in the first few hours of presentation.

Objectives

To assess the difference in outcomes with early compared to late administration of antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis in the pre-intensive care unit (ICU) admission period. We defined early as within one hour of presentation to the ED.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009); MEDLINE (1990 to February 2010); EMBASE (1990 to February 2010); and ISI web of Science (February 2010). We also searched for relevant ongoing trials in specific websites such as www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicalstudyresults.org; and www.update-software.com. We searched the reference lists of articles. There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomized controlled trials of early versus late broad spectrum antibiotics in adult patients with severe sepsis in the ED, prior to admission to the intensive care unit.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

Main Results

We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this review we are unable to make a recommendation on the early or late use of broad spectrum antibiotics in adult patients with severe sepsis in the ED pre-ICU admission. There is a need to do large prospective double blinded randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of early (within one hour) versus late broad spectrum antibiotics in adult severe sepsis patients. Since it makes sense to start antibiotics as soon as possible in this group of seriously ill patients, administering such antibiotics earlier as opposed to later is based on anecdotal suboptimal evidence.

### Trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis in US hospitals [^112qjbSN]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Empiric treatment for suspected community-onset sepsis accounts for about half of broad-spectrum antibiotic use in US hospitals even though resistant organisms are isolated in only 7% of patients with community-onset sepsis and less than 10% of patients treated with broad-spectrum agents. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected sepsis is increasing while the percentage of cases with proven resistant infections is decreasing, translating into an increasing number of broad-spectrum courses that are likely unnecessary in retrospect. These findings help elucidate the contribution of suspected sepsis to antibiotic prescribing in US hospitals and inform ongoing deliberations on finding the balance between assuring early, appropriate therapy for patients with severe infections vs limiting overuse for the majority of patients who do not have antibiotic-resistant infections.

### Multi-drug resistance, inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy and mortality in Gram-negative severe sepsis and septic shock: a retrospective cohort study [^115koNke]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

An additional point worth emphasizing is the relatively low prevalence of MDR pathogens in our study, and the implications of this for potential overuse of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, if such are available. Although certainly suboptimal with respect to both overuse and increased resource utilization, at the moment there is no way to tailor such therapies with any degree of precision. Yet not administering appropriate coverage results in a high penalty for the patient who is unlucky enough to harbor a MDR organism, with a fourfold increase in the risk of death. This situation underscores the urgency of the need for development of faster diagnostic tools, as well as risk stratification algorithms that may help clinicians to use broad-spectrum drugs appropriately. At the moment, however, the only viable solution appears to be to understand local resistance patterns in real time and make therapeutic choices based on them.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^112KcPtR]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

As causative pathogens are not usually identified at the time of initiating antibiotics in sepsis, carbapenems are commonly used as an initial treatment. To reduce indiscriminate use of carbapenems, the efficacy of alternative empiric regimens, such as piperacillin-tazobactam and the fourth-generation cephalosporins, should be elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate survival effect associated with carbapenems as initial therapy for sepsis compared with these antibiotics.

Design

Multicenter retrospective observational study.

Setting

Tertiary hospitals in Japan.

Patients

Adult patients diagnosed as having sepsis from 2006 to 2019.

Interventions

Administration of carbapenems as initial antibiotic therapy.

Measurements and Main Results

This study used data of adult patients with sepsis extracted from a large-scale database in Japan. Patients were divided into two groups as follows: patients receiving carbapenems and patients receiving noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial treatment. In-hospital mortality was compared between the groups by a logistic regression model adjusted by an inverse probability treatment weighting using propensity scores. To evaluate heterogeneity of effects according to patient characteristics, we also fitted logistic models in several subgroups. Among 7,392 patients with sepsis, 3,547 patients received carbapenems, and 3,845 patients received noncarbapenem agents. The logistic model showed no significant association between carbapenem therapy and lower mortality (adjusted OR 0.88, p = 0.108). Subgroup analyses suggested that there were significant survival benefits associated with carbapenem therapy in patients with septic shock, in ICUs, or with mechanical ventilation (p for effect modifications: < 0.001, 0.014, and 0.105, respectively).

Conclusions

Compared with the noncarbapenem broad-spectrum antibiotics, carbapenems as an initial therapy for sepsis were not associated with significantly lower mortality.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^117MHk7w]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in community-onset sepsis, and is there risk associated with the receipt of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics?

Findings

In this cohort study of 17 430 adults with culture-positive sepsis admitted to 104 US hospitals, 67.0% received empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, but resistant gram-positive organisms were isolated in only 13.6% of patients and resistant gram-negative organisms in 13.2%. Both undertreatment (failure to cover organisms) and overtreatment (resistant organisms targeted but not isolated) were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment.

Meaning

In this study, broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered to patients with community-onset sepsis without resistant organisms, and these therapies were associated with worse outcomes.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^112f2Nh3]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Despite the progress made in medical management over the past few decades, sepsis remains an important global health problem causing millions of deaths around the world. One essential facet of sepsis management is the administration of appropriate antimicrobials. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that failure or delay in the administration of appropriate antimicrobials is associated with substantial increases in the mortality of sepsis. On the basis of the evidence, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommended empiric broad-spectrum therapy to cover all likely pathogens as soon as possible after sepsis is recognized.

Broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics are commonly used as empiric therapy for sepsis. Among them, carbapenems offer an exceptionally broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The existing evidence suggests that carbapenems are associated with relatively low mortality in several infectious diseases, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens. For these reasons, carbapenems are the preferably used antibiotics for the initial treatment of sepsis, and consumption of carbapenem has been reported to be increasing in different parts of the world. However, indiscriminate use of carbapenems against sepsis should be avoided because it has contributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, updating knowledge on the efficacy of alternative empiric regimens for sepsis is required.

The fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime and cefpirome, and piperacillin/tazobactam are nearly equal to carbapenems in antimicrobial activity and thus are considered alternative therapies against sepsis. Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of carbapenems compared with these antibiotics against several specific pathogens, such as Acinetobacter species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. However, there is little evidence of the efficacy of carbapenems against unidentified mixed pathogens. Causative pathogens are not usually identified at the time of initiating antibiotics in sepsis because of the strong recommendation to initiate immediate treatment, ideally within 1 hour after sepsis is first suspected. Thus, there is a significant need to comprehensively evaluate differences in mortality and morbidities between carbapenems versus noncarbapenem broad-spectrum antibiotics as initial treatment of sepsis, including various underlying infectious diseases and causative pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate mortality and morbidities in patients with community-acquired sepsis treated with carbapenems as initial antibiotic therapy compared with those treated with noncarbapenem antibiotics.

### Non-antibiotic strategies for sepsis [^113a4ft4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock remain a considerable therapeutic challenge. Despite significant advances in supportive care and the availability of potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics, the overall mortality due to sepsis is still approximately 35%, and this increases to 60% if patients develop septic shock. Antibiotics constitute a necessary part of the treatment of sepsis, and there is probably considerable scope to improve the way in which they are used. Nevertheless, antibiotics alone, even used optimally, are probably not sufficient to substantially reduce the mortality that accompanies the multiorgan failure that occurs in septic patients. For this reason, considerable efforts have been expended in developing non-antibiotic (or so-called adjunctive) forms of treatment, and here the general approaches to these types of treatment are reviewed. There are three main categories: improvements in supportive care, treatments aimed at bacterial virulence factors, and treatments aimed at host mediators. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review, but rather to provide examples in each category to illustrate the general principles-and the hurdles-that have characterized these approaches to therapy.

### Antibiotic therapy in patients with septic shock [^1168YUbb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The management of a patient with severe sepsis is first to diagnose the infection, to collect samples immediately after diagnosis and to initiate promptly broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy should be based on host characteristics, site of infection, local ecology and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antibiotics. In severe infection, guidelines recommend the use of a combination of antibiotics. After results of cultures are obtained, treatment should be re-evaluated to either de-escalate or escalate the antibiotics. This is associated with optimal costs, decreased incidence of superinfection and reduced development of antimicrobial resistance. All these steps should be based on written protocols, and compliance to these protocols should be monitored continuously in order to detect violations and implement corrective procedures.

Italian multidisciplinary Consensus Conference for the antimicrobial treatment of Intra-abdominal Infections

What is the optimal timing to start antibiotic therapy in patients with IAIs?

1. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started after a treatable infection has been recognized or highly suspected. Timing of administration should be based on the patient's clinical status (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Antibiotic therapy in patients with IAIs is initially empiric because the identification of pathogens and their susceptibility patterns determined by the standard microbiological culture typically needs 24 h or more.

Timing of administration should be based on the patient's clinical status. In non-critically ill patients, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started when an IAI is recognized or highly suspected. Survival benefit from adequate empiric antibiotic therapy has not been consistently shown, even in patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia. Conversely, in patients with sepsis or septic shock, the prompt administration of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy can significantly influence the outcome, regardless of the anatomical site of infection.

According to the current literature, a strong correlation exists between each hour of delayed administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and mortality in patients with septic shock. However, this relationship is less pronounced in patients with sepsis who do not experience shock.

When should microbiological cultures be obtained in patients with IAIs?

2. In patients with IAIs at risk of resistant pathogens and in critically ill patients', cultures from peritoneal fluid should be always obtained. In critically ill hospitalized patients, a minimum of two sets of blood cultures before initiating antimicrobial therapy should be always obtained (Very low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Microbiological testing results are crucial in choosing a therapeutic strategy and in guiding a targeted antibiotic treatment. This testing allows clinicians to individualize the spectrum of the antibiotic regimen, broadening it if the initial choice was too narrow, but more commonly narrowing an empiric regimen spectrum that was too broad.

Table 2 — suspected sepsis antibiotics: out-of-hospital evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation; in the emergency department, we recommend prompt administration, reserving very short time thresholds for those with infection and shock given insufficient data to specify a threshold, administer broad-spectrum therapy when the source is unconfirmed based on local susceptibility, and target therapy to identified sources such as pneumonia or UTI per source-specific guidelines.

### The early antibiotic therapy in septic patients – milestone or sticking point? [^114yBDo1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale for early antibiotic therapy

Worldwide, the annual prevalence of sepsis is estimated at 19 million cases. The mortality rates in severe sepsis were reduced to 20% to 30% because of advances in training, recognition, surveillance, monitoring, and rapid initial antibiotic therapy and organ support. The most recent update of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines was published in 2013. A consensus committee provided valuable and clear recommendations on treatment of sepsis and septic shock (Table 1). One of the main focuses is the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Table 2). It is recommended that antimicrobials be administrated within the first hour of recognition of septic shock and severe sepsis without septic shock. Moreover, it is recommended that initial anti-infective therapy include one or more drugs that have activity against all likely pathogens and penetrate in adequate concentrations into the target tissue. The selected antibiotic strategy should anticipate the site of infection, medical and culture history, and local microbial susceptibility results, all in an emergency situation.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114m6UYR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 deaths in the USA each year. The in-hospital mortality approaches 30% despite advances in critical care during the last several decades. The direct health care costs in the USA exceed $24 billion dollars annually and continue to escalate each year especially as the population ages. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign published their initial clinical practice guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008, 2012 and most recently in 2016 following the convening of the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force. This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In addition to using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to more rapidly identify patients with sepsis, the task force also proposed a novel scoring system to rapidly screen for patients outside the ICU who are at risk of developing sepsis: the 'quickSOFA' (qSOFA) score. To date, the largest reductions in mortality have been associated with early identification of sepsis, initiation of a 3-hour care bundle and rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial, and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis in US hospitals [^117NKzA9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Early administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy can be life-saving in patients with sepsis and is heavily emphasized by best practice guidelines, quality improvement initiatives, and government metrics. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Management Bundle (SEP-1) measure, for example, requires broad-spectrum antibiotic administration within 3 hours of sepsis onset, while the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's Hour-1 Bundle sets a 1 hour goal.

However, many patients initially suspected of sepsis are ultimately diagnosed with noninfectious or viral conditions. Furthermore, most patients who do have bacterial sepsis are infected with pathogens covered by narrower-spectrum antibiotics. The increasing emphasis on administering immediate antibiotics to all patients with possible sepsis may therefore be driving increased use of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics, antibiotic-associated adverse events, and antimicrobial resistance without benefitting patients.,

Several studies examining the period shortly before and after SEP-1 was introduced in 2015 demonstrated significant increases in broad-spectrum and total antibiotic use in US hospitals without corresponding decreases in sepsis-associated mortality. However, it is unclear to what extent suspected sepsis contributes to overall broad-spectrum antibiotic utilization in hospitals, what proportion of antibiotic administrations turn out to be unnecessarily broad in retrospect, and whether these patterns are changing over time. We therefore analyzed a large cohort of US hospitals to elucidate the epidemiology and trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use relative to identified pathogens for patients with suspected community-onset sepsis.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America position paper: recommended revisions to the national severe sepsis and septic shock early management bundle (SEP-1) sepsis quality measure [^116Nh8HK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) measure has appropriately established sepsis as a national priority. However, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA and five additional endorsing societies) is concerned about SEP-1's potential to drive antibiotic overuse because it does not account for the high rate of sepsis overdiagnosis and encourages aggressive antibiotics for all patients with possible sepsis, regardless of the certainty of diagnosis or severity of illness. IDSA is also concerned that SEP-1's complex "time zero" definition is not evidence-based and is prone to inter-observer variation. In this position paper, IDSA outlines several recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of unintended consequences of SEP-1 while maintaining focus on its evidence-based elements. IDSA's core recommendation is to limit SEP-1 to septic shock, for which the evidence supporting the benefit of immediate antibiotics is greatest. Prompt empiric antibiotics are often appropriate for suspected sepsis without shock, but IDSA believes there is too much heterogeneity and difficulty defining this population, uncertainty about the presence of infection, and insufficient data on the necessity of immediate antibiotics to support a mandatory treatment standard for all patients in this category. IDSA believes guidance on managing possible sepsis without shock is more appropriate for guidelines that can delineate the strengths and limitations of supporting evidence and allow clinicians discretion in applying specific recommendations to individual patients. Removing sepsis without shock from SEP-1 will mitigate the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for noninfectious syndromes, simplify data abstraction, increase measure reliability, and focus attention on the population most likely to benefit from immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics.
