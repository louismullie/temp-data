## Question

lifting restrictions after cabg?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lifting and activity restrictions after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with attention to sternal healing, early mobilization, return-to-work timelines, and special situations like minimal access surgery and arterial graft risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of sternal instability and how long bone healing actually takes. Then, I should verify the conventional sternal precautions, including weight limits and duration. Next, I will examine evolving evidence that supports less restrictive, earlier mobilization. After that, I should consider graft-specific risks, particularly LIMA avulsion, and whether these truly change lifting advice. I will then integrate rehabilitation phases and a practical, risk-stratified return-to-activity timeline. Finally, I will align the recommendations with contemporary guidelines and outline how to individualize counseling based on comorbidities and job demands, before concluding with a concise synthesis that reflects both safety and functional recovery goals.

> Let me first confirm the core issue: median sternotomy creates a controlled fracture of the sternum that requires bony union, and instability can lead to dehiscence, infection, and chronic pain, which is why most programs historically enforced strict lifting and movement precautions for 6–12 weeks. This risk frame justifies conservative limits while the sternum heals, even though it can slow functional recovery if overly restrictive [^116CX5t6] [^114aH4Cw].

> I need to check the conventional restrictions used in practice: typical sternal precautions advise avoiding lifting more than about 2–5 kg (approximately 5–10 pounds), keeping elbows close to the body when lifting anything, avoiding pushing or pulling heavy objects, and not carrying anything that causes pain or strain. Most programs enforce these for 7–12 weeks, with an average of about 9 weeks, and instruct patients to use log-roll techniques for bed mobility to minimize shear on the sternum during early recovery [^1147S3VZ] [^116CX5t6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about blanket restrictions. Contemporary enhanced recovery frameworks emphasize early mobilization and upper-extremity movement because deconditioning worsens outcomes, and observational and consensus data suggest that carefully supervised early activity is safe and may not increase sternal complications when pain-guided and technique-focused, prompting many centers to adopt a more permissive approach with patient education rather than rigid numeric limits [^114aH4Cw] [^113AdcwB].

> But wait, what about the internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft specifically? Could heavy lifting avulse the LIMA? Rare case reports describe LIMA avulsion in the early postoperative period, often linked to technical factors like inadequate conduit length or adhesions, with exertion, coughing, or CPR as precipitants; while the absolute risk is very low, I should counsel patients to avoid maximal, Valsalva-type straining early and to progress lifting gradually as sternal pain resolves, especially in the first 4–6 weeks, even though formal evidence-based lifting thresholds are lacking for this specific complication [^11139fjK].

> Next, I should review the rehabilitation phases to anchor counseling: in weeks 0–2, prioritize pain control, sternal protection, and supervised ambulation with basic range-of-motion. In weeks 2–6, advance to structured cardiac rehabilitation with low-resistance upper-body work and progressive ambulation. In weeks 6–12, escalate resistance and functional tasks as sternal discomfort abates. After 12 weeks, most patients without complications can return to unrestricted activity, with individualized pacing for heavy manual labor or high-demand athletes [^notfound].

> I will now examine return-to-work timelines, since patients often ask about lifting at work. Observational cohorts suggest that among patients under 60 who return to work, roughly three-quarters remain employed at 10 years, but many retire within the first postoperative year, underscoring the importance of early, graded work reintegration. Combined cardiac rehabilitation with work-directed counseling can accelerate return-to-work by about 6 weeks in some trials, though evidence certainty varies, so I should tailor expectations to job demands and recovery trajectory [^111B3mSM] [^116nBZpr].

> Let me consider special surgical approaches. Minimally invasive or off-pump strategies may reduce pain and sternal complications, but they do not eliminate the need for sternal precautions if a sternotomy was performed, whereas true nonsternotomy approaches (e.g. MICS-CABG) may allow earlier functional recovery. However, even in these cases, I should confirm wound-healing status and any chest wall morbidity before lifting guidance, and avoid assuming that less invasive surgery equals no precautions in the early postoperative period [^114V7REh].

> I should double-check how guidelines inform this. Major society guidelines emphasize early mobilization and structured rehabilitation after CABG, but they do not specify numeric lifting limits, reflecting the limited direct evidence. Practically, this supports using a symptom-guided, technique-focused approach with a default 6–12 week period of cautious progression, while individualizing based on sternal healing, pain, and comorbidities such as osteoporosis, diabetes, or chronic cough that may prolong precaution needs [^113GuTEe] [^114aH4Cw].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic, risk-stratified recommendation: for most patients after standard sternotomy CABG, maintain a default 2–5 kg lifting limit for about 6–8 weeks, advance to 5–10 kg by weeks 8–10 if pain-free and sternum feels stable, and progress to unrestricted lifting after 10–12 weeks if there is no pain, crepitus, or deformity. For low-risk patients with excellent sternal fixation, rapid healing, and supervised rehab, earlier progression at 4–6 weeks may be reasonable with careful technique. For high-risk patients (osteoporosis, diabetes, chronic cough, obesity, malnutrition), extend precautions toward 12 weeks and consider imaging if instability is suspected. Throughout, avoid Valsalva-heavy maximal lifts in the first month and teach safe movement mechanics [^1147S3VZ] [^114aH4Cw].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to anchor the 10-pound limit to gynecologic surgery data showing surgeons commonly use that threshold after minimally invasive procedures, but hold on, I should verify applicability. That 10-pound benchmark comes from gynecologic postoperative care and is not evidence-based for sternotomy healing, so I should not overextend it to CABG. Instead, I will keep the 2–5 kg range tied to cardiac surgery physiotherapy surveys and emphasize symptom-guided progression rather than a fixed weight cap borrowed from other surgeries [^1161LC3e] [^1147S3VZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling is actionable and safe: teach log-roll bed mobility, keep elbows tucked when lifting, avoid pushing or pulling doors or shopping carts early, and use a pillow to splint the chest when coughing or sneezing. Reinforce that pain is a stop signal, and coordinate with cardiac rehabilitation for supervised progression. If patients report sternal shift, click, or localized pain with lifting, I should evaluate for instability and consider sternal imaging rather than escalating load, prioritizing early detection of dehiscence or nonunion [^1147S3VZ] [^114aH4Cw].

After CABG, patients should **avoid lifting more than 5–10 pounds (2–5 kg)** for the first 6–8 weeks to protect the healing sternum and grafts [^1147S3VZ]. After this period, lifting can be gradually increased to 10–20 pounds (4.5–9 kg) by weeks 8–12, and heavier loads only after 12 weeks if pain-free and cleared by the surgeon. Lifting should be **pain-free and use proper body mechanics**; avoid overhead lifting, twisting, or holding breath during exertion. Individualize restrictions based on healing, comorbidities, and job demands, and always follow the cardiac rehabilitation plan [^113GuTEe].

---

## General lifting restrictions after CABG

- **Initial postoperative period (0–6 weeks)**: Patients are typically advised to avoid lifting anything heavier than 5–10 pounds (2–5 kg) [^1147S3VZ] during the first 6 weeks postoperatively. This precaution is primarily to protect the healing sternum (breastbone) and prevent complications such as sternal instability or dehiscence [^116CX5t6].

- **Intermediate postoperative period (6–12 weeks)**: After the initial 6 weeks, patients may gradually increase lifting activities, but generally should not exceed 10–20 pounds (4.5–9 kg) without specific clearance from their healthcare provider. This gradual progression allows the sternum to continue healing and reduces the risk of complications.

- **Long-term postoperative period (after 12 weeks)**: Most patients can return to normal lifting activities after 12 weeks, provided they have healed properly and have no ongoing complications. However, heavy lifting (more than 20 pounds or 9 kg) should only be resumed with caution and under medical guidance.

---

## Rationale behind lifting restrictions

Lifting restrictions after CABG are primarily intended to:

- **Protect the healing sternum**: The sternum is typically divided during CABG surgery and takes approximately 6–12 weeks to heal properly. Excessive lifting or strain can disrupt the healing process, leading to sternal instability or dehiscence [^116CX5t6].

- **Prevent graft complications**: Lifting heavy objects can increase intrathoracic pressure, potentially compromising the integrity of the grafts and increasing the risk of complications such as graft failure or bleeding [^11139fjK].

- **Reduce risk of musculoskeletal injuries**: Patients may experience reduced muscle strength and endurance postoperatively, making them more susceptible to injuries during lifting activities [^113AdcwB].

---

## Factors influencing lifting restrictions

Several factors influence the **specific lifting restrictions** recommended for individual patients:

| **Factor** | **Influence on lifting restrictions** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older patients may require longer recovery periods and more cautious lifting restrictions [^notfound]. |
| Gender | Female patients, particularly those with osteoporosis, may have increased risk of sternal complications and may require more conservative lifting restrictions. |
| Surgical technique | Minimally invasive or off-pump CABG procedures may result in faster recovery and potentially less restrictive lifting guidelines. |
| Presence of complications | Patients experiencing postoperative complications such as sternal instability, infection, or delayed wound healing may require prolonged lifting restrictions. |
| Overall health and fitness level | Patients with pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions or low fitness levels may need more conservative lifting restrictions. |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting lifting restrictions

Although there is limited high-quality evidence specifically addressing lifting restrictions after CABG, several studies and expert consensus statements emphasize the importance of sternal precautions and gradual progression of physical activity. The ERAS Cardiac Society and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) recommend **early mobilization and gradual progression of physical activity**, including lifting, under supervised cardiac rehabilitation programs [^114aH4Cw].

---

## Potential risks of not adhering to lifting restrictions

Failure to adhere to recommended lifting restrictions can lead to **several complications**, including:

- **Sternal instability or dehiscence**: Excessive lifting can disrupt the healing sternum, leading to serious complications that may require surgical intervention [^notfound].

- **Graft complications**: Increased intrathoracic pressure from heavy lifting can compromise graft integrity, potentially leading to graft failure or bleeding [^11139fjK].

- **Musculoskeletal injuries**: Patients may experience muscle strains, joint injuries, or chronic pain due to premature resumption of heavy lifting activities [^notfound].

---

## Gradual progression of lifting activities

Patients are typically advised to follow a **gradual progression of lifting activities**, such as:

- **Weeks 0–6**: Avoid lifting more than 5–10 pounds (2–5 kg). Focus on gentle range-of-motion exercises and light daily activities [^1147S3VZ].

- **Weeks 6–12**: Gradually increase lifting to 10–20 pounds (4.5–9 kg) with proper body mechanics and under medical guidance.

- **After 12 weeks**: Resume normal lifting activities cautiously, avoiding heavy lifting (> 20 pounds or 9 kg) until cleared by a healthcare provider.

---

## Role of cardiac rehabilitation

Cardiac rehabilitation programs play a crucial role in guiding patients through safe **progression of physical activity**, including lifting. These programs provide supervised exercise training, education on proper body mechanics, and individualized guidance based on patient-specific factors [^1147S3VZ].

---

## Individualized patient education

Healthcare providers should provide individualized patient education, including:

- **Clear instructions**: Specific lifting restrictions tailored to the patient's condition and recovery progress.

- **Proper body mechanics**: Education on safe lifting techniques to minimize strain on the healing sternum and grafts.

- **Warning signs**: Information on signs of complications, such as chest pain, sternal instability, or unusual fatigue, and instructions to seek immediate medical attention if these occur [^112zkUUh].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Patients recovering from CABG surgery should adhere to **lifting restrictions** to protect the healing sternum, prevent complications, and promote safe recovery. The general recommendation is to avoid lifting more than 5–10 pounds (2–5 kg) for the first 6 weeks, gradually increasing to 10–20 pounds (4.5–9 kg) by weeks 6–12, and resuming normal activities after 12 weeks if cleared by a healthcare provider. Individualized guidance from healthcare providers and participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs are essential for safe recovery and return to normal activities [^1147S3VZ].

Background

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is generally recommended with major occlusion of any of the main coronary arteries and contraindication or previous unsuccessful attempts of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In particular, CABG can effectively improve survival when severe stenosis of the left main coronary artery (≥ 50% in diameter) occurs, and triple large coronary arteries are severely narrowed (≥ 70% in diameter) with or without involvement of the proximal anterior descending artery. Despite progress in recent decades, CABG surgery is invasive and considered a high-risk procedure, associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality rates to 14.0% and 2.0%, respectively. Moreover, postoperative complications, including pneumonia (1–3.9%), periprocedural myocardial infarction(PMI) (9.7–12.5%), atrial fibrillation(5–40% within 2–4 days postoperatively), stroke (1.6–8.4%), and acute kidney injury (5–42%) affect treatment success and patients' quality of life.

Programs targeting the prevention of such complications including Enhanced recovery after cardiac surgery (ERAS-cardiac) with demonstrated effectiveness are thus of pivotal importance. ERAS-Cardiac is an umbrella term for multimodal and interdisciplinary intervention programs targeting perioperative management of a patient with the aim of promoting early recovery after cardiac surgery. ERAS-Cardiac usually includes three phases the pre-, peri- and post-surgery, including smoking and alcohol cessation, dietary modifications, and psychological care, among others. ERAS programs after CABG have been shown to reduce bronchopneumonia rate from 18.8 to 9.7%, atrial fibrillation from 39 to 26%, stroke from 3 to 0%. Moreover, the mean length of ICU and hospital stay decreased by 1–3 days and 1–7 days, respectively. An additional file shows this in more detail (see Additional file 1). Although ERAS has the potential to reduce postoperative complications, postoperative bed rest and reduced activity in CABG patients can result in decline in in muscle strength and decreased cardiopulmonary endurance.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets.

Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of cardiovascular events, even in the absence of previous cardiovascular symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.

### Coronary artery bypass graft surgery complications: a review for emergency clinicians [^112nHtKW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery remains a high-risk procedure, and many patients require emergency department (ED) management for complications after surgery.

Objective

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the current data for the emergency medicine evaluation and management of post-CABG surgery complications.

Discussion

While there has been a recent decline in all cardiac revascularization procedures, there remains over 200,000 CABG surgeries performed in the United States annually, with up to 14% of these patients presenting to the ED within 30 days of discharge with post-operative complications. Risk factors for perioperative mortality and morbidity after CABG surgery can be divided into three categories: patient characteristics, clinician characteristics, and postoperative factors. Emergency physicians will be faced with several postoperative complications, including sternal wound infections, pneumonia, thromboembolic phenomena, graft failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, pericardial effusion, strokes, renal injury, gastrointestinal insults, and hemodynamic instability. Critical patients should be evaluated in the resuscitation bay, and consultation with the primary surgical team is needed, which improves patient outcomes. This review provides several guiding principles for management of acute complications. Understanding these complications and an approach to the management of hemodynamic instability is essential to optimizing patient care.

Conclusions

Postoperative complications of CABG surgery can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians must rapidly diagnose these conditions while evaluating for other diseases. Early surgical consultation is imperative, as is optimizing the patient's hemodynamics, including preload, heart rate, cardiac rhythm, contractility, and afterload.

### Blood consumption in total arterial coronary artery bypass grafting [^11776LY3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Surgical technique

Median sternotomy was performed in all patients. All IMAs were skeletonized from the subclavian artery to the bifurcation and either harvested as free conduits for composite grafting or used as in situ grafts. Double clipping was performed on the side branches and topical papaverine and intraluminal heparinized solution of Ringer's Lactate was applied for graft viability and spasm prophylaxis. SV grafts were harvested by an open method using double clipping. All procedures were performed on a conventional cardiopulmonary bypass using single aortic cross-clamping with cold blood cardioplegia. Moderate systemic hypothermia was induced. The grafting strategy and the use of total arterial or mixed CABG primarily depended on IMA graft quality and length. Several different graft configurations were used depending on the anatomy, configuration of coronary lesions, heart volume and total graft length needed.

For blood saving we used retrograde autologous priming on the cardiopulmonary bypass, reducing the standard priming volume to approximately 400 ml. Furthermore, the Cell Saver autotransfusion system was applied in redo-cases and in patients under dual antiplatelet therapy. Intraoperatively, all patients received tranexamic acid in a continuous scheme. Monofilament suture lines were used for all cannulation sites and all anastomoses. In all patients, CABG and the control of hemostasis was performed by the attending surgeon (A.K.) or under his supervision. No sealant at all was used for hemostasis and clipping was preferred for bleeding control whenever possible.

As recommended by the current clinical practice guidelines for blood transfusion, we followed a restrictive transfusion strategy perioperatively using a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dl in patients with a hemodynamically stable anemia. After cardiopulmonary bypass, indication for platelet transfusion was driven by clinical criteria such as substantial microvascular bleeding and/or excessive postoperative anemia in combination with a low platelet count < 50 × 10⁹ /l and/or antiplatelet therapy. Indication for FFP transfusion was given for correction of substantial microvascular bleeding, especially in the presence of coagulation factor deficiencies. The transfusion strategy was identical in all patients and did not depend on grafting strategy.

### Five-year hospital readmission after coronary artery bypass surgery and the association with off-pump surgery and sex [^116msPx1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Technical and procedural advances in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have contributed to a progressive improvement in postoperative morbidity and mortality. However, hospital readmission rates are still relatively high, ranging between 7% and 24% in the first postoperative month, and negatively affecting both patient well‐being and resource expenditure and use.

Previous reports have mainly focused on readmission as a hospital quality measure and, as such, were limited to early readmission within the first 30 or 90 days after surgery. Limited data exist on long‐term readmission, and even fewer data are available on the association between readmission and postoperative survival.

We, therefore, aimed to investigate follow‐up readmission after CABG and explore its association with patient and procedural characteristics. Specifically, we focused on on‐ versus off‐pump surgery and sex. We hypothesized a potential effect of off‐pump CABG on the risk of readmission and that women may be more likely to be readmitted compared with men, consistent with the growing evidence supporting disparities in outcomes between sexes after CABG. Finally, we hypothesized that follow‐up readmission would correlate to follow‐up mortality.

To test our hypotheses, we performed a post hoc analysis of the CORONARY (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting [CABG] Off or On Pump Revascularization) trial, leveraging the higher data quality and lower heterogeneity typically granted by data from randomized controlled trials.

### Self-reported physical activity and lung function two months after cardiac surgery – a prospective cohort study [^112ukTpd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients were selected from a previous randomized controlled trial by Westerdahl et al. including 313 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Örebro University Hospital and Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, between 2007 and 2011. The sample consisted of all patients who had answered a categorical question about physical activity (Table 1) both preoperatively and at two months after cardiac surgery (n = 283). Patients who had not answered the question postoperatively and were excluded (n = 30) did not differ compared to the remaining patients (n = 283), regarding age (p = 0.70), gender (p = 0.83), length of surgery (p = 0.27), or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (p = 0.62).

Table 1
A four-category scale for assessment of self-reported physical activity during the last month

The categorical question was answered preoperatively and two months after cardiac surgery.

All patients were scheduled for non-emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve surgery, or a combination of CABG and valve surgery. The patients underwent cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia, with or without cardiopulmonary bypass, using sternotomy as the surgical incision. All patients received the same pre- and postoperative care and treatment from nursing staff and physiotherapists in the cardiothoracic surgery ward during the hospital stay. This included general care, early mobilisation, analgesia, breathing exercises, and information about postoperative regimens.

Descriptive data (sex, age, weight, height, information on smoking, preoperative ejection fraction, and surgical data) were collected from medical records. Lung function and self-reported level of physical activity were assessed preoperatively and two months after surgery. Measurements of static and dynamic lung function were performed by experienced biomedical technicians at the Department of Physiology (Jaeger MasterScreen PFT/Bodybox, Intramedic AB, Bålsta, Sweden). The tests were performed according to the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society. The patients performed the tests in a sitting position, wearing a nose clip. The highest value of three correctly performed tests was registered. Vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), inspiratory capacity (IC), functional residual capacity (FRC), residual volume (RV), and total lung capacity (TLC) were assessed. Predicted values were related to age, gender, and height.

### Physiotherapy-supervised mobilization and exercise following cardiac surgery: a national questionnaire survey in Sweden [^116CX5t6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Many activities are discouraged after cardiac surgery, such as weight carrying and exercises involving the pectoralis major. Few studies have been published evaluating which activities and exercises negatively affect the sternal incision. The recommendation for how long after surgery the patients should avoid weight bearing and certain other activities, differs with a range of 7 to12 weeks. Likewise, how much weight patients are allowed to lift while the sternum is healing differs between 1 and 5 kg. It has been suggested that current activity guidelines for CABG patients are too restrictive; however, considering that postoperative sternal instability is a serious complication with increased risk of mortality, the importance of correct instructions for sternal precautions is essential, especially in risk patients. More scientific knowledge of risk factors and risk behaviours for sternum instability is needed. This would provide further possibilities to individualize the postoperative recommendations to the patients.

All physiotherapists in the present study considered physiotherapy necessary after cardiac surgery, although one-third considered the physiotherapy treatment offered not optimal. The main reason mentioned was lack of time.

A national Swedish guideline for physiotherapy treatment for patients undergoing major surgery is currently under development, but was not available during the study period. In spite of this, the physiotherapy management given in the different departments, by different physiotherapists, was fairly similar. An explanation for this may be the yearly national meetings for physiotherapists in the cardiovascular field. This survey provides information that may be useful in research as well as development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines in physiotherapy. It is also very important to widen this knowledge and formulate internationally accepted guidelines for cardiac surgery patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) perioperative management of oral P2Y12 inhibitors specifies interruption intervals and postoperative resumption. For clopidogrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 5 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For prasugrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 7 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 7 d may be reasonable. For ticagrelor, elective CABG: interrupt for 3–5 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For all patients, oral P2Y12 inhibitor should be resumed after surgery when bleeding risk not excessive (typically 24–72 hours).

### Relief of angina pectoris when carrying heavy loads with the left hand in a patient with previous coronary artery bypass graft operation who has severe exercise angina: a case report [^115ZAj2v]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with known coronary artery disease and/or a history of revascularization, angina pectoris or unstable coronary syndromes are usually attributed to the progression of atherosclerotic lesions rather than an unrecognized great vessel disease. However, for patients with a previous coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG), during which a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) conduit has been used, great vessel disease, especially subclavian artery stenosis should also be suspected. We present a case of a patient with a LIMA conduit who has angina pectoris on exertion, but interestingly the pain is relieved when he carries heavy loads with his left hand, which can be due to increased blood flow to the LIMA conduit during heavy lifting because of increased peripheral resistance.

### Retention of work capacity after coronary artery bypass grafting. A 10-year follow-up study [^111CqS4m]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this paper we present a model for estimating patients' possibilities to remain in work after CABG. We also report that 73% of men who returned to work postoperatively and were aged less than 60 years were still working 10 years later. The number of women was not large enough for scrutinized statistical comparison, but their continuation at work resembled that of men.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

To the best of our knowledge this study represents the longest follow-up of CABG patients' retention of work capacity. We analyzed data on all consecutive patients operated over a period of 18 months. Their urban and rural domiciles comprise more than 20% of the inhabitants of the country, thus well representing the Finnish population.

The study was commenced with a retrospective analysis of patient records. In addition, written patient questionnaires and telephone contacts were used. Follow-up data on pensioning and mortality were verified from national archives, which in Finland are particularly precise. Even after these measures some postoperative data, for instance in patient questionnaires, were missing.

Our study population was only 141 patients. In general, relevant long-term follow-up data on CABG patients' working status are somewhat difficult to obtain by reason of the relatively high age of the patients operated. Especially the female population was very small, and the interpretation of its postoperative work activity must be made very carefully. We therefore treated men and women as one group when forming the model. On the other hand, patients' uniformity in respect of age and burden of diseases made it easier to make significant calculations also from a fairly small material.

When building the model, possibly relevant parameters had first to be selected by univariate analysis. At this stage some, again, had to be left out owing to insufficiency of material. Some factors were not selected due to their low prevalence in the population studied. Of variables describing different aspects of the same feature, only the best was selected for the model.

The Bayesian approach in multivariate analysis was used in view of its ability to analyze partly incomplete material from questionnaires. In this study it also seemed to be more illustrative than logistic calculations based on an iterative process.

Methods

Material

The population of the W-CABG study has been described elsewhere. Briefly, CABG was undertaken for 960 patients in Tampere University Hospital during a period of 18 months. The subjects of the present study comprised 141 consecutive patients aged less than 60 who had undergone CABG and were working one year postoperatively.

Data collection

Study personnel checked hospital records after transfer to primary care. The follow-up checks were made with a detailed questionnaire on an average 21 months after the operation and 9.5 years after the operation. The reply percents were 89 and 83 of patients alive, respectively. Working status and other relevant information was obtained from all but two patients.

Employment status or date and reason for possible retirement were checked from the Finnish Centre for Pensions 10 years after the last operation. Possible death, its date and diagnosis were checked from the Statistical Office of Finland. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tampere University Hospital.

Statistical methods

Categorical variables were tested using chi-square test and Wilcoxon rank test (Return to work vs. pre-, peri- and immediate postoperative medical data, education, type of work, preoperative pensioning, patients' social situation and lifestyle elements such as exercise habits and smoking).

Bayesian analysis

A stepwise Bayesian approach was used in multivariate analysis to determine posterior probabilities and likelihood ratios and to ascertain the sensitivity and specificity of the rule. The model was calculated taking into account all patients under 60 and working one year after CABG.

Theory

The Bayesian approach states how posterior probability of diagnosis D given symptom × is calculated using the prior probability of diagnosis D and its absence. These show how common the diagnosis D and its absence are in the population. The probabilities of symptoms given the diagnosis and its absence are commonly estimated by their frequencies in learning material.

In the case of a two-valued outcome, the Bayesian approach is commonly developed to give a likelihood ratio (probability of × given diagnosis D divided by probability of × given absence of diagnosis D). The likelihood ratio (L) of a set of observed symptoms or properties xi is written as the product of the probability ratios of each xi, also known in epidemiology as risk ratios.

The posterior probability of a given set of observations is calculated by dividing the likelihood ratio by "one plus likelihood ratio". Percentage is obtained by multiplying by 100.

### Early results of coronary artery bypass grafting with coronary endarterectomy for severe coronary artery disease [^115cjes8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

In our department, coronary endarterectomy combined with CABG was performed in 104 cases in about four years. Indication for CE was handled restrictively. It was only performed on occluded, nearly occluded and/or calcified vessels with long-range stenoses, if regular anastomosis between graft and coronary artery seemed to be technically impossible. Decision to perform endarterectomies was therefore made intraoperatively, based on local findings on these patients with severe calcified atherosclerosis. The operations were performed by fully-trained staff cardiac surgeons. Although a surgical trainee participated in the operations, the critical portions were performed by experienced surgeons.

This severity of atherosclerosis that affects the coronary arteries and its fatal consequences may be demonstrated through following findings: in the majority of the cases, an event like stroke or myocardial infarction occurred before intervention. According to NYHA and CCS it is understandable that these patients were hardly able to handle daily life activities. This was not only revealed by the NYHA-/CCS-constellation or preoperative symptoms like vertigo, edema or syncopes but also by interviews and postal questionnaires. In 40% of the cases, CABG and CE were performed as an emergency procedure -one more clue for the progressed severity of this disease.

Our results also indicate an expected match among this heterogeneous group of patients: nearly all of them, except one woman, show a variegated mixture of cardiac risk factors (Figure 1), averaging more than three factors per patient.

Even today, in the era of wide spread information concerning health-prevention via different media, these disease-supporting avoidable factors are still present and imply a major difficulty in coping with the disease.

Operation time and therefore cardiopulmonary bypass- as well as aortic cross clamp time were longer comparing with other studies. This can be explained by several factors:

1. **Operation technique**: in most cases open technique was used based on surgeons' preferences. It offers free insight to local findings, exposing the whole arterial lumen and side branches containing atherosclerotic occlusive material and therefore guarantees the quality (which means avoiding an intima flap and therefore assure the same plane etc.) of the endarterectomy by avoiding residuals. On the other hand it takes more time to fulfil the long-range suture of the vessel.

### Intra-operative and post-operative management of conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting: a clinical consensus statement of the European Society of Cardiology working group on cardiovascular surgery and the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery coronary task force [^1149VXy6]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Graft patency is the mechanism for the sustained clinical benefits of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Continued patency of bypass grafts protects against spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) and reduces the need for repeat revascularization. In the largest individual participant data pooled analysis on graft failure to date [seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 4413 patients and 13 163 grafts], graft failure was strongly associated with non-fatal cardiac events, as well as mortality after CABG. Graft failure is a multifactorial process that involves acute thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia, inflammation, spasm, and atherosclerosis. Conduit harvesting techniques, intra-operative storage prior to reimplantation into the coronary circulation, and targeted pharmacotherapy therefore represent the key determinants to preserve the structural and functional integrity and, ultimately, the efficacy of CABG conduits. In this clinical consensus statement by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Working Group on Cardiovascular Surgery and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Coronary Task Force, we review the scientific evidence and provide best practice statements for the intra- and post-operative management of CABG conduits. We also highlight gaps in knowledge and future research directions.

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112nQdM8]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Aspirin monotherapy is currently recommended for patients with stable coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass graft surgery to reduce saphenous vein graft failure. In patients who present with acute coronary syndromes, dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended to be resumed soon after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, there is a lack of evidence that dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with a decrease in thromboembolic complications or mortality in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Few observational and randomised data suggest that additional drug intervention with dual antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of saphenous vein graft failure. This effect appears to be more pronounced in patients undergoing off pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery than on pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or for arterial graft recipients.

The 2016 American guidelinesrecommend that in patients with stable coronary artery disease, aspirin 81 mg (75–100 mg) plus clopidogrel (started early after surgery) for 12 months after coronary artery bypass graft might be reasonable to improve saphenous vein graft patency (class IIb, level of evidence B). Conversely, the 2017 European guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to generally recommend dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce saphenous vein graft failure. To mitigate the relative hypercoagulable state that off pump patients experience, the 2015 American Heart Association scientific statementrecommends the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel after off pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (class I, level of evidence A). However, the European guidelines state that there is weak evidence to support dual antiplatelet therapy in this subset of patients, and the American guidelinesdo not comment on this.

Population and baseline characteristics

The MIMIC III database contains records of 9243 patients undergoing isolated CABG due to CAD between 2001 and 2012. Patients were excluded if they were duplicated or unrecorded, or they had contraindications to either aspirin or clopidogrel, declined to be followed-up or were incarcerated. We also excluded the patients with metal valve or the presence of atrial fibrillation since anticoagulant therapy is necessary in this population. Moreover, we included patients that undergone emergent CABG, since this population usually is under-presented in registries and are more likely to receive DAPT. Therefore, in the end, a total of 3274 patients were included in this study. Of these, 72.8% (n = 2385) were treated with ASA alone postoperatively, and the rest (n = 889) were treated with ASA and clopidogrel. Moreover, 33.3% of the patients also received anticoagulant therapy after the surgery in the ASA (n = 794) and DAPT (n = 296) groups. Patients at high risk of thrombosis (e.g. ACS or coronary stenting within 30 days) who have had a minor/major bleeding event are advised to continue low-dose aspirin. Early reactivation of a second antiplatelet agent should be considered after bleeding control. The use of perioperative antiplatelet therapy was decided by individual surgeons. Clopidogrel should be stopped at least 5 days before surgery. There were no specific rules or restrictions from local authorities on selecting patients for post-CABG DAPT. Typically, aspirin 100 mg daily was started within 24 h (ideally within 6 h) after CABG and recommended to continue long-term. For DAPT, 75 mg clopidogrel daily was added to 100 mg aspirin without a loading dose, preferably within 48 h after CABG once clinical stability was ensured and chest tube output was < 30 mL/hour for at least 2 h. The duration of DAPT was determined by the treating physician, with a minimum of 1 month. Proton-pump inhibitors were recommended as a prophylactic therapy for gastrointestinal bleeding. Additional therapies like statins, beta-blockers, or renin-angiotensin system inhibitors were recommended for secondary prevention in suitable patients, following clinical guidelines. In summary, the choice of perioperative antiplatelet therapy was up to individual surgeons. Post-CABG, aspirin was started quickly and continued indefinitely. Clopidogrel could be added for DAPT after ensuring clinical stability, for a minimum of 1 month as decided by physicians. Other secondary prevention medicines were used as suitable per guidelines. The baseline characteristics of patients in the ASA and DAPT groups are presented in Table 1. Before matching, the two groups were balanced regarding most comorbidities, preoperative ASA and heparin use, and postoperative anticoagulant therapy which were determined by claimed prescriptions after surgery to reduce ischemic events. The DAPT group had a higher proportion of patients with peripheral artery disease, ACS, previous PCI or previous CABG history. Additionally, lower preoperative hemoglobin values and higher preoperative platelet counts were seen in the DAPT group. Following PSM, the 2 groups (n = 868) were balanced regarding all the baseline characteristics.

### Spontaneous avulsion of left internal mammary artery graft a complication of coronary artery bypass surgery: case report and review of the literature [^11139fjK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Avulsion of LIMA following CABG surgery is considered a rare but life threating complication with high mortality rate. Avulsion can complicate both minimal invasive and conventional CABG. According to a PubMed search this complication has been reported in the literature on eight occasions: five cases following minimal invasive CABG and three cases post-conventional CABG.

The first case of LIMA avulsion following minimal invasive CABG was reported by McMahonet al. in 1997 in a 58-year-old male patient on the fifth post-operative day while lifting a heavy object, and was successfully managed with re-exploration. Since then, avulsion of LIMA has been reported in additional three cases.

Regarding conventional CABG, avulsion has been firstly reported by Morrittet al. 11 in 2004 in 65-year-old patient four hours following surgery. Re-exploration showed non-anastomotic avulsion of the LIMA graft two centimeters proximal to the anastomotic site at the site of the clipped side branch. Later, tow more case of LIMA avulsion post-conventional CABG were reported in which the avulsion occurred at the site of anastomosis of LIMA to LAD.

The etiology of the avulsion is usually multifactorial, however after reviewing all the reported cases in the literature it is well established that the most important factor for avulsion in both conventional and minimal invasive CABG is inadequate length of LIMA at the time of the harvest, making it vulnerable for avulsion with the development of any shear force. Thus, ensuring adequate length of the conduit at the time of harvest and utilizing meticulous techniques are crucial in preventing such a fatal complication.

Interaction of the artery with the edge of the pericardium, inadequate side branch clipping, and adhesion of the conduit to the surrounding anatomical structures such as the chest wall, mediastinum, or lung, make it susceptible to excessive traction, and have been named as other possible causes for avulsion. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hyperventilation, coughing, sneezing, blunt trauma, and weightlifting have also been considered as possible risk factors for avulsion in what may be assumed as a vulnerable conduit.

### CTA in roadmapping post-CABG evaluation [^116MCjNX]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Although coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) outcomes are typically highly successful, outpatient evaluation of bypass grafts is an important step. Moreover, the return of myocardial ischemia and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events after bypass is not uncommon. Whether due to failure of prior bypass grafts or progression of underlying arteriosclerosis in native coronaries, regularly evaluating if a patient requires intervention (and assessing graft patency vs. closure) is essential. Imaging via cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) offers a gold standard anatomical map to facilitate efficiency and accuracy in later invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or surgical re-CABG intervention. This review discusses the utility of CTA as a safe pre and post CABG evaluation tool, in guiding outpatient evaluation of graft patency and roadmapping subsequent reintervention if needed. We seek to ameliorate clinical uncertainties and synthesize growing amounts of research, to help encourage a homogenous approach to post-CABG evaluation. This comprehensive review paper introduces the indications for bypass grafting surgery and transcatheter PCI approaches, details techniques and strategies for bypass surgery, discusses CTA in evaluating post-CABG graft patency, and consolidates research surrounding pre-reintervention CTA in post-CABG patients. Last, this review explores future directions in standardizing post-CABG evaluation guidelines.

### Appropriate coronary artery bypass grafting use in the percutaneous coronary intervention era: are we finally making progress? [^114Kyi5E]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Appropriate use criteria integrate guidelines, clinical trial evidence, and expert opinion in order to determine the most appropriate care for a range of distinct clinical scenarios. Inappropriate use estimates cannot be neglected. Approximately 12%-14% of all percutaneous coronary interventions and 1%-2% of all coronary artery bypass grafting procedures in patients with stable angina are deemed inappropriate. Several reasons for this difference are identified. Continuous improvement of the criteria, multidisciplinary discussions, and the correct financial incentives will be essential in reducing the number of inappropriate procedures, improve patient outcomes, and contain costs.

Results

Study population

The study population comprised 141 CABG patients, 12 women and 129 men who were working one year postoperatively. Their demographic data and work classification are shown in Table 1. Clinical characteristics and severity of coronary heart disease are compiled in Table 2. Besides CABG an aortic valve replacement was carried out for one patient (male, age 52 years). Four patients had been pensioned before the operation and returned to work after CABG, 137 had been preoperatively at most on short-term sick pay.

Continuation at work after CABG

The yearly employment status (full-time or part-time work) gradually decreased in men from 100% to 85% (n = 95) in five years. Correspondingly, it was 73% (n = 49) ten years postoperatively. The results for women were affected by their small number (n = 7 five years and n = 3 ten years postoperatively) (Figure 1). Altogether 76% of patients aged < 60 years were still working 10 years after CABG.

All 141 patients were younger than 60 one year after CABG. Twenty-six of them (17%) retired on disability pension before the age of 60, the main reason being cardiac condition in 16 cases. Ten patients retired for other reasons (stroke, pulmonary embolism, psychiatric and musculoskeletal disorders). During the follow-up, a total of 15 CABG patients retired to adjusted old-age pension at the age of 57–60 mainly for non-medical reasons. Half of them retired 1 to 2 years after CABG.

Proposed Pregnancy Lifting Guidelines How much can a healthy pregnant worker lift at work. NIOSH is working to address this question and has proposed clinical guidelines with provisional recommended weight limits. NIOSH expects that most pregnant workers with uncomplicated pregnancies would be able to perform lifts at those limits without increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal health consequences. The proposed guidelines should be useful to occupational health practitioners in the evaluation and redesign of lifting tasks and to clinicians in advising patients about manual lifting restrictions at work. The infographic below summarizes the guidelines. For a full-size version of the infographic click here. A Spanish version of the infographic is also available. For more information see the journal articles Provisional recommended weight limits for manual lifting during pregnancy and Clinical guidelines for occupational lifting in pregnancy.

Ergonomics Women generally have more work-related cases of musculoskeletal disorders than men. More research is needed to understand why but the higher rate of these disorders among women could be related to job differences or physical differences between men and women. Additionally, women are more likely than men to do contingent, part-time, temporary, or contract work. Compared to workers in traditional job arrangements, contingent workers have lower incomes and fewer benefits. Women who work in insecure jobs may fear that bringing up a safety issue could result in job loss or more difficult work situations. They may also be less likely to report a work-related injury. Personal Protective Equipment Women may face health and safety risks because personal protective equipment and clothing are often designed for average-sized men.

The protective function of respirators, work gloves, work boots, and other protective equipment may be reduced when they do not fit properly.

### A novel endothelial damage inhibitor for the treatment of vascular conduits in coronary artery bypass grafting: protocol and rationale for the European, multicentre, prospective, observational duraGraft registry [^114uFSjF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical revascularisation represents the gold standard for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. However, besides the left internal mammary artery being the established graft for the left anterior descending (LAD) territory, the debate about conduit selection for the other coronary territories is ongoing. Especially for younger patients, multi- or even total arterial grafting strategies are recommended, and recent data indicate a significant long-term benefit when using multiple arterial grafts (ie, right internal mammary artery or radial artery). To increase the use of multiple arterial grafts, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons recently published the 'First Clinical Practice Guidelines on Arterial Conduits. Despite the current effort on multiarterial grafting, the adoption rate of multiple arterial conduits in daily clinical practice is rather slow and is still below 10% due to the technical complexity added to the CABG procedure. Instead, saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) remain the most common conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting (CAGB) procedures. In most cases, SVG conduits are readily available and easy to harvest, which is particularly beneficial in urgent or emergency cases with ongoing ischaemia. Moreover, SVGs are considered to be more resistant to manipulation during harvest and anastomosis, and appear less susceptible to vasospasm. However, compared with arterial conduits, the long-term patency of SVGs due to vein graft disease (VGD) and consecutive failure remains a major issue, substantially impairing long-term clinical outcomes. One-year failure rates range from 15 to 29%, with at least one graft occluded graft at 12–18 months, and up to 40–50% of failed SVGs at 10 years post CABG. Besides general factors such as the overall progress of a patient's coronary artery disease, the quality of the anastomosis and the target vessel, and postoperative preventive strategies, long-term patency strongly depends on the overall quality of the SVG conduit itself. Importantly, damage to the fragile SVG endothelium appears to be a key promotor for the development and progress of VGD, stenosis, and complete failure. Therefore, to best possibly protect the SVG endothelium, several intraoperative considerations are mandatory. These include state-of-the-art graft harvesting techniques to reduce traumatic injury (ie, no or less-touch techniques), avoidance of graft distension or over-pressurisation (ie, when assessing for potential leakages), and, importantly, effective intraoperative storage and preservation to reduce ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI) of the graft endothelium between harvest and until completion of anastomosis.

### Incentive spirometry for preventing pulmonary complications after coronary artery bypass graft [^114AC3ZY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), the main causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality are postoperative pulmonary complications, respiratory dysfunction and arterial hypoxemia. Incentive spirometry is a treatment technique that uses a mechanical device (an incentive spirometer) to reduce such pulmonary complications during postoperative care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of incentive spirometry for preventing postoperative pulmonary complications in adults undergoing CABG.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (1980 to December 2004), LILACS (1982 to December 2004), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (1980 to December 2004), Allied & Complementary Medicine (AMED) (1985 to December 2004), CINAHL (1982 to December 2004), and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (1994 to December 2004). References were checked and authors contacted. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing incentive spirometry with any type of prophylactic physiotherapy for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in adults undergoing CABG.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently evaluated the quality of trials using the guidelines of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook and extracted data from included trials.

Main Results

Four trials with 443 participants contributed to this review. There was no significant difference in pulmonary complications (atelectasis and pneumonia) between treatment with incentive spirometry and treatment with positive pressure breathing techniques (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB)) or preoperative patient education. Patients treated with incentive spirometry had worse pulmonary function and arterial oxygenation compared with positive pressure breathing (CPAP, BiPAP, IPPB).

Authors' Conclusions

Individual small trials suggest that there is no evidence of benefit from incentive spirometry in reducing pulmonary complications and in decreasing the negative effects on pulmonary function in patients undergoing CABG. In view of the modest number of patients studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine those patients who may derive benefit from incentive spirometry following CABG.

After acute coronary syndrome (ACS), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the standard of care for both invasive management with percutaneous intervention and noninvasive (medical) management. Conversely, studies using dual antiplatelet in the population of patients presenting with ACS who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are conflicting. The appropriate antiplatelet regimen after CABG remains an area of controversy. Plaque stability, prevention of graft closure, and secondary thrombosis form the basis for using a second antiplatelet drug, whereas the additional risk of bleeding and lack of conclusive evidence should also be considered. After an extensive literature search, 12 clinical trials with efficacy outcomes were identified. Most of the studies are retrospective, nonrandomized single-center trials. A few large patient populations have been examined using database information. To date, there is only 1 prospective, multicenter, randomized trial published. Recommendations from national guidelines differ, proposing single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or DAPT with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. The purpose of this report is to review the available clinical trial data and provide guidance to practitioners when caring for this patient population. In conclusion, there is no clear consensus regarding the use of DAPT in patients after CABG. If not contraindicated, it is reasonable to use DAPT, starting in the postoperative period, in patients presenting with ACS. Large, multicenter, randomized clinical trials are needed to definitively investigate the role of DAPT in patients with ACS after CABG.

Transfusion triggers — TRACS and valve/CABG threshold trials — the TRACS trial in Brazil randomized 502 cardiac surgery patients to restrictive (hematocrit 24%) versus liberal (hematocrit 30%) strategies in the operating room and ICU; the liberal group received more transfusions (78% vs 47%), with no difference in the primary composite end point at 30 days and a P value of 0.93 for the 1% absolute mortality difference (6% liberal vs 5% restrictive). Another study randomized 722 adults undergoing valve or CABG to restrictive (24% hematocrit) versus liberal (28% hematocrit) thresholds, reducing allogeneic transfusion to 54% vs 75% (P < .001).

### Outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease who were recommended for but declined coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^111GJx5J]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients who underwent PCI were categorized into 3 distinct groups: (a) patients with multivessel disease recommended for PCI as per American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2012 appropriate use criteria recommendations (PCI‐recommended); (b) patients eligible and recommended for CABG who refused surgery despite Heart Team recommendation (CABG‐refusal); and (c) patients deemed ineligible for CABG by the heart team (CABG‐ineligible).

In general, patients without disqualifying clinical comorbidities or frailty were recommended for CABG if "surgical anatomy" was present, defined as 2‐vessel or 3‐vessel CAD with diabetes and proximal left anterior descending artery involvement, 3‐vessel CAD with SYNTAX‐I score > 22, or unprotected left main disease with SYNTAX‐I score > 32. PCI‐recommended criteria reflected societal guidelines criteria class I, IIa, and IIb recommendations in patients with multivessel or left main CAD as summarized in Table S1. These generally correlate with 2012 AUC criteria "appropriate" (generally acceptable and reasonable) or "uncertain" (may be acceptable and reasonable). Patients with prior CABG were included in the PCI‐recommended cohort given the equipoise in guidelines with regard to outcomes with PCI or repeat CABG in these patients. Patients in the PCI‐recommended cohort usually underwent ad hoc PCI following diagnostic catheterization if previous patient consent was achieved after general discussion of revascularization alternatives with the heart team. The CABG‐refusal group consisted of patients who declined surgical revascularization despite heart team recommendation and instead elected for multivessel PCI. Patient refusal of CABG was expressly documented in the hospital chart before PCI in all cases. The CABG‐ineligible group was composed of patients who underwent surgical consultation and were not considered suitable for CABG. Documented reasons for CABG ineligibility were further categorized according to a previously published taxonomy.

Data Collection

Clinical, laboratory, and angiographic findings were prospectively entered into standardized forms during the index hospitalization for the PCI. The SYNTAX‐I score was also calculated in all patients undergoing cardiac catheterization by the interventional cardiologist. PCI was performed according to standard techniques, and stent choice was per operator preference. Likewise, dual antiplatelet therapy choice and duration were based on treating physician preference. Patients were followed by clinic visit or telephone interviews by experienced research personnel including medical records review of recurrent hospitalizations up to 1 year after PCI. The study was approved by the institutional review board at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, and informed consent was obtained from all patients for anonymized data collection.

### Operative techniques in awake coronary artery bypass grafting [^114M6GBg]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting was implemented to reduce trauma of surgical coronary revascularization by avoiding extracorporeal circulation. High thoracic epidural anesthesia further reduces intraoperative stress and postoperative pain. In addition, this technique even allows awake coronary artery bypass grafting, avoiding the drawbacks of mechanical ventilation and general anesthesia in high-risk patients.

Methods

Thirty-four patients underwent awake coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending coronary artery by partial lower ministernotomy (n = 20), H-graft technique (n = 2), or rib cage-lifting technique (n = 2). In 9 cases we performed double bypass grafting, and in 1 case we performed triple-vessel coronary artery revascularization through complete median sternotomy. In addition to clinical outcomes, visual analog scale pain scores were recorded on days 1, 2, and 3 after surgery.

Results

Thirty-one patients remained awake throughout the whole procedure. Three patients required secondary intubation because of incomplete analgesia (n = 1) or pneumothorax (n = 2). Procedure time was 90 ± 31 minutes, and recovery room stay was 4.2 ± 0.6 hours. There were no in-hospital deaths or serious postoperative complications. In 1 case a graft occlusion was documented on predischarge angiography. Early postoperative pain was low (visual analog scale score of 30 ± 6).

Conclusion

These data demonstrate the feasibility and safety of various surgical coronary revascularization techniques without general anesthesia. Continuation of thoracic epidural analgesia provides good pain control and fast mobilization postoperatively. Surprisingly, the awake coronary artery bypass grafting procedure was well accepted by the patients.

### Diclofenac [^114Z6YB2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of diclofenac in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.

### Gender-specific practice guidelines for coronary artery bypass surgery: perioperative management [^116CpPjQ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Gender differences in coronary bypass surgery have been the focus of numerous publications in recent years. Unfortunately these publications have contradictions that leave surgeons with conflicting recommendations for care. To help resolve these inconsistencies, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Workforce on Evidence-Based Surgery has carried out an objective review of published information in this field. The STS Workforce recognizes that there are important gender issues associated with referral bias, the impact of body size, psychosocial factors, and postoperative support, but the intent of this guideline is to focus specifically on perioperative management. As with all practice guidelines, our goal is to gather the most important information, analyze the information in a logical and unbiased fashion, and make recommendations based solely on the available evidence.

### Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting is the future: pro [^113WFyyM]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains one of the most commonly performed operations worldwide. However, most CABG operations performed today are as invasive -apart from saphenous vein harvesting- as they were 50 years ago. While heart valve operations have become less invasive, CABG faces formidable challenges in doing so. Valve surgery requires a single surgical exposure to the valve intervened on, but less invasive CABG necessitates multiple surgical exposures to harvest internal thoracic artery conduits, source their inflow plus that of other grafts, and expose each coronary target to be grafted -including anterior, lateral, posterior, and inferior vessels. In this article, we rationalize why we believe that conventional CABG remains unduly invasive, associated with morbidity and prolonged recovery, and why less invasive CABG in its many forms, which we describe, represents a safe, practical, diffusible, and less invasive alternative to sternotomy CABG. Centers of excellence in coronary artery surgery should dedicate resources and expertise to developing high-quality, safe, durable, and advanced forms of lesser invasive CABG.

### Revascularisation versus medical treatment in patients with stable coronary artery disease: network meta-analysis [^112w1byY]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Model fit, heterogeneity between trials, and consistency of the network

Model fit was adequate (see supplementary table 8) and heterogeneity between trials low for all outcomes (range of τ² across outcomes 0.003 to 0.047; supplementary table 9). There was no evidence of inconsistency for the primary outcome of overall mortality (P for inconsistency = 0.98), and 95% credibility intervals of all loop specific inconsistency factors overlapped the null (see supplementary figure 3). For the composite of death or myocardial infarction, 95% credibility intervals of two correlated loops, both involving coronary artery bypass grafting, did not cross the null, but the overall test for inconsistency was negative (P for inconsistency = 0.27). For myocardial infarction, 95% credibility intervals of three loops did not overlap the null, two involving coronary artery bypass grafting, and the overall test for inconsistency was positive (P for inconsistency = 0.015). For revascularisation, 95% credibility intervals of four loops did not overlap the null, three involving coronary artery bypass grafting, again with a positive overall test for inconsistency (P for inconsistency < 0.001). After restriction to contemporary trials, model fit remained adequate (see supplementary table 8) and heterogeneity between trials low for all outcomes (see supplementary table 9). Signals of inconsistency completely disappeared for myocardial infarction but persisted for revascularisation (see supplementary figure 4). Likely sources of inconsistency in the analysis of myocardial infarction were the 12 coronary artery bypass grafting trials initiated before 1999, which yielded a pooled rate ratio of 0.99 compared with medical treatment, balloon angioplasty or bare metal stent (95% credibility interval 0.81 to 1.20, τ² = 0.050) compared with the six contemporary coronary artery bypass grafting trials, which yielded a pooled ratio of 0.49 compared with medical treatment or early generation drug eluting stents (0.40 to 0.60, τ² = 0.000). The overall test for inconsistency became negative after exclusion of five coronary artery bypass grafting trials, which showed increases in the risk of myocardial infarction associated with coronary artery bypass grafting between 34% and 133% (see supplementary figure 5). Likely sources of inconsistency in the analysis of subsequent revascularisation were the FREEDOM and CARDia trials, which showed that the probability of subsequent revascularisation was reduced approximately three and six times with coronary artery bypass grafting compared with early generation drug eluting stents in people with diabetes, and the RESOLUTE China trial, which showed a fourfold reduction in subsequent revascularisations with the zotarolimus eluting (Resolute) stent compared with early generation drug eluting stents. The overall test for inconsistency remained positive after exclusion of these trials in the overall analysis but became negative in the analysis of contemporary trials (see supplementary figure 5), which showed only one inconsistent loop. Supplementary table 10 shows that estimates after exclusion of likely sources of inconsistency were similar to estimates from main analyses.

### Etodolac [^115iBS3t]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two-large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of etodolac in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If etodolac is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

Hypertension

NSAIDs, including etodolac, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including etodolac, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Postdischarge management after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in heart failure (HF) — The importance of adhering to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), secondary prevention, and cardiac rehabilitation cannot be overemphasized, and close follow-up is recommended for titration of HF medications and assessment for additional interventions, including device implantation (eg, ICD/CRT) or advanced HF surgical therapies. A vulnerable period typically defined as 90 days postdischarge is associated with a several-fold increase in HF-associated rehospitalization and mortality; thus, post-CABG patients with HF should undergo close clinical monitoring and follow-up, and early (7–14 days) postdischarge follow-up to review volume status and titrate guideline-directed medications may be warranted and is associated with better short-term outcomes. Post hoc analyses reveal that the best long-term outcomes are achieved by patients who are maintained on optimal medical therapy.

Outcomes and endpoints

The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularisation). Secondary outcomes included an extended major adverse cardiovascular events outcome (a composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularisation, and hospital admission for unstable angina) and a restricted major adverse cardiovascular events outcome (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), as well as their individual components. All outcomes were measured at the time to first occurrence from randomisation to last visit. Detailed outcome definitions are provided in the supplementary appendix.

The safety outcome, analysed post hoc, was major bleedings events based on the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk criteria (combination of coronary artery bypass grafting related bleeding and non-coronary artery bypass grafting related major bleeding, such as intracranial bleeding, clinically overt signs of haemorrhage with haemoglobin drop ≥ 5 g/dL, and fatal bleeding). The secondary safety outcome was serious adverse events resulting in hospital admission or emergency department visits. We added net adverse clinical events, a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events and major bleeding events, as a post hoc outcome.

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114YJP37]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is the preferred treatment for many patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. However, patients undergoing this procedure remain at risk of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events, mainly caused by associated progression of native coronary artery disease, vascular damage, or saphenous vein graft failure. Previous studies have shown rates of saphenous vein graft failure of up to 30–40% in the first yearand up to 70% beyond 10 years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Despite its relatively high early failure rates, saphenous vein graft remains the most commonly used graft in contemporary coronary artery bypass graft trials.

Aspirin is considered the preferred antiplatelet drug to prevent saphenous vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass graft (class I, level of evidence A). Updated meta-analyses support this recommendation, but at a cost of increasing the risk of bleeding. Uncertainty remains about the benefits of adding a P2Y12 inhibitor or oral anticoagulant to aspirin monotherapy. There is emerging evidence on the potential benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but these combinations have not been directly compared with other antithrombotic therapies in randomised controlled trials. Additionally, no studies have been published to compare the effects of all available oral antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelets and anticoagulants) for the prevention of saphenous vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass graft surgery within a single analytical framework. Therefore, in this study we aimed to systematically review randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of oral antithrombotic drugs to prevent saphenous vein graft failure in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We also evaluated the comparative efficacy and harms of these drugs by using a network meta-analysis.

### Impact of coronary angiography early after CABG for suspected postoperative myocardial ischemia [^111cF5Yc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Coronary bypass surgery is fundamental in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Its indication is mainly based on findings during coronary angiography and well defined by national and international guidelines. On contrast, the diagnosis of post−/perioperative myocardial ischemia is grounded on elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK), CK-MB or cardiac troponin I (cTNI) levels, and the elevation of these serum markers within the first 24 h are associated with increased intermediate- and long-term mortality. However, there are neither uniform recommendations with regard what to enzymes to analyze nor cut-off levels indicating a need for further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Likewise, discussion is controversial whether cTNI or CK-MB is more useful to identify perioperative myocardial infarction. Yet, repeat coronary angiography remains the gold standard to evaluate postoperative myocardial ischemia, its indication has been recently proposed in a algorithm of the ESC Joint Working Groups on Cardiovascular Surgery and the Cellular Biology of the Heart position paper. It allows to judge patency of bypass grafts or the presence of untreated native coronary vessels as there is a substantial overlap with patients without graft occlusion, meaning that the patency status in the individual cannot be reliably predicted from these noninvasive tests. Nevertheless, the usefulness of repeat angiography is still under debate as it not only augments costs of treatment and may prolong hospital stay, especially if no further consequences are drawn, but also exposes the patient to an additional risk. According to the German Society of Cardiology the mortality for coronary angiography is 0.4–0.7% if no coronary artery disease is present, and 3.7% in patients with acute coronary syndrome (Press release German Society of Cardiology 10/2014).

### Minimally invasive cardiac surgery defined… [^114mar65]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Excellent long-term results are achieved with conventional CABG employing cardiopulmonary bypass and sternotomy. Beating-heart CABG requires temporary interruption of coronary blood flow to achieve a bloodless operative field. Most surgeons employ a vessel snare proximal to the arteriotomy, with or without a second snare placed distally. Interruption of coronary blood flow, however, may cause myocardial ischemia, infarction, or arrhythmia. Anecdotal reports highlight the feasibility of this hybrid approach in selected high-risk patients with multivessel disease. 21 Currently, the minimally invasive approach of choice that best achieves the objective of complete revascularization while preserving ideal anastomotic conditions entails CABG through a ministernotomy or limited left anterior thoracotomy with CPB on the arrested heart.

Based on the major complications and cost surrounding the use of CPB, significant interest has focused on approaches to perform CABG on the beating heart. The primary complications of CPB — adverse neurological events, the systemic inflammatory response, postoperative bleeding, and pulmonary dysfunction — were described earlier. Although CABG on the beating heart to avert cerebral microemboli in patients with severe proximal aortic atherosclerosis is an accepted indication, well-designed studies that demonstrate a significant decrease in adverse neurological events in patients without severe aortic disease currently are not available. Importantly, these findings correlated with less pulmonary dysfunction and postoperative bleeding in the beating-heart group. 22 Indeed, beating-heart CABG has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusions.

12, 17 Finally, the effect of avoiding CPB on relative hospital costs was examined by Fonger et al, 23 who compared 25 patients who underwent beating-heart LITA to LAD anastomosis with 25 patients who underwent conventional CABG. In contrast to the conventional approach, the cost of supplies and total cost for beating-heart CABG were decreased by 65% and 45%, respectively. Magovern et al17 also documented savings in overall cost, primarily in higher-risk patients. Thus, although the avoidance of CPB seems to reduce the elaboration of inflammatory mediators and may reduce the incidence of adverse neurological events, clinical correlates of reduced postoperative bleeding, pulmonary dysfunction, and stroke await the outcome of appropriately designed randomized controlled trials.

European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Current clinical practice is to continue antiplatelet therapy life-long after CABG, but evidence in support of a clinical benefit is limited. There is in fact little evidence to support a clinical benefit, as opposed to a graft patency benefit, from aspirin use after CABG. Most studies showed no effect on mortality, or even a trend to excess mortality, but they were underpowered for small to moderate differences in clinical outcomes and, in particular, in mortality. However, a pooled analysis of 7 contemporary RCTs with systematic graft imaging (4413 patients, 13 163 grafts) showed that graft failure is strongly associated with adverse cardiac events (adjusted OR 3.98, 95% CI 3.54–4.47, P < .001) and mortality after CABG (adjusted OR 2.79, 95% CI 2.01–3.89, P < .001), indirectly supporting a potential clinical benefit of aspirin. On the other hand, 1 trial randomized 213 patients 1 year after CABG to continue aspirin 325 mg/day or switch to placebo for the following 2 years and found no difference in the rate of graft occlusion, MI, or death (although the trial was not formally powered and the described power limitations apply).

With increased emphasis on minimally invasive surgical approaches, ERAS, prehabilitation, and same-day surgery, some of the most common questions gynecologic surgeons hear from patients center around resumption of exercise and physical activity and return to work. Given the lack of clear evidence-based recommendations, most surgeons rely on anecdotal instructions passed down from prior surgeons. A recent survey study demonstrated that most gynecologic surgeons placed some restrictions on how much patients could lift after surgery, and 60% recommended that women continue lifting restrictions for at least 6 weeks after a minimally invasive laparoscopic hysterectomy. Half of participants recommended a 10-lb weight restriction; for perspective, a gallon of milk weighs nearly 10 lb (8.6 lb), as do many women's bags. This contrasts with many public health websites that answer common recovery questions for women after a hysterectomy. For example, the Illinois Department of Public Health notes that patients can go back to normal activity within 1–2 weeks after a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy. It also obviates many of the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, including earlier return to work and normal activities. Our lack of consensus on postoperative physical activity is a potential source of confusion and deterrent for women contemplating a quality of life–enhancing procedure.

Risks and benefits of preoperative exposure to antiplatelet therapy

Benefits of preoperative aspirin

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) is recommended as secondary prevention therapy for all patients with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) and without contraindications. Its indication is even stronger for post-CABG patients (recommendation IA). The general consensus is that ASA treatment withdrawal has ominous prognostic implications in patients with CAD, especially in those with intracoronary stents, and should be advocated only when the bleeding risk clearly outweighs that of atherothrombotic events.

The benefits of continuing ASA until the day of CABG ('preoperative ASA') are less clear and may explain the wide variability in the management of ASA therapy in the perioperative period and differences between guidelines endorsed by different professional and scientific societies. This was based on the demonstration that ASA started the day before surgery was no more effective than ASA started 6 h after surgery at improving early (7- to 10-day) graft patency, but was associated with increased bleeding complications. More recent evidence suggests, however, that ASA use within 5–7 days prior to CABG halves mortality without significant increase in haemorrhage, blood product requirements, or related morbiditiesand reduces late infarction and repeat revascularization. Retrospective data show consistent benefit of preoperative aspirin within 5 days of surgery, including a reduction in cerebrovascular events and 30-day mortality.

Risks of preoperative aspirin

Evidence that preoperative ASA increases the risk of transfusion, re-exploration rate, and chest tube drainage was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the late 80s when blood conservation and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) techniques were very different, such as little off-pump CABG surgery and higher aspirin ASA dosage. More recent analysis still suggests an increase in blood loss and more frequent use of blood products in patients exposed to ASA within 7 days of surgery. However, the underpowered nature of subanalyses precludes any strong recommendation on the time delay from ASA discontinuation to CABG in those at high risk of bleeding. Aspirin interruption 3 days prior to CABG may be considered in patients at very high risk for bleeding after individualized assessment or in patients who refuse blood transfusions(Table 1).

Managing the patient with suspected graft-related failure

The incidence of early graft failure is ∼3%, and the rate of graft occlusion before discharge varies from 3 to 12% for vein grafts (3 to 4% for radial arteries and 1 to 2.5% for internal mammary arteries). It is often difficult to distinguish graft-related from non-graft-related PMI and Type 5 MI, and surgeons rely on elevations in cardiac biomarkers, unexplained low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), persistent ischaemic ECG changes, recurrent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, and new echocardiographic RWMAs to detect graft failure following CABG surgery. A variety of patient symptoms and objective findings should raise suspicion of regional ischaemia due to early graft failure, and trigger prompt evaluation with an ECG, measurement of cardiac biomarkers, coronary angiography or other appropriate cardiac imaging. These include the presence of typical or atypical chest pain, unexplained shortness of breath, haemodynamic instability as well as difficulty in weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass, refractory arrhythmia or persistent circulatory failure. Unfortunately, all of the above can be present following CABG surgery, even in the absence of regional ischaemia, hence none of these findings are sensitive or specific enough in isolation to accurately identify the presence of regional ischaemia, and so the appropriate diagnostic or management pathway should be determined in each patient taking the whole clinical picture in consideration. Equally, regional ischaemia may be present even in the absence of the above findings. The assessment of regional ischaemia following CABG surgery remains a considerable challenge for managing PMI and Type 5 MI.

The main cause of early graft failure post CABG surgery is graft occlusion but other causes include graft kinking and anastomotic stenosis. A graft-related cause is identified in 60–80% of coronary angiograms performed for this indication, and consecutive re-revascularisation is performed in 50–70% of graft-related Type 5 MI. However, in one study, 24–35% of patients undergoing coronary angiography after CABG for early graft dysfunction had patent grafts. One retrospective series found that an urgent post-CABG coronary angiogram was required in 1.8% patients, and more than half of these patients needed re-intervention, and, in spite of this, had high mortality. In multi-variate analysis, younger patients, female patients, smaller patients, and patients receiving a combined arterial and venous revascularisation were at a higher risk for an unplanned post-surgical coronary angiogram.

### Additional right-sided upper "Half-mini-thoracotomy" for aortocoronary bypass grafting during minimally invasive multivessel revascularization [^1161fBMZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (MICS-CABG) has been shown to result in excellent clinical outcomes overall adoption rates still remain low. Traditional strategies for minimally invasive multivessel revascularization - usually performed through single-thoracotomy – have to deal with restricted grafting possibilities and possible increased susceptibility of arterial grafts to competitive flow, restraining their applicability to very specific indications or hybrid approaches and on top, are prone to conversion to full-sternotomy in case of left internal thoracic artery (LITA) insufficiency.

Methods

Here, we present a novel alternative to the traditional MICS-CABG approaches by adding a right-sided upper "half-mini-thoracotomy", which allows for aortocoronary bypass grafting in standard "off-pump" manner and adoption of similar revascularization principles as with conventional CABG during minimally invasive multivessel revascularization, though reducing restrictions inherent to current MICS-CABG strategies.

Results

So far, feasibility and safety of this new approach has been successfully shown in 7 consecutive patients requiring surgical revascularization with no procedure-specific complications and graft configuration as well as intraoperative flow assessment comparable to those of similar patients operated via standard full-sternotomy off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery.

Conclusions

Further evaluation warranted, this technique might have the potential to develop into an additional approach for minimally invasive multivessel revascularization, especially in cases where competitive flow to arterial grafts is feared, while also serving as a bailout-strategy for traditional approaches in case of LITA insufficiency.

European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Preserving the structural and functional integrity of the conduit during graft harvesting and storage, prevention and treatment of vasospasm, and attenuating atherogenesis are integral to graft patency and the clinical benefits of CABG. The best practice clinical consensus statements outlined in this document provide a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to the intra-operative and post-operative management of conduits for CABG surgery. These strategies can serve as a valuable resource for multidisciplinary heart teams, facilitating more informed and effective treatment planning tailored to individual patient needs and local practices.

Lifestyle modification and cardiac risk factor reduction Post-PCI

Lifestyle modification and cardiac risk factor reduction post-PCI should include promotion of smoking cessation, regular physical activity, and a healthy diet, as well as blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, lipid, and weight management. Smoking cessation therapies should be prescribed by cardiologists and initiated in hospital, as opposed to postdischarge at outpatient rehabilitation or smoking cessation clinics (however, referral to these clinics should still be made). Smoking cessation therapies with proven efficacy in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) include varenicline, bupropion (stable CVD only), combination pharmacotherapies and nicotine replacement therapies (eg, varenicline + nicotine replacement therapy), individual and telephone counseling, and combination behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions) Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends intervention for smoking cessation during hospitalization using a combination of behavioral interventions plus pharmacotherapy, with supportive follow-up for at least 1 month postdischarge.

General recommendations on the timeline to return to regular physical activity post-PCI are after 1 to 2 weeks for patients without myocardial infarction (MI) and after 6 weeks for patients with MI, with heavy lifting and strain on the access site avoided for 2 to 3 days post-PCI. However, there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines in this area. Cardiac rehabilitation can assist with gradual return to exercise. Return to sexual activity can take place several days after PCI provided revascularization was complete and there are no access site complications. Once return to regular activity is possible, all patients should be counseled to attain a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week (a minimum of 30 minutes/day for a minimum of 5 days/week) or a minimum of 75 minutes of high-intensity activity per week, if they are physically capable of doing so. At least 2 days of resistance training per week is additionally recommended.

Mechanisms and consequences of impaired endothelial function

The long-term patency of vein or arterial grafts is highly dependent on the anatomical integrity of the graft in situ and the anatomical and haemodynamic characteristics of the target vessel, but also the biology of the graft. The integrity and the biological 'health' of the endothelial layer of the graft are critical factors that determine its early patency given that trauma to the graft during harvesting and storage may lead to disruption of the endothelial layer exposing the subendothelial collagen to the circulating platelets, leading to acute graft thrombosis and failure early after CABG. This mechanism, together with technical anastomotic issues, lead to slow blood flow through the graft and largely explain the early thrombosis and graft failure observed in ∼11% of saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) within the first few weeks post-surgery. Beyond these mechanical factors, endothelial dysfunction [related to reduced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability] leads to redox dysregulation in the graft wall and triggers pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic mechanisms that may result in graft occlusion. Indeed, endothelial dysfunction related to clinical risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes or insulin resistance, obesity, and hypercholesterolaemia, is driven by activation of pro-oxidant enzymatic systems in the endothelial cell, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases, which generate free radicals like superoxide (O₂⁻), damaging endothelial cell structures. The same redox dysregulation results in oxidative degradation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin, which then induces eNOS uncoupling in the graft's endothelial cell, further increasing superoxide generation and endothelial dysfunction. On the other hand, late (> 1 year) graft failure is often associated with intimal hyperplasia as part of atherogenesis. Clinical risk factors and the graft biology (e.g. redox dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction)lead to proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells and may also trigger the classic mechanisms of plaque formation, plaque rupture, and late graft failure. Size mismatch, particularly when larger SVGs are grafted to small coronary targets, may predispose to non-laminar flow patterns, which may lead to intimal hyperplasia or graft occlusion. Grafts are also prone to spasm, driven by the imbalance between vasoconstrictors (e.g. thromboxane A2 and endothelin) and vasodilators [e.g. NO, endothelial derived relaxation factor, and prostacyclin (PGI₂)] subsequent to endothelial dysfunction. Finally, evidence suggests that maintaining perivascular adipose tissue around the graft [internal thoracic artery (ITA) or SVG] could have a beneficial effect on graft patency, given that perivascular adipose tissue secretes a range of vasodilatory agents [e.g. adiponectin and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)] that could improve endothelial function and the graft's overall redox state. An overview of the role of endothelial dysfunction and vascular redox dysregulation in graft failure is shown in Figure 1.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111CUBMS]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

ACC/AHA aortic disease — cardiac rehabilitation after aortic surgery and dissection indicates that although data are limited, cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to be useful and safe for patients after aortic surgery, and a randomized trial after type A aortic dissection showed improved peak oxygen uptake and maximal workload. Because of deconditioning, patients may be unable to exercise initially at the recommended level; an intensity of 3 to 5 metabolic equivalents of task is recommended, while avoiding strenuous lifting, lifting to the point of exhaustion, or other activities that entail maximal exertion. Fear of a repeat cardiac event can reduce activity after aortic dissection, but mild-to-moderate intensity exercise may be cardioprotective, and in a retrospective study of small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients in a modified preoperative cardiac rehabilitation program, the rate of aortic growth was slower in the rehabilitation group.

Compared with the main analysis, point estimates of the rate ratio of all cause mortality moved closer to the null effect line, and 95% credibility intervals became wider, with a rate ratio of 0.85 for coronary artery bypass grafting (0.72 to 1.00), 0.82 for everolimus eluting stent (0.65 to 1.03), and 0.71 for zotarolimus eluting (Resolute) stent (0.46 to 1.11) compared with medical treatment. For myocardial infarction, the rate ratio for coronary artery bypass grafting moved towards more benefit (0.48, 0.37 to 0.64), and results became statistically more robust for the everolimus eluting stent (0.73, 0.57 to 0.95). For the composite of death or myocardial infarction and for revascularisation, results were similar to the main analysis.

Antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) — guideline recommendations and context: In patients undergoing CABG, aspirin (100–325 mg daily) should be initiated within 6 hours postoperatively and then continued indefinitely to reduce the occurrence of SVG closure and adverse cardiovascular events (COR 1, LOE A). In selected patients undergoing CABG, DAPT with aspirin and ticagrelor or clopidogrel for 1 year may be reasonable to improve vein graft patency compared with aspirin alone (COR 2b, LOE B-R). Observational and small randomized trials and meta-analyses support that DAPT after CABG improves vein graft patency, primarily among patients undergoing off-pump surgery and those with higher SYNTAX scores.

### Standard restrictions vs expedited activity after pelvic organ prolapse surgery… [^115LggP2]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The findings demonstrate that it is reasonable to instruct patients to resume activities ad lib after prolapse surgery, while reassuring patients that resuming physical activity quickly will not result in worse anatomic or symptomatic outcomes. Importance Restrictions on postoperative activity following pelvic organ prolapse surgery are not evidence based. Nonetheless, many pelvic surgeons place lifting and activity restrictions on patients following surgery. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04329715 Activity recommendations and lifting restrictions after gynecologic surgery are based on tradition and anecdote. 1 Despite a paucity of evidence, 82% to 86% of gynecologic surgeons recommend postoperative lifting restrictions, with one-half recommending a maximum of 10 lb.
2. For pelvic organ prolapse surgery, lifting restrictions are primarily based on theoretical avoidance of intra-abdominal pressure compromising a recent reconstruction.

However, in a study of healthy volunteers, daily physiologic events, such as Valsalva maneuver and coughing, generated more IAP than lifting weight off the floor. 3, 4 Such evidence challenges the notion that avoiding weight-bearing activities is protective. Unnecessarily restricting postoperative activity may not be benign. The arbitrary limitation of patients' postoperative activity level could influence postoperative deconditioning, weight gain, and venous thromboembolism risk. In an older surgical population, artificially limiting mobility may adversely affect postoperative recovery trajectories. Participants were screened at their preoperative clinic visit or via a recruitment phone call.

Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups, as follows: standard instructions or expedited instructions. Participants in both groups were instructed to avoid sexual activity until the 6-week postoperative visit. Between July 1, 2020, and October 31, 2021, 218 patients were approached for participation. Sixteen were ineligible, mostly due to an inability to meet minimum activity thresholds. A total of 123 participants were randomized. Three from each group withdrew after randomization prior to surgery. There were overall few numbers of patients reporting heavy physical workloads. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm the safety of shortened convalescence for heavy physical work.

Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical approach

Conventional OPCABG was performed via sternotomy, and aspirin and clopidogrel were routinely applied. The MICS CABG approach was conducted as follows. Under general anesthesia, selective ventilation of the right lung was achieved with a double-lumen endotracheal tube to achieve LITA exposure for takedown and anastomosis. The left scapula of each patient was padded to elevate it and achieve a rotation of approximately 30° to the right side. A great saphenous vein graft was harvested from the lower extremity, and a left sub-mammary incision (8–12 cm long) provided access to the heart through either the 4th or 5th intercostal space. For female patients, a slightly larger incision was made along the lower edge of the breast tissue. A LITA retractor (THORATRAK MICS Retractor System) was used to expose the chest wall space, and the LITA was harvested under direct visualization (Fig. 1 A). For patients that were not able to tolerate single-lung ventilation, intermittent full-lung ventilation, decreased tidal volume, increased respiratory rates, and wet gauze placement to press the lung tissue were employed as effective alternative approaches. Chest wall retractors have both longer and shorter lift options. To achieve a maximal length, the retractor could be reversed to reach the inferior portion of the LITA. Systemic heparin (1.5 mg/kg) was applied, and ACT (Activated Clotting Time) was monitored and prolonged to a minimum of 300 s during anastomosis. Following pericardial incision and suspension, LITA-LAD anastomosis was performed with a tissue stabilizer (TS2000, Medtronic Inc. Minneapolis, MN, USA) and a ValveGate™ Hinged retractor (Fig. 1 B). The right pericardium near the ascending aorta was suspended sufficiently using three to four stitches externalizing through the second intercostal space. The left pericardium was carefully retracted to avoid LITA strain. The the plane between the aorta and pulmonary artery was freed, and a gauge was placed at the right side of the aorta. Owing to patient-specific differences in angle or depth, a customized vascular clamp (Cardiomedical GmbH, Langenahgen, Germany) was placed on the ascending aorta (Fig. 1 C) for proximal anastomosis using a long needle holder, ring tissue forceps, and a knot pusher (ValveGate™PRO) (Video). Distal anastomoses were then performed as in the OPCABG procedure. The exposure of the obtuse marginal branch (OM) is clearer under direct left intercostal visualization than during sternotomy as the target vessel is nearer to the incision, but in some cases, an Octopus stabilizer (29800 Medtronic Inc. Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used for the exposure of deeper sites such as the right coronary artery (RCA) main branch (Fig. 1 D). TTFM (transit time flow measurement) was used as a routine approach to measuring immediate graft patency following vascular anastomosis, and was assessed with a QuickFit TTFM probe (Medistem VeriQ, Oslo, Norway). A single drainage tube was placed in the left thoracic cavity through the 6th–7th intercostal space before closure. The same dual antiplatelet regimen used for patients in the OPCABG group was applied to these patients.

### Nonsternotomy multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting: a key development in cardiac surgery [^114V7REh]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

A Need for Less-invasive Coronary Bypass Surgery

In the 1990s and early 2000s, attempts at performing less-invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were largely restricted to the minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass operation, itself a variation of the first CABG operation performed — in 1964 and through a thoracotomy — by Kolesov and Potashov. With the exception of multiple anterior target coronary vessels and other rare favorable combinations, multivessel bypass grafting through a nonsternotomy incision was not considered feasible until a large consecutive patient series was published in 2009. These minimally invasive (MICS) CABG data became a catalyst for the adoption, over the ensuing decade, of this operation at other expert centers in America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Nowadays, it is estimated that thousands of MICS CABGs are performed every year. Nevertheless, multivessel MICS CABG remains a technically challenging operation performed only at select centers. Complete ease of the surgeon and team at off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) represents 1 prerequisite, after which surgeons should initiate single-vessel MICS CABG to the left anterior descending artery, performed either conventionally or with robotic assistance. Numerous training programs and peer-to-peer options exist for surgeons and teams who wish to learn and develop MICS CABG. The outcomes of this operation have also been validated by several groups, and data pertaining to its safety, feasibility, adoptability, angiographic patency of grafts and, as of recently, long-term durability, are now available. A randomized clinical trial comparing multivessel surgical revascularization by MICS CABG versus regular sternotomy has, as of this writing, completed nearly one half of its recruitment.

Because a sternotomy incision can lead to healing issues or chronic pain in nearly 30% of patients, with the average time period needed to recover from CABG approaching 1 year, it is imperative that our specialty evolves by endorsing safe, validated ways to provide the therapeutic robustness of surgical coronary revascularization while avoiding the intrusiveness of a sternotomy. In this article, salient technical points about the performance of multivessel MICS CABG and key remaining questions related to its degree of adoption by the cardiac surgical community are presented.

Returning to work after AD/ATAAD — After open heart surgery, most patients returned to work after an average of 30 weeks, whereas 34% never did, and 12 months after discharge only a quarter of patients had returned to work after undergoing repair for ATAAD. Requirements for returning to work are adequate blood pressure control and pain management achievable without opioids, and most patients can return to their jobs after 12 weeks provided its physical demands are not excessive. Heavy lifting (high static demand), intensive physical activity and positions associated with a high stress level might be unsuitable for individuals who have undergone acute aortic dissection repair or chronic aortic dissection repair.

### Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: 30 Years of debate [^111DdWys]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The Technical Evolution of Beating‐Heart Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery

The very first direct coronary revascularization procedures in the early 1960s were performed on the beating heart without CPB. 1 However, the technique was soon abandoned because of developments in extracorporeal circulation and improvement in myocardial protection that made the surgery safer, standardized, and reproducible. In the early 1980s, 2 South American surgeons, Buffolo 2 and Benetti, 3 published their extensive series of OPCAB. Most patients received grafts to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and the main right coronary artery, but with more limited and difficult grafting of coronary arteries on the posterior and lateral wall. In the mid 1990s, a minimally invasive left internal mammary artery (LIMA)–LAD performed through a small left anterior thoracotomy on the beating heart 4 was proposed in combination with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the non‐LAD targets. 5

Innovative technology played a key role in the development of OPCAB by minimizing the motion of the heart during construction of the anastomosis. Initially, stabilization of the target coronary vessel was obtained by stay sutures, but the advent of mechanical stabilizers, by means of pressure or suction pods, transformed the way OPCAB was performed, accompanied by an evident improvement in surgical results. 6 The critical challenge was the exposure of the lateral and inferior walls. Initially, lifting of the heart and exposure of the targets were achieved with multiple slings 7 or pericardial stitches, as proposed by Lima and Salerno. 8 The commercialization of pressure‐ and vacuum‐assisted positioners further changed the field and allowed minimization of hemodynamic changes during exposure. The use of intracoronary shunts rather than snaring of the target native coronary vessel has been shown to significantly reduce intraoperative myocardial dysfunction and hemodynamic instability during OPCAB. 9

### An introduction to aviation cardiology [^112YbGTK]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

It is possible to return to flying after a diagnosis of CVD, although this may be in a limited occupational role, and special attention to the pharmacological management, intervention or perioperative planning is essential. The choice of procedure (eg, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting vs full revascularisation with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG))or consideration of the prosthetic material (eg, stentless bioprosthesis) used for a valve replacementare often critical in the determination of licence renewal, but intervention should always be driven by the clinical need, not the occupational one.

Restrictions on aircrew licences often apply following cardiovascular intervention and follow-up usually requires additional investigations at specific time points. The cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon should always consider liaising with the pilot's AME/and or regulatory authority before intervention or surgery, if there is a genuine clinical choice of procedure. They should also aim to understand the ramifications of various courses of action, and the need for certain clinical investigations to allow the AME to determine their suitability to return to their flying career or recreation. However, the overriding principle remains that every individual should be treated as a patient first, and aircrew second — that is, the optimal management of any condition should not be compromised to try and maintain full flying privileges.

The requirement for additional investigations and the cut-off values for aeromedical significance versus clinical significance can lead to some difficult ethical challenges. A single stenosis of > 50% may preclude pilots from flying in some jurisdictions but is below the standard threshold for intervention. However, if the pilot has an intervention that results in no residual stenosis the licensing authorities would consider a return to flying. The threshold for ablation or the requirement for repeat angiography post-PCI may also be influenced by the aircrew's need to fulfil regulatory aviation medical requirements, and this can pose significant challenges to cardiologists.

### Uniform standards do not apply to readmission following coronary artery bypass surgery: a multi-institutional study [^117HA1bD]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reducing hospital readmissions is a national priority, with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery slated for upcoming reimbursement decisions. Clear understanding of the elements associated with readmissions is essential for developing a coherent prevention strategy. Patterns of readmission vary considerably based on diagnosis. We therefore sought to clarify the factors most clearly associated with 30-day readmission following CABG surgery in an academically affiliated community hospital network.

Methods

All patients undergoing isolated CABG in an 11-hospital network from 2007 to 2011 were entered into a Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) compliant registry that tracks hospital readmission within 30 days of surgery. Data were split at random into training and validation groups that were used to create and validate a logistic regression model of pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors associated with readmission. Subanalyses included development of logistic models predicting readmission for the 2 largest institutions individually, and relatedness of readmission to CABG procedure.

Results

The readmission rate for the entire 4861 patient group was 9.2% and varied between hospitals from 6.1% to 18.0%. Factors associated with readmission were moderate chronic obstructed pulmonary disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–3.14; p = 0.036), cerebrovascular disease (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.09–2.24; p = 0.016), diabetes (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.08–1.93; p = 0.014), congestive heart failure (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.23–3.66; p = 0.007), intra-aortic balloon pump (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19–0.83; p = 0.015), and use of blood products (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.31–2.37; p = 0.0002). Although the c statistic for the training model (n = 2341) was 0.643, when applied to the validation dataset (n = 2520) the area under the receiver operating curve was reduced to 0.57. Separate analyses of factors for the 2 largest hospitals revealed marked differences, with only body mass index (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04–1.12; p = 0.0001) significantly associated with readmission at 1 hospital, and discharge to extended care (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.02–4.33; p = 0.043) and renal failure (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.21–5.76; p = 0.0149) significant at the other hospital. Most readmissions (60.8%) occurred within 10 days of discharge. Nearly one-third (31.3%) were categorized as unlikely to be CABG-related. The mean number of days from surgery to readmission was less for readmissions clearly related to CABG (15.5 ± 6.4 days), compared with those unlikely to be CABG-related (17.4 ± 7.0 days) (P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Analysis of CABG readmission data from a network of community hospitals that vary in size and patient demographic characteristics suggests that there are many nonclinical factors influencing readmission; readmission rates and associated risk factors may vary considerably between centers; earlier readmissions are more likely to be procedure-related than patient-related; and therefore, considerable caution should be exercised in attempting to apply uniform standards or strategies to address post-CABG readmission.

### Recommendations of the immunization practices advisory committee (ACIP) varicella-zoster immune globulin for the prevention of chickenpox… [^115nmVVf]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

With increasing supplies, some of these restrictions can be lifted. This statement includes use of VZIG for immunocompromised individuals of any age, normal adults, pregnant women, and premature and full-term infants. However, because the supply of VZIG is still limited, it continues to be recommended primarily for immunocompromised children and certain neonates exposed in utero. VZIG is not recommended for normal-term infants exposed postnatally even if their mothers do not have a prior history of varicella. Adults Immunocompromised Adults: The complication rate for immunocompromised adults who contract varicella is likely to be substantially greater than for normal adults. Most immunocompromised adults with negative or unknown histories of prior varicella are likely to be immune. Indiscriminate use of VZIG in normal adults would quickly exhaust supplies and prevent prophylaxis of known high-risk individuals, such as immunocompromised children and high-risk neonates.

Persons in the latter two groups who develop varicella have estimated death-to-case ratios of at least 7, 000/100, 000 and 31, 000/100, 000, respectively, compared with 50/100, 000 for normal adults. Potentially susceptible hospital personnel with significant exposure should not have direct patient contact from the 10th through the 21st day after exposure, if they do not develop varicella. This is the period during which chickenpox may occur. If they develop varicella, they should not have direct patient contact until all lesions have dried and crusted, generally 6 days after rash onset. To be safe, high-risk susceptibles who are again exposed more than 3 weeks after a prior dose of VZIG should receive another full dose. Dosage VZIG is supplied in vials containing 125 units per vial. The recommended dose is 125 units per 10 kg body weight, up to a maximum of 625 units. The minimum dose is 125 units.

Fractional doses are not recommended. Some experts recommend 125 units per 10 kg of body weight without limiting the total dose to 625 units. VZIG has not been evaluated as a prophylactic measure for prevention or attenuation of varicella in normal or immunocompromised adults.

### Coronary artery bypass grafting in the awake patient: three years' experience in 137 patients [^113YiUK7]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Our experience with 137 patients operated on without general anesthesia is reviewed to explore the validity of our surgical strategy.

Methods

Between October 1998 and January 2002, 137 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with high thoracic epidural anesthesia. There were 47 female and 90 male patients, ranging in age from 37 to 92 years (mean, 68 ± 12 years). Two patients underwent reoperation. Nineteen patients had contraindications for general anesthesia. Target vessels involved were the left anterior descending artery in 122, the right coronary artery in 6, the left anterior descending artery plus right coronary artery in 7, and the left anterior descending artery plus circumflex artery in 2 patients. Coronary artery bypass was performed through limited access in 74 patients (H-graft in 42 and rib cage lifting in 32 patients) and through a median sternotomy in 63 patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass was not used.

Results

In 39 (28.4%) patients pneumothorax was observed during surgical intervention. There was no mortality. Of the 137 patients, 132 (96.3%) completed the procedure awake. In 58 patients the intensive care unit was not used. Eight patients were discharged from the hospital on the day of their operation. Mean length of hospitalization was 1 day (range, 0–3 days). One hundred thirty-one patients were followed up for a period of 3 months and 3 years after their operations, and 94.7% of the patients were symptom free. Control angiograms were obtained in 41 patients. Graft patency was 100%, with one radial artery graft spasm.

Conclusions

Our initial experience confirms the feasibility and safety of performing coronary artery bypass grafting in the conscious patient without general anesthesia. Further study is required to define the possible extent and limitations of this strategy.

### Impact of ACGME work-hour restrictions on the outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting in a cohort of 600, 000 patients [^113cdZvi]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Since the resident physician 80-h/wk restriction was implemented on July 1, 2003, little has been learned about the impact of this reform on patient outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database, we identified 614,177 patients who underwent isolated CABG from 1998 through 2007. Of the 374,947 patients who underwent CABG at a teaching hospital, 133,285 (36%) belonged to the post-reform group. Hierarchic logistic and multivariable regression models were used to assess the independent effect of the reform after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Outcomes assessed were operative morbidity and mortality, and length of stay. Outcomes of CABG patients at non-teaching hospitals were used to control for time bias.

Results

In teaching hospitals, after risk adjustment, the post-reform era was associated with lower mortality risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–0.63; P < 0.001) but greater operative morbidity (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.43–1.58; P < 0.001). Although the implementation of work-hour reforms was correlated with shorter lengths of stay, there were fewer routine home discharges (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.73–0.76; P < 0.001). Outcomes at non-teaching hospitals were similar, except that operative morbidity rates were lower during the post-reform era.

Conclusions

The implementation of the resident work-hour reform in teaching hospitals did not affect mortality rates in CABG patients but was associated with increased morbidity. Further studies are needed to identify the reasons for the post-reform increase in postoperative complications at teaching hospitals.

### Antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass surgery: five year follow-up of randomised DACAB trial [^114TUoJY]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

This study provides evidence of clinical benefit with the use of ticagrelor dual antiplatelet therapy for one year after coronary artery bypass grafting. Given the substantial rate of cardiovascular events after coronary artery bypass grafting despite standard aspirin therapy, evidence for the clinical effect of ticagrelor dual antiplatelet therapy is of critical importance to inform clinical practice. Strengths of this study include the evaluation of three different antiplatelet strategies, the high adherence to the randomised treatment during the first year, the high rate of complete five year follow-up, and the combined evaluation of clinical events and imaging.

The main limitation is that the randomised allocation to antiplatelet therapy was for the first year only. However, coronary artery bypass graft thrombosis typically occurs within the first year after surgery, and the prevention of graft occlusion in the first postoperative year could conceivably have long term effects on reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events; in addition, the long term benefit of one year of ticagrelor dual antiplatelet therapy was confirmed in all the sensitivity analyses.

In clinical practice, patients with coronary artery bypass grafts are generally followed by a specialist early after surgery and then referred to their general physician, and changes in medical therapy are frequent during this transition and also driven by the patient's health status. The change in antiplatelet treatment could be seen as an intercurrent event, and we presented the intention-to-treat analysis and two as-treated analyses to describe the effect of the interventions both from a treatment policy estimand perspective and from a hypothetical strategy perspective. However, the intention-to-treat analysis is of principal interest for inference as it describes the practical consequences of the specific antiplatelet treatment over the first year (and collider stratification, confounding by indication, and unmeasured bias may be present in the as-treated analyses).

Other limitations include the fact that owing to restrictions associated with the covid-19 pandemic, more than half of the patients completed the five year follow-up remotely, rather than attending an in-person visit, and this may have affected in particular the ascertainment of silent myocardial infarctions. Moreover, given the small number of events, the analysis of the individual outcomes may be underpowered. Finally, the use of the internal mammary artery for coronary artery bypass grafting was lower compared with that in Western registries, which may affect the generalisability of results, but this is consistent with contemporary Chinese cardiac surgical practice.

### Interventions to support return to work for people with coronary heart disease [^116nBZpr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with coronary heart disease (CHD) often require prolonged absences from work to convalesce after acute disease events like myocardial infarctions (MI) or revascularisation procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Reduced functional capacity and anxiety due to CHD may further delay or prevent return to work.

Objectives

To assess the effects of person- and work-directed interventions aimed at enhancing return to work in patients with coronary heart disease compared to usual care or no intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC-2, HSELINE, CISDOC, and LILACS through 11 October 2018. We also searched the US National Library of Medicine registry, clinicaltrials.gov, to identify ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining return to work among people with CHD who were provided either an intervention or usual care. Selected studies included only people treated for MI or who had undergone either a CABG or PCI. At least 80% of the study population should have been working prior to the CHD and not at the time of the trial, or study authors had to have considered a return-to-work subgroup. We included studies in all languages. Two review authors independently selected the studies and consulted a third review author to resolve disagreements.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and independently assessed the risk of bias. We conducted meta-analyses of rates of return to work and time until return to work. We considered the secondary outcomes, health-related quality of life and adverse events among studies where at least 80% of study participants were eligible to return to work.

Main Results

We found 39 RCTs (including one cluster- and four three-armed RCTs). We included the return-to-work results of 34 studies in the meta-analyses. Person-directed, psychological counselling versus usual careWe included 11 studies considering return to work following psychological interventions among a subgroup of 615 participants in the meta-analysis. Most interventions used some form of counselling to address participants' disease-related anxieties and provided information on the causes and course of CHD to dispel misconceptions. We do not know if these interventions increase return to work up to six months (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.40; six studies; very low-certainty evidence) or at six to 12 months (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.63; seven studies; very low-certainty evidence). We also do not know if psychological interventions shorten the time until return to work. Psychological interventions may have little or no effect on the proportion of participants working between one and five years (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.34; three studies; low-certainty evidence). Person-directed, work-directed counselling versus usual careFour studies examined work-directed counselling. These counselling interventions included advising patients when to return to work based on treadmill testing or extended counselling to include co-workers' fears and misconceptions regarding CHD. Work-directed counselling may result in little to no difference in the mean difference (MD) in days until return to work (MD -7.52 days, 95% CI -20.07 to 5.03 days; four studies; low-certainty evidence). Work-directed counselling probably results in little to no difference in cardiac deaths (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 5.39; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Person-directed, physical conditioning interventions versus usual careNine studies examined the impact of exercise programmes. Compared to usual care, we do not know if physical interventions increase return to work up to six months (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.41; four studies; very low-certainty evidence). Physical conditioning interventions may result in little to no difference in return-to-work rates at six to 12 months (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.20; five studies; low-certainty evidence), and may also result in little to no difference on the rates of patients working after one year (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; two studies; low-certainty evidence). Physical conditioning interventions may result in little to no difference in the time needed to return to work (MD -7.86 days, 95% CI -29.46 to 13.74 days; four studies; low-certainty evidence). Physical conditioning interventions probably do not increase cardiac death rates (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.80; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Person-directed, combined interventions versus usual careWe included 13 studies considering return to work following combined interventions in the meta-analysis. Combined cardiac rehabilitation programmes may have increased return to work up to six months (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.98; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5; four studies; low-certainty evidence), and may have little to no difference on return-to-work rates at six to 12 months' follow-up (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13; 10 studies; low-certainty evidence). We do not know if combined interventions increased the proportions of participants working between one and five years (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.37; six studies; very low-certainty evidence) or at five years (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.38; four studies; very low-certainty evidence). Combined interventions probably shortened the time needed until return to work (MD -40.77, 95% CI -67.19 to -14.35; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Combining interventions probably results in little to no difference in reinfarctions (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.40; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Work-directed, interventionsWe found no studies exclusively examining strictly work-directed interventions at the workplace.

Authors' Conclusions

Combined interventions may increase return to work up to six months and probably reduce the time away from work. Otherwise, we found no evidence of either a beneficial or harmful effect of person-directed interventions. The certainty of the evidence for the various interventions and outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. Return to work was typically a secondary outcome of the studies, and as such, the results pertaining to return to work were often poorly reported. Adhering to RCT reporting guidelines could greatly improve the evidence of future research. A research gap exists regarding controlled trials of work-directed interventions, health-related quality of life within the return-to-work process, and adverse effects.

### Nabumetone (nabumetone 500 mg) [^114U9ebo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years

in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of nabumetone tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If nabumetone tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

### The risk of dementia after coronary artery bypass grafting in relation to age and sex [^113orwDZ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the preferred method for myocardial revascularization in patients with complex multi‐vessel or left main coronary artery disease. 1 CABG is still the most commonly performed cardiac surgical procedure, with ≈400,000 procedures performed in the United States annually. 1

Systematic review: Previous studies investigating the association between coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and dementia have shown conflicting results and are limited by restricted study populations and follow‐up times. In addition, no study has been large enough to investigate if potential associations diverge between subgroups of CABG patients. We examined the long‐term risk of dementia after CABG in relation to age and sex in a large population‐based cohort.
Interpretation: We found that CABG patients < 75 years have a higher long‐term risk of dementia compared to an age‐ and sex‐matched control population, while older patients have a lower risk. The increased risk becomes significant 10 years after CABG. The highest risk was observed in younger women. Cardiovascular risk factors, history of depression, and low socioeconomic status were independent predictors for developing dementia after CABG.
Future directions: Increased awareness of the higher risk for dementia in younger CABG patients and in CABG patients with a history of depression, and low socioeconomic status, is required.

### Technique of bilateral internal thoracic artery minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting with double-lung ventilation [^113wkA88]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient Selection

BITA-MICS-CABG requires thorough planning considering several contraindications (Table 1). A computed tomography chest scan reveals the patients' intrathoracic anatomy and thus eligibility. Institutional review board approval was not required. An informed written consent for publication of study data was obtained from the patient in the video.

Table 1
Contraindications for bilateral internal thoracic artery minimally invasive cardiac surgery coronary artery bypass grafting

Anesthesia and Monitoring

An anesthesiologist team with profound experience in MICS and OPCAB is mandatory. We routinely use pulmonary artery catheters to continuously monitor pulmonary arterial, central venous, and left ventricular filling pressure and cardiac output. Adequate volume management and differentiated catecholamine use are of utmost importance.

Positioning and Incision

Patients are placed in the supine position with the left thorax lifted up by 30°. After a submammary skin incision (5–8 cm along the fifth intercostal space) and extrathoracic preparation, the parietal pleura is widely opened to reduce the risk of costal fractures (Video 1).

Pulmonary Fan for Double-Lung Ventilation

Double-lung ventilation is achieved by our pulmonary fan technique as previously described. In brief, the mediastinal pleura is incised 1 to 2 cm anterior of the phrenic nerve, and 6 to 12 sutures are stitched along the pericardio-pleural margin and pulled laterally through the third or fourth intercostal space. Thus, the constructed fan retracts the left lung to enable continuous double-lung ventilation (Video 1).

Graft Harvesting

The left ITA (LITA) is skeletonized. For right ITA (RITA) preparation, an additional subxiphoidal retractor lifts the sternum (Video 1).

Anastomoses

After LITA-RITA T-graft construction, the LITA is typically sutured to the left anterior descending artery and the RITA to coronaries of the (postero) lateral wall (Video 2). For cardiac positioning and target vessel exposure, suctioning positioner devices and stabilizers are utilized. Afterward, a transit-time-flow measurement confirms adequate blood flow to the coronary targets.

### Potential biomarkers for predicting outcomes in CABG cardiothoracic surgeries [^111z21nd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting

Numerous procedures are currently used to treat coronary blockages, including the use of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). During a CABG, a healthy artery or vein, typically the saphenous vein from the medial side of either lower extremity or the internal mammary artery from the chest wall, is grafted to bypass the blocked coronary artery. The three most commonly affected vessels are the left anterior descending artery (LAD), commonly known as the widow maker, the left circumflex artery, and the right coronary artery (RCA).

A CABG procedure usually takes 3 to 5 hours, and can include a single or multiple vessel bypass (Table 1). During the surgery, thoracic exploration is performed through a median sternotomy. Medication is administered to arrest the heart, an approach known as cardioplegia, which allows the surgeon to work on a stopped heart. The aorta is cross-clamped, and blood flow is then re-routed through the cardiopulmonary bypass machine during the procedure. After the case is completed and sinus rhythm of the heart is restored, the heart-lung bypass machine is removed.

Table 1
Different heart conditions and general characteristics (listed in decreasing order of occurrence)

An alternative procedure, off-pump CABG is performed on a beating heart. It is indicated for high-risk patients who are not stable enough to use the cardiopulmonary bypass machine for prolonged periods of time. These patients often have a history of peripheral vascular disease, cerebral vascular accidents (CVA), or multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).

The CABG procedure is complex and does not come without risk. Cardiac surgery is a highly invasive procedure that can potentially lead to further myocardial insult. The degree of insult is dependent on multiple factors such as the type and extent of the surgical procedure, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping, pre-operative condition of the heart, length of anesthesia use and timing of post-operative revascularization.

Cardiac surgery with the cardiac bypass machine causes an acute inflammatory response through activation of inflammatory cells, complement cascade, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Vascular endothelial cells are activated and increase leukocyte adhesion molecules, a marker for inflammation. This same response also occurs once the cross-clamp is released and the heart is re-perfused. It is understood that during the use of CPB, and after reperfusion, a rise in the production of free radicals occurs that causes damage to the vasculature, also known as reperfusion injury.

### Physiotherapy-supervised mobilization and exercise following cardiac surgery: a national questionnaire survey in Sweden [^1147S3VZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Postoperative mobilization and exercises

Mobilization and exercises usually provided to the patients on the first postoperative days after surgery are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Instructions for range of motion exercises for the upper extremities and thorax were provided to the patients on postoperative day 1 by six physiotherapists, on postoperative day 2 by 22, and on postoperative day 3 by 25 of physiotherapists. How many times the patients were instructed to perform the exercises varied between one and three times a day during the hospital stay and once and twice a day after discharge. Postoperative group training for the patients during the hospital stay were provided by 62% of the physiotherapists. Physiotherapy-supervised stair climbing was practised postoperatively, according to 79% of the physiotherapists.

Table 1
Physiotherapy-supervised mobilization usually provided to cardiac surgery patients during the first postoperative days.

Data shown as % of respondents (n = 29). POD = postoperative day.

Table 2
Physiotherapy-supervised exercises usually provided to cardiac surgery patients during the first postoperative days.

Data shown as % of respondents (n = 29). POD = postoperative day; ROM = range of motion.

Sternal precautions

Sternal precautions recommended for the healing period during the first postoperative weeks are presented in Table 3. Recommendations for how long after surgery the patients should avoid weight bearing varied between 7 and 12 weeks (mean 9 weeks). How much weight the patients were allowed to lift while the sternum was healing varied between 1 and 5 kg (median 2 kg, mean 2.5 kg).

Table 3
Sternal precautions recommended for the healing period during the first postoperative weeks after cardiac surgery.

Data shown as number (n) and as % of respondents (n = 29).

Instructions for moving in, and out of, bed were given to the patients using a "standard technique" by 90% of the physiotherapists. The most commonly described technique for getting out of bed was lying on the side, placing one or both hands in front of the body, leaning forward and pushing up to a sitting position.

Postoperative information

Before discharge from the department of cardiothoracic surgery all physiotherapists provided information to the patients about physical activity, exercises and rehabilitation. Instructions to the patients to continue shoulder range of motion exercises after discharge from the hospital, were as well given by all physiotherapists. The time that patients were recommended to continue the exercise programme varied between 1 and 8 weeks.

### Retention of work capacity after coronary artery bypass grafting. A 10-year follow-up study [^11373FMw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The major objectives in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are restoration of normal functional capacity and quality of life as well as resumption of professional activity. Factors predictive for return to work after CABG have been examined in various studies and are fairly well known. Return rates vary widely around the world, due to various factors such as different sick insurance systems, labour market conditions and sick listing traditions among physicians. Only few studies have focused specifically on retention of work capacity after CABG.

In the earlier part of the Working after CABG (W-CABG) study we examined return to work and the length of continuation in a Finnish CABG patient population. According to the follow-up of patients remaining under 60 years, almost half returned to work successfully for a longer period. One fourth retired preoperatively and one fourth during the first postoperative year. After 5 years, pensioning of patients once successfully returned to work did not differ from that in the matched general population.

Aims of the present study

In this paper we report postoperative continuation in work life among men and women aged less than 60. It was of special interest to evaluate the following aspects:

1) Which factors influence patients staying on?

Why do people who have resumed work after CABG retire prematurely?

2) What kind of model would help to estimate patients' possibilities of staying at work?

### Additional right-sided upper "Half-mini-thoracotomy" for aortocoronary bypass grafting during minimally invasive multivessel revascularization [^115TWLsU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the increasing numbers of percutaneous interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) still remains the gold standard for the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease in many patients. However, although clinical outcomes have dramatically improved since first introduction of CABG five decades ago, invasiveness of the procedure has not significantly changed, with most of the routinely performed CABG procedures still involving full-sternotomy and aortic clamping. Although minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (MICS-CABG) alternatives have been widely explored showing excellent clinical outcomes overall adoption rates still remain low.

Traditional strategies for minimally invasive multivessel revascularization are of high technical complexity - usually performed through a single-thoracotomy - and have to deal with restricted grafting possibilities and subsequent possible increased susceptibility of arterial grafts to competitive flow, restraining their applicability to very specific indications or hybrid approaches. On top, they are prone to conversion to full-sternotomy in case of left internal thoracic artery (LITA) insufficiency, due to lacking possibilities of aortocoronary venous bypass grafting.

Here, we present a sternotomy-free and clampless alternative to the standard CABG procedure, which allows for aortocoronary bypass grafting in standard "off-pump" manner, while reducing restrictions inherent to current minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) CABG approaches.

### Comparison of dual antiplatelet therapies after coronary endarterectomy combined with coronary artery bypass grafting: a cohort study [^116wQW9W]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of two different DAPT protocols, AC versus AT, after CE + CABG. We observed there's no significant difference concerning ischemic and bleeding events, as well as overall MACCE-free survival between the two groups during mid-term follow-up.

Complete revascularization is very important in patients with coronary artery disease, where satisfactory coronary revascularization can be achieved by CABG alone or coronary stenting in most cases. However, it is a challenge for surgeons to achieve complete revascularization in those with diffuse coronary artery disease by conventional techniques. In these cases, CE had its priority when used adjunctively to CABG. Unlike early study results, researchers reported improved early and late outcomes after CE + CABG in several individual studies during last two decades, although most of the studies were restricted with observational design. Undoubtedly, these results might be attributed to the improvement in operative techniques and postoperative management.

Antithrombotic treatment is one of the most important treatments to improve graft patency and clinical outcomes of patients after coronary revascularization. Loss of coronary intima is one of the disadvantages caused by CE, which in turns leads to the direct exposure of sub-intimal tissues to blood flow and release of tissue factor. This can be followed by platelet activation and aggregation, resulting in increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, patients who underwent CE + CABG might need more strict antiplatelet therapy compared to CABG alone or stenting.

Clinical guidelines recommended DAPT after CABG alone, including aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Different from clopidogrel, ticagrelor is a direct-acting and reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist with faster and more consistent antiplatelet inhibition effect. Furthermore, both prototype and metabolites of ticagrelor have biological effect, which means its effect is stronger and not limited by CYP2C19 gene polymorphism. Several clinical trials also reported stronger platelet inhibition after ticagrelor than clopidogrel. However, there's no guideline recommendation with respect to antithrombotic therapy after CE + CABG. There're limited studies that focused on antiplatelet therapy after CE + CABG. In one retrospective study, Russo and colleagues reported compared results in single versus dual antiplatelet therapy after CE + CABG, but this study was restricted with small sample size. Others involved antithrombotic treatment protocol in their studies, but not focusing on the comparison of antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, more evidence is needed.

Patient categorization for CABG with planned temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) — Patients deemed appropriate candidates for CABG combined with planned insertion of a temporary MCS device as a bridge to recovery or to long-term MCS/heart transplantation, if needed, should be tracked as a separate cohort and excluded from the isolated CABG category for purposes of quality assignment; centers with the necessary infrastructure and expertise to handle such complex cases could care for high-risk referrals from other less-equipped centers without risking lower public ratings, yet still be monitored for performance.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons clinical practice guidelines on arterial conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting [^112gPs9D]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

SYNTAX trial and STS ACSD arterial conduit use — in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the SYNTAX trial reported that almost all received at least one arterial conduit and many received more than one, while U.S. sites used multiple arterial conduits less frequently; in contemporary STS ACSD data the use of a second arterial graft remains uncommon, and saphenous vein graft (SVG) failure rates are substantial over time. Specifically, "almost all of the patients undergoing CABG (97.3%) received at least one arterial conduit bypass and 35.3% of patients received more than one arterial conduit", and "The US sites had a significantly lower rate at 17%". In the STS ACSD, "the current incidence of a second arterial graft is less than 7% (1990 to 1999, 3.2%; 2000 to 2009, 11.6%; and 2010 to 2013, 6.7%)". Reported SVG outcomes note "failure rates of up to 10% to 20% after 1 year and an additional 5% failure rate for each subsequent year", with the text adding that "it is logical to infer that if the surgical conduit failure rate can be ameliorated by safe, more judicious, and effective use of arterial grafts, long-term clinical outcomes may be significantly improved".
