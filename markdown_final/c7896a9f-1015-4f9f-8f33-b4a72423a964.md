## Question

Which medications for type 2 diabetes are safe for a woman attempting to conceive?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are safe for managing type 2 diabetes in a woman who is attempting to conceive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching preconception goals and whether insulin is indeed the preferred and safest glucose-lowering therapy. Then, I should verify how to handle metformin differently when used for PCOS versus for T2DM management. Next, I will need to examine the evidence and guidance for GLP-1 receptor agonists and other noninsulin agents preconception, including what to discontinue and when. After that, I should confirm the handling of concomitant cardiometabolic drugs that are teratogenic or otherwise unsafe. Finally, I will integrate a patient-specific action plan with timing, monitoring, glycemic targets, and folate supplementation, while acknowledging areas of controversy and ensuring shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the core principle. Insulin is the preferred glucose-lowering therapy before and during pregnancy because it does not cross the placenta and has an established safety profile, and rapid-acting insulin analogs such as lispro or aspart and long-acting analogs such as detemir or glargine can be continued if already effective and tolerated preconceptionally, with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous infusion favored for flexibility and precision in titration [^111Mi6LJ] [^1153P9uc] [^115NwvFw].

> I need to ensure preconception care elements are in place. Reliable contraception should be used until glycemia is optimized and potentially harmful medications are discontinued, with a goal HbA1c less than 6.5% if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia and with explicit shared decision-making documented, and high-dose folic acid at 5 mg daily should begin at least 3 months before attempting conception to reduce neural tube defect risk [^111Mi6LJ] [^111hELfa] [^111NJALE] [^11218C24] [^116owkaq].

> Hold on, I should verify the nuanced role of metformin. If metformin is used for PCOS and ovulation induction, ADA 2025 recommends discontinuation by the end of the first trimester, whereas for T2DM management, it may be continued only when a patient declines insulin or cannot safely administer it, ideally with a plan to transition to insulin preconception when feasible, and this approach is consistent with ACOG summarized by AAFP, recognizing that metformin crosses the placenta and long-term offspring data remain limited [^113ULwyE] [^113cBkWz] [^114WsFJ3] [^114Keg8b]. Let me double-check trial data to contextualize benefits and risks. The MiTy trial showed that adding metformin to insulin in pregnant women with T2DM improved glycemia, reduced insulin dose and gestational weight gain, and lowered cesarean delivery rates, while increasing small-for-gestational-age infants, and observational target-trial emulation in Medicaid suggested no increase in congenital malformations when metformin was continued with insulin in early pregnancy, so shared decision-making and close fetal growth monitoring are prudent if metformin is continued [^116LNRAe] [^111f19Bd] [^113ULwyE]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially said "FDA Category C" for metformin, but I need to correct myself because the category language provided here refers to the Australian categorisation system rather than current FDA PLLR, so the "Category C" designation in these materials is from TGA and not the FDA, and current US labeling uses narrative risk summaries emphasizing the risks of poor glycemic control rather than categorical letters [^116PM5dB] [^115Yqjmi] [^1179wJRp].

> Next, I should review GLP-1 receptor agonists. I will now examine the human data first. A large multinational cohort did not find an increased risk of major congenital malformations with periconceptional exposure to GLP-1 receptor agonists or other second-line noninsulin agents compared with insulin, but estimates were imprecise and subject to potential selection bias because only live births were included, so we should be cautious about overinterpreting this as proof of safety [^113nntpd] [^113BeKZd] [^112bsPbH]. But wait, guideline direction remains conservative, and ES/ESE 2025 recommends discontinuing GLP-1 receptor agonists before conception with active management of glycemia to prevent hyperglycemia and weight rebound after withdrawal, with the timing individualized and contraception emphasized if pregnancy is not desired, so the practical step is planned cessation and insulin transition before attempting conception [^116Jmq4B] [^113VHnm9].

> I need to check the status of other noninsulin agents. DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and meglitinides lack sufficient pregnancy safety data or have concerning signals, so they should be stopped preconception in favor of insulin, and observational reviews reiterate the paucity of robust pregnancy safety data for newer agents, arguing against their use when planning pregnancy [^117MxxJ1] [^111hELfa]. Hold on, sulfonylureas deserve a specific comment. Glyburide or other sulfonylureas have been used for gestational diabetes later in pregnancy in selected cases, but for pregestational T2DM and preconception planning they are not recommended due to neonatal hypoglycemia and related risks, and if used for GDM they should be stopped well before delivery, so for women attempting conception these should be discontinued and insulin used instead [^1177Wu7S] [^113XQY4q] [^115fwbWh] [^117JtLon].

> I should confirm the approach to concomitant cardiometabolic medications that are unsafe. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and most lipid-lowering agents should be stopped before conception, and statins in particular should generally be avoided when attempting to conceive, though ADA notes rare exceptions for very high-risk patients after careful risk-benefit analysis, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs stopped immediately once pregnancy is recognized if not already discontinued, which argues for preconception medication reconciliation and alternatives for blood pressure control [^115pGT5o] [^117FFR89] [^117BM5HD] [^117QFtqw].

> Let me think about how to translate this into a patient-specific action plan. If the patient is already on an effective insulin regimen, I should continue it and, if needed, optimize using rapid-acting analogs for meals and detemir or glargine for basal coverage, making changes well in advance of stopping contraception so she can master the regimen before trying to conceive, and maintain SMBG or CGM guided titration toward pregnancy glycemic targets as per standards of care [^1153P9uc] [^112ycyxB] [^111Mi6LJ]. If the patient is on metformin for T2DM, the preferred plan is to transition to insulin before conception with shared decision-making, though if she declines insulin, metformin may be continued with close monitoring and a plan to reassess in the first trimester, balancing MiTy and observational data against the SGA signal and the fact that metformin crosses the placenta, whereas if metformin was started solely for PCOS or ovulation induction it should be discontinued by the end of the first trimester once pregnancy is achieved [^114WsFJ3] [^116LNRAe] [^113ULwyE] [^1123MHrg]. If the patient is on a GLP-1 receptor agonist, I should stop it preconception with an immediate, proactive insulin transition to avoid glycemic deterioration, time the cessation based on conception plans and agent pharmacokinetics, and reinforce reliable contraception until glycemia is optimized off the GLP-1 agent [^116Jmq4B] [^113VHnm9].

> I need to ensure supportive preventive steps are explicit. Target HbA1c less than 6.5% before conception if safely achievable, initiate folic acid 5 mg daily at least 3 months prior, review and discontinue teratogenic or inadequately studied agents preconception, and document a shared decision-making conversation that includes the patient's preferences, logistic constraints, and safety monitoring plan, including eye care and hypoglycemia education when intensifying insulin, with contraception counseling at every visit until optimization is complete [^111Mi6LJ] [^116owkaq] [^111hELfa] [^114XbfEw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on "real-world" trends suggesting broader noninsulin use. Utilization studies show increasing metformin exposure into pregnancy, likely reflecting unplanned pregnancies and late transitions, but guideline-concordant care still centers insulin for pregestational T2DM, and postponing transitions until after conception risks early first-trimester hyperglycemia when organogenesis is underway, which strengthens the case for preconception planning and timely medication changes [^116LNRAe] [^112KhB3W].

> I should double-check how to communicate the key controversies. For GLP-1 receptor agonists, large cohort data are reassuring but not definitive due to imprecision and live-birth conditioning, and given compelling animal data and the risks of abrupt withdrawal without bridging, current high-credibility guidelines remain conservative and recommend preconception discontinuation with active glycemic management and contraception when pregnancy is not desired, which is the prudent course until more definitive human safety data accrue [^113nntpd] [^113BeKZd] [^112bsPbH] [^116Jmq4B]. For metformin, early pregnancy safety looks acceptable in observational analyses and RCTs add maternal and neonatal benefits when combined with insulin, but the SGA signal warrants growth surveillance and individualized decisions, and for PCOS indications it should be stopped by the end of the first trimester per ADA 2025, which I should reiterate clearly during counseling [^113ULwyE] [^116LNRAe] [^1123MHrg].

> In summary, I recommend insulin as the primary therapy before and during pregnancy, with optimization of analog regimens, continuation of long-acting analogs if already effective, discontinuation of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other noninsulin agents with insufficient safety data before conception in favor of an actively managed insulin transition, selective and cautious continuation of metformin only when insulin is declined and with close monitoring, cessation of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and most statins preconception, achievement of HbA1c less than 6.5% prior to stopping contraception, and initiation of 5 mg folic acid daily at least 3 months before attempting to conceive, while documenting shared decision-making and monitoring for hypoglycemia and fetal growth, acknowledging that emerging data may refine future recommendations but do not yet change current standards [^111Mi6LJ] [^1153P9uc] [^116Jmq4B] [^115pGT5o] [^117FFR89] [^116owkaq] [^1123MHrg] [^116LNRAe].

Insulin is the **preferred first-line therapy** for women with T2DM planning pregnancy because it does not cross the placenta and is safe throughout gestation [^112ycyxB] [^1153P9uc]. Metformin is an **acceptable alternative** when insulin is not tolerated or is declined, with no clear increase in congenital anomalies; however, it should be stopped by the end of the first trimester if used for PCOS or ovulation induction [^114WsFJ3] [^1123MHrg]. Sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones **should be avoided** due to limited safety data or potential fetal risks [^113XQY4q] [^117MxxJ1] [^113VR5YG]. Preconception counseling should prioritize **glycemic optimization** (HbA1c < 6.5%) and discontinuation of potentially harmful medications [^111Mi6LJ] [^111hELfa].

---

## Insulin therapy

- **Preferred first-line therapy**: Insulin is recommended for women with T2DM planning pregnancy because it does not cross the placenta and is safe throughout gestation [^112ycyxB] [^1153P9uc].

- **Rapid-acting insulin analogs**: Insulin aspart and insulin lispro are preferred over regular insulin due to better glycemic control and flexibility [^112ycyxB] [^115itMbd].

- **Long-acting insulin analogs**: Insulin detemir and insulin glargine can be continued if used successfully preconceptionally [^1153P9uc].

---

## Metformin

- **Acceptable alternative**: Metformin is acceptable if insulin is not tolerated or refused, with no clear increase in congenital anomalies.

- **Discontinuation timing**: Stop by the end of the first trimester if used for PCOS or ovulation induction [^113cBkWz] [^1123MHrg].

- **Benefits and risks**: May reduce maternal weight gain and insulin requirements, but long-term offspring effects are uncertain [^111MSsEA].

---

## Medications to avoid

- **Sulfonylureas**: Glimepiride and glipizide should be avoided due to fetal harm and neonatal hypoglycemia risk [^113XQY4q].

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Avoid due to limited safety data and potential fetal risks.

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Avoid due to limited safety data and potential fetal risks.

- **Thiazolidinediones**: Avoid due to limited safety data and potential fetal risks [^113VR5YG].

---

## Preconception counseling and glycemic control

Preconception counseling should **focus on optimizing glycemic control** and on discontinuing harmful medications [^111hELfa]. Aim for **an HbA1c < 6.5%** to reduce congenital anomalies and other complications [^111Mi6LJ]. Recommend **folic acid 5 mg/day** starting 3 months before conception [^116owkaq].

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: Update on screening, diagnosis, and management [^113XQY4q]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the use of glimepiride PO (also known as Amaryl) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: consider safer alternatives due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for hypoglycemia. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. Discontinue glimepiride, if used during pregnancy, at least two weeks before the expected delivery date to decrease the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia.

The drug glimepiride PO (also known as Amaryl) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Duetact [^113VR5YG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Limited data with Duetact or pioglitazone in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. There are clinical considerations related to fetal and neonatal adverse reactions and drug discontinuation if glimepiride is used during pregnancy. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

No adverse developmental effects were observed when pioglitazone was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposures up to 5 and 35 times the 45 mg clinical dose, respectively, based on body surface area. Administration of glimepiride to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis induced maternal hypoglycemia and also increased fetal mortality at doses 50 (rats) and 0.1 times (rabbits) the 8 mg clinical dose, respectively, based on body surface area [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6–10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with HbA1c > 7. It has been reported to be as high as 20–25% in women with HbA1c > 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, and spontaneous.

### The need for appropriate registration of pregnancy outcomes under newer oral glucose-lowering therapies [^117MxxJ1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Because of the increase in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in young adults, women of childbearing age are frequently treated with newer glucose-lowering therapies, and an increase in unintentional exposure to therapies unapproved for use during pregnancy is expected. The clinician faces the dilemma of deciding between the discontinuation of a novel agent that is providing excellent glycaemic control and switching to other agents, which may cause deterioration of glycaemia, and continued use of novel agents that may have uncertain effects on the unborn child.

For T2DM, pregnancy data are collected only via spontaneous reporting systems. Therefore, we evaluated the available data on pregnancy outcomes under newer glucose-lowering agents in pharmaceutical safety databases. We found that data on pregnancy outcomes with new glucose-lowering agents in T2DM are scarce, with a high risk of bias towards negative outcomes, limiting their usefulness in robustly assessing safety. Because of the lack of information at present, these agents are not recommended for use during pregnancy or when planning pregnancy. To better guide clinical practice, structured systems of assessing pregnancy outcomes in women receiving these novel agents are urgently needed.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112ycyxB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

- **Preconception care of women with diabetes**:

	- **Preconception counseling**: We recommend that preconception counseling be provided to all women with diabetes who are considering pregnancy.

	- **Preconception glycemic control**: We suggest that women with diabetes seeking to conceive strive to achieve blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels as close to normal as possible, provided they can be safely achieved without undue hypoglycemia.

	- **Insulin therapy**:
		- **Multiple daily doses of insulin**: We recommend that insulin-treated women with diabetes seeking to conceive be treated with multiple daily doses of insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. This is preferred over split-dose, premixed insulin therapy, as it is more likely to achieve and maintain target blood glucose levels preconceptionally. Moreover, in the event of pregnancy, it is more likely to allow for sufficient flexibility or precise adjustment of insulin therapy.
		- **Adjustments before conception**: We suggest that any change to a woman's insulin regimen, especially when starting continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, be made well in advance of withdrawing contraceptive measures or attempting to conceive. This allows the patient to gain expertise in, and optimize, the chosen insulin regimen.
		- **Rapid-acting insulin**: We suggest that insulin-treated women with diabetes seeking to conceive be treated with rapid-acting insulin analog therapy, such as insulin aspart or insulin lispro, over regular (soluble) insulin.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: Update on screening, diagnosis, and management [^114WsFJ3]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the use of glyburide/metformin PO (also known as Glucovance) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, consider safer alternatives. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. The ACOG guidelines suggest metformin as a second-line choice in patients declining insulin or who are unable to safely administer insulin. The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend discontinuing metformin, when used to treat PCOS and induce ovulation, by the end of the first trimester.

Glyburide can be considered as a third-line option for gestational diabetes mellitus. Discontinue glyburide, if being used during pregnancy, at least 2 weeks before the expected delivery date to decrease the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The drug glyburide/metformin PO (also known as Glucovance) is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations.

### Metformin for pregnancy and beyond: The pros and cons [^111MSsEA]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Metformin has been used in pregnancy since the 1970s. It is cheap, widely available, and acceptable to women. Despite its increasing use, controversy remains surrounding its benefits and risks. Metformin effectively reduces hyperglycemia for the mother during pregnancy and reduces rates of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia. However, concerns exist surrounding an increase in the rate of small for gestational age (SGA) births and obesity in childhood. This paper aims to review the evidence and expert opinions on metformin in pregnancy through to the postpartum period.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature review of relevant studies from online databases using a combination of keywords. We also searched the references of retrieved articles for pertinent studies.

- **Results**: There is strong evidence that metformin is safe in early pregnancy with no risk of congenital malformations. If used throughout pregnancy, it is likely to lead to reduced maternal weight gain and reduced insulin dose in women with type 2 diabetes. In infants, metformin reduces hypoglycemia and macrosomia but may increase the rate of infants born SGA. There is some evidence of an increased risk of obesity and altered fat distribution in offspring. Metformin appears well tolerated in pregnancy and is more acceptable to women than insulin therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Due to increasing rates of maternal obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and type 2 diabetes, metformin use in pregnancy is increasing. Overall, it appears safe and effective, but further research is needed to examine mechanisms linking metformin to obesity reported during childhood.

### Interventions in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum periods to optimise care and health outcomes: A systematic review [^113V5PhA]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). High credibility.

UK guidelines on postpartum care for Type 2 diabetes focus on medication management immediately after birth to achieve and optimize glycaemia, advising on nutrition, and advocating breastfeeding. These guidelines recommend that women should also be referred back to their routine care providers in primary care, where advice should be given on planning for future pregnancies, including appropriate contraception. However, there is a paucity of interventions during this period, and limited data on the effectiveness of guidance to inform the optimal management of women with Type 2 diabetes during the postpartum period and beyond.

Due to the increasing rates and complications associated with Type 2 diabetes among women of reproductive age, it is particularly important for women to receive evidence-based optimal management before, during, and after pregnancy. There has been no detailed review of interventions essential for translation and implementation into clinical practice; this is necessary as a benchmark of the best approach, to highlight potential inadequacies in the evidence, and to drive innovative practice. As part of a series of systematic reviews formulated to identify the evidence for optimizing care and health outcomes, this systematic review aimed to evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) interventions in the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum periods for women with Type 2 diabetes.

### Safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other second-line antidiabetics in early pregnancy [^113nntpd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

In this cohort study by the InPreSS consortium, which includes more than 50,000 pregnancies in women with pregestational type 2 diabetes (T2D) from six countries, we observed no elevated risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) after periconceptional exposure to GLP-1 receptor agonists or any of the second-line noninsulin antidiabetic medication (ADM) classes evaluated compared with insulin. Insulin is another second-line ADM and the traditional treatment for T2D in pregnancy. Further, we showed an increase in the periconceptional use of second-line noninsulin ADMs, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists in the U.S. This highlights a shift in how T2D in reproductive-aged women is treated. Although this study did not suggest that these medications have strong teratogenic effects, further research is needed to fully evaluate the safety of these medications in pregnancy.

T2D is an increasingly common condition in female individuals of reproductive age, and consequently in pregnant patients. In line with previous studies, we found an elevated prevalence (5.3%) of MCMs in infants born to women with pregestational T2D, compared with the general population (3.7%). The effect of T2D is believed to be at least partially mediated by hyperglycemia, as poor glycemic control during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of MCMs and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. This supports the importance of glycemic control and having safe and effective medications available during pregnancy.

Although insulin does not cross the placenta and is considered nonteratogenic, little to no data are available on what risks, if any, noninsulin ADMs might present.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114pxF3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, specifically in relation to postpartum care, the 2013 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend continuing metformin or glyburide therapy during breastfeeding, if necessary, in patients with overt diabetes, provided these medications were used successfully during pregnancy.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113dxfDj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society identified the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and pregnancy as a priority area in need of a clinical practice guideline and appointed a Task Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available research evidence to develop these recommendations.

The Task Force adopted the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group, an international group specializing in the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. The Task Force also utilized consistent language and graphical representations to denote both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence.

- **Strength of recommendations**: Strong recommendations use the phrase "we recommend" and are indicated by the number 1, while less strong recommendations use the phrase "we suggest" and the number 2.

- **Quality of evidence**: Cross-filled circles signify the quality of evidence, where:
	- ⊕○○○ denotes very low-quality evidence
	- ⊕⊕○○ denotes low-quality evidence
	- ⊕⊕⊕○ denotes moderate-quality evidence
	- ⊕⊕⊕⊕ denotes high-quality evidence

The Task Force is confident that individuals receiving care according to strong recommendations will generally experience more benefits than harm. Less strong recommendations require more careful consideration of individual circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the best course of action.

### Interventions in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum periods to optimise care and health outcomes: A systematic review [^117Q6bat]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The global prevalence of diabetes is reflected in the increasing number of pregnancies complicated by type 2 diabetes. In England as well as Wales, during 2021/2022, 55% of women with diabetes in pregnancy were reported to have type 2 diabetes. Many of these women face health inequalities before and during pregnancy. Infants of women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy are at a greater risk of adverse outcomes, including perinatal and neonatal death, compared to those of women with type 1 diabetes. Additionally, diabetes in pregnancy can increase the risk of small and large for gestational age (SGA and LGA, respectively), gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and pre-term delivery.

To optimize pregnancy preparation and outcomes, guidelines in the United Kingdom (UK) advise intervention in the pre-pregnancy period for women with type 2 diabetes. These recommendations include achieving an HbA1c ≤ 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), high-dose folic acid (5 mg) supplementation, identification and management of diabetes complications and hypertension, and ceasing potentially teratogenic medication. However, multiple factors impact the ability of this population to effectively prepare for pregnancy. The implementation of this advice has been suboptimal, with only around 10% of women with type 2 diabetes meeting these targets. Furthermore, a high proportion of obesity (65%), smoking (23%), and illicit/recreational drug use (9%) have been reported among women with type 2 diabetes planning pregnancy compared to women without diabetes. This evidence highlights the significant challenges to pre-pregnancy care.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114Keg8b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: Pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to metformin at the time of conception and during early pregnancy have been favorable. Compared with women with gestational diabetes taking insulin, those taking metformin have no difference in maternal glycemic control, significantly lower rates of neonatal hypoglycemia, and no increased risk of congenital anomalies or other serious maternal or neonatal adverse events. Although not shown to be deleterious to the fetus, metformin does cross freely through the placenta, with similar metformin concentrations in the fetal and maternal circulation, and long-term follow-up studies establishing safety are not yet available. Also, nearly half of women with gestational diabetes treated with metformin monotherapy have glycemic control failure rates requiring conversion to insulin therapy. Additionally, metformin-treated women with gestational diabetes have increased rates of preterm birth.

- **Remarks**: Compared with insulin therapy, metformin is typically more convenient and less expensive and is not associated with the risk of hypoglycemia. Nonetheless, certain concerns, as described, still preclude its routine use in the treatment of gestational diabetes.

Because data on the safety and efficacy of the use of other noninsulin antihyperglycemic medications (apart from those discussed above) during pregnancy, including the use of incretin-based therapies during pregnancy, are not yet available, we do not recommend their use in this setting.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1177Wu7S]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, particularly concerning oral hypoglycemics, the ES 2013 guidelines recommend considering glyburide (glibenclamide) as a suitable alternative to insulin therapy. This is suggested for glycemic control in patients with gestational diabetes who fail to achieve sufficient control following a one-week trial of medical nutrition therapy and exercise, except in the following cases:

- **Diagnosis of gestational diabetes before 25 weeks gestation**: In such cases, glyburide may not be suitable.
- **Fasting plasma glucose levels > 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L)**: If levels exceed this threshold, insulin therapy is preferred.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^116Jmq4B]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, specifically concerning oral hypoglycemics, the ES/ESE 2025 guidelines recommend considering the discontinuation of GLP-1 receptor agonists before conception in patients with T2DM rather than waiting until between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester.

- **Sudden discontinuation**: Recognize that sudden discontinuation of GLP-1 receptor agonists may cause hyperglycemia and weight gain, increasing the risk for congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion. Ensure timely transition and titration of alternative antihyperglycemic agents after discontinuing GLP-1 receptor agonists to minimize hyperglycemia.

- **Timing of discontinuation**: Individualize the timing of discontinuation prior to pregnancy based on the anticipated likelihood of conception after discontinuing contraception, the type of GLP-1 receptor agonist used, and the risks of prolonged time off GLP-1 receptor agonists prior to pregnancy.

- **Active management**: Provide active management of glycemia after GLP-1 receptor agonist discontinuation.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: Update on screening, diagnosis, and management [^115fwbWh]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the use of glipizide XL PO (also known as Glucotrol XL) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, consider safer alternatives. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for hypoglycemia. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. Discontinue glipizide, if being used during pregnancy, at least 4 weeks before the expected delivery date to decrease the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia.

The drug glipizide XL PO (also known as Glucotrol XL) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### International association of diabetes and pregnancy study groups recommendations on the diagnosis and classification of hyperglycemia in pregnancy [^113k8xAV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

These recommendations have widespread implications. The strategy outlined in Table 2 will finally lead to using a 75-g glucose dose for an OGTT in all clinical settings in or outside of pregnancy. In some regions and/or countries, this represents a substantial change in long-established practices. Glucose testing early in pregnancy to detect overt diabetes and again with a 75-g OGTT at 24–28 weeks of gestation in all pregnancies not already diagnosed with overt diabetes or GDM by early testing represents fundamental changes in strategies for detection and diagnosis of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. In most areas, using the outcome-linked diagnostic criteria in Table 1 and the detection strategy in Table 2 will substantially increase the frequency of hyperglycemic disorders in pregnancy. However, this is consistent with the high prevalence of obesity and disorders of glucose metabolism in the general population of young adults and with recent reports of a rising prevalence of GDM and preexisting overt diabetes in pregnant women.

In future clinical practice, simpler and more cost-effective strategies that do not require performing an OGTT on most pregnant women may be developed. In the HAPO study, risks of some adverse outcomes were low when FPG was ≤ 4.4 mmol/l (80 mg/dl). However, it was thought that using FPG to potentially identify pregnancies at very low risk for GDM and for adverse outcomes requires further evaluation. Similarly, further evaluation of A1C results from the HAPO study, results from other populations, and further exploration is needed.

### The use of glucose-lowering medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy in the United States [^114PWa8W]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Some guidelines allow for the use of either insulin or noninsulin antidiabetic agents for gestational diabetes, but only insulin is recommended for pregnant women with preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to document treatment patterns in routine care for women with preexisting T2DM.

- **Methods**: We identified pregnancy cohorts within two U.S. claims databases for publicly and privately insured individuals: the Medicaid Analytical eXtract (2000–2014) and OptumClinformatics (2004–2014). T2DM was classified with a validated algorithm using ICD-9-CM and CPT codes. We assessed medication usage over the years of the study and changes in medication use before and after the beginning of pregnancy, using prescription fills as a proxy for the use of insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, and other noninsulin antidiabetic agents before pregnancy and during each trimester.

- **Results**: Among 12,631 women with T2DM, insulin use during pregnancy was stable over the study years (55%-60% in the 2nd trimester), but 2nd trimester use of metformin increased from less than 5% to 20%. Over the study period, 41% of women filled a prescription for metformin before pregnancy, 37% in the 1st trimester, and 17% in the 2nd trimester. By the 2nd trimester, few women used sulphonylureas (11%) or other noninsulin antidiabetic agents (1%). Of the women on metformin only before pregnancy, 36% switched to insulin only by the 2nd trimester, 11% added insulin, and 16% continued on metformin only. Of the women on metformin and insulin before pregnancy, 61% switched to insulin only by the 2nd trimester.

### Metformin versus placebo in obese pregnant women without diabetes mellitus [^1129Y4R1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Obesity is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Lifestyle-intervention studies have not shown improved outcomes. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, and in pregnant patients with gestational diabetes, it leads to less weight gain than occurs in those who do not take metformin.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned pregnant women without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of more than 35 to receive metformin, at a dose of 3.0 g per day, or placebo (225 women in each group) from 12 to 18 weeks of gestation until delivery. The BMI was calculated at the time of study entry (12 to 18 weeks of gestation). The primary outcome was a reduction in the median neonatal birth-weight z score by 0.3 SD (equivalent to a 50% reduction, from 20% to 10%, in the incidence of large-for-gestational-age neonates). Secondary outcomes included maternal gestational weight gain and the incidence of gestational diabetes and of preeclampsia, as well as the incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes. Randomization was performed with the use of computer-generated random numbers. The analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

- **Results**: A total of 50 women withdrew consent during the trial, which left 202 women in the metformin group and 198 in the placebo group. There was no significant between-group difference in the median neonatal birth-weight z score (0.05 in the metformin group [interquartile range, -0.71 to 0.92] and 0.

Regarding patient education for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, the ES/ESE 2025 guidelines recommend asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit in patients with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant. It is advised to address screening for pregnancy intent at urgent care or emergency room visits when clinically appropriate. Recognize that a critical component of preconception care is the optimization of glycemia to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital malformations. Provide basic counseling about the benefits of preconception care, evaluate contraception needs, and/or refer for family planning, and refer for preconception care to achieve therapy goals.

### Interventions in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum periods to optimise care and health outcomes: A systematic review [^111f19Bd]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

This review aimed to evaluate and synthesize RCT evidence for the optimal approach to managing women with Type 2 diabetes in the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum periods. Our findings highlight a paucity of specifically tailored interventions for women of reproductive age with Type 2 diabetes, particularly in the pre-pregnancy and postpartum periods. Studies primarily targeted glycemia management, with a lack of emphasis on other aspects of optimized care. This review was also limited by studies that were inadequately designed, statistically powered, or reported.

There was limited high-quality RCT evidence, with most studies being small, underpowered, or lacking a power calculation, as well as poor reporting of methodology and outcomes. However, in a well-designed large study conducted with women with Type 2 diabetes, Feig et al. demonstrated safety and maternal and neonatal benefits when metformin was added to a standard insulin regimen. There was no evidence of adverse fetal/neonatal events (primary outcome), with improvements in glycemia, less insulin needed, less weight gain, and fewer Caesarean sections compared to placebo, as well as reduced neonatal adiposity and LGA. However, there were more SGA infants (a secondary outcome). A small subgroup analysis of this study exploring the effect of metformin in individuals with both Type 2 diabetes and PCOS suggested worse outcomes in this group; however, further investigation is needed. Two studies aimed to compare metformin versus insulin for the management of hyperglycemia.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^115GhUfy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Other, smaller clinical trials have studied the short-term efficacy and safety of metformin versus insulin in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) pregnancies. Most have demonstrated a reduction in gestational weight gain (GWG) with metformin use. Some have mirrored the EMERGE findings of lower mean birth weights and fewer large for gestational age (LGA) infants in the metformin groups. No other studies have replicated the increased preterm birth risk seen in the MiG trial. Comparisons between these studies are limited by the heterogeneity in inclusion criteria, ethnicities, GDM diagnostic criteria, treatment targets, and outcome measures in each study. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses continue to be published regularly in this area, though none have yet incorporated the results from the EMERGE or SUGAR-DIP trials.

- **Systematic reviews and meta-analyses**: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of metformin use in GDM pregnancies, published in the last three years, are summarized in Table 3.

The term pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) refers to diabetes in pregnancy that existed prior to conception. The main type of PGDM encountered in clinical practice is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with fewer cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or rarer forms of diabetes, such as monogenic diabetes. The prevalence of PGDM, particularly T2DM, has increased substantially in recent decades among women of childbearing age. Tight glycaemic management before and during pregnancy is required to mitigate the associated risks of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including gestational diabetes.

### Safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other second-line antidiabetics in early pregnancy [^113BeKZd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Question**: Is periconceptional use of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or other noninsulin second-line antidiabetic medications (ADMs) associated with increased risk of major congenital malformations?

- **Findings**: This multinational population-based cohort study of more than 50,000 pregnant women with type 2 diabetes and their infants did not find a greater risk of malformations after periconceptional use of sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors compared with insulin.

- **Meaning**: Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other noninsulin second-line ADMs has increased in pregnancy, and in this first large study on their teratogenic risk in humans, results provide initial reassurance of their safety.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115VDEaY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Our objective was to formulate a clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnant women with diabetes. The task force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

One group meeting, several conference calls, and numerous email communications enabled consensus for all recommendations, except one, where a majority decision was employed. Using an evidence-based approach, this Diabetes and Pregnancy Clinical Practice Guideline addresses important clinical issues in the contemporary management of women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes preconceptionally, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum setting, and in the diagnosis and management of women with gestational diabetes during and after pregnancy.

### Prevalence, trends, and patterns of use of antidiabetic medications among pregnant women, 2001–2007 [^113oND3w]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe the prevalence, trends, and patterns in the use of antidiabetic medications to treat hyperglycemia and insulin resistance before and during pregnancy in a large U.S. cohort of insured pregnant women.

- **Methods**: Pregnancies resulting in live births were identified (N = 437,950) from 2001 to 2007 among 372,543 females aged 12–50 years at delivery from ten health maintenance organizations participating in the Medication Exposure in Pregnancy Risk Evaluation Program. Information for these descriptive analyses, including all antidiabetic medications dispensed during this period, was extracted from electronic health records and newborn birth certificates.

- **Results**: A little more than 1% (1.21%) of deliveries were to women dispensed antidiabetic medication in the 120 days before pregnancy. Use of antidiabetic medications before pregnancy increased from 0.66% of deliveries in 2001 to 1.66% of deliveries in 2007 (p < 0.001) due to an increase in metformin use. Most women using metformin before pregnancy had a diagnosis code for polycystic ovary syndrome or female infertility (67.2%), whereas only 13.6% had a diagnosis code for diabetes. The use of antidiabetic medications during the second or third trimester of pregnancy increased from 2.8% of deliveries in 2001 to 3.6% in 2007 (p < 0.001). Approximately two-thirds (68%) of women using metformin before pregnancy did not use any antidiabetic medications during pregnancy.

- **Conclusions**: Antidiabetic medication use before and during pregnancy increased from 2001 to 2007, possibly due to the increasing prevalence of gestational diabetes.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^113VHnm9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

This recommendation is based on indirect evidence drawn from studies conducted in both the general population and in women with diabetes. In the general population, the availability of free contraception has been shown to effectively prevent unplanned pregnancies and terminations. Among women living with diabetes, observational data has shown that preconception care (PCC), including contraception as a key component, has a clinically significant association with first-trimester HbA1c and with the rate of congenital malformations. A causal relation is accepted, supported by the plausibility of the observed associations.

To support the conditional recommendation, the guideline development panel placed high importance on women's perspectives of the acceptability of the use and types of contraception. They recognize that this acceptability is variable, influenced by personal beliefs, perspectives of significant others, and dynamic throughout a woman's lifespan.

- **Comments**: Among individuals with diabetes who could become pregnant, there are three important subgroups to consider: (i) adolescent girls/young women; (ii) women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as previously discussed; and (iii) women with diabetes and obesity. Women with diabetes and accompanying obesity require special consideration due to the high prevalence of the association and the potential impact of obesity on the effectiveness and undesirable effects of contraceptive methods.

Universally, clinician counseling about contraception should be noncoercive and patient-centered. Shared decision-making should prioritize an individual's autonomy.

### Safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other second-line antidiabetics in early pregnancy [^112bsPbH]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The study population was restricted to pregnancies resulting in live births because information on MCM was not available or was only partially available for pregnancies that resulted in stillbirth, miscarriage, or termination. Conditioning on live birth might introduce selection bias and potentially underestimate the RRs only if MCMs were more lethal or preferentially terminated in pregnancies exposed to specific ADMs relative to those exposed to insulin; however, to our knowledge, there are currently no studies that have investigated whether there is evidence toward this. Evaluating the potential effect of noninsulin ADM on fertility, miscarriages, or pregnancy termination is challenging and beyond the scope of this study.

Despite including data from six countries, the number of infants exposed to specific second-line noninsulin ADM classes remained low during the study period, and thus, the estimates were imprecise, with the upper limits of the 95% CI including up to a 2-fold increased risk. Although this study is valuable because there is no available information on the teratogenicity of these medications in humans and results are reassuring that these drugs are not major teratogens, confirmation from other studies is needed. Because the use of these medications is becoming more common for the treatment of T2D and for other indications (i.e. obesity), the number of infants with prenatal exposure will increase.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116PM5dB]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the use of metformin PO (also known as Riomet) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. The ACOG guidelines suggest metformin as a second-line choice for patients who decline insulin or are unable to safely administer it. The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend discontinuing metformin, when used to treat PCOS and induce ovulation, by the end of the first trimester. The drug metformin PO (also known as Riomet) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. Importantly, these effects may be reversible.

### The use of glucose-lowering medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy in the United States [^112KhB3W]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

- **Principal findings**: In a large cohort of publicly and privately insured US women with T2DM, metformin was the most frequently dispensed antidiabetic medication in the 90 days before pregnancy. The prescription for metformin declined throughout pregnancy, and insulin monotherapy was the most prevalent treatment by the second trimester. However, the use of metformin during pregnancy more than doubled between 2000 and 2014, while insulin use was stable. Treatment combinations of insulin with other non-insulin antidiabetic medications, predominantly metformin, also increased over time. Women on metformin monotherapy before pregnancy often switched to, or added, insulin, while those on insulin monotherapy rarely added metformin. The smaller number of women on the combination of metformin and insulin before pregnancy tended to stay on the combination. Sulphonylurea prescriptions were less common but remained stable both throughout pregnancy and over time. The use of antidiabetic medications other than insulin, metformin, and sulphonylureas before pregnancy was low, and most women switched to insulin early in pregnancy.

Our results are consistent with other recent studies describing increases in the use of non-insulin antidiabetic medications in pregnancy. We observed that metformin was the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic medication before pregnancy, which differs from studies in which insulin was more prevalent; this discrepancy is likely due to differences in the definition of pregestational diabetes used in other studies, which allowed for inclusion of women.

### Metformin use in the first trimester of pregnancy and risk for nonlive birth and congenital malformations: Emulating a target trial using real-world data [^113ULwyE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Metformin is a first-line pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes, but there is limited evidence about its safety in early pregnancy.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the teratogenicity of metformin use in the first trimester of pregnancy.

- **Design**: In an observational cohort of pregnant women with pregestational type 2 diabetes receiving metformin monotherapy before the last menstrual period (LMP), a target trial with two treatment strategies was emulated: insulin monotherapy (discontinue metformin treatment and initiate insulin within 90 days of LMP) or insulin plus metformin (continue metformin and initiate insulin within 90 days of LMP).

- **Setting**: U.S. Medicaid health care administration database (2000 to 2018).

- **Participants**: 12,489 pregnant women who met the eligibility criteria.

- **Measurements**: The risk and risk ratio of nonlive births, live births with congenital malformations, and congenital malformations among live births were estimated using standardization to adjust for covariates.

- **Results**: A total of 850 women were in the insulin monotherapy group and 1,557 in the insulin plus metformin group. The estimated risk for nonlive birth was 32.7% under insulin monotherapy and 34.3% under insulin plus metformin (risk ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04]). The estimated risk for live birth with congenital malformations was 8.0% (CI, 5.7% to 10.2%) under insulin monotherapy and 5.7% (CI, 4.5% to 7.3%) under insulin plus metformin (risk ratio, 0.72 [CI, 0.51 to 1.09]).

- **Limitation**: Possible residual confounding by glycemic control and body mass index.

- **Evidence (2.3a–c)**: Plasma glucose acts as a continuous variable in exerting its effects on the fetus. Even mild hyperglycemia alters the normal metabolic adaptation to pregnancy, and correction of maternal hyperglycemia reduces or prevents adverse outcomes.

	- Lifestyle therapy for gestational diabetes results in a lower incidence of reduced birth weight, large-for-gestational-age births, and preeclampsia. Both aerobic exercise and non-weight-bearing exercise have been shown to lower blood glucose levels in women with gestational diabetes.

	- Blood glucose-lowering pharmacological therapy is effective at improving outcomes in women with gestational diabetes whose hyperglycemia does not respond sufficiently to lifestyle therapy. See Section 5.0 for a discussion on blood glucose-lowering pharmacological therapy during pregnancy.

- **Postpartum care (2.4a)**: We recommend that postpartum care for women who have had gestational diabetes should include measurement of fasting plasma glucose or fasting self-monitored blood glucose for 24 to 72 hours after delivery to rule out ongoing hyperglycemia.

- **Postpartum care (2.4b)**: We recommend that a 2-hour, 75-g OGTT should be undertaken 6 to 12 weeks after delivery in women with gestational diabetes to rule out prediabetes or diabetes. If results are normal, we recommend this or other diagnostic tests for diabetes should be repeated periodically as well as before future pregnancies.

- **Postpartum care (2.4c)**: We suggest the child's birth weight and whether or not the child was born to a mother with gestational diabetes become part of the child's permanent health record.

### The use of oral hypoglycaemic agents in pregnancy [^1124yC6o]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

While insulin has been the treatment of choice when lifestyle measures do not maintain glycaemic control during pregnancy, recent studies have suggested that certain oral hypoglycaemic agents may be safe and acceptable alternatives. With the exception of metformin and glibenclamide (glyburide), there are insufficient data to recommend treatment with any other oral hypoglycaemic agent during pregnancy. There are no serious safety concerns with metformin, despite it crossing the placenta. When used in the first trimester, there is no increase in congenital abnormalities, and there appears to be a reduction in miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, and subsequent gestational diabetes. Studies of the use of metformin in gestational diabetes show at least equivalent neonatal outcomes while reporting reductions in neonatal hypoglycaemia, maternal hypoglycaemia, and weight gain, alongside improved treatment satisfaction.

Glibenclamide effectively lowers blood glucose in women with gestational diabetes, possibly with a lower treatment failure rate than metformin. Although generally well tolerated, some studies have reported higher rates of pre-eclampsia, neonatal jaundice, longer stays in the neonatal care unit, macrosomia, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. There is a paucity of long-term follow-up data on children exposed to oral agents in utero. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have recommended that either metformin or glibenclamide can be used to treat gestational diabetes. Metformin is also recommended for use in the pre-conception period when necessary.

### The use of glucose-lowering medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy in the United States [^111MBMy9]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

We assessed diabetes medication use before pregnancy and during each trimester. The prepregnancy baseline period was defined as 90 days before the last menstrual period (LMP) date to the day before the LMP date (LMP‐90 to LMP‐1). The first trimester was defined as LMP to day 90 of pregnancy (LMP to LMP + 90), the second trimester as days 91–180 after LMP (LMP + 91 to LMP + 180), and the third trimester as the period between day 181 and the delivery date (LMP + 181 to delivery).

We categorized antidiabetic medications or classes as insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, and other noninsulin antidiabetic agents. The latter category includes thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1 RA), pramlintide, and meglitinides. Women were considered to have used the medication of interest if they filled a prescription in the relevant pregnancy period, and those who used a combination product were considered users of both products (e.g. a prescription for glyburide/metformin HCl would be counted in both the metformin and sulphonylurea groups).

We also defined eight mutually exclusive exposure groups based on the most frequently observed treatment strategies: no pharmacological treatment, metformin only, insulin only, metformin and insulin, sulphonylureas only, sulphonylureas and metformin, sulphonylureas and other noninsulin antidiabetic drugs, and "other" that included any pregnancies whose pharmacological.

### Anti-diabetic drug utilization of pregnant diabetic women in US managed care [^112CCGBB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

In general, the use of insulin to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy is accepted and recommended as safe and effective in achieving normal blood glucose levels. There is also sufficient evidence to support that metformin is non-inferior to insulin with regards to neonatal safety, but comparative data regarding efficacy during pregnancy are lacking. Furthermore, the majority of the metformin safety studies have been completed in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome or gestational diabetes, not in women with pre-existing diabetes, and have not evaluated pregnancy outcomes (pre-term labor, preeclampsia, cesarean section delivery) as safety endpoints.

The distinct increase of sulfonylureas use during pregnancy observed in this cohort was noteworthy in this context because this drug class is currently not recommended for this indication, including an FDA contraindication for use in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy. This notwithstanding, several studies have found no harmful effects and report good glycemic control with the use of sulfonylureas during pregnancy. Again, the majority of studies on the use of this drug class in pregnancy address the use in gestational diabetic women and lack evidence on various aspects of safety and efficacy.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^116cyxtA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In the absence of direct evidence supporting the safety of continued use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) during pregnancy, the GDP recommended discontinuing GLP-1RAs before pregnancy. The preconception use of GLP-1RAs in women with obesity aims to decrease excessive weight before pregnancy and reduce adverse perinatal complications, such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and fetal overgrowth. These serve important goals. Decreasing weight and improving the metabolic condition of women with obesity is being assessed currently, using the lifestyle interventions of a healthy diet and increased physical activity.

The manufacturer prescribing recommendations for some GLP-1RAs suggest stopping therapy before conception due to early pregnancy losses and fetal abnormalities in animal studies when exposed during organogenesis. This coincided with marked maternal body weight loss. However, this approach has a risk for harm if no proactive attention to glycemic management is in place or discontinuation occurs in the absence of active pregnancy plans. Effective coordination of care in both the preconception period and early pregnancy is needed with discontinuation of GLP-1RAs, and glucose should be immediately and actively monitored.

Although the percentage of unintended pregnancies in the United States declined from 43.3% in 2010 to 41.6% in 2019, approximately 40% remain unintended. Women of childbearing age on GLP-1RAs who are not planning pregnancy, even with a history of infertility, should use effective contraception to minimize unplanned pregnancies. A recent literature review addresses these concerns and emphasizes the need for improved guidance.

Regarding patient education for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, specifically concerning general counseling, the ES 2013 guidelines recommend providing postpartum counseling to all patients with a history of gestational diabetes. This counseling should address lifestyle measures to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), highlight the importance of planning future pregnancies, and emphasize the need for regular diabetes screening, especially before any future pregnancies.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1178efqL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, important new research has emerged in the field of diabetes and pregnancy. This guideline has been developed to address and distill this burgeoning literature with the goal of assisting healthcare providers to best manage their pregnant patients living with overt or gestational diabetes using contemporary, evidence-based strategies.

In this guideline, all references to diabetes specifically and exclusively refer to diabetes mellitus. Also, unless stated otherwise, the terms diabetes, overt diabetes, and pregestational diabetes refer to either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

We use the traditional term gestational diabetes to describe what has customarily been defined as "any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first definition during pregnancy", while acknowledging that the more contemporary term hyperglycemia in pregnancy has strong merit as a more appropriate term. We have retained the longstanding term (gestational diabetes) owing to its widespread familiarity and traditional usage.

Select thyroid recommendations in this diabetes and pregnancy guideline are included as they relate specifically to thyroid disease in pregnant women with diabetes. See the 2012 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on pregnancy and thyroid disease for a detailed discussion on this topic.

This guideline advocates for the use of best practices based on an analysis of contemporary (and older) medical literature. It is, however, recognized that cost considerations and other practical realities may not necessarily allow for implementation.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115Yqjmi]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the use of metformin ER PO (also known as Fortamet, Glumetza) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. The ACOG guidelines suggest metformin as a second-line choice in patients declining insulin or unable to safely administer insulin. The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend discontinuing metformin, when used to treat PCOS and induce ovulation, by the end of the first trimester. The drug metformin ER PO is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Oral anti-diabetic agents for women with established diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes planning pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes [^112EPSzF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

While most guidance recommends the use of insulin in women whose pregnancies are affected by pre-existing diabetes, oral anti-diabetic agents may be more acceptable to women. The effects of these oral anti-diabetic agents on maternal and infant health outcomes need to be established in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, as well as in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus preconceptionally or during a subsequent pregnancy. This review is an update of a review that was first published in 2010.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the effects of oral anti-diabetic agents in women with established diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or previous gestational diabetes who are planning a pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes, on maternal and infant health. The use of oral anti-diabetic agents for the management of gestational diabetes in pregnancy is evaluated in a separate Cochrane Review.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of oral anti-diabetic agents in women with established diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or previous gestational diabetes who were planning a pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. Cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, but none were identified.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of DUETACT in pediatric patients have not been established. DUETACT is not recommended for use in pediatric patients based on adverse effects observed in adults, including fluid retention, congestive heart failure, fractures, and urinary bladder tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8)].

- **Glimepiride**: The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of glimepiride have been evaluated in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes. Glimepiride is not recommended in pediatric patients because of its adverse effects on body weight and hypoglycemia. The pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg single dose of glimepiride were evaluated in 30 patients with type 2 diabetes (male = 7; female = 23) between ages 10 and 17 years. The mean (± SD) AUC (0-last) (339 ± 203 ng•hr/mL), Cmax (102 ± 48 ng/mL), and t1/2 (3.1 ± 1.7 hours) for glimepiride were comparable to historical data from adults (AUC (0-last) 315 ± 96 ng•hr/mL, Cmax 103 ± 34 ng/mL, and t1/2 5.3 ± 4.1 hours).

### Quality of medical care in diabetic women undergoing fertility treatment: We should do better [^114KkraF]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

As for potentially teratogenic drugs, we chose to examine the use of only those drugs that are commonly used by diabetic women and for which there is a firm recommendation to stop using before conception. One might argue that a woman can fill a prescription and still not use the medication; thus, prospective evaluation of harmful medication use might be lower than what we reported. However, these women should have received guidance to stop using these drugs prior to conception and, thus, should not have filled prescriptions for potentially teratogenic drugs in the month after fertility treatment when they might be pregnant. Use of potentially harmful medications in early pregnancy should be negligible, especially among women who undergo fertility treatment.

In conclusion, we found that the medical care of diabetic women who undergo fertility treatment is suboptimal and needs improvement. Moreover, diabetic women who used assisted reproduction techniques were not better prepared for pregnancy compared with diabetic women with spontaneous pregnancy. Preconception care and counseling is a form of primary prevention that includes three components: risk assessment, health promotion, and intervention to improve pregnancy outcome. Couples who are referred to an infertility unit invest a lot of effort into conceiving. These women are highly motivated in their desire to achieve a pregnancy and, thus, represent an ideal group for preconception care. Therefore, it is astonishing that less than one-quarter of these patients prepared themselves for pregnancy by taking folic acid regularly.

### Oral hypoglycemic agents and the pregnant diabetic: "From bench to bedside" [^112dFrgz]. Seminars in Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

The criteria for diagnosis and treatment have evolved into an evidence-based medicine approach. The need for evidence-based information is especially critical in the management of gestational diabetes, particularly regarding the use of oral hypoglycemic agents. These agents have been categorically contraindicated for decades in the United States, based on anecdotal or weak evidence for these recommendations.

In this article, the similarities between gestational and type 2 diabetes are described, and the rationale for using oral hypoglycemic agents for the treatment of both is discussed. The author demonstrates how research from basic sciences (such as placental transfers) to clinical studies (like perinatal outcomes) can lead to significant evidence on which to base management recommendations.

### The use of glucose-lowering medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy in the United States [^116LNRAe]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

There are several possible explanations for the observed increase in metformin use during pregnancy. First, as many pregnancies are unplanned, changes to pre-pregnancy medication regimens often occur during pregnancy. Metformin and newer noninsulin drugs are established treatments in the nonpregnant T2DM population, and late recognition of pregnancy or lack of preconception counseling may lead to continuation of these medications into pregnancy.

Consistent with this hypothesis, transitions to guideline‐recommended treatments are not occurring before pregnancy for many women in our study, which may result in first trimester fetal exposure to medications with unknown safety profiles and/or suboptimal glycemic control in early pregnancy. Second, because women with T2DM often have insulin resistance that worsens during pregnancy, they may require high doses of insulin to achieve euglycemia. The possibility that metformin in combination with insulin may help pregnant women with T2DM achieve glycemic control without high doses of insulin has been embraced by many clinicians and is the subject of two randomized trials.

- **The MiTy trial**: Evaluated the addition of metformin to a standard insulin regimen among pregnant women with T2DM enrolled between 6 and 20 weeks of gestation and found no differences in neonatal mortality or serious morbidity, as well as a significant benefit in the metformin group for glycemic control, lower insulin requirements, less gestational weight gain, and fewer caesarean births. Infants in the metformin group weighed less, which resulted in both fewer infants born with high birth weight and improved birth outcomes.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116PGjVc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

- **Preconception care of women with diabetes**:

- **Preconception counseling**: We recommend that preconception counseling be provided to all women with diabetes who are considering pregnancy.

- **Evidence**: Women with diabetes who receive preconception counseling have better preconception glycemic control and are more likely to have favorable pregnancy outcomes, including lower rates of congenital anomalies and spontaneous abortions. By the time a woman knows she is pregnant, much fetal organogenesis has typically been completed.

- **Remarks**: Preconception counseling can optimally be provided by a multidisciplinary team that includes the diabetes specialist, diabetes educator, dietitian, obstetrician, and other healthcare providers, as indicated. If possible, and with the patient's consent, the woman's partner can be included as part of a supportive and mentoring therapeutic relationship. Preconception counseling should include a discussion regarding the need for pregnancy to be planned and to occur only when the woman has sufficient glycemic control, has had appropriate assessment and management of comorbidities including hypertension and retinopathy, has discontinued potentially unsafe medications during pregnancy, and has been taking appropriate folate supplementation beforehand. This discussion should also address the importance of smoking cessation and the major time commitment and effort required by the patient in both self-management and engagement with the healthcare team, both preconceptionally and during pregnancy.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^116CeKj8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Metformin in pregnancies affected by PCOS**: Pregnancies in women with PCOS are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, higher gestational weight gain (GWG), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, induction of labor, and Caesarean delivery. Given its insulin-sensitizing properties, metformin has the potential to improve outcomes in women with PCOS who are pregnant or trying to conceive. This role of metformin is reviewed in a separate manuscript in this special supplement.

- **Metformin for GDM prevention**: The role of metformin in GDM prevention has been studied in several trials of at-risk groups, mainly as a secondary outcome measure. Risk factors for the development of GDM include overweight or obesity, PCOS, advanced maternal age, non-European ethnicity, previous GDM, and family history of diabetes.

	- In pregnant women living with obesity, the EMPOWaR (Effect of Metformin on Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in Obese Pregnant Women) randomized controlled trial assigned 449 women living in the UK with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m² to either placebo or metformin from 12 to 16 weeks' gestation until delivery. Metformin did not impact the secondary outcome of GDM prevalence (18% vs. 24%; OR 0.728; 95% CI 0.414 to 1.283; p = 0.27). The MOP (Metformin in Obese Non-diabetic Pregnant Women) trial assigned women with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² to metformin or placebo from 12 to 18 weeks' gestation until delivery. Again, there was no significant difference in the risk of developing GDM (12.4% vs. 11.3%; OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.60 to 2.04; p = 0.74).

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^115GjB6w]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Metformin is well-established as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in non-pregnant individuals. The low cost, acceptability, and broad tolerability of metformin have also made it an attractive option for research into the treatment of other conditions associated with insulin resistance. Despite almost 50 years of clinical experience with the use of metformin to treat diabetes in pregnancy, many questions remain regarding its precise effectiveness in different maternal subgroups, as well as the potential short-term and long-term effects on the offspring.

In this narrative review, we present the evidence for the use of metformin during pregnancy in various maternal subgroups, including women living with overweight and obesity, women at risk of gestational diabetes, women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and women with pregestational diabetes, including type 2 diabetes. Our specific focus is on the impact of metformin on short-term maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We also consider the evidence for other emerging indications for metformin in pregnancy, such as the prevention and management of pre-eclampsia.

This article looks at research on how metformin use in pregnancy affects mothers and newborns in the short term. Doctors have prescribed metformin since the 1970s for the treatment of diabetes in pregnancy. Despite years of use, there are still questions about how safe and effective metformin is for mothers and their children. Metformin taken during pregnancy moves through the placenta into the fetus's bloodstream.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^1179wJRp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Risk summary: Limited data with metformin hydrochloride in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 5­ times, respectively, a 2550 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6–10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1C > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20–25% in women with a HbA1C > 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and other adverse outcomes.
