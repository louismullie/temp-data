## Question

Middle-aged man with acute chest/epigastric pain after recent endoscopy, vomiting, mild fever, tachycardia, chest crepitus, epigastric tenderness, and negative troponins/ECG.

A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe epigastric discomfort and left-sided chest pain radiating to the back that began after waking up. He has also vomited several times since the pain began. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy the previous day for evaluation of epigastric pain. He has ischemic heart disease and underwent a coronary angioplasty 3 years ago. His mother died of pancreatic cancer when she was 60 years old. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, ramipril, and rosuvastatin. He is pale, anxious, and diaphoretic. His temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg in his upper extremities and 108/68 mm Hg in his lower extremities. Pulse oximetry on room air shows oxygen saturation at 98%. An S4 is audible over the precordium, in addition to crepitus over the chest. Abdominal examination shows tenderness to palpation in the epigastric area. Serum studies show an initial Troponin I level of 0.031 ng/mL (N < 0.1 ng/mL) and 0.026 ng/mL 6 hours later. A 12-lead ECG shows sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T changes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer Choices:
A. Pneumothorax
B. Esophageal perforation
C. Aortic dissection
D. Acute myocardial infarction

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely in a 52-year-old man with severe chest/epigastric pain, vomiting, tachycardia, mild fever, chest crepitus, and recent EGD, given negative troponins and nonspecific ECG changes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate life threats and how the timing after endoscopy shifts pretest probabilities. Then, I should verify which physical finding is pathognomonic and what imaging confirms the diagnosis. Next, I will examine why the alternatives are less likely despite some overlapping features. Finally, I will outline the diagnostic test of choice and the urgency of intervention, anchoring to guideline-based recommendations and outcome data.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical clues and their implications. The chest crepitus indicates subcutaneous emphysema, which in this context strongly suggests air tracking from the mediastinum into the soft tissues, a hallmark of esophageal perforation rather than pneumothorax or myocardial ischemia, and the recent EGD provides a clear iatrogenic mechanism and timing that elevates suspicion for perforation substantially [^651cc15e] [^2482bbb7].

> Wait, let me verify the differential and not jump to conclusions. Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and crepitus, but the crepitus in pneumothorax is typically focal over the chest wall and accompanied by unilateral breath sounds or hyperresonance; here, the crepitus pattern and the recent endoscopy make esophageal perforation more compelling, and the absence of focal lung findings argues against a primary pneumothorax as the driver of crepitus in this case. Aortic dissection remains on the table given the radiation pattern and tachycardia, but the lack of a blood pressure differential between arms and legs and the presence of crepitus push me away from dissection as the primary diagnosis here, though I should still keep it in mind if the story evolves. Acute myocardial infarction is less likely because the troponins are not rising and the ECG is nonspecific, even though mild troponin elevations can be seen in noncoronary conditions; the clinical picture just doesn't fit ACS here.

> I need to check the pathophysiology and why the presentation fits. Iatrogenic esophageal perforation during EGD can occur via direct instrumental injury or barotrauma from insufflation and patient retching, allowing esophageal contents to leak into the mediastinum, causing mediastinitis, sepsis physiology with fever and tachycardia, and subcutaneous emphysema as air dissects into the neck and chest wall; delays in diagnosis are common and worsen outcomes, which underscores the need for rapid imaging and intervention [^651cc15e] [^e891db87] [^47ec7c33].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic test of choice and its contraindications. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and upper abdomen is the first-line modality to confirm esophageal perforation, assess the size and location of the leak, quantify mediastinal contamination, and guide management; water-soluble contrast is preferred if perforation is suspected, and barium should be avoided because it is contraindicated in suspected perforation due to mediastinal irritation and granulomatous reactions [^256fa9b0] [^76d34226] [^36638038] [^df136cbe].

> Let me consider management implications briefly to ensure the diagnosis changes practice. Early recognition and definitive management within 24 hours reduce morbidity and mortality; options include conservative care with antibiotics and drainage for stable, contained leaks, endoscopic closure with clips or stents for larger or nonhealing defects, and surgical repair for unstable patients or extensive contamination, with endoscopic therapy achieving high success in contemporary series when appropriately selected [^b37cb13b] [^e8685561] [^47ec7c33] [^36a72e15].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is esophageal perforation given the recent EGD, severe chest/epigastric pain, vomiting, tachycardia, mild fever, and especially the pathognomonic subcutaneous emphysema on exam. I should confirm with an urgent contrast-enhanced CT using water-soluble contrast and initiate early multidisciplinary management to prevent progression to mediastinitis and sepsis [^651cc15e] [^256fa9b0] [^76d34226].

The most likely diagnosis is **esophageal perforation** (Boerhaave syndrome) [^b37cb13b] given the recent EGD, severe chest/epigastric pain, vomiting, subcutaneous emphysema (crepitus), and systemic inflammatory response (tachycardia, mild fever) [^e8685561]. The negative troponins and nonspecific ECG exclude acute MI, and the absence of a blood pressure differential makes aortic dissection less likely. Immediate **contrast-enhanced CT** of the chest and abdomen is the diagnostic test of choice to confirm perforation and guide urgent management [^256fa9b0] [^76d34226].

---

## Clinical features supporting esophageal perforation

- **Recent EGD**: Iatrogenic perforation is the most common cause of esophageal perforation, accounting for up to 59% of cases [^e891db87] [^651cc15e].
- **Severe chest and epigastric pain**: Chest pain is the cardinal symptom of esophageal perforation, often radiating to the back or abdomen [^651cc15e].
- **Vomiting**: Forceful emesis increases intraluminal pressure, predisposing to spontaneous rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) [^b37cb13b].
- **Subcutaneous emphysema (crepitus)**: Air leakage into the mediastinum and subcutaneous tissues is a hallmark of esophageal perforation [^2482bbb7].
- **Systemic inflammatory response**: Tachycardia and mild fever are common due to mediastinitis and sepsis [^e891db87].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

| **Option** | **Rationale for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Pneumothorax | - Unlikely due to absence of characteristic pleuritic pain <br/> - Decreased breath sounds <br/> - And hyperresonance on examination [^notfound] |
| Aortic dissection | - Less likely due to absence of blood pressure differential between upper and lower extremities <br/> - And lack of characteristic tearing pain [^notfound] |
| Acute myocardial infarction | - Excluded by negative troponins and nonspecific ECG changes [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Immediate **contrast-enhanced CT** of the chest and abdomen is the diagnostic test of choice to confirm esophageal perforation, assess the extent of mediastinal contamination, and guide management [^256fa9b0] [^76d34226]. Water-soluble contrast (e.g. gastrografin) is preferred over barium due to lower risk of mediastinal inflammation if extravasation occurs [^notfound].

---

## Management implications

Esophageal perforation is a **surgical emergency** requiring prompt intervention to prevent mediastinitis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure [^b37cb13b]. Management options include:

- **Conservative management**: Appropriate for small, contained perforations without systemic instability, involving nil per os, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and close monitoring [^notfound].
- **Endoscopic therapy**: Clips, stents, or endoscopic suturing are effective for selected cases, particularly in patients unfit for surgery [^e8685561] [^47ec7c33].
- **Surgical repair**: Indicated for large perforations, systemic instability, or failed conservative/endoscopic management [^b37cb13b].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **esophageal perforation** (Boerhaave syndrome) given the recent EGD, severe chest/epigastric pain, vomiting, subcutaneous emphysema, and systemic inflammatory response. Immediate contrast-enhanced CT is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide urgent management [^256fa9b0].

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare but underrecognized cause of acute coronary syndrome. It is mostly reported in female patients. In this report, however, we describe this rare and unique case of multivessel SCAD in a 52-year-old man. He was presented with chest pain, significant elevated cardiac troponin level, and T-wave changes in electrocardiogram. Coronary angiography showed multivessel SCAD involving his circumflex and right coronary arteries. The patient was conservatively managed. He has recovered well and was discharged a week after admission. Coronary angiography is still considered the gold standard for diagnosis of multivessel SCAD. Conservative treatment is recommended in most conditions unless there is a necessity for interventional treatment.

### High-sensitivity troponin elevation in a young woman with typical chest pain: the heart of the matter [^b900b302]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the era of high-sensitivity troponin, minor elevations are often attributed to noncardiac etiologies. However, in patients who present with characteristic symptoms, any troponin elevation is concerning. We detail a case of a 37-y-old woman who presented to an outside hospital with typical chest pain and had a mild elevation in high-sensitivity troponin. Given her overall stability, she was discharged with outpatient cardiology follow-up. 82 Rb PET/CT myocardial perfusion imaging test demonstrated a large, reversible anteroseptal perfusion defect. Coronary angiography revealed severe (80%) stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery treated with a single stent. This case highlights the need to have a high index of suspicion in young people with minor troponin elevations and pursue timely imaging.

Discussion

In recent years, conservative and endoscopic approaches have become popular for managing EPs. This retrospective study aimed to report our 17-year experience with this life-threatening condition across three sites, and compare different endoscopic methods and the conservative approach in the management of EP.

In our cohort, the mean age was 63.7 ± 15.3 years, which is notably higher than that reported in previous studies. A systematic review of 1,319 studies on acute esophageal perforations, encompassing 2,830 cases, found an average patient age of 58.4 years. Regarding gender, studies have consistently shown that this condition is more prevalent in males, and 65.3% of our sample were males. The most common etiology of esophageal perforation in our cohort was iatrogenic, accounting for 58.3% of cases. This is consistent with prior studies that identified iatrogenic factors as responsible for up to 59% of esophageal perforations. In our population, the most common site of perforation was the distal esophagus (67.6%). This finding aligns with some studies, though the predominant site of esophageal perforation remains a topic of debate.

Patients with EP can present with a variety of symptoms, making diagnosis challenging and requiring a high index of suspicion. Notably, a missed diagnosis that was first made at autopsy has been reported in 17% of cases. In our study population, the most common symptoms at diagnosis were dysphagia (27.8%) and chest pain (22.2%), both of which are nonspecific and can stem from a wide variety of conditions. Notably, the SIRS criteria were met at the time of presentation in 44.4% of our patients, which is considerably higher than the 23.3% reported in a systematic review of 898 patients with EP. Despite these challenges, we found that the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 0 days, and the median time from diagnosis to treatment was only 0.5 days. This prompt response is critical, as delays can significantly increase the risk of serious complications, including sepsis, mediastinitis, multiorgan failure, and even mortality.

### Hypoglossal nerve stimulator lead extrusion into the pharynx [^41ad902a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first reported case of extrusion of HNS lead into the pharynx. All prior reports of lead extrusion have been through the neck incision, and successful reimplantation without infection has been reported. Other cervical foreign bodies have been reported to erode into the pharynx. Iatrogenic esophageal injury or thinning during anterior cervical disc fusion can lead to perforation/erosion. Vascular stents have also extruded into the pharynx, most commonly in patients previously treated with radiation, but also in the posttonsillectomy hemorrhage setting. Other than prior irradiation, there are no established risk factors for foreign body/implant erosion into the pharynx. Our patient did have multiple pharyngeal instrumentations (4 EGDs, 52F bougie during Nissen, and 1 intubation) within 9 months postimplantation, which could have increased pressure between the pharynx and the lead. There were no signs of complication during initial implantation; initial EGDs did not show lead extrusion; and neck exploration at the time of explantation showed the anchor secured to the digastric tendon. Together, these suggest that migration was not secondary to deep/medial tunneling.

Given the patient's desire for continued HNS therapy and her left‐sided cardiac pacemaker, we elected to attempt to preserve her current device. The device and leads did not seem grossly infected at the time of electrode explant, thus we elected to just remove the central portion of the electrode, keeping the pin in the header and the cuff on the nerve. The patient was discharged on antibiotics with no signs of infection after surgery. The patient was successfully reimplanted 3 months postoperatively without signs of infection. While this case did not show signs of deep neck space infection, this could represent an esophageal perforation and postoperative monitoring for signs of deep infection and mediastinitis is prudent.

In conclusion, we present the first reported case of pharyngeal extrusion of the stimulator lead, a rare complication in HNS. A potential patient risk factor in this case is multiple pharyngeal instrumentations in the months following surgery. If the neck is not grossly infected, removal of only the stimulation lead allowed for preservation of the implantable pulse generator and facilitates reimplantation with decreased scarring.

### Treatment of boerhaave syndrome: experience from a tertiary center [^b37cb13b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common cause of esophageal perforation is iatrogenic, accounting for up to 70% of esophageal perforation, followed by trauma, spontaneous, and foreign body. Boerhaave syndrome, a rare yet life-threatening medical emergency, is characterized as a spontaneous esophageal perforation. It is typically associated with severe straining or vomiting, where a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure, combined with negative intrathoracic pressure (as in normal physiological state), leads to esophageal rupture. Boerhaave syndrome represents about 15% of esophageal perforations. Patients often present with non-specific symptoms, leading to a high incidence of initial misdiagnosis. Typically, the perforation leads to mediastinitis due to the contamination of the mediastinal cavity from gastric contents and food, thereby leading to sepsis and potential multiple organ failure and a high mortality rate that varies from 11% up to 50%. The primary objectives in the management of Boerhaave syndrome include prompt sealing of the perforation, mediastinal and pleural or abdominal drainage combined with antibiotics to control the sepsis, and nutritional support.

Treatment decisions should be based on the patient's clinical condition upon presentation, current comorbidities, and time of diagnosis. Primary surgical repair, with or without the use of reinforcement flaps, is considered the standard procedure, but it is mainly limited to patients presenting within the first 24 h since the onset of symptoms. Other options include surgical drainage, with a preference for minimally invasive techniques. Ultimately, esophageal resection can be considered. Non-surgical strategies vary from conservative management with antibiotics to endoscopically placed stents or clips. The use of self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) is well established in the palliative treatment of malignant esophageal stenosis and has emerged as an alternative treatment option for benign esophageal strictures. In addition, many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of partially or fully covered SEMS, in managing upper gastrointestinal leaks. This technique was therefore increasingly used over the past years in our center.

Due to the rarity of Boerhaave syndrome, there are currently no definitive management guidelines. The objective of this study is to share the experience of a tertiary (referral) hospital in managing patients with Boerhaave syndrome over a span of 13 years and to provide clinical guidance.

Post-travel respiratory infections — clinical presentation and differential considerations — Most respiratory infections, especially those of the upper respiratory tract, are mild, whereas lower respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, can be more severe. Lower respiratory tract infections are more likely than upper respiratory tract infections to cause chest pain, dyspnea, or fever; cough is often present in either upper or lower respiratory tract infections; and rash may be present, especially in measles, rubella, and varicella. People with influenza commonly have acute onset of cough, fever, headache, and myalgias, and people with COVID-19 might have a similar clinical presentation but mild disease and asymptomatic infection also are common, with similar symptoms seen in bacterial infections including legionellosis. Consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of travelers who present with cough, dyspnea, tachycardia, or fever and pleurisy, especially those who have recently been on long car or plane trips.

### Naproxen (Ec-naproxen) [^3b51c1b4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including naproxen cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.

Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occured in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Rifampin [^8dae3b51]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Signs and Symptoms

Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pruritus, headache, and increasing lethargy will probably occur within a short time after ingestion; unconsciousness may occur when there is severe hepatic disease. Transient increases in liver enzymes and/or bilirubin may occur. Brownish-red or orange discoloration of the skin, urine, sweat, saliva, tears, and feces will occur, and its intensity is proportional to the amount ingested.

Liver enlargement, possibly with tenderness, can develop within a few hours after severe overdosage; bilirubin levels may increase and jaundice may develop rapidly. Hepatic involvement may be more marked in patients with prior impairment of hepatic function. Other physical findings remain essentially normal. A direct effect upon the hematopoietic system, electrolyte levels, or acid-base balance is unlikely.

Facial or periorbital edema has also been reported in pediatric patients. Hypotension, sinus tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, seizures, and cardiac arrest were reported in some fatal cases.

Acute Toxicity

The minimum acute lethal or toxic dose is not well established. However, nonfatal acute overdoses in adults have been reported with doses ranging from 9 to 12 gm rifampin. Fatal acute overdoses in adults have been reported with doses ranging from 14 to 60 gm. Alcohol or a history of alcohol abuse was involved in some of the fatal and nonfatal reports. Nonfatal overdoses in pediatric patients ages 1 to 4 years old of 100 mg/kg for one to two doses has been reported.

Treatment

Intensive support measures should be instituted and individual symptoms treated as they arise. The airway should be secured and adequate respiratory exchange established. Since nausea and vomiting are likely to be present, gastric lavage within the first 2 to 3 hours after ingestion is probably preferable to induction of emesis. Following evacuation of the gastric contents, the instillation of activated charcoal slurry into the stomach may help absorb any remaining drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Antiemetic medication may be required to control severe nausea and vomiting.

Active diuresis (with measured intake and output) will help promote excretion of the drug.

For severe cases, extracorporeal hemodialysis may be required. If this is not available, peritoneal dialysis can be used along with forced diuresis.

### Infection mimicking appendicitis case report: new differential diagnosis considerations [^55ee1153]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old female presented to urgent care with sharp, acute-on-chronic right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, which began the morning of presentation and persisted throughout the afternoon. Her mother described her as having difficulty ambulating due to the pain. They were unable to indicate whether the pain had migrated from the periumbilical region. She had abdominal pain that had been ongoing for the past 3 weeks with a waxing and waning presentation and had taken polyethylene glycol in the past for constipation. She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, fever, diarrhea, hematochezia, or melenic stools. She denied cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. She did not have any unexplained pruritus. She also had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency.

She had no other chronic conditions for which she took any medication and had no history of abdominal or inguinal hernias or previous surgeries. Her family history was notable for multiple close family members with a history of appendectomy, including her mother.

She and her mother recently arrived in the United States from rural Peru 3 months prior. Her workup upon arrival was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, syphilis, and active tuberculosis. She had a recent normal lead level. Her mother expressed concern for general parasitosis in their home community in Peru; however, the patient had never had specific symptoms and had not had any testing done.

In clinic, her vital signs were notable for tachycardia and tachypnea. She was afebrile. Her weight was in the 73rd percentile. Her general exam was notable for an uncomfortable appearance, not moving on the exam table. Her abdominal exam demonstrated active bowel sounds. She voluntarily tensed her abdominal muscles throughout the exam. She exhibited acute tenderness to palpation with rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant (McBurney's point) with generalized tenderness in all other quadrants, including the suprapubic region. Pain could be reliably elicited in her right lower quadrant with palpation of her left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign). Supine internal and external flexed hip rotation (obturator sign) and straight leg left against resistance (psoas sign) elicited intense pain in her right lower quadrant. She was unable to participate in a jump test to further assess for peritonitis.

### Prasugrel [^b398a874]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including prasugrel tablets, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on prasugrel tablets than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use prasugrel tablets in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

Age ≥ 75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel tablets is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Trials (14)].
CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Body weight < 60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7, 8.8)].
Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.4), and Clinical Studies (14)].

14.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome

CURE

The CURE study included 12,562 patients with ACS without ST-elevation (UA or NSTEMI) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia. Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal.

Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization.

The patient population was largely White (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% age ≥ 65 years of age. Only about 20% of patients underwent revascularization during the initial hospitalization and few underwent emergent or urgent revascularization.

The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10% to 28%; p < 0.001) for the clopidogrel-treated group (see Table 4).

### Gemfibrozil [^82f0bf57]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Gemfibrozil Tablets, USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for:

Treatment of adult patients with very high elevations of serum triglyceride levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Patients who present such risk typically have serum triglycerides over 2,000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL-cholesterol as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V hyperlipidemia). Subjects who consistently have total serum or plasma triglycerides below 1,000 mg/dL are unlikely to present a risk of pancreatitis. Gemfibrozil therapy may be considered for those subjects with triglyceride elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 mg/dL who have a history of pancreatitis or of recurrent abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis. It is recognized that some Type IV patients with triglycerides under 1,000 mg/dL may, through dietary or alcoholic indiscretion, convert to a Type V pattern with massive triglyceride elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of gemfibrozil therapy on the risk of pancreatitis in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing Types I, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia.
Reducing the risk of developing coronary heart disease only in Type IIb patients without history of or symptoms of existing coronary heart disease who have had an inadequate response to weight loss, dietary therapy, exercise, and other pharmacologic agents (such as bile acid sequestrants and nicotinic acid, known to reduce LDL- and raise HDL-cholesterol) and who have the following triad of lipid abnormalities: low HDL-cholesterol levels in addition to elevated LDL-cholesterol and elevated triglycerides (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The National Cholesterol Education Program has defined a serum HDL-cholesterol value that is consistently below 35 mg/dL as constituting an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. Patients with significantly elevated triglycerides should be closely observed when treated with gemfibrozil. In some patients with high triglyceride levels, treatment with gemfibrozil is associated with a significant increase in LDL-cholesterol. BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL TOXICITY SUCH AS MALIGNANCY, GALLBLADDER DISEASE, ABDOMINAL PAIN LEADING TO APPENDECTOMY AND OTHER ABDOMINAL SURGERIES, AN INCREASED INCIDENCE IN NON-CORONARY MORTALITY, AND THE 44% RELATIVE INCREASE DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD IN AGE-ADJUSTED ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY SEEN WITH THE CHEMICALLY AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY RELATED DRUG, CLOFIBRATE, THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF GEMFIBROZIL IN TREATING TYPE IIA PATIENTS WITH ELEVATIONS OF LDL-CHOLESTEROL ONLY IS NOT LIKELY TO OUTWEIGH THE RISKS. GEMFIBROZIL IS ALSO NOT INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH LOW HDL-CHOLESTEROL AS THEIR ONLY LIPID ABNORMALITY.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal perforations: a multi-center study [^651cc15e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Esophageal perforation (EP) is a full-thickness tear of the mucosal and muscular layers of the esophagus. It is a relatively uncommon medical emergency with an incidence of 3.1/1000000 a year. Although its causes are multifactorial, the leading cause worldwide is iatrogenic, which often occurs during endoscopic procedures. Other relatively less common causes include spontaneous rupture, ingestion of foreign bodies, trauma, and malignancy. Chest pain is considered the cardinal symptom of EP; however, the clinical presentation varies depending on the underlying cause, location, and duration of rupture.

Prompt management of EP is crucial, as the main predictor of complications and survival in those cases is the interval of time from the esophageal injury to its diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, the initial diagnosis in patients with EPs is incorrect in 50% of cases, and the time interval to diagnosis is longer than 24 h in two-thirds of the cases. There are several possible therapeutic strategies, ranging from medical treatment to the most aggressive, esophagectomy. Somewhere between these two extremes, one finds the mini-invasive techniques, including interventional endoscopy. Available endoscopic management options are clips, esophageal stents, and endoscopic suturing. Although stent placement is the most widely described option, determining the suitable endoscopic closure technique relies on evaluating specific parameters like the defect's location, size, and margins.

The debate over the most effective approach to managing EPs persists. Existing evidence guiding the management of EPs relies heavily on retrospective studies from single institutions and a few nationwide studies. The absence of randomized studies underscores the need for a thorough understanding of the factors that influence the success of conservative and endoscopic management. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the outcomes of different EP non-operative management approaches and identify predictors of successful repair.

### Treatment of boerhaave syndrome: experience from a tertiary center [^11a947e9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

While endoscopic treatment appears promising and can reduce the need for resection, surgery remains the most commonly used treatment modality for Boerhaave syndrome in the literature. Nonetheless, there is a growing trend toward the use of stents. A nationwide study conducted in the USA by Thornblade et al. reported an increase in the utilization of esophageal stents for benign esophageal perforations, rising from 7% in 2007 to 30% in 2014. However, no improved outcomes were observed despite the increasing use of stents. Therefore, further research is required to establish clear criteria and optimize patient selection for stent use.

In an effort to guide the management of esophageal perforation, University of Pittsburgh developed the Pittsburg Perforation Score (PSS) initially based on expert opinion and later validated with clinical data. The score includes 10 risk factors, among which clinical signs of sepsis and extent of mediastinal/pleural contamination, but it is not specific to the etiology of the esophageal perforation. Patients treated nonoperatively typically had a lower score than patients treated operatively. While a large multicenter study by Schweigert et al. demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for morbidity and mortality, another study found limited associations, with some factors (e.g. cancer) even inversely related to outcomes. Our analysis did not demonstrate a clear correlation between the PSS score and treatment outcomes in Boerhaave syndrome either. These inconsistencies highlight the need for prospective validation in larger cohorts to refine the PSS and better assess its utility as a decision-making tool. In addition, the difficulty in diagnosing Boerhaave syndrome limits this tool's applicability in initial interventions.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^92cbde28]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: methodology and review of evidence [^21bf718a]. VideoGIE (2025). High credibility.

ASGE GERD guideline — evidence basis and certainty: The panel performed a systematic review of the published literature; symptoms prompting evaluation include dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, GI bleeding, persistent vomiting, and/or unexplained iron deficiency anemia. EGD is recommended for patients with risk factors for BE including family history of BE and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma, and those with GERD and another risk factor including age ≥ 50 years, male sex, white race, smoking, and/or obesity. GERD symptoms are observed differently in pediatric patients, and there should be increased vigilance to evaluate for atypical pediatric symptoms including poor weight gain, unexplained anemia, concern for GI bleeding, recurrent pneumonia, and regurgitation and/or vomiting. Therefore, the overall certainty in the evidence was determined to be low.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^d1d67f03]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Esophageal stricture detection in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) shows low endoscopic sensitivity, with a structured esophagram study reporting endoscopy sensitivity 14.7% (95% CI 5.0%–31.1%) and specificity 79.2% (95% CI 57.8%–92.9%); even at a lumen cutoff of ≤ 15 mm, sensitivity was 45.0% (95% CI 5.5%–57.2%). Under-recognition is further suggested by a 71% symptomatic response to dilation despite no perceived narrowing on endoscopy and by pediatric data where 55% of strictures on barium esophagram were not detected endoscopically. Impedance planimetry with the EndoFLIP probe is described as more sensitive than endoscopy for fibrotic change, with pediatric studies noting only 23% of strictures detected endoscopically despite distensibility-based distinctions, although EndoFLIP has primarily been used in research settings and not routinely in most clinical practices for EoE.

### Celecoxib [^dc7865ac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including celecoxib cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with celecoxib. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants; or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

### Recognition of refractory benign esophageal strictures at index endoscopy: creation of a predictive model [^384cf8e4]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Refractory benign esophageal strictures (RBESs) are defined by an inadequate response to dilation. Early recognition of RBESs allows for earlier initiation of aggressive therapy, potentially leading to less morbidity and cost. We sought to establish a predictive model for RBESs.

Methods

Patients who underwent EGD with esophageal dilation at Mayo Clinic Rochester were identified. In addition, a cohort of patients from a clinical database of patients with RBESs managed with self-dilation was identified. Malignant strictures, Schatzki's rings, and previously treated strictures were excluded. RBES was defined by the inability to maintain a diameter ≥ 14 mm over 5 dilation sessions. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to predict RBESs.

Results

Of 128 identified patients with an index EGD and esophageal dilation, 25 met the RBES criteria. An additional 63 RBES patients were identified from the self-dilation cohort for a total of 88 RBES and 103 non-RBES patients. Multivariable analysis yielded a strong predictive model, with a c-statistic of .85, identifying stricture length ≥ 2 cm, diameter ≤ 7 mm, and proximal or diffuse stricture location as associated with a higher risk for RBESs. Patients without any of these risk factors had a 2% risk of RBESs, whereas those with all 3 risk factors had a risk of 73% for RBESs.

Conclusions

Risk of RBESs can be predicted at the index EGD based on stricture features. A predictive model for RBESs was created based on readily available risk factors, which may guide an individualized therapeutic approach to patients with benign esophageal strictures, potentially reducing morbidity and cost.

### Efficacy and safety of esophageal stenting for esophageal perforation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e8685561]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal perforation is a severe, life-threatening condition that is most commonly associated with iatrogenic causes, such as surgery or endoscopic procedures, while spontaneous perforations also occasionally occur. Boerhaave syndrome is a spontaneous longitudinal esophageal wall tear due to high intra-abdominal pressure combined with low intra-thoracic pressure, as in retching, trauma, seizures and defecation. This tear usually occurs above the diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus, most commonly on the left side. Rarely, malignancy can lead to esophageal perforation, often secondary to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Law et al reported spontaneous rupture as the main cause of perforation, with one-third of cases related to malignant etiologies receiving chemotherapy.

Esophageal stenting has been used to treat patients with esophageal perforation to good effect, especially patients who are poor candidates for surgery. However, esophagectomy or primary surgical repair for esophageal perforation are still performed in many institutions, despite their high mortality and morbidity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esophageal stent placement to manage esophageal perforation.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal perforations: a multi-center study [^36a72e15]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, when comparing different treatment methods, the conservative group showed the lowest non-operative success rate at 42.9%, while both the primary closure and combination groups achieved 100% success, a difference that was statistically significant (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences among the groups concerning symptom resolution or length of hospital stay. The median lengths of stay varied, with the primary closure group having the shortest at 6 days and the primary bypass group the longest at 14 days. Notably, both of these lengths are lower than the mean hospital stay of 32.9 days reported in a systematic review of 2,971 patients with esophageal perforation treated through various surgical and non-surgical methods.

Esophageal perforation presents high morbidity and mortality, with mortality rates ranging anywhere from 4 to 50%. In our study, adverse events and mortality rates were relatively low across all treatment groups, showing no significant differences (p = 0.578 and p = 0.701, respectively). By the end of the follow-up period, our cohort experienced an overall mortality rate of 11% (8 cases), with 4 of those deaths directly attributed to the perforation.

Limitations

This study has several notable limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, its retrospective design inherently carries the risk of selection bias, as patients were identified from a database and may not represent the entire population of individuals with esophageal perforations. Additionally, we acknowledge that reporting time to diagnosis and intervention in hours would offer greater precision; however, the retrospective nature of the data and lack of uniform timestamp documentation limited reporting to calendar days. Also, the relatively small sample size limits the ability to draw broad conclusions, reduces the statistical power to detect significant differences between treatment groups, and widens the confidence interval range for our results. Future prospective multicenter studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate these observations and explore subgroup-specific outcomes in greater detail. Variability in treatment protocols and physician preferences across different institutions could introduce inconsistencies in the data. Lastly, the reliance on clinical assessments and imaging interpretations can also lead to variability in diagnosis and management decisions.

### Diclofenac sodium topical (diclofenac sodium 1.5%) [^cc07f156]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal perforations: a multi-center study [^47ec7c33]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal perforation (EP) is a rare but life-threatening condition with an incidence of approximately 3.1 per million annually. While iatrogenic injury during endoscopy is the leading cause, other etiologies include spontaneous rupture, trauma, and malignancy. EP can present with nonspecific symptoms, most commonly chest pain or dysphagia, and diagnostic delays are associated with worse outcomes. Multiple non-operative strategies exist, including primary closure, stenting (bypass), combination therapy, and conservative management. However, data guiding the optimal approach remain limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of different non-operative management strategies for EP and identify predictors of successful repair.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed adult patients with EP across three Mayo Clinic sites between 2007 and 2023. Patients were categorized into four groups based on treatment modality. Demographics, clinical features, imaging, endoscopic intervention, and outcomes were recorded. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as avoidance of surgical intervention. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of success.

Results

A total of 72 patients were included (mean age 63.7 years, 65.3% male). The most common cause was iatrogenic injury (58.3%), and the distal esophagus was the most frequent site (67.6%). Non-operative success was 100% in the primary closure and combination groups, and 42.9% in the conservative group (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, non-conservative therapy significantly predicted success (aOR 22.4, 95% CI [1.2–407.4], p = 0.036).

Conclusion

Primary closure and combination endoscopic approaches offer superior outcomes in managing EP. Early intervention with appropriate modality selection is critical to avoid surgical escalation and improve prognosis.

### Effects of the lavage through fistula in treatment of spontaneous esophageal rupture by combined thoracoscopic and gastroscopic management [^2482bbb7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Cases collection

We retrospectively analyzed the subjects diagnosed as "Spontaneous esophageal rupture" during January 2014 and July 2024 at department of cardiothoracic surgery in Jinling hospital, excluding those who received conservative therapy, primary suture, esophagectomy, and esophageal stent implantation, only those who underwent surgical debridement and drainage under thoracoscope were retained. According to whether a lavage tube (usually being a nasogastric tube) was placed through the fistula under gastroscope, the enrolled subjects were divided into lavage-drainage and drainage groups (Fig. 1). The diagnosis of spontaneous esophageal rupture is mainly based on medical history, computed tomography (CT), gastroscopy and clinical manifestations. The patient usually had a recent episode of alcohol consumption, binge eating and forceful vomiting before the onset of typical symptoms, which were characterized by chest or epigastric pain, subcutaneous emphysema and so on. CT scans showed typical fluid-air plane around the esophageal bed and left lower lobe atelectasis, and gastroscopy showed definite esophageal tear (Fig. 2). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013). This study was approved by the Jinling hospital ethics committee (approval number 2024DZGJJ-488). The committee waived the need for informed consent owing to the retrospective observational design of study.

### Elevated tumour markers in the pleural effusion of a patient with spontaneous esophageal rupture: a rare case report [^e406656a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal rupture is a rare but life-threatening condition. Esophageal tumours do not usually cause esophageal ruptures, and elevated tumour markers have rarely been detected in pleural effusion after esophageal rupture with no detectable tumour. The presence of elevated tumor markers in pleural effusion can lead to a misdiagnosis of esophageal cancer in patients with esophageal rupture, resulting in inappropriate treatment.

Case Presentation

The 65-year-old male patient who was admitted to the emergency department with left chest pain and dyspnoea after severe vomiting. Chest computed tomography (CT) indicated left hydropneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema. The patient underwent bedside closed thoracic drainage. The drainage fluid was coffee-coloured and turbid, with significantly elevated CA199, CA125 and CEA levels. After transferring the patient to the emergency operating room, the esophageal defect was repaired, and a jejunostomy was performed. No tumours were detected in the thoracic cavity during surgery. The patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital.

Conclusion

Esophageal tumours should be suspected in patients with elevated pleural effusion CA199, CA125 and CEA levels. The findings from chest CT and oesophagography did not support the diagnosis of a thoracic tumor. These tumor markers may be concomitant changes during esophageal rupture.

### Porfimer sodium (Photofrin) [^2f6881c4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Location of the tumor was a prognostic factor for three adverse reactions: upper-third of the esophagus (esophageal edema), middle-third (atrial fibrillation), and lower-third, the most vascular region (anemia). Also, patients with large tumors (> 10 cm) were more likely to experience anemia. Two of 17 patients with complete esophageal obstruction from tumor experienced esophageal perforations, which were considered to be possibly treatment-associated; these perforations occurred during subsequent endoscopies. Serious and other notable adverse reactions observed in less than 5% of PDT-treated patients with obstructing esophageal cancer in the clinical studies include the following; their relationship to therapy is uncertain. In the gastrointestinal system, esophageal perforation, gastric ulcer, ileus, jaundice, and peritonitis have occurred. Sepsis has been reported occasionally.

Cardiovascular reactions have included angina pectoris, bradycardia, myocardial infarction, sick sinus syndrome, and supraventricular tachycardia. Respiratory reactions of bronchitis, bronchospasm, laryngotracheal edema, pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and stridor have occurred. The temporal relationship of some gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and respiratory reactions to the administration of light was suggestive of mediastinal inflammation in some patients. Vision-related reactions of abnormal vision, diplopia, eye pain and photophobia have been reported.

### Rare complications after esophagectomy: incidence, clinical features, risk factors, management, and prevention [^8da78de7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

To prevent conduit necrosis, other comorbid diseases of the stomach, the ischemic condition of the conduit, or the reconstruction approach should be evaluated. Specifically, for patients with severe gastric ulcers, the use of a gastric tube for reconstruction could help avoid potential perforations. However, gastric tubes should be chosen with caution if the patient has a short right gastroepiploic artery or intraoperative gastroepiploic artery injury. In cases of uncertain R0 resection with a high risk of local recurrence or an anticipated need for adjuvant/radical radiotherapy postoperatively, the selection of a retrosternal or subcutaneous reconstruction route warrants careful consideration. Finally, periodic endoscopic examination may be necessary to detect an early ulcer, and timely intervention can help prevent existing ulcers from progressing to conduit necrosis, thereby avoiding severe clinical consequences.

### CT of the esophagus in the ER: what you need to know and what you need to remember [^a2aac4bb]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a crucial diagnostic tool in the emergency department (ED) for evaluating non-traumatic esophageal conditions. Advanced imaging techniques such as multidetector CT (MDCT) quickly provide detailed 3D images with high spatial resolution, making it ideal for rapid assessment of a variety of esophageal pathologies. This pictorial essay presents 10 illustrative cases to highlight the clinical applications of MDCT and its critical role in diagnosing conditions like perforation, foreign body impaction, inflammatory or infectious esophagitis, achalasia, fistulae, and neoplasms. Optimized CT protocols, such as contrast-enhanced imaging and advanced postprocessing techniques like maximum intensity projection (MIP) images and volumetric rendering technique (VRT), in addition to 3D cinematic rendering, are crucial in improving diagnostic accuracy and enhancing visualization of anatomical structures. The cases presented emphasize the importance of early detection and timely management of esophageal conditions, as small delays can lead to significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Ultimately, a multidisciplinary approach that coordinates clinical, radiological, and pathological evaluations ensures appropriate management and improved patient outcomes in esophageal emergencies.

5.1 Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events

Cardiac Events and Fatalities with 5-HT Agonists

Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, have been reported within a few hours following administration of almotriptan tablets. Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of other triptans. Considering the extent of use of triptans in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low.

Almotriptan tablets can cause coronary vasospasm; at least one of these events occurred in a patient with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease. Because of the close proximity of the events to use of almotriptan tablets, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or a predisposition to Prinzmetal's variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur.

Premarketing Experience with Almotriptan Tablets in Adults Among the 3865 subjects/patients who received almotriptan tablets in premarketing clinical trials, one patient was hospitalized for observation after a scheduled electrocardiogram (ECG) was found to be abnormal (negative T-waves on the left leads) 48 hours after taking a single 6.25 mg dose of almotriptan. The patient, a 48-year-old female, had previously taken 3 other doses for earlier migraine attacks. Myocardial enzymes at the time of the abnormal ECG were normal. The patient was diagnosed as having had myocardial ischemia and that she had a family history of coronary disease. An ECG performed 2 days later was normal, as was a follow-up coronary angiography. The patient recovered without incident.

### Pain out of plane: lumbar erector spinae block redefining analgesia for acute soft tissue injury in emergency department [^c436be2d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Soft tissue injuries resulting from trauma (motor vehicle collisions, falls, etc.) are frequently present to the Emergency Department. While opioid analgesia is commonly used, its side effects and dependence potential underscore the need for alternative approaches (1). The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a regional anesthesia technique that involves the injection of local anesthetic into the fascial plane deep to the erector spinae muscles. This case report highlights the effective use of lumbar ESPB in a patient with severe soft tissue pain who was unresponsive to opioids, showcasing its potential as a safe, rapid, and non-opioid alternative for acute pain management in the ED.

Case

A 32-year-old man presented to the ED with complaints of intense lower back pain radiating to the left lower quadrant after a history of fall from height. The patient was found to have soft tissue injury on imaging. The only concern the patient had was severe pain, which was unresponsive to opioids. Erector spinae plane block was given at L1. The patient experienced rapid and substantial pain relief within 10 min of ESPB administration, with a Defense Veteran Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) score reduction of 2/10 and then 0/10 within an hour. This was the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that ESPB was given at the lumbar vertebrae for soft tissue injuries in the emergency department.

Conclusion

The Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) is a minimally invasive, effective alternative for managing acute soft tissue pain in emergency care, reducing opioid use, and enabling early mobilization. This case highlights its potential as a regional anesthetic in soft tissue injury and underscores the need for further research to expand its applications in acute care. Lumbar ESPB may serve as an alternative intervention for acute, intractable soft tissue pain in emergency care, especially in cases where standard analgesics are insufficient. When performed correctly and with suitable patient selection, it serves as an important tool in the arsenal of regional anesthesia practitioners anesthesia.
