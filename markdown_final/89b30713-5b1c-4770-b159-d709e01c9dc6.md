## Question

what medications are used for ringing in the ears

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are used for ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any medications are FDA-approved specifically for tinnitus. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend regarding pharmacotherapy for tinnitus. Next, I will examine the evidence for common drug classes that patients ask about, including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, and intratympanic agents. After that, I need to check for any investigational or emerging therapies. Finally, I should consider medications that treat co-occurring conditions and review ototoxic drugs to avoid or adjust, before summarizing a practical, guideline-concordant approach.

> Let me first confirm the foundational point: there are no FDA-approved medications for tinnitus, and no pharmacologic cure exists, so any drug use is off-label and should be framed as symptom management rather than disease-modifying therapy [^116E7UGs] [^11374mg7].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor recommendations. The VA/DoD 2025 guideline issues a weak recommendation against using anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antiemetics, antithrombotics, betahistine, intratympanic corticosteroids, or NMDA antagonists for tinnitus management, emphasizing that no medications have proven benefit and that treating co-occurring conditions may improve quality of life, which is the clinical priority [^116E7UGs]. The AAO-HNSF 2014 guideline similarly recommends against routine use of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for persistent, bothersome tinnitus, citing insufficient benefit and potential harms [^112HET3p] [^1134HBVb].

> I will now examine antidepressants, since patients often ask about them. Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence: Cochrane reviews and guideline syntheses show that tricyclics, SSRIs, and trazodone have not demonstrated consistent, clinically meaningful reductions in tinnitus loudness or functional impact, and any apparent improvements are likely secondary to treating depression or anxiety rather than a direct tinnitus effect; side effects are common and tinnitus can rarely be worsened by these agents, so routine use for tinnitus alone is not supported [^1132BwLH] [^113DhYFH] [^1178Wrtn] [^113kVJU2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anticonvulsants either. I should double-check the randomized data: multiple RCTs and a Cochrane review show no consistent benefit for gabapentin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or related agents, with a small, clinically uncertain signal in some analyses and meaningful adverse effects in a substantial minority; the VA/DoD guideline highlights that a single small study of gabapentin plus intradermal lidocaine after acoustic trauma showed improvement, but this is insufficient to change practice [^1138Zzzp] [^116XWuga] [^116E7UGs].

> Let me consider anxiolytics next. Benzodiazepines occasionally show small, inconsistent improvements on subjective scales, but trials are heterogeneous, often unblinded or confounded, and the risk of dependence, sedation, and cognitive effects — particularly in older adults — outweighs uncertain benefit; guidelines advise against routine benzodiazepine use for tinnitus [^114ZMfVy] [^112HET3p].

> I need to check intratympanic therapies as well. Intratympanic corticosteroids have not shown benefit over placebo in RCTs for tinnitus, and intratympanic lidocaine lacks supportive RCTs and can cause significant vertigo and nausea; thus, these are not recommended for routine tinnitus treatment outside of research or specific otologic indications [^1154S37u] [^116E7UGs].

> But wait, what about supplements like Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, or zinc? I should confirm the evidence quality. Systematic reviews and guidelines conclude there is little to no clinically meaningful benefit from Ginkgo biloba, and insufficient or negative evidence for melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements; patients should be counseled to avoid these for tinnitus given low certainty and potential costs [^115AQS7p] [^113g1Ai8] [^112HET3p].

> Next, I should review investigational or emerging pharmacologic directions. Intratympanic NMDA receptor antagonists such as gacyclidine (OTO-313) are under study with early signals in phase 1/2 work, but these remain experimental and are not standard care; similarly, rTMS has regulatory constraints and requires larger, standardized trials before routine clinical adoption for tinnitus [^113HwpZy] [^114DxPme].

> I will now examine medications for co-occurring conditions, because this is where pharmacotherapy can legitimately help patients with tinnitus. Treating clinically significant depression, anxiety, PTSD, or insomnia with appropriate agents can reduce distress and improve quality of life, which may secondarily lessen the functional impact of tinnitus; this is guideline-endorsed and should be individualized, with careful counseling that the goal is comorbidity management rather than tinnitus suppression per se [^116E7UGs] [^113NUcGW] [^114mKDSJ].

> Hold on, I should verify ototoxic medication risks and mitigation. Aminoglycosides, cisplatin, high-dose salicylates, loop diuretics, quinine, certain macrolides and fluoroquinolones, and some calcium channel blockers can precipitate or worsen tinnitus; if tinnitus began or worsened after starting or uptitrating a suspect drug, clinicians should reassess the risk–benefit balance, consider dose reduction or alternatives, and counsel on noise exposure avoidance because ototoxic drugs synergize with noise to damage the cochlea [^111XaGxV] [^114gVnY7] [^114ucD7T].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure it aligns with evidence and guidelines. No medications reliably reduce tinnitus loudness or eliminate the perception, and routine pharmacotherapy for primary tinnitus is discouraged; management should prioritize education, hearing rehabilitation when indicated, sound therapy, and CBT to reduce tinnitus-related distress, while pharmacotherapy is reserved for treating identifiable medical or psychiatric comorbidities and for avoiding or modifying ototoxic exposures when feasible [^111XaGxV] [^112HET3p] [^111UD1k1] [^11212NDE].

There is **no FDA-approved medication** for tinnitus [^111XaGxV], and routine use of drugs to treat tinnitus is not recommended [^112HET3p]. Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and intratympanic steroids have **no consistent benefit** and may cause side effects [^1132BwLH] [^1138Zzzp] [^114ZMfVy] [^1154S37u]. Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and zinc are ineffective [^115AQS7p] [^112tJnPn]. Treat co-occurring depression/anxiety if present, and use sound therapy, hearing aids, or CBT for symptom relief [^111UD1k1] [^11212NDE]. Avoid ototoxic drugs when possible [^114ucD7T] [^111XaGxV].

---

## Medications commonly considered for tinnitus

Several medication classes have been studied for tinnitus, but **none are FDA-approved** for this indication [^111XaGxV]:

- **Antidepressants**: Tricyclics (e.g. amitriptyline, nortriptyline) and SSRIs (e.g. sertraline, paroxetine) have been studied, but evidence is limited and mixed [^1132BwLH]. Some patients with coexisting depression or anxiety may benefit indirectly, but routine use is not recommended [^112HET3p].

- **Anticonvulsants**: Gabapentin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine have been evaluated, but evidence does not support their use for tinnitus [^1138Zzzp].

- **Benzodiazepines**: Alprazolam and clonazepam may reduce tinnitus loudness or distress in some studies, but risks of dependence, sedation, and cognitive impairment outweigh potential benefits [^114ZMfVy].

- **Intratympanic steroids**: Intratympanic dexamethasone or methylprednisolone injections have not shown consistent benefit and are not recommended for routine tinnitus treatment [^1154S37u].

---

## Medications not recommended for tinnitus

Guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) **strongly recommend against** the routine use of the following medications for tinnitus:

- **Antidepressants**: Not recommended due to lack of consistent benefit and potential side effects [^112HET3p].

- **Anticonvulsants**: Not recommended due to insufficient evidence of benefit [^1138Zzzp].

- **Benzodiazepines**: Not recommended due to inconsistent benefit and significant adverse effects, particularly in older adults [^114ZMfVy].

- **Intratympanic medications**: Not recommended due to lack of proven benefit and potential risks [^1154S37u].

---

## Medications for co-occurring conditions

While no medications directly treat tinnitus, **managing co-occurring conditions** such as depression, anxiety, or insomnia may indirectly improve tinnitus-related distress and quality of life:

- **Antidepressants**: May be considered for patients with clinically significant depression or anxiety, but not for tinnitus alone [^112HET3p].

- **Anxiolytics**: May be considered short-term for severe anxiety or insomnia, but long-term use is discouraged due to dependence and cognitive risks [^notfound].

- **Sleep medications**: Short-term use of non-benzodiazepine sleep aids (e.g. zolpidem) may help manage insomnia related to tinnitus, but caution is advised due to potential side effects.

---

## Non-pharmacological treatments

Given the limited efficacy of medications, **non-pharmacological treatments** are recommended as first-line management for tinnitus:

- **Sound therapy**: Use of environmental sounds, white noise machines, or hearing aids with sound generators can help mask tinnitus and reduce distress [^116UjeyK].

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Strongly recommended for persistent, bothersome tinnitus to help patients manage distress and improve quality of life [^11212NDE].

- **Hearing aids**: Recommended for patients with concurrent hearing loss, as they can improve hearing and reduce tinnitus perception [^11212NDE].

---

## Medications that may worsen tinnitus

Certain medications are **ototoxic** and may exacerbate tinnitus:

- **Aminoglycoside antibiotics**: Gentamicin, amikacin, and neomycin.

- **Chemotherapeutic agents**: Cisplatin and carboplatin.

- **Loop diuretics**: Furosemide and ethacrynic acid.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: High doses of aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.

- **Quinine derivatives**: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.

Patients should discuss potential ototoxic effects with their healthcare provider and explore alternatives when possible [^111XaGxV] [^114gVnY7].

---

## Emerging pharmacological treatments

Research into new pharmacological treatments for tinnitus is ongoing, including **NMDA receptor antagonists** (e.g. gacyclidine) and intratympanic drug delivery systems [^113HwpZy]. However, these treatments remain experimental and are not currently approved for clinical use.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no FDA-approved medication** for tinnitus, and routine pharmacological treatment is not recommended [^111XaGxV] [^112HET3p]. Medications may be considered for co-occurring conditions such as depression, anxiety, or insomnia, but non-pharmacological treatments like sound therapy, CBT, and hearing aids are first-line management strategies [^111XaGxV] [^1153WrAR]. Patients should avoid ototoxic medications when possible and consult their healthcare provider before starting or stopping any medication [^111XaGxV] [^112DYfa2].

Appendix C — medication-related considerations in managing patients with bothersome tinnitus note that no medications have been approved by the FDA to treat tinnitus and no cure exists. Providing care focuses on improving QoL with tinnitus, and encouraging patients to address with their health care provider co-occurring conditions that also reduce QoL is useful. Many of these co-occurring conditions can be successfully treated with medication (or other methods), which might contribute to overall improved QoL. Some medications are known to be ototoxic and might lead to or contribute to bothersome tinnitus; however, the risks of these medications must be balanced with the benefits of treatment when considering whether to continue treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue the medication, and if the decision is made to continue a medication believed to contribute to or worsen tinnitus, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.

The search for an effective medication that will eliminate tinnitus has a long history. Currently, no drugs exist that universally cure tinnitus. Pharmacologic interventions that have been investigated can be divided into those that attempt to eliminate the perception of tinnitus, and those that are designed to treat the negative comorbidities associated with tinnitus, thereby mitigating tinnitus' negative impact on quality of life. A third category of drugs can also be considered that addresses an identified pathologic condition that has tinnitus as an associated symptom (for example, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, migraine-associated vertigo). This third category is not addressed.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Tinnitus — when patients question whether their medication is possibly contributing to their tinnitus, consider asking these following questions: Did the tinnitus worsen when the medication was started or when the dose was increased? Did the tinnitus improve when the dose was decreased, or when the medication was withheld? Did the tinnitus return when the medication was restarted? If no connection exists between the timing of changes in tinnitus and changes in medication, stopping any medication or medications prescribed for other conditions is unlikely to change the tinnitus perception, and in these instances, discussing the importance of addressing ways to improve overall health and well-being and how that approach relates to improving QoL with tinnitus is recommended.

Medical therapy for persistent, bothersome tinnitus — clinicians should not routinely recommend antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for a primary indication of treating persistent, bothersome tinnitus, with Recommendation (against) based on systematic reviews and RCTs with methodological concerns, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B and level of confidence in the evidence is Medium regarding the lack of efficacy of medical therapy as a primary treatment for persistent bothersome tinnitus. Benefits include avoiding unproven therapy, side effects/adverse events (including tinnitus), false hope, and expense, and avoiding use of medications not approved for use in geriatric population, whereas risks, harms, costs are denying some patients benefit; the benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit. Value judgments state evidence is insufficient to justify routine use given known harms, cost of therapy, and potential for some medications (eg, antidepressants) to worsen tinnitus; intentional vagueness notes routine acknowledges individual circumstances; role of patient preferences is Limited with a trial of medication administered based on individual circumstances; exclusions are patients with depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders indicating pharmacologic therapy independent of tinnitus; and the policy level is Recommendation (against). Supporting text emphasizes avoiding routine medications because they have not been shown to alleviate tinnitus and may have adverse effects, that there are no medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of tinnitus, and that no medications have been shown to reliably eliminate or reduce tinnitus perception.

Tinnitus — research priorities for trials and observational studies emphasize methodological rigor and relevant populations. Future clinical trials should be registered and adhere to reporting standards with adequate power, and future studies of tinnitus should be methodologically enhanced with uniform validated outcomes and both audiologic testing and validated questionnaires that incorporate patient-reported outcomes. Tinnitus trials should include a broader, more representative adult population and control for confounding medications and other therapies, and include global QOL measures. Additional needs include determining which validated tinnitus questionnaire is most effective and most useful for relevant treatment effects, conducting surveys or cohort studies on which clinicians patients approach first and how this differs by provider type, establishing the duration/natural history of recent onset tinnitus and time to spontaneous resolution, documenting common medical and/or psychiatric comorbidities, identifying subsets who respond especially well to specific treatments and incorporating these into subsequent RCTs, and conducting methodologically rigorous research into CAM therapies for tinnitus.

Tinnitus is a significant medical problem affecting approximately 50 million Americans, 12 million of them severely. Once a thorough evaluation has been performed by a qualified otolaryngologist, and no life-threatening pathology has been identified, the opportunity for treatment exists. Treatment options are extensive and range from approved protocols to anecdotal remedies. Although tinnitus may not miraculously disappear, many therapeutic options exist that may help to make the tinnitus more manageable.

Tinnitus is a common symptom. Standard therapies aim at improving the quality of life and reducing the psychological stress associated with tinnitus. Most interventions have little or no effect on the main symptom. Those affected subjects, however, want such a change and prefer a specific solution, such as pharmacologic therapy to other modalities. Scientific efforts have not yet led to significant improvement in the range of therapies. This article outlines existing efforts and develops ideas on how research for improved tinnitus therapy might look in the future.

Introduction

Up to 18% of people in industrialised societies are mildly affected by chronic tinnitus, and 0.5% report tinnitus having a severe effect on their daily life. Tinnitus can be associated with hearing loss, acoustic neuromas, drug toxicity, ear diseases, and depression. Tinnitus can last for many years, and can interfere with sleep and concentration.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for chronic tinnitus? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 29 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acamprosate, acupuncture, antidepressant drugs, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, cinnarizine, electromagnetic stimulation, ginkgo biloba, hearing aids, hypnosis, psychotherapy, tinnitus-masking devices, and tinnitus retraining therapy.

Tinnitus guideline — disclaimer and scope emphasize supportive, non-mandatory use. The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only and is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing patients with tinnitus. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies, and it is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^114gVnY7]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Tinnitus — ototoxic medication effects and noise exposure states that Ototoxic medications directly result in damage to cochlear (cochleotoxic) and vestibular (vestibulotoxic) structures in the inner ear, which can lead to acquired hearing loss and tinnitus. When taking ototoxic medications, noise exposure can result in more severe damage than would occur with either source alone. The synergistic interaction of noise and ototoxic medications, such as aminoglycosides and antineoplastic agents, directly results in hearing loss and tinnitus at high rates. Health care providers are encouraged to explain to patients that because of the combined effects of ototoxic medication and noise exposure, they are more vulnerable to experiencing auditory damage, which is the reason for strongly encouraging them to use hearing protection when exposed to moderate and high levels of noise. Both national organizations for audiology, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and the American Academy of Audiology, have published audiological management guidelines for ototoxicity monitoring.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^113kyW4P]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Tinnitus care and research has long been and continues to be a challenge. The efficacy of most tinnitus management interventions recommended for clinical practice remains to be demonstrated conclusively as there are currently too few studies to make informed conclusions. Most studies reviewed here provide only moderate levels of evidence largely due to a lack of power and incomplete data reporting. Interventions most in need of high-level evidence studies are hearing aids/sound enrichment and TRT, whereas the efficacy of therapist-delivered CBT appears to be reasonably established. If audiologists are to deliver CBT, however, this will require new investigation. Although the overall quality of CBT studies is moderate, there is sufficient consistency within these results to be confident of its benefit for tinnitus intrusiveness. In terms of pharmacotherapy, only antidepressant use shows any evidence of potential benefit.

Research needs for tinnitus interventions — trial design priorities: In general, clinical trials of interventions for tinnitus need well-defined entry criteria regarding duration and severity of tinnitus, comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, and prior therapies; use of validated instruments to assess effect on QOL and daily functions and reliable assessment of perceived tinnitus loudness, with instruments that reliably assess changes from the intervention; careful selection of the placebo with randomization/blinding; short- and long-term assessments; adequate sample size; and study populations representative of most tinnitus patients to allow generalizability of results.

### The placebo effect on tinnitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111yGZYy]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To quantify the placebo effect in randomized clinical trials treating tinnitus with oral or intratympanic placebo treatment.

Data Sources

CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for articles from conception to October 2022. MESH and key terms such as "tinnitus", "placebo", and "medication" were used to find randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The search was limited to articles in English.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials with adult subjects evaluating tinnitus pretreatment and posttreatment with an oral or intratympanic medication versus a placebo arm were included. Crossover studies, studies involving middle/inner ear operations or devices, and studies that exclusively included nonidiopathic etiologies of tinnitus were excluded. Mean tinnitus symptom survey scores for the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Severity Index, Tinnitus Functional Index, Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Scales for tinnitus Intensity/Loudness (VAS-L), Annoyance (VAS-An), and Awareness (VAS-Aw) were extracted for both placebo and experimental groups.

Results

953 studies were screened with 23 studies being included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis of mean difference (MD) was calculated using RevMan 5.4. MD between pretreatment and posttreatment THI scores of the placebo arms was 5.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.3–8.0; p < 0.001). MD between pretreatment and posttreatment VAS scores of the placebo groups for Loudness, Annoyance, and Awareness were 0.8 (0.0 to 1.6, p = 0.05), 0.2 (-0.2 to 0.5, p = 0.34), and 0.3 (-0.0 to 0.7, p = 0.08), respectively.

Conclusions

Placebo treatment has shown effectiveness in improving patient-reported evaluations of tinnitus when using some standardized metrics such as THI and VAS-L; however, the improvement is not as substantial as nonplacebo treatment.

### Antidepressants for patients with tinnitus [^1132BwLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006 and previously updated in 2009. Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. It has been compared with chronic pain, and may be associated with depression or depressive symptoms which can affect quality of life and the ability to work. Antidepressant drugs have been used to treat tinnitus in patients with and without depressive symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of tinnitus and to ascertain whether any benefit is due to a direct tinnitus effect or a secondary effect due to treatment of concomitant depressive states.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 January 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical studies of antidepressant drugs versus placebo in patients with tinnitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors critically appraised the retrieved studies and extracted data independently. Where necessary we contacted study authors for further information.

Main Results

Six trials involving 610 patients were included. Trial quality was generally low. Four of the trials looked at the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on tinnitus, investigating 405 patients. One trial investigated the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a group of 120 patients. One study investigated trazodone, an atypical antidepressant, versus placebo. Only the trial using the SSRI drug reached the highest quality standard. None of the other included trials met the highest quality standard, due to use of inadequate outcome measures, large drop-out rates or failure to separate the effects on tinnitus from the effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression. All the trials assessing tricyclic antidepressants suggested that there was a slight improvement in tinnitus but these effects may have been attributable to methodological bias. The trial that investigated the SSRI drug found no overall improvement in any of the validated outcome measures that were used in the study although there was possible benefit for a subgroup that received higher doses of the drug. This observation merits further investigation. In the trial investigating trazodone, the results showed an improvement in tinnitus intensity and in quality of life after treatment, but in neither case reached statistical significance. Reports of side effects including sedation, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth were common.

Authors' Conclusions

There is as yet insufficient evidence to say that antidepressant drug therapy improves tinnitus.

The current study had been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020177742) with the first submission date of April 1 st, 2020 and final approval of registration date by July 5 th, 2020.

2.2 Target of investigated medication, search strategy and selection criteria

In order to improve the reliability of the current NMA, we choose the pharmacologic treatments which were intended to include from the list of recommendations in the current review articles or clinical guidelines. A systematic review was carried out using ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to April 5th, 2021 (Suppl. B, eTable 1). No language restriction was used. In addition, manual searches were performed for potentially eligible articles selected from the reference lists of review articles, clinical guidelines, and pairwise meta-analyses. The definition of "tinnitus without specific or treatable origin" followed the definition of primary tinnitus addressed in the important guideline by Tunkel, D.E. (2014).

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^114ZMfVy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Anxiolytics — anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, should not be used to treat tinnitus, because clinical trials do not consistently show benefit. These medications can have adverse effects, particularly in the elderly, unless dosing is carefully monitored and tailored with drug holidays. Evidence is mixed: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of alprazolam showed decreased tinnitus loudness, whereas another triple-blind randomized crossover trial using chlorpheniramine did not find a significant difference in THI or tinnitus loudness but did find a significant improvement on a visual analogue scale for tinnitus severity. A single-blind randomized study of 66 patients treated with diazepam, flurazepam, oxazepam, clonazepam, and carbamazepine showed improvement on a tinnitus visual analogue scale with oxazepam and clonazepam, but it did not assess tinnitus loudness or use validated questionnaires and subjects received more than 1 medication.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^116XWuga]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — anticonvulsants for tinnitus management states that the Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of anticonvulsants because of the lack of evidence to support benefit. Daily administered gabapentin improved tinnitus severity (VAS) in patients with acoustic trauma after 6 weeks, with a reduction in VAS in both treatment and placebo groups of at least 30%, yet insufficient evidence exists supporting the effectiveness of gabapentin in the treatment of chronic tinnitus and a significant benefit from carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine has not been confirmed in placebo-controlled trials. The study that favored gabapentin was in combination with intradermal lidocaine injection, the one randomized controlled trial (RCT) after acoustic trauma limited audiometric threshold measurements to 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz, and because of the lack of evidence for benefit any risk for adverse events might lead to an unfavorable risk versus benefit profile.

### Evidence synthesis of tinnitus treatment methods: an umbrella review [^1177gdgb]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We collated and evaluated evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews on tinnitus treatment to establish a reference for clinical decision-making in tinnitus management.

Methods

Major medical databases such as CNKI, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched. Literature on systematic review/meta-analysis of evidence of tinnitus treatment was collected without reference language restrictions. The methodological quality, reporting quality, and evidence quality of the included studies were assessed using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool, respectively.

Results

In the end, a total of 48 out of 2642 screened publications met the eligibility criteria. The primary treatment modalities included tinnitus counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy, auditory therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy and pharmacotherapy. We analyzed seven treatment approaches, among which three demonstrated definitive efficacy while four showed probable efficacy.

Conclusion

The primary objective of this systematic review was to synthesize and critically evaluate evidence-based data on tinnitus treatment derived from multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews, while also assessing methodological quality, reporting quality, and evidence quality of the included studies. Our study consolidated the most recent evidence-based findings on various tinnitus treatments to guide clinical decision-making in tinnitus management.

### Alternative treatments of tinnitus: alternative medicine [^111uoXJX]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

"Because Western medicine has remained largely unsuccessful at treating tinnitus symptoms, many physicians as well as patients have turned to alternative treatment options to decrease patients' suffering and improve their quality of life. Although research in complementary/integrative medicine continues to be scarce and inconclusive, studies are pointing toward the positive effects of acupuncture, herbal remedies, dietary supplements, antioxidants, melatonin, and hypnosis on tinnitus. Although the efficacies of these treatments are inconsistent and may depend on a patient's unique circumstances, studies acknowledge that each treatment is worth trying in light of the potential benefits while being both noninvasive and well tolerated".

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^113m6uze]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — patient education and counseling for persistent, bothersome tinnitus is a policy level recommendation and should include shared decision making, realistic messaging, key content areas, and referrals. Clinicians should engage the patient or the patient's proxy in decision making with awareness of the natural history, prognosis, and management options, point out that there is no established cure while avoiding statements that may exacerbate negative reactions, emphasize that tinnitus is a symptom and not a dangerous disease with comprehensive assessment to exclude associated conditions, include information on hearing loss associations and lifestyle factors, and encourage follow-up if symptoms persist or worsen. Counseling should also cover discussing the availability and lack of proven benefits of pharmacologic and other medical therapies and complementary and alternative medicine, and include referral to other professionals and to support organizations. Clinicians can inform and educate by providing brochures, suggesting self-help books, and describing counseling and sound therapy options.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^114v6taQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Persistent tinnitus — classification and rationale for timing: Clinicians should distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care. Recommendation based on inclusion criteria in RCTs, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on inclusion criteria in RCTs, with level of confidence in the evidence Moderate, and benefit-harm assessment Preponderance of benefit. The majority of RCTs of tinnitus therapies enroll subjects with moderate severity tinnitus of at least 6 months' duration, and a review of 89 RCTs yielded only 1 trial with enrollment limited to new onset tinnitus (less than 3 months' duration) and 1 trial of tinnitus less than 6 months' duration. Another reason for distinguishing those with recent onset tinnitus from those with persistent tinnitus is the potential for resolution of tinnitus within 6 months of onset, and value judgments note that 6 months was a reasonable time to conclude that the tinnitus would likely persist, while risks include deferring treatment that may benefit some tinnitus patients who do not have persistent symptoms.

Tinnitus — intervention and survey study priorities specify targets for comparative effectiveness and novel modalities. The document calls to conduct surveys on utilization of hearing aids, audiology evaluation, and frequency of patient education and counseling for tinnitus in community and academic settings. It urges conducting clinical trials comparing different counseling treatments and studies comparing the effectiveness of CBT, ACT, and bibliotherapy, as well as in-person versus Internet-based CBT with cost-benefits. It also calls to conduct studies on acamprosate and additional anticonvulsant medications, conduct clinical trials on new therapies such as cochlear implantation and deep brain stimulation, and ensure patient cohorts are stratified by concurrent depression and anxiety when testing antidepressant and anxiolytic medications. Brain stimulation research priorities include studying a variety of techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation and investigating rTMS with longer duration or combined approaches to assess prolonged efficacy.

Anticonvulsants — anticonvulsants are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 8 RCTs and a Cochrane review that failed to demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm. None of the RCTs have shown a clear benefit, and a Cochrane review of 7 placebo-controlled trials found no improvement of tinnitus or health-related QOL. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of an 8-week treatment with gabapentin showed no differences between gabapentin and control groups when assessing the tinnitus severity index or loudness scores. Reported side effects during these RCTs were significant, most commonly nausea, dizziness, and headaches.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112SA57U]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In comparison with the previous clinical guidelines, the current NMA did not focus on the traditional management (i.e. tinnitus support and psychologic therapy) to tinnitus, which was relatively time-consuming and expensive. Rather, the current NMA focus on the pharmacologic interventions to manage the tinnitus severity. In addition, the current NMA also focus on the potential placebo effect in the tinnitus management. To be specific, the current NMA found that the oral form placebo exerted significantly beneficial effects in participants with tinnitus (p < 0.001) (Suppl. B, eFig. 3A). However, the CLES of response rates of oral form placebo (i.e. the probability of one random observation from the treated population being larger than another random observation from the control population) was only 24.5%, which was relatively low compared to that of neuropsychiatric disease, such as depression (i.e. 35%−40%). However, the unavoidable placebo effect could also be at least partly explained by the fact that most studies applied subjective rating scales and there was a relative lack of reliable objective investigating tools. Therefore, to develop up an conclusive objective measurements for the severity of tinnitus without specific/treatable origin should be warranted.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^115MC4Wa]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To evaluate the existing level of evidence for tinnitus management strategies identified in the UK Department of Health's Good Practice Guideline.

Study Design

Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and meta-analyses.

Methods

Searches were conducted in PubMed, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Web of Science, and EMBASE (earliest to August 2010), supplemented by hand searches in October 2010. Only randomized controlled trials that used validated questionnaire measures of symptoms (i.e., measures of tinnitus distress, anxiety, depression) were included.

Results

Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria, most of which provide moderate levels of evidence for the effects they reported. Levels of evidence were generally limited by the lack of blinding, lack of power calculations, and incomplete data reporting in these studies. Only studies examining cognitive behavioral therapy were numerous and similar enough to perform meta-analysis, from which the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (moderate effect size) appears to be reasonably established. Antidepressants were the only drug class to show any evidence of potential benefit.

Conclusions

The efficacy of most interventions for tinnitus benefit remains to be demonstrated conclusively. In particular, high-level assessment of the benefit derived from those interventions most commonly used in practice, namely hearing aids, maskers, and tinnitus retraining therapy needs to be performed.

### Antidepressants for patients with tinnitus [^113DhYFH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. It has been compared with chronic pain, and may be associated with depression or depressive symptoms which can affect quality of life and the ability to work. Antidepressant drugs have been used to treat tinnitus in patients with and without depressive symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of tinnitus and to ascertain whether any benefit was due to a direct tinnitus effect or a secondary effect due to treatment of concomitant depressive states.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1951 to 2006); EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CINAHL (to 2006), PSYCINFO (to 2006), LILACS (to 2006), and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. The date of the most recent search was March 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical studies of antidepressant drugs versus placebo in patients with tinnitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

The studies retrieved were critically appraised and data extracted independently by two authors. Where necessary study authors were contacted for further information.

Main Results

Five trials involving 525 patients were included. Four of these trials looked at the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on tinnitus, investigating 405 patients. One trial investigated the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a group of 120 patients. No trials involving other antidepressant agents met the inclusion criteria. Only the trial using the SSRI drug met the highest quality standard. None of the other included trials met the highest quality standard, due to use of inadequate outcome measures, large drop out rates or failure to separate the effects on tinnitus from the effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression. All the trials assessing tricyclic antidepressants suggested that there was a slight improvement in tinnitus but these effects may have been attributable to methodological bias. The trial that investigated the SSRI drug found no overall improvement in any of the validated outcome measures that were used in the study although there was possible benefit for a subgroup that received higher doses of the drug. This observation merits further investigation. Reports of side effects including sedation, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth were common.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to say that antidepressant drug therapy improves tinnitus.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^1178Wrtn]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, trazodone, nortriptyline) for tinnitus management reports evidence from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a network meta-analysis (NMA) that failed to show a significant benefit in reducing tinnitus functional impact. The use of fluoxetine alone or in combination with alprazolam improved the tinnitus functional impact (THI) and VAS scores compared with placebo in patients with chronic subjective tinnitus at 4 weeks, whereas TSI scores decreased in both treatment groups without a significant difference between the single therapy and the combination treatment. The use of trazodone in a small study (n = 43) showed no difference in quality of life (QoL) compared with placebo in individuals at up to 8 weeks of follow-up, and there was also no difference in QoL after administration of nortriptyline versus placebo. The Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of antidepressants because of the lack of evidence to support the benefit of using these agents for tinnitus management, with the RCT showing a reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory in the treatment groups while the severity of anxiety in the fluoxetine and control group increased significantly (p = 0.003) and Seven individuals left the combination group as a result of side effects; commonly reported side effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth.

### SSRI use by tinnitus patients: interactions between depression and tinnitus severity [^1145w4W5]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Depression is often coincident with chronic tinnitus, and several studies have suggested that antidepressant medications may play a role in relieving tinnitus as well as depression. We conducted a retrospective study of the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by patients at a large tinnitus clinic to assess the effects of these antidepressants on tinnitus severity. We focused on a subgroup of 30 patients with depression who had begun taking SSRI medication after the onset of their tinnitus; these patients had also been treated with psychotherapy by a mental health clinician. At a mean follow-up of 20.6 months, only 10 of the 30 patients reported that they were still experiencing major depression. Moreover, this group as a whole demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in tinnitus symptoms as reflected by a reduction in their Tinnitus Severity Index scores. We conclude that SSRIs represent one category of tools that can be used to help patients with severe tinnitus and depression. Like all antidepressant medications, SSRIs should be used in conjunction with psychotherapy to facilitate patient improvement.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115QeaAz]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Several potential limitations should be considered. First, this NMA may have been underpowered due to the heterogeneity of the participants (e.g. comorbidities, mood disorder, baseline severity of tinnitus, duration of tinnitus onset, wearing hearing-aids, treatment duration in each study and follow-up duration), variety in the definition of response, variety in tinnitus severity or quality-of-life rating scales, and high risk of bias in 'Random sequence generation' and 'Blinding of participants' in some of the included RCTs. In order to overcome the potential bias on the primary outcome, we arranged subgroup to exclude RCTs without placebo-control, in which the main results would not change. Further, in the subgroup of different duration of tinnitus symptoms, there was no significant difference of placebo effect between the subgroups with different disease duration of tinnitus symptom (p = 0.80), which suggest potentially less impact by the different duration of tinnitus symptom on the primary outcome. As for the heterogeneity of the outcome reporting (i.e. variety in tinnitus severity or quality-of-life rating scales), this was an unavoidable limitation of any NMA investigating subjective outcomes. The tinnitus, just like the depressive symptoms, quality of life, or pain symptoms, was a subjective symptom and lack of objective measurement to measure its severity or to define its treatment response. Currently, there had not been any conclusive golden rating scales to measure its severity. Also, there had been no conclusive evidence to approve the superiority of one rating scales to the others. The choice or selection of one specific rating scales would become an potential source of bias in the network meta-analysis of subjective symptoms. Based on this limitation, we highly recommend future studies to address the need for a gold standard measurement of tinnitus severity, which would appear to be a significant limitation in the tinnitus research field. Further, the results of the future study would be recommended to be rated according to a standardized multi-measure scale. Therefore, the clinicians may pay attention when applied the results of current study in their clinical practice because of the potential difference between the rating scales and the variety of definition of response rate. Second, although the most of the RCTs included a placebo control in their study design, some of the included trials applied waiting list as their control groups. However, the main findings were unchanged after excluding those trials (Suppl. B, eFig. 1D-1E and 2D-2E). Third, given the relatively small number of patients and RCTs, the main results of this NMA should perhaps be conservatively applied in clinical practice. Fourth, despite some heterogeneity among RCTs regarding the control group, when trials were restricted to an oral form of placebo therapy, results were similar. Further, the potential placebo effect was an unavoidable issue in any clinical studies investigating disease of subjective symptoms, such as tinnitus. The overall placebo of the injection form placebo and oral form placebo were 26.4% and 24.5%, which was relatively low compared to that of neuropsychiatric disease, such as depression (i.e. 35%−40%). Fifth, because of small numbers of included RCTs and insufficient direct/indirect comparison between treatment arms, there would be different findings between the primary outcome (i.e. changes of tinnitus severity) and secondary outcome (i.e. response rate). Sixth, although the De Ridder et al. (2021)had provided the clear concept of "tinnitus disorder", the most included RCTs (published from 1993 to 2020) in the current NMA did not apply the concept of "tinnitus disorder". Therefore, we could not make distinguish between the target of "tinnitus vs tinnitus disorder" in the current study. Finally, we only investigated the drop-out rate but not by an adverse events profile because too few studies provided data about adverse events to form a network. Also, there were some other important factors associated with the baseline tinnitus severity, such as quality of life, anxiety mood, depressive mood, and so on. However, we could only perform network meta-analysis of quality of life but not the others because there were too few RCTs providing such data to form a network structure.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^1139pRce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used in the management of this condition, including betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications and corticosteroids. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which these treatments may work. The efficacy of these different interventions at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic pharmacological interventions versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease comparing betahistine, diuretics, antihistamines, antivirals or systemic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months, or with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies with a total of 848 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines. Betahistine Seven RCTs (548 participants) addressed this comparison. However, we were unable to conduct any meta-analyses for our primary outcomes as not all outcomes were considered by every study, and studies that did report the same outcome used different time points for follow-up, or assessed the outcome using different methods. Therefore, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Some data were available for each of our primary outcomes, but the evidence was low- or very low-certainty throughout. One study reported on the outcome 'improvement in vertigo' at 6 to ≤ 12 months, and another study reported this outcome at > 12 months. Four studies reported on the change in vertigo, but again all used different methods of assessment (vertigo frequency, or a global score of vertigo severity) or different time points. A single study reported on serious adverse events. Diuretics Two RCTs addressed this comparison. One considered the use of isosorbide (220 participants), and the other used a combination of amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide (80 participants). Again, we were unable to conduct any meta-analyses for our primary outcomes, as only one study reported on the outcome 'improvement in vertigo' (at 6 to ≤ 12 months), one study reported on change in vertigo (at 3 to < 6 months) and neither study assessed serious adverse events. Therefore, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. The evidence was all very low-certainty. Other pharmacological interventions We also identified one study that assessed antivirals (24 participants), and one study that assessed corticosteroids (16 participants). The evidence for these interventions was all very low-certainty. Again, serious adverse events were not considered by either study.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease is very uncertain. There are few RCTs that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^111N4TFc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus — action statements include a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus, and a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: clinicians should perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus; obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (≥ 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months); educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; against Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and against transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group also provided options, stating that clinicians may obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status).

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease comparing betahistine, diuretics, antihistamines, antivirals or systemic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow‐up of less than three months, or with a cross‐over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified).

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included 10 studies with a total of 848 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines.

Betahistine

Seven RCTs (548 participants) addressed this comparison. However, we were unable to conduct any meta‐analyses for our primary outcomes as not all outcomes were considered by every study, and studies that did report the same outcome used different time points for follow‐up, or assessed the outcome using different methods. Therefore, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Some data were available for each of our primary outcomes, but the evidence was low‐ or very low‐certainty throughout. One study reported on the outcome 'improvement in vertigo' at 6 to ≤ 12 months, and another study reported this outcome at > 12 months. Four studies reported on the change in vertigo, but again all used different methods of assessment (vertigo frequency, or a global score of vertigo severity) or different time points. A single study reported on serious adverse events.

Diuretics

Two RCTs addressed this comparison. One considered the use of isosorbide (220 participants), and the other used a combination of amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide (80 participants). Again, we were unable to conduct any meta‐analyses for our primary outcomes, as only one study reported on the outcome 'improvement in vertigo' (at 6 to ≤ 12 months), one study reported on change in vertigo (at 3 to < 6 months) and neither study assessed serious adverse events. Therefore, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. The evidence was all very low‐certainty.

Other pharmacological interventions

We also identified one study that assessed antivirals (24 participants), and one study that assessed corticosteroids (16 participants). The evidence for these interventions was all very low‐certainty. Again, serious adverse events were not considered by either study.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease is very uncertain. There are few RCTs that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta‐analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

GRADE-based recommendation framework — per GRADE, each recommendation's strength and direction is determined by the following four domains and includes the domain Confidence in the Quality of the Evidence, for which the options include High, Moderate, Low, or Very Low; the overall quality of the body of evidence is rated as High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low, and if the quality of evidence differs across the relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation; recommendation strength generally aligns with the confidence in the quality of evidence (e.g. Strong recommendations are typically supported by High or Moderate quality evidence), although GRADE permits Low or Very Low quality evidence to support a Strong recommendation in certain instances (e.g., life-threatening situation).

### Transtympanic management of tinnitus [^113FJgC7]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Transtympanic therapy is becoming and important treatment modality for many inner ear disorders. The current therapies aimed at Meniere's disease, sudden sensorineural hearing loss, noise-induced hearing loss, and the tinnitus associated with these disorders and idiopathic tinnitus, however, represents simply an evolutionary step in this treatment modality and must be validated by further scientific study. A number of promising developments including newer more targeted neuroactive medicines, a better understanding of medicine delivery, and the knowledge of the site, origin, and pathophysiology of the symptoms complex will make this therapy more effective. In the future it is possible that many inner ear disorders will be amenable to inner ear medical therapy. Ideally in the future with knowledge of the disease and its etiology the physician will simply pick the established medicine, the established dose, and the established route of administration and achieve a relatively predictable result.

### Tinnitus [^11374mg7]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Tinnitus is a common medical symptom that can be debilitating. Risk factors include hearing loss, ototoxic medication, head injury, and depression. At presentation, the possibilities of otological disease, anxiety, and depression should be considered. No effective drug treatments are available, although much research is underway into mechanisms and possible treatments. Surgical intervention for any otological pathology associated with tinnitus might be effective for that condition, but the tinnitus can persist. Available treatments include hearing aids when hearing loss is identified (even mild or unilateral), wide-band sound therapy, and counselling. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is indicated for some patients, but availability of tinnitus-specific CBT in the UK is poor. The evidence base is strongest for a combination of sound therapy and CBT-based counselling, although clinical trials are constrained by the heterogeneity of patients with tinnitus.

### Ginkgo biloba for tinnitus [^115AQS7p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinnitus is a symptom defined as the perception of sound in the absence of an external source. In England alone there are an estimated ¾ million general practice consultations every year where the primary complaint is tinnitus, equating to a major burden on healthcare services. Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sound enrichment using ear-level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co-morbid symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety or depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of Ginkgo biloba for tinnitus in adults and children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL (2022, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 7 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults and children with acute or chronic subjective tinnitus. We included studies where the intervention involved Ginkgo biloba and this was compared to placebo, no intervention, or education and information. Concurrent use of other medication or other treatment was acceptable if used equally in each group. Where an additional intervention was used equally in both groups, we analysed this as a separate comparison. The review included all courses of Ginkgo biloba, regardless of dose regimens or formulations, and for any duration of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were tinnitus symptom severity measured as a global score on a multi-item tinnitus questionnaire and serious adverse effects (bleeding, seizures). Our secondary outcomes were tinnitus loudness (change in subjective perception), tinnitus intrusiveness, generalised depression, generalised anxiety, health-related quality of life and other adverse effects (gastrointestinal upset, headache, allergic reaction). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This review included 12 studies (with a total of 1915 participants). Eleven studies compared the effects of Ginkgo biloba with placebo and one study compared the effects of Ginkgo biloba with hearing aids to hearing aids alone. All included studies were parallel-group RCTs. In general, risk of bias was high or unclear due to selection bias and poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessments. Due to heterogeneity in the outcomes measured and measurement methods used, only limited data pooling was possible. Ginkgo biloba versus placebo When we pooled data from two studies for the primary outcome tinnitus symptom severity, we found that Ginkgo biloba may have little to no effect (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores) at three to six months compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) -1.35 (scale 0 to 100), 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.26 to 5.55; 2 studies; 85 participants) (very low-certainty). Ginkgo biloba may result in little to no difference in the risk of bleeding or seizures, with no serious adverse effects reported in either group (4 studies; 1154 participants; low-certainty). For the secondary outcomes, one study found that there may be little to no difference between the effects of Ginkgo biloba and placebo on tinnitus loudness measured with audiometric loudness matching at 12 weeks, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -4.00 (scale -10 to 140 dB), 95% CI -13.33 to 5.33; 1 study; 73 participants) (very low-certainty). One study found that there may be little to no difference between the effects of Ginkgo biloba and placebo on health-related quality of life measured with the Glasgow Health Status Inventory at three months (MD -0.58 (scale 0 to 100), 95% CI -4.67 to 3.51; 1 study; 60 participants) (low-certainty). Ginkgo biloba may not increase the frequency of other adverse effects (gastrointestinal upset, headache, allergic reaction) at three months compared to placebo (risk ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.60; 4 studies; 1175 participants) (low-certainty). None of the studies reported the other secondary outcomes of tinnitus intrusiveness or changes in depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety. Gingko biloba with concurrent intervention versus concurrent intervention only One study compared Ginkgo biloba with hearing aids to hearing aids only. It assessed the mean difference in the change in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores and tinnitus loudness using a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) at three months. The study did not report adverse effects, tinnitus intrusiveness, changes in depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health-related quality of life. This was a single, very small study (22 participants) and for all outcomes the certainty of the evidence was very low. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Authors' Conclusions

There is uncertainty about the benefits and harms of Ginkgo biloba for the treatment of tinnitus when compared to placebo. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of Ginkgo biloba when used with concurrent intervention (hearing aids). The certainty of the evidence for the reported outcomes, assessed using GRADE, ranged from low to very low. Future research into the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba in patients with tinnitus should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the use of validated, patient-centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1152yEen]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.7 Statistical analysis

We estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (95%CIs) for continuous variables (i.e. the primary outcome of tinnitus severity and the secondary outcome of quality of life). For the categorical variables, we used the rate ratio (RR) and 95%CIs (i.e. the secondary outcome of response rates and drop-out rate) and applied a 0.5-zero-cell correction during the meta-analysis procedure. However, if zeroes were present in both the intervention and control arms of one study, we did not apply such a correction procedure because of the risk of increasing the bias; instead, such studies were excluded from our analysis. We used the frequentist model of NMA to compare the effect sizes of studies with similar interventions. All comparisons were performed using a two-tailed t -test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated using the tau value, which is the estimated standard deviation of the effect across the included studies.

We used mixed comparison with generalised linear mixed models to make direct and indirect comparisons. To compare multiple treatment arms, we combined direct and indirect evidence from the included studies. STATA version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC Statistics/Data Analysis StataCorp, TX, USA) was used in our NMA with the mvmeta command. The restricted maximum likelihood method was used to evaluate the between-study variance. To provide additional information for clinical applications, we calculated the relative ranking probabilities of the treatment effects of all treatments for the target outcomes. In brief, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated the percentage of the mean rank of each treatment relative to an imaginary intervention that was the best without uncertainty. When the area under the curve was smaller, the treatment deserved a higher rank of benefit in the treatment of tinnitus.

### Tinnitus [^114jRUvY]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Around 10% of people experience subjective tinnitus (the perception of sound, only audible to the patient, in the absence of an external auditory stimulus).(1–3) It may be associated with hearing loss, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, concentration problems or reduced quality of life; for around 0.5% it is extremely disturbing.(1–4) Risk factors include aging, significant noise exposure, drug therapy (e.g. aminoglycosides, NSAIDs, diuretics), or disorders of the outer, middle or inner ear or auditory nerve (e.g. ear wax, infections, vestibular schwannoma, otosclerosis).(1,2,4) It may be due to excessive spontaneous activity in the auditory system and brain; if the signal (normally suppressed by the subconscious) becomes noticed it becomes more intrusive and annoying in a vicious cycle.(5) Here, we discuss symptomatic drug and non-drug treatments for subjective tinnitus in adults. We do not cover treatment of underlying causes of tinnitus.

Intratympanic medications — intratyampanic steroid injections are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 3 prospective RCTs, with intratympanic dexamethasone and intratympanic methylprednisolone producing no benefits over placebo saline injections when measuring subjective tinnitus severity scores; a third study randomized patients to intratympanic prednisone injection, intratympanic dexamethasone, and oral carbamazepine and, although no benefit for intratympanic steroids was seen over carbamazepine, absence of a placebo group prohibited further conclusions regarding treatment effect. Side effects of steroid studies were minimal (vertigo, otalgia, aggravation of tinnitus). Intratympanic lidocaine injection is not recommended for treating tinnitus, no RCTs exist that support this treatment, and substantial side effects were seen in 2 studies performed without controls, including severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.

### Understanding tinnitus symptom dynamics and clinical improvement through intensive longitudinal data [^11582Y26]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tinnitus, characterized by the perception of an unspecified sound, is a complex and common condition affecting over 740 million adults globally according to recent estimates. In its severe form, it can be accompanied by sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, memory problems, anxiety and depression, leading to a considerable impairment in quality of life. Severe tinnitus is estimated to afflict more than 120 million individuals globally. In European countries, severe tinnitus imposes a profound individual burden with around 1500€ in annual out-of-pocket expenses, as well as socioeconomic burden with approximately 4800€ in annual socioeconomic costs per patient. Efforts have been made to alleviate both health-related and economic burden by the design and implementation of various treatment strategies such as psychological, auditory and pharmacological treatments. Yet, the efficacy of many treatment options remains unclear, which is often attributed to the diverse etiological and clinical manifestation of tinnitus, often referred to as tinnitus heterogeneity.

### Comparative efficacy of different acupuncture-related therapies for primary tinnitus: a systematic review and network meta-analysis protocol [^1168nUa4]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the treatment of primary tinnitus, conventional therapeutic therapies recommended by related guidelines mainly include medications, sound therapy, hearing aids, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and dietary changes and supplements. However, the efficacy of these therapies varies from person to person and frequently only offers modest relief. As a result, acupuncture is gaining popularity as an alternative therapy that an increasing number of tinnitus patients are seeking help. Moreover, despite the fact that more high-level evidence regarding the efficacy of acupuncture for tinnitus is warranted, acupuncture has been regarded as a potential treatment option for tinnitus in some clinical guidelines of tinnitus treatment.

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy to treat various diseases through the insertion of needles along specific meridians or pathways. The precise placement of these needles varies depending on the particular disease being targeted. Acupuncture is often combined with other relevant techniques such as moxibustion, electric stimulation, and acupressure. In recent decades, acupuncture has attracted interest as a feasible treatment option for primary tinnitus. Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analysis studieshave been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for tinnitus. The majority of these studies have shown that acupuncture is effective in alleviating tinnitus symptoms and has a favorable safety profile. Although the exact mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effects of acupuncture in treating tinnitus have yet to be fully elucidated, previous studies suggested that acupuncture could significantly improve circulation in the inner earand promote neuroplasticity of central auditory pathway. Furthermore, acupuncture could regulate neuronal changes in both auditory and extra-auditory brain networks, and it can also influence the somatosensory system. These multifaceted effects are likely to contribute to the potential mechanisms underlying acupuncture's efficacy in alleviating tinnitus. In clinical practice, various modalities of acupuncture are frequently employed in clinical practice for tinnitus treatment, including manual acupuncture (MA), electroacupuncture (EA), warm needling, acupoint injection, and so on. Moreover, these modalities are usually utilized alone or in combination. Despite the wide use of acupuncture for primary tinnitus, there is a great lack of studies that aims to compare the efficacy of various acupuncture therapies.

### The efficacy and safety of acupuncture for tinnitus-associated insomnia: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168nsAN]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinnitus accounts for a significant proportion of the factors that cause insomnia, and insomnia, in turn, aggravates tinnitus. Given that tinnitus and insomnia have a bidirectional relationship, tinnitus-associated insomnia is prevalent. Nonetheless, current treatments including medication and psychological therapies for tinnitus-associated insomnia do not yield satisfactory efficacy, thereby making it challenging to manage. Although acupuncture is a potentially effective treatment option, the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for tinnitus-associated insomnia remains inconclusive. Therefore, this systematic review and analysis protocol aims to investigate whether acupuncture is beneficial for tinnitus-associated insomnia with an acceptable safety profile.

Methods

Nine mainstream English-language and Chinese-language databases will be searched to include qualified RCTs and meta-analyses will be conducted by combining extracted data using RevMan 5.3. The risk of bias 2.0 tool recommended by Cochrane will be adopted to evaluate the methodological quality of the included RCTs. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be utilized to appraise the strength and certainty of evidence. Where available, we will also perform sensitivity analyses, publication bias and subgroup analysis.

Discussion

Expected results from our systematic review and meta-analysis will verify the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in tinnitus-associated insomnia. The evidence generated by this review will help patients and clinicians make informed treatment decisions.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^113qdfhk]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence base for those tinnitus management interventions recommended by the Department of Health's Good Practice Guide. Where possible, we aimed to identify the conditions under which these interventions are efficacious, and consider whether these interventions are sufficiently researched or in need of further study. We also asked which patients benefit most, but report little on this question due to limited information in those studies reviewed.

In a previous review of RCTs of tinnitus interventions, Dobie did not find any that demonstrated a significant benefit of intervention over typically large placebo effects. He concluded that nowhere in the literature were there studies similar enough to attempt meta-analysis. Two recommendations from that review were that future RCTs needed consensus outcome measures and adequate sample sizes. There is a now reasonable consensus in the tinnitus research community on which validated measures to use. In this review, the most widely used tinnitus questionnaire was the TRQ. It appeared in 10 of the 28 studies and was used here in two separate meta-analyses. However, only seven of 28 studies used a power calculation to estimate their required sample size. Therefore, more than 10 years on, although we have greater RCT-level evidence and some opportunities for meta-analysis, there is still little evidence for the efficacy of most recommended treatment strategies.

It is striking that many authors ascribed null results for changes in depression and anxiety to the fact that participants have low baseline scores, often quoting floor effects. It may well be that, as authors suggest, more distressed individuals are less likely to put themselves forward for clinical trials. However, it may equally be that major depression or other comorbidities are less common than anecdotally suggested. Studies of the prevalence of comorbid depression or anxiety suggest it is no more an issues for tinnitus patients than it is for non-tinnitus ENT patients. Given that the screening and management of anxiety and depression is highlighted in the GPG, more routine clinical assessment of anxiety and depression at baseline and outcome is needed to explore this observation.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115NyJgd]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with placebo-controlled, waiting-list controlled or active-controlled design, conducted in tinnitus patients. In the initial registration in PROSPERO, the target participants were those with chronic tinnitus and the target of comparison was pharmacologic treatment only. However, in order to reduce the potential heterogeneity of the recruited participants and to expand the potential treatment strategy, we changed to only included published RCTs to compare different pharmacologic treatments or nutrient supplements in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin. That is, in the current NMA, non-invasive brain/nerve stimulation methods were not investigated. Further, tinnitus patients with specific or treatable origin would not be included in the current study. The targets of comparison arms were set to be pharmacologic treatments or nutrient supplements in patients with tinnitus. That is, in the current NMA, non-invasive brain/nerve stimulation methods were not investigated.

The exclusion criteria were [1] not a clinical trial, [2] not an RCT, [3] not reporting the target outcomes (defined below), [4] not related to pharmacologic treatment or nutrient supplements mentioned earlier and [5] studies investigating central or peripheral non-invasive brain/nerve stimulation therapy. In cases of duplicated usage of data (i.e. different articles based on the same sample sources), we included only the article with the largest sample source. In addition, the network meta-analysis was based on two KEY hypotheses (i.e. transitivity and similarity), which had to be fulfilled by the good randomization. It will violate these important hypotheses of network meta-analysis if we included the study with poor randomization [i.e. had significantly different baseline tinnitus severity between the groups after randomization]. In order to improve the quality of similarity/transitivity hypothesis, we excluded those poor randomization RCTs with significantly different severity in baseline.

### Intratympanic administration of OTO-313 reduces tinnitus in patients with moderate to severe, persistent tinnitus: a phase 1 / 2 study [^113HwpZy]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus or "ringing in the ears", defined as a perception of sound without a correlated external auditory stimulus, is a common problem that affects millions (i.e. approximately 10% of the adult population in the United States or 21.4 million people suffer from tinnitus). A significant proportion of patients experience moderate to severe tinnitus, which can negatively impact sleep, disrupt ability to focus, create feelings of distress, anxiety, and depression, and lower overall quality of life.

At present, there is no cure or approved medications to treat tinnitus. Nearly half of patients will seek medical treatment. Current management focuses on education and counseling, sound therapy, use of hearing aids, and cognitive behavioral therapy. These therapies focus primarily on modulation of patient's attention and reactions to tinnitus rather than the sensation itself.

Tinnitus often arises as a consequence of noise or other cochlear insults. Although systemically administered agents have been tested in clinical studies in tinnitus aimed at influencing the putative imbalance in auditory firing rates produced by cochlear insults, none have been approved to treat tinnitus. One potential pharmacologic approach to treating tinnitus would be to normalize altered neural activity within the cochlea. Excessive activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors at the level of the inner hair cell synapses with subsequent deafferentation may be key in altering activity of the auditory nerve and generating subjective tinnitus. In animal models of acute tinnitus induced by acute traumatic noise or salicylate, intratympanic administration of NMDA receptor antagonists was shown to reduce "tinnitus-like" behavior. These findings suggest that activation of cochlear NMDA receptors may be an important mechanism for generating tinnitus and that intratympanic NMDA receptor antagonists may have potential as a local cochlear treatment for tinnitus.

Gacyclidine is a high affinity NMDA-receptor antagonist, that has shown efficacy in animal models of tinnitus. In addition, gacyclidine was administered to the otic compartment in an open label study in patients with chronic tinnitus. The drug was generally safe and well-tolerated and reduced subjective ratings of tinnitus in four of six patients evaluated.

OTO-313 is a lipid-based formulation of gacyclidine that provides sustained exposure to the cochlea after a single intratympanic injection. Intratympanic delivery of drugs permits deposition over the round window membrane, allowing access to the inner ear for more localized delivery to the cochlea and less systemic drug exposure. Herein, we report the safety and exploratory efficacy of OTO-313 in a Phase 1/2 study.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^117MWWgy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Patient education — bothersome tinnitus outlines definition, differentiation from transient ear noise, assessment, potential temporariness with noise exposure, medication-related tinnitus, absence of a cure, and current pathophysiology. Tinnitus is described as sound created in the ears or head, a symptom rather than a disease, and may be chronic or intermittent. Transient ear noise is a sudden unilateral whistling with perceived hearing loss that resolves in about a minute and is normal. Clinicians should determine how much of a complaint is due to hearing problems versus tinnitus, with assessment potentially including an audiologic examination and questionnaires. Noise exposure can cause temporary threshold shift and temporary tinnitus that will likely resolve within a few days, but repeated exposure increases the likelihood of permanence. Medications and drug interactions can induce tinnitus, which is usually temporary — typically lasting 1 to 2 weeks postexposure — but can be permanent; examples include aminoglycosides and cisplatin, and drugs such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, loop diuretics, quinine, and certain mental health and sleep medications may trigger or exacerbate tinnitus. There is no cure for primary tinnitus and no method proven to provide long-term suppression, but care can relieve functional effects (sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, hearing problems, difficulty relaxing) and patients can learn to manage reactions to improve QOL with compassionate support. Current theory suggests tinnitus results from compensatory adaptation of the central auditory system to hearing loss, there is a near universal association of tinnitus with hearing loss, hearing loss associated with tinnitus can range from minimal to profound and many with hearing loss do not experience tinnitus, and changes in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters occur throughout the auditory pathway in association with tinnitus.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^1115MzgA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Abbreviations and definitions of common terms — Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external source of the sound. Primary tinnitus is tinnitus that is idiopathic and may or may not be associated with sensorineural hearing loss, whereas secondary tinnitus is tinnitus that is associated with a specific underlying cause (other than sensorineural hearing loss) or an identifiable organic condition. Recent onset tinnitus is less than 6 months in duration (as reported by the patient), and persistent tinnitus is 6 months or longer in duration. Bothersome tinnitus is a distressed patient with affected quality of life and/or functional health status who is seeking active therapy and management strategies to alleviate tinnitus, while nonbothersome tinnitus does not have a significant effect on a patient's quality of life but may result in curiosity about cause or concern about natural history and change over time.

2.4 Data extraction

Three authors (JJ Chen, YW Chen and BY Zeng) independently screened the studies and extracted the relevant information from the manuscripts. In cases of discrepancy, the corresponding author (PT Tseng) mediated. If data of outcomes of interest were missing from published reports, the corresponding authors or co-authors were approached to obtain the additional data. If the data of outcomes of interest still were unavailable, we will only count the other available outcomes of interest from this RCT in the network meta-analysis of other outcomes. We followed an a priori defined unpublished protocol (available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author) and the flowchart used in previous NMAs.

2.5 Outcomes

2.5.1 Primary outcome

The primary outcome was change in the severity of tinnitus after treatment in patients with tinnitus.

2.5.2 Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes were change in quality of life and response rate related to the treatment in patients with tinnitus. The response rate was defined on the basis of the criteria applied in the included studies. Finally, we assessed the dropout rate, which was defined as the percentage of patients dropping out for any reason before study completion.

2.6 Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Grade ratings

Three independent authors (JJ Chen, YW Chen and BY Zeng) evaluated the risk of bias (interrater reliability, 0.85) for each domain described in the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence, including transitivity, precision, and coherence, according to the GRADE framework and the article by Cipriani, et al.

### Efficacy of tinnitus retraining therapy in the treatment of tinnitus: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^112fvFnq]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) in the treatment of tinnitus.

Materials and Method

Computer retrieval of PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), Wanfang data, etc., were conducted. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the literature's quality was evaluated, and useful data was extracted. All statistical analyses were performed by RevMan5.3 software.

Results

13 eligible RCTs with a total of 1345 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results showed that the 1-month response rate, 3-month response rate, 6-month response rate, and overall response rate of TRT with drugs for tinnitus were higher than that of drugs only (P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that the THI scale after the treatment period of TRT with medications for tinnitus was lower than that of drugs only (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Analysis of limited studies low-quality evidence with a high risk of bias showed that the TRT was an effective treatment for tinnitus, which could improve the response rate of tinnitus and reduce the THI scale. However, more multicenter RCTs with a large sample number and high quality should verify the conclusion mentioned above.

4 Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first NMA addressing the efficacy of different pharmacologic management in tinnitus without specific/treatable origin (i.e. primary tinnitus). The main findings of the current NMA were that regimens of pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effect, such as amitriptyline, acamprosate, gabapentin, and melatonin, were associated with significantly better improvement in tinnitus severity or response rate than the placebo/waiting-list groups. Several mechanisms support the effects found in this NMA. Another important finding of the current NMA was the significantly higher response rate of intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin than the placebo/waiting-list group. Most treatments showed similar drop-out rate compared to placebo/control.

The severe tinnitus perception exerted similar abnormal neurotransmitter secretion found in the pain perception in the somatosensory system, which was associated with decreased GABAergic inhibition. Therefore, the prescription of gabapentin, which bound at calcium channel proteins and exerted widely suppressing effect, could imitate the GABAergic effect. Similarly, the amitriptyline, one of the tri-cyclic antidepressant family, had been found to exert its role on nociceptive perception in the central somatosensory system through multiple neurotransmitter system, such as GABA and alpha1-adrenergic receptors. In addition to the theory of abnormal nociceptive perception, the previous systematic review and network meta-analysis had demonstrated that tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin had been found to have significant hyperactivity in brain multiple regions. Therefore, the strategy to reduce the abnormal hyperactivity would exert potential beneficial effects to reduce tinnitus severity. For example, the acamprosate is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain through blocking glutaminergic N-methyl — aspartate receptors and GABA receptors, which efficacy in improving tinnitus would reflect the potential new direction for guiding future research of tinnitus management.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^113kVJU2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants — antidepressants are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 7 RCTs and 1 Cochrane review that failed to demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm. Although 4 of 7 trials showed improvement, these trials had significant methodological limitations, and the Cochrane review included 4 trials of tricyclic antidepressants, 1 trial of trazodone, and 1 trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine); of these trials, 4 are double blind, 1 is single blind, and 1 does not clearly state blinding. Three tricyclic trials showed modest improvement possibly related to depression/anxiety modulation rather than tinnitus change, and commonly reported side effects include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth with more subjects dropping out of treatment groups than placebo; tinnitus is listed as a rare side effect of all available antidepressants.

### Use of biologics for treatment of autoimmune inner ear disease [^116zwbSt]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Biologic medications are novel therapeutics in the treatment of Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease (AIED), an etiology of Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL). The goal of this study is to review the currently available literature on the efficacy of biologic medications on autoimmune-mediated hearing loss and associated symptomology among patients with AIED.

Methods

A systematic review of Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify studies investigating the impact of biologic medications on hearing outcomes. Bias assessment was independently conducted by three authors and studies were stratified based on risk of bias.

Results

Of 174 unique abstracts screened, 12 articles met inclusion criteria for formal review. One randomized control trial, seven prospective cohort studies, and four retrospective cohort studies were included. Seven biologic medications, Etanercept, Infliximab, Adalimumab, Golimumab, Rituximab, Anakinra, and Canakinumab, were identified targeting three unique molecular targets, TNF-α, CD20, and IL-1.

Conclusion

The effects of biologic medications in treating SNHL was highly variable without clear efficacy of a drug or drug category, likely due to rarity of disease, multifactorial etiologies of AIED, and cohort heterogeneity. However, several medications alleviate symptoms associated with AIED, such as vertigo and tinnitus. While biologic medications may be promising therapeutics in AIED patients, the evidence is currently inconclusive. Large-scale randomized control trials and prospective cohort reviews are required to establish the efficacy of biologic medications in treating hearing loss.

### A systematic review of eligibility and outcomes in tinnitus trials: reassessment of tinnitus guideline [^113txQya]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze existing tinnitus treatment trials with regard to eligibility criteria, outcome measures, study quality, and external validity and to recognize the effect of patient demographics, symptom duration, severity, and otologic comorbidity on research findings to help practitioners apply them to patient encounters.

Data Sources

Systematic literature search conducted by an information specialist for development of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's tinnitus clinical practice guideline.

Review Methods

Articles were assessed for eligibility with the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) and data extracted by 2 independent investigators. Studies were assessed for methodological quality, inclusion and exclusion criteria, patient demographics, and outcome measures.

Results

A total of 147 randomized trials met inclusion criteria. Nearly all studies took place in a specialist setting. More than 50% did not explicitly define tinnitus, and 44% used a subjective severity threshold, such as "severely disturbing". Fifty-four percent required symptom duration of at least 6 months for study eligibility, and up to 33% excluded patients with "organic" hearing loss or otologic conditions. Mean age was 52.2 years, and median follow-up was 3 months. Only 20% had a low risk of bias.

Conclusion

Randomized trials of tinnitus interventions are most applicable to older adults with tinnitus lasting ≥ 6 months who are evaluated in specialty settings. High risk of bias, short follow-up, and outcome reporting raise concerns about the validity of findings and may influence how clinicians apply trial results to individual patients and establish treatment expectations, thus demonstrating the need for further quality research in this field.

### Anticonvulsants for tinnitus [^1138Zzzp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Tinnitus is the perception of sound or noise in the absence of an external or internal acoustic stimulation. It is a common and potentially distressing symptom for which no adequate therapy exists.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of anticonvulsants in patients with chronic tinnitus.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 26 May 2010.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials in patients with chronic tinnitus comparing orally administered anticonvulsants with placebo. The primary outcome was improvement in tinnitus measured with validated questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were improvement in tinnitus measured with self-assessment scores, improvement in global well-being or accompanying symptoms, and adverse drug effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently.

Main Results

Seven trials (453 patients) were included in this review. These studies investigated four different anticonvulsants: gabapentin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and flunarizine. The risk of bias of most studies was 'high' or 'unclear'. Three studies included a validated questionnaire (primary outcome). None of them showed a significant positive effect of anticonvulsants. One study showed a significant negative effect of gabapentin compared to placebo with an increase in Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score of 18.4 points (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 1.58). A second study showed a positive, non-significant effect of gabapentin with a difference compared to placebo of 2.4 points on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.25). When the data from these two studies are pooled no effect of gabapentin is found (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.40). A third study reported no differences on the THI after treatment with gabapentin compared to placebo (exact numbers could not be extracted from the article). A meta-analysis of 'any positive effect' (yes versus no) based on a self-assessment score (secondary outcome) showed a small favourable effect of anticonvulsants (RD 14%, 95% CI 6% to 22%). A meta-analysis of 'near or total eradication of tinnitus annoyance' showed no effect of anticonvulsants (risk difference (RD) 4%, 95% CI -2% to 11%). Side effects of the anticonvulsants used were experienced by 18% of patients.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence regarding the effectiveness of anticonvulsants in patients with tinnitus has significant risk of bias. There is no evidence from studies performed so far to show that anticonvulsants have a large positive effect in the treatment of tinnitus but a small effect (of doubtful clinical significance) has been demonstrated.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^114ZWDg1]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The "phantom" auditory experience of tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of people in the United Kingdom. It is most clearly associated with noise exposure and ageing and can present with comorbid sleep disturbance, hearing difficulty, social withdrawal, and negative emotional reactions such as anxiety and depression. Although a majority of tinnitus patients are male and present with some form of hearing loss and higher-frequency steeply sloping hearing loss in particular, there is no typical characteristic history or level of distress of the help-seeking tinnitus patient.

In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health issued a Good Practice Guide (GPG) for the commissioning of tinnitus services and for the clinical assessment and management of tinnitus patients. It recommends that tinnitus severity is assessed using either the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)or the Tinnitus Questionnaire. It also recommends that psychological comorbidity is assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventoryor the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). However, questionnaire use in clinical practice is limited.

In terms of management, therapeutic targets include the sound itself (i.e. interrupt the neural signal generating the sound) or the associated symptoms of distress, anxiety, or depression that can accompany tinnitus. The GPG states that tinnitus patients will be given, as appropriate, information/education, hearing aids, counseling and psychological support, relaxation therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with the requisite professional supervision, sleep management (including supervised CBT), sound enrichment therapy, and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). The use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and night sedation is also advocated. However, the GPG lacks an evidence base to support these recommendations and is in part based on anecdotal evidence and expert opinion.

This review asked the question, how much high-level evidence exists for the efficacy of the GPG-suggested tinnitus management strategies, and was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for evaluating therapeutic interventions. A systematic search was used to identify RCTs that examined tinnitus management strategies and reported validated measures of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression, therefore providing comparable measures of change in patient symptoms. Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted. The outcome of this review provides high-level evidence that supports some, but not all, GPG recommended strategies for tinnitus management in the United Kingdom, and also highlights where further RCTs would be of immediate benefit.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^1153WrAR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported experiencing tinnitus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potential significant effect on quality of life, there are no evidence-based, multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians with management. The focus of this guideline is on tinnitus that is both bothersome and persistent (lasting 6 months or longer), which often negatively affects the patient's quality of life. The target audience for the guideline is any clinician, including nonphysicians, involved in managing patients with tinnitus. The target patient population is limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus. This guideline provides clinicians with a logical framework to improve patient care and mitigate the personal and social effects of persistent, bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including selection and timing of diagnostic testing and specialty referral to identify potential underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the evaluation and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the evaluation and measurement of the effect of tinnitus and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life for tinnitus sufferers.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus. The development group made a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: Clinicians should (a) perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that if promptly identified and managed may relieve tinnitus; (b) obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (≥ 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; (c) distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care; (d) educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; (e) recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and (f) recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against (a) antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; (b) Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: Clinicians may (a) obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status); and (b) recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.

RESULTS

All studies included in this review were RCTs of tinnitus management interventions mentioned in the GPG. All participant groups were representative of a clinically relevant population, and without exception all studies reported one or more outcomes based on validated questionnaire measures of tinnitus, anxiety, or depression. Unless otherwise stated, studies included adults of all ages, and baseline scores for outcome measures did not differ significantly between groups. Throughout, statistical significance refers to a reliable numerical difference between group means. Clinical significance refers to the specific questionnaire score change that implies a functional improvement or worsening of the condition in an individual patient.

Vicious circle of symptoms in tinnitus — Tinnitus severity is positively correlated with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and other psychosocial factors, which can form a "vicious circle" of symptoms, and tinnitus that has been present for six months or more is likely to persist; the treatment of chronic tinnitus is more accurately described in terms of management rather than cure. For some patients, tinnitus can exacerbate co-occurring anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and these co-occurring conditions can affect the severity of tinnitus; effective treatment of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or PTSD might decrease the severity of tinnitus and improve quality of life (QoL). Effective interventions should include management of tinnitus functional impact and associated co-occurring conditions, and when tinnitus negatively impacts patients' health-related QoL, multidisciplinary interventions are often required.

### The efficacy of acoustic therapy versus oral medication for chronic tinnitus: a meta-analysis [^116UjeyK]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of acoustic therapy (AT) and drug therapy (DT) for chronic tinnitus.

Methods

We searched Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Embase, and Cochrane Library from the establishment of the database to December 2019. Meta-analysis was performed on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with included literature using Revman 5.3 software.

Results

A total of 18 documents were included, including 16 Chinese documents and 2 English documents, with 1774 patients (including 962 patients treated with AT and 812 patients treated with DT). The effect of AT (by the number of cases or ears) is better than that of DT (P < 0.05). After treatment, the THI value of AT was more evident than that of DT (WMD = -4.25, (-13.24, -5.29)). And the VAS value of AT was significantly lower than that of DT (WMD = -0.73, (-1.31, -0.15)).

Conclusion

Compared with DT, AT can significantly improve the efficacy of tinnitus and reduce the symptoms of tinnitus patients. Clinically, it can vigorously promote the application value of treating tinnitus by sound.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Tinnitus — GB and antioxidant interventions: Evidence suggests that the use of GB alone does not improve outcomes in tinnitus functional impact, tinnitus perceived loudness, or QoL in patients with bothersome tinnitus, and a systematic review including 12 RCTs (n = 1,915), 11 of which compared GB with a placebo, found little to no effect on THI scores, QoL, and tinnitus perceived loudness scores, with four studies reporting zero adverse events with GB use; one study comparing GB plus hearing aids versus GB alone found no improvement in tinnitus functional impact and tinnitus perceived loudness. A meta-analysis of five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate dementia with tinnitus and dizziness using an 11-point scale reported among the patients with tinnitus at baseline (n = 773) a mean reduction with GB use (mean difference: -1.06; 95% CI: -1.77–-0.36; p = 0.003), but there were significant issues with the measurement of tinnitus, including that a standardized tinnitus scale was not used, small sample sizes ranging from 19 to 102 patients, and potentially unreliable ratings. In a randomized double-blinded clinical trial (n = 58) of GB plus antioxidants versus placebo for six months, no difference between the groups was found when measured with the tinnitus functional impact questionnaire.

Tinnitus — rTMS regulatory status and implementation notes that although rTMS is FDA approved for the treatment of depression, it is unapproved for the treatment of tinnitus, making rTMS treatment for tinnitus less readily available; evidence suggests rTMS might be effective for chronic tinnitus but larger clinical trials are necessary to identify practical and efficacious protocols because most studies had relatively small samples and variable parameters, sessions, outcomes, and follow-up; standardized protocols must be developed and tested before large-scale clinical implementation, and providers who administer rTMS should also be knowledgeable about other effective tinnitus management strategies that could augment the procedure and benefit patients.

### Steroids for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^111Xc18x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2006 and previously updated in 2009. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is a clinical diagnosis characterised by a sudden deafness of cochlear or retrocochlear origin in the absence of a clear precipitating cause. Steroids are commonly prescribed to treat this condition. There is no consensus on their effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine whether steroids in the treatment of ISSHL a) improve hearing (primary) and b) reduce tinnitus (secondary). To determine the incidence of significant side effects from the medication.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 22 April 2013.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which steroids were evaluated in comparison with either no treatment or a placebo. We considered trials including the use of steroids in combination with another treatment if the comparison control group also received the same other treatment. The two authors reviewed the full-text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance and applied the inclusion criteria independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

We graded trials for risk of bias using the Cochrane approach. The data extraction was performed in a standardised manner by one author and rechecked by the other author. Where necessary we contacted investigators to obtain the missing information. Meta-analysis was neither possible nor considered appropriate because of the heterogeneity of the populations studied and the differences in steroid formulations, dosages and duration of treatment. We analysed and reported the quality of the results of each study individually. A narrative overview of the results is presented.

Main Results

Only three trials, involving 267 participants, satisfied the inclusion criteria and all three studies were at high risk of bias. One trial showed a lack of effect of oral steroids in improving hearing compared with the placebo control group. The second trial showed a significant improvement of hearing in 61% of the patients receiving oral steroid and in only 32% of the patients from the control group (combination of placebo-treated group and untreated control group). The third trial also showed a lack of effect of oral steroids in improving hearing compared with the placebo control. However, this trial did not follow strict inclusion criteria for participant selection and analysis of data was limited by significant exclusion of participants from the final analysis and lack of participant compliance to the treatment protocol. No clear evidence was presented in two trials about any harmful side effects of the steroids. Only one study declared that no patients suffered from adverse effects of the steroid treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The value of steroids in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains unclear since the evidence obtained from randomised controlled trials is contradictory in outcome, in part because the studies are based upon too small a number of patients.

### Pharmacologic therapy for eustachian tube dysfunction… [^111EKLVP]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

1 One study of 44 children found no improvement in hearing in those receiving oral corticosteroids compared with the placebo group. 2 Five RCTs that included 409 children found that oral corticosteroids plus antibiotics improved rates of OME resolution at less than one month compared with placebo plus an antibiotic. 1 One study of 99 children found no improvement in hearing in those receiving oral corticosteroids. 3 In all studies included in the Cochrane review, the benefits of corticosteroids did not persist beyond four weeks. NASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS Nasal corticosteroids have not demonstrated short- or long-term benefits in the resolution of OME or improvement in hearing. One study of 200 children randomized to daily mometasone or placebo found no difference in the number of days with hearing loss after three months of therapy.

An RCT including 91 participants with OME found that triamcinolone nasal spray was no better than placebo for improving tympanometry findings or symptoms such as deafness and blocked or popping ears. 7 Analysis of a subgroup of children found a similar lack of effectiveness. DECONGESTANTS AND ANTIHISTAMINES A systematic review of 16 RCTs evaluating first-generation antihistamines and decongestants alone or in combination found no clinically or statistically significant improvement in hearing or OME persistence with the active treatments compared with placebo. 8 The treatment groups had more adverse effects; irritability, sedation, and gastrointestinal upset were the most common.

Recommendations from Others UpToDate recommends treatment of the underlying cause of eustachian tube dysfunction and states that systemic decongestants may be helpful in isolated cases. 9.
