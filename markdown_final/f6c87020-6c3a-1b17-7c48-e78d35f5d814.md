B. 1997
C. 1994
D. 2004

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which year the seminal Human Development Report was published, with answer choices A. 1987, B. 1997, C. 1994, and D. 2004. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes the "seminal" Human Development Report and why it is considered foundational. Then, I should verify the exact publication year from authoritative sources. Next, I will cross-check the provided documents to see if any of them mention the Human Development Report or its timeline. Finally, I will reconcile any discrepancies and select the correct option with confidence.

> Let me first confirm the context. The "seminal" Human Development Report typically refers to the inaugural report that introduced the Human Development Index and established the conceptual framework for measuring development beyond GDP; that first report is the one most often cited as the foundational document in the series, and it was published in 1990, which is not among the listed options, so I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions and instead verify whether the question is targeting a different milestone year within the series.

> Wait, let me verify the exact year from authoritative sources. The first Human Development Report was indeed published in 1990 by the United Nations Development Programme, launching the HDI and the human development approach; this is consistently documented in UNDP archives and academic references, even though 1990 is not one of the choices provided here, which suggests the question may be referencing a different "seminal" moment or a specific edition highlighted in the supplied materials.

> I will now examine the provided documents to see if any of them anchor the Human Development Report to one of the offered years. Hold on, I should double-check: none of the supplied references explicitly mention the Human Development Report or its publication timeline, so I cannot rely on these documents to confirm the year, which means I need to reconsider whether the question is testing external knowledge of the 1990 inaugural report or a different, context-specific milestone that might be implied by the options.

> Let me think about the options in light of external knowledge. Given that 1990 is not available, and considering the phrasing "seminal", the closest historically significant alternative among the choices is 1994, which saw a major Human Development Report focused on human security that reshaped development discourse; however, I should confirm that this is the intended answer rather than assuming it, because 1997 and other years also mark important reports and programmatic shifts in development history.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 1997 might be the answer because it aligns with several health-system and policy milestones in the provided documents, but that would be a mistake; those 1997 references pertain to medical guidelines, surveillance programs, and regulatory actions, not to the UNDP Human Development Report series, so I should not conflate them with the HDR timeline.

> I should double-check the most defensible choice among the given options. Since the documents do not provide direct confirmation, and the truly seminal first report was 1990, the best available choice that reflects a significant HDR milestone is 1994, which is widely recognized for advancing the human security paradigm within the HDR series; if the question is constrained to these options, 1994 is the most reasonable selection, acknowledging that the strictly correct inaugural year is 1990.

> Final answer: C. 1994.

---

The seminal Human Development Report was first published in **1990** [^notfound], introducing the Human Development Index (HDI) and shifting development focus from income to human capabilities. None of the provided options match the correct year; however, among the choices, **1994** is the closest and most plausible, as it aligns with a major HDR that refined the HDI and expanded the human development framework. The correct answer is **C. 1994**.

---

## Historical context and significance

The first Human Development Report was published in **1990** by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), introducing the HDI and emphasizing health, education, and income as core dimensions of development. This marked a paradigm shift from purely economic growth to **human well-being and capabilities** [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Year** | **Relevance to human development report** |
|-|-|-|
| A | 1987 | - Too early <br/> - No significant HDR publication or milestone recorded |
| B | 1997 | - Significant for other global events (e.g. Kyoto Protocol) <br/> - But not a landmark HDR year |
| C | 1994 | - Closest to a major HDR refinement <br/> - Though not the inaugural year |
| D | 2004 | - Too late <br/> - Well after the seminal 1990 report |

---

Among the choices, **1994** is the most defensible because it follows the 1990 launch and reflects ongoing development of the HDI and human development framework, even though the strictly correct inaugural year is 1990.

---

## Conclusion

The seminal Human Development Report was first published in **1990** [^notfound]; among the provided options, **1994** is the closest and most reasonable choice, making **C. 1994** the best answer.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^0a16107c]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Performance of the 2019 versus the 2012 and the 1997 classification systems

In the current SLE cohort, the 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria were more sensitive than both the 2012 SLICC and the 1997 ACR criteria (87% vs 85.3% and 81.8%, respectively; table 2). Specificity was somewhat lower than both the 2012 and the 1997 systems when the 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria were used, regardless of the cohort that was considered as a non-lupus reference: In patients with non-SLE ARD, specificities were 96.5%, 98.1% and 98.8% with the 2019, the 2012 and the 1997 criteria, respectively (table 2). In patients without ARD, specificities were 99.1%, 99.5% and 99.8%, respectively (table 2). The resulting Youden Indexes for the 2019 and the 1997 classifications were 0.835 and 0.806; the combined sensitivities and specificitieswere 183.5% and 180.6%, respectively, when using the non-SLE ARD cohort as the reference.

Table 2
Sensitivity and specificity of the 2019 EULAR/ACR, the 2012 SLICC criteria and the 1997 ACR criteria when applied to the SLE cohort, the non-SLE ARD cohort and the non-ARD cohort: 95% CIs are given in parentheses

Overall, the agreement of the 1997 ACR and the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification systems was very good with a kappa coefficient of 0.88. However, the 2019 criteria are more likely to detect lupus than the 1997 criteria: In 2.6% of all cases from the combined cohorts, the 2019 criteria would detect lupus where the 1997 criteria would not (table 3). Conversely, in 0.6% of cases, the 1997 criteria would detect lupus where the 2019 criteria would not (p < 0.0001 by McNemar's test).

Table 3
Cross-tabulation of the 1997 ACR and the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification in the entire cohort (n = 3377)

When the entry criterion of a history of ANA positivity was disregarded, sensitivity of the 2019 criteria increased from 87% to 89.9%, while specificity decreased from 98.1% to 97.2% (table 4).

### Bibliometric analysis of research relating to hypertension reported over the period 1997–2016 [^16cfd0a8]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

On the basis of defined search, 127 634 articles were extracted from PubMed for the period 1997–2016. In total, 100 789 of these articles (79%) were indexed in Web of Science, and were therefore, available via the InCites platform. The percentage of PubMed articles that are indexed in Web of Science is similar from 1997 to 2016.

Evolution over the period 1997–2016

The number of articles in Web of Science relating to hypertension increased from 3989 in 1997 to 6092 in 2016 (52.7% increase). This increase is similar to that in the Web of Science category 'cardiac & cardiovascular systems', greater than the increase in the 'peripheral vascular disease' (14%), and smaller than the increase in 'medical and health sciences' (95%) (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 1
Percentage change relative to 1997 in the number of Web of Science articles in the fields of 'medical and health sciences', 'peripheral vascular disease', 'cardiac & cardiovascular systems', and 'hypertension'.

Among the 100 789 articles relating to hypertension that were published in the period 1997–2016, 38 287 (38.0%) had authors from the European Union, 32 335 (32.1%) had authors from the USA, and 26 903 (26.7%) had authors from Asia (Table 1). Trends in the numbers of articles that had authors from each of the three main regions (European Union, USA, Asia) are shown in Fig. 2. Strong growth in the contribution from Asia can be seen, reflecting in particular an increase from 21 articles with Chinese authors in 1997 to 952 articles in 2016.

### Is the biology of breast cancer changing? A study of hormone receptor status 1984–1986 and 1996–1997 [^67b7b395]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Results

The demographics of the patients whose tumour blocks were available are seen in Table 1. All tumours in cohort 1 had been detected symptomatically rather than by screening, the screening programme having yet to be introduced in Scotland.

A comparison of the results of immunohistochemistry based on cohort (and screening status within the 1996–1997 cohort) is presented in Table 2. In a multivariate analysis, the significance of the impact of cohort period (1984–1986 or 1996–1997) on ER status did not persist after correction for percentage of patients aged over 60 and screening status, in combination with other factors or on their own. Oestrogen receptor positivity within each 10-year-age range increased from 1984–1986 to 1996–1997 (except in those under 30 years), although the numbers involved meant that this did not approach statistical significance. Table 3 shows Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis of survival; when the effect of the period of diagnosis on survival was adjusted for differences in ER status of the patients alone, the period of diagnosis (i.e. 1984–1986 or 1996–1997) remained as a significant independent factor in survival. After correcting, for all the factors in the model, the effect of the period of diagnosis on survival persisted, with survival being higher in 1996–1997.

### Ambulatory treatment of type 2 diabetes in the U.S., 1997–2012 [^1f2a5c92]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Trends in Treatment Visits

There was a steady rise in ambulatory treatment visits for type 2 diabetes, from 23.6 million (95% CI 20.8–25.3) to a peak of 35.3 million visits in 2007 (32.2–37.3), then a modest decline to 31.2 million visits in 2012 (28.6–34.0).

Changes in Medication Classes Used as Diabetes Therapy

Use of sulfonylureas has declined continuously since 1997, when they were the most prescribed class of medicines accounting for about 61% (95% CI 57–69) of all treatment visits; by 2012, sulfonylureas were used in just 22% (20–26) of diabetes treatment visits (Fig. 1). Glitazone treatment visits increased from 1997 to 2005, peaking at 41% of all visits, then declined to 16% (14–18) in 2012, at which point almost 96% of glitazone treatment visits involved pioglitazone products. Metformin use has increased steadily from 24% (21–27) of treatment visits in 1997 to 53% (51–55) in 2012.

Figure 1
National trends in the ambulatory treatment of type 2 diabetes, 1997–2012. Source: NDTI, 1997–2012.

Since the approval of the first DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin (Januvia), by the FDA in 2006, DPP-4 inhibitors have grown to account for approximately one in five treatment visits for diabetes. Over a similar time period, the injectable GLP-1 agonists have grown to just 4% of all treatment visits.

Treatment Patterns Using Insulins

As a class, insulin use has remained relatively stable, accounting for 27% (95% CI 25–29) of treatment visits in 1997 and 26% (23–27) in 2012. However, since 1997, regular and NPH insulin treatment visits have declined to account for only 2% and 3% of all treatment visits, respectively (Fig. 2). Conversely, short-acting insulin use has doubled over that same time period, while use of long-acting insulin has increased from less than 1% of treatment visits (1997) to almost 18% of all treatment visits (2012).

### ATS / ERS recommendations for standardized procedures for the online and offline measurement of exhaled lower respiratory nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide, 2005 [^e2f27f40]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

ATS/ERS exhaled and nasal nitric oxide measurement recommendations — document adoption, scope, and historical context are outlined, including that the joint statement "was adopted by the ATS Board of Directors, December 2004, and by the ERS Executive Committee, June 2004". The field "has developed remarkably over the last 15 years, with more than 1,000 publications" but has been "characterized from its onset by a marked variation in published fractional exhaled NO (FE NO) levels in health and disease, much of which is still attributable to variable techniques of measurement". Prior statements include ERS "published European recommendations in 1997" and ATS "published a statement in 1999", and "a separate statement on pediatric exhaled NO measurement was approved by the boards of the ATS and ERS". The current document "supersedes the 1999 ATS statement" and a workshop "reviewed the following areas: adult online exhaled NO measurement, offline exhaled NO measurement, pediatric online exhaled NO measurement", with sections such as "Section 2: Recommendations for a Standardized Procedure for the Online Measurement of Exhaled NO in Adults", "Section 3: Recommendations for the Offline Measurement of FE NO", and "Section 5: Recommendations for the Standardized Measurement of Nasal NO".

### Emetic risk classification and evaluation of the emetogenicity of antineoplastic agents-updated MASCC / ESMO consensus recommendation [^7468c1f4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). High credibility.

Discussion — classifying antineoplastic agents according to their emetic potential remains imprecise and challenging, and this process is hindered because the potential of an administered antineoplastic agent to cause emesis has been established rigorously for only a few agents; due to limitations, the third Antiemetic Perugia Consensus Conference decided to change from the original Hesketh classification schema from 1997 with five emetic risk groups.

### Preventing excessive noise exposure in infants, children, and adolescents [^d218b7fd]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

AAP NICU noise recommendations and observed levels — historical thresholds and current findings are summarized as follows: "In 1974, the AAP Committee on Environmental Hazards recommended reducing incubator noise to < 58 dBA and eliminating unnecessary noise in the hospital setting". "In the 1997 AAP policy statement, the recommended safe level of noise exposure in the NICU was decreased to 45 dBA, and NICUs were advised to adopt strategies to reduce noise". The Recommended Standards have been "updated and subsequent editions published, most recently in 2020 (Table 6)". Since the 1997 guidelines, "measured noise levels are above recommended standards", with "average noise levels in traditional, open design NICUs… often above the recommended 45 dBA". Regarding support devices, "Multiple studies have examined the noise levels associated with different modes of respiratory support. All modalities produce noise levels above the recommended standards (Table 7)". For incubators, "Most studies… demonstrate environmental noise attenuation by incubators", but "The degree of attenuation is significantly diminished when the incubator motor is turned on versus when the motor is off and varies by incubator brand", and with CPAP, "one study found no difference in noise measured inside versus outside the incubator".

### Safety of blood supply for infectious diseases in latin American countries, 1994–1997 [^cfe80036]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2001). Low credibility.

The potential risk of acquiring a transfusion-transmitted infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) virus, hepatitis C (HCV) virus, or Trypanosoma cruzi was estimated for seven South American and five Central American countries during the period 1994–1997. The estimates were based on official national reports of the number of donors, blood screening coverage, and prevalence of serologic markers for infectious diseases. Coverage of screening in 1997 was 100% in 12 and 11 countries for HIV and HBV respectively. Complete screening for HCV was reported by only one country in 1994 and by six in 1997. For T. cruzi, the number of countries with 100% screening coverage increased from two in 1994 to four in 1997. In 1994, three countries showed risk of transfusion-transmitted infections for HIV, seven for HBV, eight for HCV, and seven for T. cruzi. The risk of receiving an infected blood unit and acquiring a transfusion-transmitted infection has been reduced with time in 10 of the 12 countries due to improvements in screening coverage. In Uruguay, the risk was theoretically nil from 1994–1997 because at the beginning of the study period they already had 100% blood donor screening for all infectious diseases transmitted by blood. In 1994, Colombia and Venezuela had the highest health risk associated with blood transfusion (spreading index of 101 and 62, respectively); during the period 1996–1997, Costa Rica presented the highest figures (spreading index of 53 and 83, respectively). The analysis of the potential risk associated with transfusion of tainted blood highlights the need for continuous monitoring of the safety of blood supply.

### Mortality with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation: effects of time and NSAID use [^b18c574b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Some people who suffer an upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforation die. The mortality rate was estimated at 12% in studies published before 1997, but a systematic survey of more recent data is needed. Better treatment is likely to have reduced mortality. An estimate of mortality is helpful in explaining to patients the risks of therapy, especially with NSAIDs.

Methods

A systematic review of studies published before 1997, and between 1997 and 2008. Any study architecture was acceptable if it reported on cases who died from any cause of upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforation. Analyses were conducted separately for all cases, and those prescribed NSAID or aspirin.

Results

Information was available for 61,067 cases (81% published since 1997) of whom 5,001 died. The mortality rate in all cases fell significantly, from 11.6% (95% confidence interval, 11.0 to 12.2) in pre-1997 studies to 7.4% (7.2 to 7.6) in those published since 1997. In 5,526 patients taking NSAID or aspirin, mortality increased, from 14.7% (13.6 to 15.8) before 1997 to 20.9% (18.8 to 22.9) since 1997.

Conclusion

Upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforation still carries a finite risk of death. Differences in study architecture, population characteristics, risk factors, definition of mortality, and reporting of outcomes impose limitations on interpreting effect size. Data published since 1997 suggest that mortality in patients suffering from an upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforation has fallen to 1 in 13 overall, but remains higher at about 1 in 5 in those exposed to NSAID or aspirin.

### Extreme oceanographic forcing and coastal response due to the 2015–2016 El Niño [^fde3d846]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The primary difference in wave energy flux between the most powerful El Niño events of the past two decades (that is, 1997–1998 and 2015–2016) appears related to a latitudinal shift in the primary storm tracks and resulting wave generation location. Elevated wave energy flux during the winter of 2015–2016 exceeded the 1997–1998 event by 29% in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, including a 44% increase off the coast of Washington. Conversely, higher mean (+37%) and elevated wave energy (+27%) was measured during 1997–1998 for Central and Southern California compared to the 2015–2016 winter. The distinct northerly wave direction anomaly and the smaller elevated wave energy flux anomaly in Southern California during 2015–2016 relative to 1997–1998 are likely related to storm tracks taking a more southerly route during the 1997–1998 El Niño. In 2015–2016, a coincident decrease in precipitation for Southern California compared with Northern Californiawas the result of a northerly shift in storm tracks relative to 1997–1998. A northerly shift in storm tracks during the El Niño of 1997–1998 compared with 1982–1983 is suggested by precipitation records across Californiaas well as reports of significant flooding and coastal erosion, indicating more pronounced impacts from local storms in Southern California during the 1982–1983 winter relative to 1997–1998. This evidence of a progressive northerly migration of storm tracks during El Niño winters along the US West coast is consistent with the observed multi-decadal trend of poleward Hadley cell expansion and, therefore, the location of the sub-tropical jet stream. Measured multi-decadal increases in wave heights for the Pacific Northwest relative to Californiais evidence of this broader trend, as is the predicted poleward migration of storm tracks and correlative northerly shift in the focus of extreme wave impacts along the west coast of North America noted in global wave modelling projections for the 21st century.

Figure 2
Distribution of elements of direct medical cost (US$) per Lyme disease (LD) patient in Maryland Eastern Shore (1997–2000). Mean is based on direct medical costs of LD patients. Direct medical costs were collected from medical record abstraction (1997–2000). Direct medical costs of LD included costs of physician visits, consultation, serologic tests, procedure, therapy, hospitalization/emergency room, and other relevant costs. All costs were converted to 2000 equivalent.

A patient with clinically defined early-stage LD paid an average of $164 in 1997 and $307 in 1998 (in 2000 dollars) for extra prescription and nonprescription drugs (Table 4). Those with clinically defined late-stage LD paid, for similar items, an average of $579 in 1997 and $389 in 1998. The mean nonmedical cost for clinically defined early-stage LD was $109 in 1997 and $23 in 1998. For patients with clinically defined late-stage LD, mean nonmedical costs were $60 in 1997 and $6,703 in 1998. During the survey period, the mean productivity loss of clinically defined early-stage LD was $411 in 1997 and $88 in 1998, and the mean productivity loss of clinically defined late-stage LD was $7,762 in 1997 and $9,108 in 1998. For all 3 types of costs shown in Table 4, a large difference was seen between mean and median values, with the latter often less than half of the mean value, indicating that a small number of LD patients account for a large portion of total costs.

### The changing roles of radiologists, cardiologists, and vascular surgeons in percutaneous peripheral arterial interventions during a recent five-year interval [^2b6c373b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine the relative roles of radiologists, cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and other physicians in performing percutaneous peripheral arterial interventions and how these roles have changed over a recent 5-year period.

Methods and Materials

The authors reviewed the Medicare Part B fee-for-service databases between 1997 and 2002 for the Current Procedural Terminology (4th ed.) (CPT-4) surgical procedure codes for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of noncardiac peripheral arteries (six codes), the transcatheter placement of noncardiac intravascular stents (two codes), and endovascular aortic stent graft placement (six codes). Using the Medicare physician specialty codes, procedure volume in each CPT-4 code was determined for radiologists, cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and other physicians. Percentage changes from 1997 to 2002 were calculated for PTA and intravascular stent placement procedures.

Results

Between 1997 and 2002, the total Medicare procedure volume in the eight procedure codes relating to PTA and stent placement increased by 95%. In 2002, radiologists performed 72,657 of these procedures, cardiologists 62,901, vascular surgeons 17,895, and other physicians 19,666. Over the 5-year interval, procedure volume among radiologists increased 29%, among cardiologists by 181%, among vascular surgeons by 398%, and among other physicians by 195%. Radiologists' share in the total pool of procedures in 2002 was 42.0% (down from 63.3% in 1997), cardiologists' 36.3% (up from 25.2% in 1997), vascular surgeons' 10.3% (up from 4.0% in 1997), and other physicians' 11.4% (up from 7.5% in 1997). Trend data were not available for endovascular aortic stent graft procedures.

Conclusion

Between 1997 and 2002, procedure volume in percutaneous peripheral arterial interventions grew at faster rates among cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and other physicians than it did among radiologists. As a result, radiologists' share of this market declined during the interval. However, procedure volume among radiologists continued to grow over the 5 years, and in 2002, they still had the largest share among the four physician specialty groups. Thus, despite the erosion, interventional radiologists still maintain a strong position in this rapidly growing field.

### Leisure activity participation and risk of dementia: an 18-year follow-up of the whitehall II study [^9031dc48]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Association between leisure activity participation and incident dementia

We first calculated dementia incidence rates according to tertiles of leisure activity participation (low leisure activity was 0–13, medium was 14–18, and high was 19–33) and then calculated absolute rate differences between groups at each of the different study waves. Then our primary analysis examined the association between total leisure activity participation at 1997–1999, 2002–2004, and 2007–2009 and subsequent incident dementia using Cox regression, after checking for the proportionality of hazards assumption. We found no evidence of interaction by sex (p = 0.72) so did not stratify our analysis by sex. We censored participants at date of dementia diagnosis, death, or March 31, 2017, whichever came first. We repeated the analysis for each of the 13 activities. Results for the total leisure activity participation score are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia according to 1 SD higher activity participation. For each activity, they are presented per 1-point increase on the 4-point Likert scale.

We also examined the association between change in leisure activity participation between 1997–1999 and 2007–2009 and risk of incident dementia after 2007–2009. A positive value in the change score indicated decline in activity participation. In this analysis, HRs represent risk ratios of dementia per 1 SD decline in activity participation. In addition, we derived categories of change in leisure activity participation tertiles from 1997–1999 to 2007–2009: remain low (low at 1997–1999 and 2007–2009), remain medium (medium at 1997–1999 and 2007–2009), remain high (high at 1997–1999 and 2007–2009), increasing (low at 1997–1999 and medium or high at 2007–2009, or medium at 1997–1999 and high at 2007–2009), and decreasing (high at 1997–1999 and medium or low at 2007–2009, or medium at 1997–1999 and low at 2007–2009). We repeated our analyses on the association between change in leisure activity participation and dementia using these categorical groups as exposure variable.

### Deforestation and malaria in M âncio lima county, Brazil [^0bc6beef]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Baseline deforestation in 1997 was concentrated within and near the city of Mâncio Lima, with varying degrees of deforestation found in the health districts along the river ways. The most deforestation change between 1997 and 2006 was located just west and south of the city. Over this period, percentage of deforestation in health districts increased, on average, 6.6%–26%. The SD of this increase is 5.9% (Table). Notably, a large wetland area northeast of the city limited the amount of land clearing taking place in that area (Figures 2, 4).

Table
Influence of ecologic deforestation and social demographic risk factors on malaria incidence in health districts, Mâncio Lima County, Brazil, 1997–2006*

*Summary statistics of variables, relative risks (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the univariate and multivariate negative binomial generalized additive models with integrated smoothness estimation of spatial correlation. The SD is used as the unit of analysis for all risk factors and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values for the univariate models are shown. The AIC for the multivariate model is 655.9.
†Models adjusted for spatial trend
‡Area × access to care.

The univariate analysis adjusts for variability between the health districts, and spatial trend. We show the influence of ecologic deforestation and social demographic risk factors on malaria incidence. Percentage of deforestation during 1997–2000 is the factor most predictive of malaria risk in the health districts on the basis of model AIC. Health districts that deforested 4.3% (± 1 SD) from 1997 to 2000 are associated with 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.58) increase in malaria risk. Historic baseline deforestation in 1997 is not significant, but malaria risk and percentage deforestation from 1997–2002, 1997–2001, and 1997–2000 are significant and positively correlated. More recent percentage deforestation changes from 2001 through 2006 are not associated with malaria risk, along with 1997 and 2000–2006 measures of absolute deforestation and cumulative percent deforestation (Table).

### Evidence-based guideline update: vagus nerve stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^5ef7aaad]. Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regulatory and historical context — vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): The document notes that in 1997 the US Food and Drug Administration approved VNS as adjunctive therapy for reducing seizure frequency in patients > 12 years of age with partial-onset seizures refractory to antiepileptic medications, and that a 1999 American Academy of Neurology technology assessment concluded VNS is indicated for patients > 12 years with medically intractable partial seizures who are not candidates for potentially curative surgical resections; it recommended thorough epilepsy evaluation before implantation and stated evidence was insufficient then to recommend VNS for young children or for Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. It further states that since that assessment the FDA has approved VNS for adjunctive long-term treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in patients > 18 years with a major depressive episode who have not had an adequate response to 4 or more adequate antidepressant treatments.

Figure 6
Network map of co-citation of references.

The first and largest trend started in 1994 with 8 research clusters. These clusters, with specific information such as the label, size, silhouette score, and the average year of publication of the articles included in the cluster were as follows: cluster #10 ("fibromyalgia syndrome"; 42; S = 0.972; 1996), which shared hots topics with cluster #7 ("low back pain"; 64; S = 0.898; 1995), and cluster #17 ("clinical applications"; 12; S = 0.998; 1987). These clusters further evolved into cluster #11 ("controlled trial"; 41; S = 0.933; 1997) and cluster #8 ("visceral pain"; 59; S = 0.826; 2005). The findings of the above clusters promote the research in cluster #5 ("systematic review"; 81; S = 0.799; 2010), which further branches into #6("knee osteoarthritis"; 69; S = 0.847; 2010).

The second major trend of research concerns the mechanisms of acupuncture. It starts with research on EA frequency with cluster #14 ("intensity frequency"; 25; S = 0.966; 1985), which develops research on the rat model with cluster #16 ("ventriculocisternal perfusate"; 13; S = 0.994; 1988), #12 ("electroacupuncture-produced anti-hyperalgesia"; 35; S = 0.881; 1997) and #2 ("zusanli point"; 111; S = 0.774; 1989). More recently, these clusters became cluster#1 ("neuropathic pain"; 134; S = 0.793; 2004) and cluster#3 ("fMRI study"; 106; S = 0.835; 2004), with strong links to #0 ("signaling pathway"; 139; S = 0.869; 2004), which is mainly dedicated to exploring the mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia, not only central mechanisms but also peripheral mechanisms such as local changes at acupoints.

### Malaria risk in travelers [^242ca68f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Results

From 1997 to 2003, a total of 975 persons were reported with malaria in Sweden; 118 of them were newly arrived immigrants or refugees and thus excluded from further analysis (Table 1). Of the remaining 857 persons, 348 were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 178 with P. vivax, 47 with P. ovale, and 15 with P. malariae (Tables 2 and 3). In 269 patients, the report did not contain data on Plasmodium species. Most of these patients were seen in 1997 before the full implementation of a new reporting system that year. Little variation occurred, either in the number of reported cases or the species distribution over the period, except in the last year studied (2003), which had < 65% of the mean of reported cases for the preceding years. This low figure in 2003 was mainly due to a decreased number of reported P. falciparum cases.

A total of 16,255 persons with overnight travel abroad were recorded in the travel database for the period 1997–2003. Of these, 881 (projected to a total of 3.5 million travelers) had traveled to malaria-endemic countries or regions, as defined by WHO and were included as controls (Tables 3 and 4). Of the travel destinations, east Asia (mainly Thailand) was dominant.

### Evaluating the performance of ACR, SLICC and EULAR / ACR classification criteria in childhood onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^55a69a95]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

To date, there has been two other study populations in children comparing the performance of the three classification criteria's (ACR-1997, SLICC-2012 and EULAR/ACR-2019). Batu et al described the performance of the 3 classification criteria in a large cohort of cSLE (n = 262) from Turkey at diagnosis, reporting sensitivity of SLICC-2012 to be highest (95.4%) compared to ACR-1997 (68.7%) and EULAR/ACR-2019 (91.5%) while the specificity for ACR-1997 (94.8%) to be the highest compared to for SLICC-2012 (89.7%) and EULAR/ACR-2019 (88.5%). Fonesca et al described the performance of the 3 classifications in cSLE cohort (n = 122) from Brazil, at diagnosis and at 1 year follow up. Similarly, they reported the highest sensitivity with SLICC 2012 at diagnosis and 1 year follow up (89.3%, 97,5%) compared to ACR 1997 (70.5, 95.1%) and EULAR/ACR 2019 (87.7%, 95.1); while the specificity of ACR 1997 was highest at diagnosis and 1 year follow up (83.2, 76.4%) compared to SLICC 2012 (80.9, 76.4%) and EULAR/ACR 2019 (67.4, 58.4%). In contrast, to the two previous studies from Turkey and Brazil, our study from Middle East in children with Arab ethnicity, showed the highest sensitivity with the EULAR/ACR 2019 at diagnosis, 1 year follow up and last assessment compared to ACR 1997 and SLICC 2012. Similar to the two studies, the highest specificity was observed with ACR 1997, however the degree of specificity was much higher (96%) compared to the Brazilian cohort (83.2, 76.4%) at first visit and first year follow up, but comparable to Turkish cohort (94.8%) at first visit. Comparable to the results of our cohort was unpublished data from South Indian cSLE cohort (n = 107), showing highest performance of sensitivity with the ACR/EULAR 2019 (96.3%) compared to ACR 1997 (73.8%) and SLICC 2012 (94.4%) criteria. The data also demonstrated the highest specificity with ACR 1997 (100%) compared to ACR/EULAR 2019 (98.1%) and SLICC 2012 (96.2%). Perhaps ethnic, race and geographical differences influence SLE disease expression thereby making certain classification more sensitive than others.

### Web-based surveillance and global Salmonella distribution, 2000–2002 [^19c7d215]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Foodborne diseases are among the most serious health problems affecting public health and development worldwide. Industrialization, mass food production, decreasing trade barriers, and human migration have disseminated and increased the incidence and severity of foodborne diseases worldwide.

Salmonellae are among the most common bacterial foodborne pathogens worldwide. They cause an estimated 1.4 million cases of foodborne disease each year in the United States alone. Salmonella serotyping is a surveillance tool that detects widespread outbreaks, identifies outbreak sources, monitors trends over time, and attributes human disease to various foods and animals. Such surveillance is needed to help prevent foodborne disease outbreaks and raise awareness among health authorities, food producers, food regulators, and consumers.

A 1997 survey of national reference laboratories showed that only 69 (66%) of 104 responding countries conducted routine Salmonella serotyping for public health surveillance. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Danish Veterinary Laboratory (now the Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research) founded WHO Global Salm-Surv in 2000. Its mission is to promote integrated, laboratory-based surveillance and foster collaboration among human health, veterinary, and food-related disciplines to enhance the capacity to detect, respond, and prevent foodborne diseases. By November 2005, WHO Global Salm-Surv had > 800 members from 142 countries. A key component of this program is the Web-based country databank, to which member countries annually submit their 15 most frequently isolated Salmonella serotypes. This program is the only foodborne disease surveillance network that is global in scope and surveys all aspects of the food chain, from animal feed to humans. Data are updated annually and are publicly accessible for members and the scientific community to review. We describe the global distribution of Salmonella serotypes from human and nonhuman sources reported to the WHO Global Salm-Surv country databank from 2000 to 2002 and explore how the databank may become a valuable public health resource for foodborne disease surveillance.

### A longitudinal study of changes in noticing and treating patients' overweight by Dutch GPs between 1997 and 2007 [^d992571c]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Background

One of the stakeholders in tackling the rise and health consequences of overweight and obesity is the general practice physician (GP). GPs are in a good position to inform and give nutrition guidance to overweight patients.

Objective

Assessment of working mechanism of determinants of the nutrition guidance practice: noticing patients' overweight and guidance of treatment by GPs [linear analysis of structural relations (LISREL) path model] in a longitudinal study.

Methods

This longitudinal study measured data in 1992, 1997 and 2007. The 1992 LISREL path model (Hiddink GJ, Hautvast J, van Woerkum CMJ, Fieren CJ, van t'Hof MA. Nutrition guidance by primary-care physicians: LISREL analysis improves understanding. Prev Med 1997; 26: 29–36.) demonstrated that 'noticing patients' overweight and guidance of treatment' was directly and indirectly influenced by predisposing factors, driving forces and perceived barriers. This article defines and discusses the path analysis of the 2007 data (compared with 1997).

Results

This analysis shows both similarity and differences in working mechanism of determinants of noticing patients' overweight and guidance of treatment between 1997 and 2007. The backbone of the mechanism with four predisposing factors is the similarity. The number of driving forces and of paths through intermediary factors to the dependent variable constitutes the difference.

Conclusions

The backbone of the working mechanism of determinants of the nutrition guidance practice: noticing patients' overweight and guidance of treatment by GPs was similar in 2007 and 1997. The influence of GPs task perception on noticing patients' overweight and guidance of treatment considerably increased in 2007 compared to 1997. The longitudinal character of this article gives a strong practice-based evidence for weight management by GPs.

Table 1
Number and rate of discharges with chronic pancreatitis (CP) by patient and hospital characteristics in 1997 and 2014*

The rate of CP was higher in males in both 1997 and 2014, decreasing from 8.03/10,000 discharges in 1997 to 4.30/10,000 discharges in 2014 (RR 0.5354, 95%CI 0.5350–0.5353; P < 0.001). A decrease was also found in females, from 5.54/10,000 discharges in 1997 to 3.09/10,000 discharges in 2014 (Table 1, RR 0.5581, 95% CI 0.5579–0.5583; P < 0.001).

The rate of discharges for CP was higher for uninsured patients compared with all the other categories of insurance in both 1997 and 2014 (P < 0.0001), with a significant decrease from 1997–2014 (RR 0.5295, 95%CI 0.5295–0.5303; P < 0.0001). The rate of CP significantly decreased from 1997–2014 in all the other insurance categories (Table 1: Medicare RR 0.5503, 95%CI 0.5501–0.5506; Medicaid RR 0.5225, 95%CI 0.5223–0.5227; Private RR 0.5732, 95%CI 0.5729–0.5734; other insurances RR 0.3902, 95%CI 0.3902–0.3911; all P < 0.0001), and for patients without low income (RR 0.5487, 95%CI 0.5485–0.5488; P < 0.0001).

### Sports specialization and intensive training in young athletes [^81ca8fcc]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Youth sports participation — epidemiology and background: According to a national report, 60 million youth aged 6 through 18 years participated in organized sports, an increase from 45 million in 1997. The sex ratio has remained constant, with 66% of young athletes being male and 34% being female. Of the 60 million young athletes reported, 27% participated in only 1 sport. Participation by children aged ≤ 6 years increased from 6% in 1997 to 12% in 2008. Unfortunately, 70% of children drop out of organized sports by 13 years of age. According to the 2013–2014 high school athletics participation survey, 7.8 million high school students participated in sports.

### American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America: controlling tuberculosis in the United States [^ed397ae5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

TB case detection — points of entry and training priorities: In 18 California counties during 1996–1997, initial diagnostic entry points were "hospital inpatient evaluations (45%), private outpatient offices or clinic evaluations (32%), TB clinic evaluations (12%), and other sites (11%)", while in Seattle and its suburban areas in 1997, "primary care practitioners or clinics reported 48% of TB cases during evaluations of outpatients with symptoms and 32% during hospitalizations", and "only 26 cases were diagnosed during a public health TB clinic evaluation for a symptomatic illness". Given these patterns, "the professionals in the primary health care sector, including hospital and ED clinicians, should be trained to recognize patients with symptoms consistent with TB".

### Classification of systemic lupus erythematosus: systemic lupus international collaborating clinics versus American College of Rheumatology criteria. A comparative study of 2, 055 patients from a real-life, international systemic lupus erythematosus cohort [^851d0fa6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The new Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 classification criteria aimed to improve the performance of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification over the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997 criteria. However, the SLICC 2012 criteria need further external validation. Our objective was to compare the sensitivity for SLE classification between the ACR 1997 and the SLICC 2012 criteria sets in a real-life, multicenter, international SLE population.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE followed at the participating rheumatology centers and registered in the Portuguese and Spanish national registries. The sensitivity of the 2 classification sets was compared using McNemar's test. The sensitivity of ACR 1997 and SLICC 2012 was further examined in 5 subgroups, defined according to disease duration.

Results

We included 2,055 SLE patients (female 91.4%, white 93.5%, mean ± SD age at disease onset 33.1 ± 14.4 years, mean ± SD age at SLE diagnosis 35.3 ± 14.7 years, and mean ± SD age at the time of the study 47.4 ± 14.6 years) from 17 centers. The sensitivity for SLE classification was higher with the SLICC 2012 than with the ACR 1997 (93.2% versus 85.6%; P < 0.0001). Of 296 patients not fulfilling the ACR 1997, 62.8% could be classified with the SLICC 2012. The subgroup of patients with ≤ 5 years since disease onset presented the largest difference in sensitivity between the SLICC 2012 and the ACR 1997 (89.3% versus 76.0%; P < 0.0001); this difference diminished with longer disease duration, and it was no longer significant for patients with > 20 years of disease duration.

Conclusion

The SLICC 2012 criteria were more sensitive than the ACR 1997 criteria in real-life clinical practice in SLE. The SLICC 2012 criteria may allow patients to be classified as having SLE earlier in the disease course.

### Molecular epidemiology of human respiratory syncytial virus subgroup A over a six-year period (1999–2004) in Argentina [^12e0e40c]. Journal of Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the main viral cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children. Little information about the molecular epidemiology of HRSV in developing countries, such as Argentina, is available. By RT-PCR, we subgrouped 353 HRSV isolates over six consecutive epidemic seasons (1999–2004) and few isolates from 1997. Between them, 232 (65.7%) belonged to subgroup A and 121 (34.3%) to subgroup B. Therefore, the nucleotide, amino-acid variability and phylogenetic relations of 78 HRSV subgroup A isolates, were analyzed using RFLP and sequence analysis of the G-protein gene. The results showed that there were two main restriction patterns (PA1 and PA2) and two previously described genotypes (GA2 and GA5) cocirculating in Buenos Aires, without evidence of alternation between them during the studied period. The Argentine sequences were compared with previously reported molecular data from other countries. It showed that viruses genetically related circulated the same years within neighboring countries and the sequences from long-distant places were closely related to Argentine sequences, but they belonged to different sampling years. The data reported here support the growing database on the molecular diversity of HRSVA circulating in Latin America in children under 2 years of age and contributes to describe the pattern of global spread of this virus.

### Population group differences in trends in stroke mortality in Israel [^4553fc4b]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In Israel, stroke is the third most common cause of death. In 1997 stroke accounted for 2905 deaths (8.1% of total), 1390 of them among men (7.5% of total; crude mortality rate of 48.3/100 000) and 1515 among women (8.6% of total; crude rate of 51.7/100 000). This report presents trends on stroke mortality by population group and estimates of morbidity in Israel.

Methods

Data on stroke mortality in Israel during 1969–1997 were obtained from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics. Age-specific and age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for the 2 main population groups. Data on morbidity were obtained form the 1996/1997 National Health Survey. Hospitalization rates due to stroke are based on the national hospitalization data.

Results

A monotonic decrease in stroke mortality is evident in Jews during 1969–1997 in both sexes. Age-adjusted mortality rates declined by 62.5% for Jewish men and by 73.4% for Jewish women during 1969–1997. Among Arabs, there was a general decreasing trend in the mortality for both sexes during 1973–1997. The main difference in population group mortality trends was found in the group aged ≥ 75 years: a statistically significant decrease in mortality rates for Jews is evident, while no decrease is apparent for Arabs. On the basis of available data for 1990, an estimated 13 000 patients with stroke were hospitalized during 1997.

Conclusions

During the last 25 years, age-adjusted stroke mortality in Israel has declined substantially, but the decline has been much greater among Jews than Arabs. The group aged ≥ 75 years shows the greatest difference in trends between Jews and Arabs. This finding may be explained by differences in risk factor distribution and case fatality rates.

### Reevaluation of the 1997 TNM classification for renal cell carcinoma: T1 and T2 cutoff point at 4.5 rather than 7 CM. better correlates with clinical outcome [^d49adb09]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We analyzed the effects of the change in TNM classification from the 1987 to the 1997 version and suggest a modified tumor size cutoff point between T stages 1 and 2 for renal cell carcinoma.

Materials and Methods

We evaluated a database containing the records of 661 patients who underwent nephrectomy between 1989 and 1999. The effect of the change in TNM classification on the distribution of patients between stages, the rates of M+ and N+ disease, and the local and distant recurrence rates were outlined for 280 patients with T stages 1 and 2 disease. The Cox model was used to identify the optimal cutoff point between T1 and T2 disease, and the resulting effect of adopting this cutoff was outlined.

Results

A total of 174 and 128 cases were down staged from 1987 version stage T2 to 1997 version stage T1 and from 1987 TNM stage II to 1997 TNM stage I, respectively. Survival was not significantly different in patients with 1997 TNM stages I and II disease due to a lack of survival difference during the first 2 years of followup. Stage shift also caused an increase in average tumor size, the proportion of patients with high grade cancer, and M+ and N+ disease at diagnosis in 1997 stages T1 and T2 as well as an increase in the proportion of 1997 stage T2N0M0 cases at diagnosis with systemic failure. Analysis of 11 potential cutoff points between 1 and 10 cm. revealed that 4.5 cm. was most predictive of patients survival (hazards ratio 4.99, p = 0.0001). Using this cutoff resulted in improved discriminatory power of the TNM classification and a moderating effect on the distribution of patients, average tumor size, high grade disease, M+ and N+ disease at diagnosis, and systemic failure between T(14.5) and T(24.5) compared with 1997 T1 and T2.

Conclusions

Our data imply that the current cutoff point of 7 cm. between stages T1 and T2 tumors is too high. Lowering the cutoff to 4.5 cm. resulted in better discriminatory power of the TNM classification in our dataset. This observation should be further validated by external data.

Multidisciplinary lung cancer care and high-volume centers — The European Respiratory Society/European Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines recommend that the management of patients with lung cancer be performed by multidisciplinary teams, and the American College of Chest Physicians has proposed similar recommendations for potentially resectable disease. Data show that multidisciplinary teams provide improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines, better treatment decisions, and better clinical outcomes with longer survival, including in lung cancer. In a single-center study in Scotland, median survival of patients with inoperable non–small cell lung cancer was 3.2 months in 1997 and 6.6 months in 2001 before and after the introduction of a multidisciplinary team (P < 0.001), and in 2001, 23% of patients received chemotherapy treatment compared with 7% in 1997 (P < 0.001).

### National trends in ambulatory asthma treatment, 1997–2009 [^0d7edf5b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite reductions in morbidity and mortality and changes in guidelines, little is known regarding changes in asthma treatment patterns.

Objective

To examine national trends in the office-based treatment of asthma between 1997 and 2009.

Participants and Design

We used the National Ambulatory Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index™ (NDTI), nationally representative audits of office-based physicians, to examine patients diagnosed with asthma less than 50 years of age.

Measurements

Visits where asthma was diagnosed and use of six therapeutic classes (short-acting β₂ agonists [SABA], long-acting β₂ -agonists [LABA], inhaled steroids, antileukotrienes, anticholinergics, and xanthines).

Results

Estimates from NAMCS indicated modest increases in the number of annual asthma visits from 9.9 million [M] in 1997 to 10.3M during 2008; estimates from the NDTI suggested more gradual continuous increases from 8.7M in 1997 to 12.6M during 2009. NAMCS estimates indicated declines in use of SABAs (from 80% of treatment visits in 1997 to 71% in 2008), increased inhaled steroid use (24% in 1997 to 33% in 2008), increased use of fixed dose LABA/steroid combinations (0% in 1997 to 19% in 2008), and increased leukotriene use (9% in 1997 to 24% in 2008). The ratio of controller to total asthma medication use increased from 0.5 (1997) to a peak of 0.7 (2004). In 2008, anticholinergics, xanthines, and LABA use without concomitant steroids accounted for fewer than 4% of all treatment visits. Estimates from NDTI corroborated these trends.

Conclusions

Changes in office-based treatment, including increased inhaled steroid use and increased combined steroid/long-acting β₂-agonist use coincide with reductions in asthma morbidity and mortality that have been demonstrated over the same period. Xanthines, anticholinergics, and increasingly, LABA without concomitant steroid use, account for a very small fraction of all asthma treatments.

### Implementation strategies for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews [^92c71ea9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Health systems in low‐income countries differ from those in high‐income countries in terms of the availability of resources and access to services. Thus, some problems in high‐income countries are not relevant to low‐income countries, such as how best to implement the delivery of expensive technologies that are not available in low‐income countries. Similarly, some problems in low‐income countries are not relevant to high‐income countries, such as how to implement the delivery of services that are already widely available or not needed in high‐income countries. Our focus in this overview was specifically on implementation strategies in low‐income countries. By low‐income countries we mean countries that the World Bank classifies as low or lower‐middle‐income (World Bank 2016). Because upper‐middle‐income countries often have a mixture of health systems with problems similar to both those in low‐income countries and high‐income countries, our focus is relevant to middle‐income countries but excludes consideration of conditions that are not relevant in low‐income countries and are relevant in middle‐income countries.

Description of the interventions

Health system administrators can use a wide range of implementation strategies to improve health systems. Different authors have used a number of approaches to classify these (Abraham 2008; Bero 1998; Dolan 2010; Grimshaw 2001; Grol 1997; Grol 2003; Michie 2011). For this overview we have used a pragmatic approach based on the level of the healthcare system targeted by the intervention: healthcare organisations, healthcare workers, and healthcare recipients (Table 1; EPOC 2017). This approach allows an intuitive matching of the barriers identified for the implementation of specific courses of action and the strategies proposed to address them, as illustrated in Table 2. We also have included reviews of alternative interventions targeted at specific types of problems that are common in low‐income countries, including problems with different types of healthcare worker practice and with the utilisation of health services by healthcare recipients (Table 1; EPOC 2017).

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^bc800058]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Emerging infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance — events over the last 60 years include that "as early as the 1950s" penicillin began losing its ability to cure Staphylococcus aureus infections, a "1970s" resurgence of sexually transmitted diseases and identification of Legionnaires' disease, toxic shock syndrome, and Ebola, antibiotic-resistant bacteria becoming more common in hospitals and spreading into communities, and that "in 1981" AIDS was first reported by CDC; ongoing threats cited include that flu season remains a yearly threat with the possibility that a new pandemic strain might emerge, the "1997" avian influenza H5N1 scare in Hong Kong, and the emergence of H1N1 in "2009". Increased international travel — international travel and trade play a role in the rapid spread of disease and resistance; a microbe originating in Africa or Southeast Asia can arrive on North American shores "within 24 hours"; in the U.S., reports show the majority of multidrug-resistant typhoid cases originated in "six developing countries", and "as of January 2012, 26 cities worldwide had populations above 10 million".

### Post-exposure prophylaxis after non-occupational HIV exposure: impact of recommendations on physicians' experiences and attitudes [^c0299bd0]. AIDS (2002). Low credibility.

Objective(S)

To evaluate the impact of official recommendations for non-occupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), issued in France in 1998, on physicians' prescriptions and attitudes and the occurrence of severe PEP side-effects.

Design

Two surveys were carried out among hospital physicians involved in HIV care, before (1997) and after (1999) the publication of recommendations.

Methods

Questionnaires explored, for the last 12 months, description of PEP requests and prescriptions, detailed description of the latest treated exposure, prescription attitudes towards five exposure scenarios and types of severe side-effects of antiretroviral drugs (in 1999 only).

Results

Nationally, from 1997 to 1999, PEP requests and prescriptions increased sevenfold and ninefold, respectively. Most requests followed sexual exposure (71% in 1997 and 86% in 1999; P = 10⁻⁶). The proportion of prescriptions for exposure to a known HIV-infected person decreased from 78% in 1997 to 41% in 1999 (P = 10⁻⁶). Three-drug combination therapies increased from 46% in 1997 to 83% in 1999 (P = 10⁻⁶). In 1999, 13 (0.9%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–1.5%) severe reversible adverse events occurred among patients on a three-drug regimen. Prescription attitudes based mainly on risk assessment in 1997 (64% versus 33% in 1999) were based mainly on the request of the patient in 1999 (41% versus 11% in 1997).

Conclusion

Recommendations were followed by an increase of PEP, particularly after less risky exposures, and a substantial risk of severe side-effects. PEP should be restricted to well-documented exposures for which the risk of transmission outweighs the risk of severe side-effects. Drug regimens should be revised.

### Changing mortality patterns in east and west Germany and poland. II: short-term trends during transition and in the 1990s [^581dccc4]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine trends in life expectancy at birth and age and cause specific patterns of mortality in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) and Poland during political transition and throughout the 1990s in both parts of Germany and in Poland.

Methods

Decomposition of life expectancy by age and cause of death. Changes in life expectancy during transition by cause of death were examined using data for 1988/89 and 1990/91 for the former GDR and Poland; examination of life expectancy changes after transition were based on 1992–97 data for Germany and 1991–96 data for Poland.

Results

In both the former GDR and Poland male life expectancy at birth declined by almost one year during transition, mainly attributable to rising death rates from external causes and circulatory diseases. Female life expectancy in Poland deteriorated by 0.3 years, largely attributable to increasing circulatory mortality among the old, while in East German female rising death rates in children and young adults were nearly outbalanced by declining circulatory mortality among those over 70. Between 1991/92 and 1996/97, male life expectancy at birth increased by 2.4 years in the former GDR, 1.2 years in old Federal Republic, and 2.0 years in Poland (women: 2.3, 0.9, and 1.2 years). In East Germany and Poland, the overall improvement was largely attributable to falling mortality among men aged 40–64, while those over 65 contributed the largest proportion to life expectancy gains in women. The change in deaths among men aged 15–39 accounted for 0.4 of a year to life expectancy at birth in East Germany and Poland, attributable largely to greater decreases from external causes. Among those over 40, absolute contributions to changing life expectancy were greater in the former GDR than in the other two entities in both sexes, largely attributable to circulatory diseases. A persisting East-west life expectancy gap in Germany of 2.1 years in men in 1997 was largely attributable to external causes, diseases of the digestive system and circulatory diseases. Higher death rates from circulatory diseases among the elderly largely explain the female life expectancy gap of approximately one year.

Conclusions

This study provides further insights into the health effects of political transition. Post-transition improvements in life expectancy and mortality have been much steeper in East Germany compared with Poland. Changes in dietary pattern and, in Germany, medical care may have been important factors in shaping post-transition mortality trends.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Temporal trends in the incidence of malignancy in heart failure: a nationwide Danish study [^46212e33]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Cancer and heart failure (HF) share risk factors, pathophysiological mechanisms, and possibly genetics. Improved HF survival may increase the risk of cancer due to a competing risk. Whether the incidence of cancer has increased over time in patients with HF as survival has improved is unclear. Therefore, temporal trends of new onset cancer in HF patients between 1997 and 2016 were investigated.

Methods and Results

Using Danish nationwide registers, 103 711 individuals alive, free of cancer, and aged 30–80 years 1 year after HF diagnosis (index date) were included between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2016. A five-year incidence rate of cancer for each year after index date was calculated. The median age and proportion of women at the index date decreased with advancing calendar time [1997–2001: 70.3 interquartile range (Q1-Q3 62.5–75.7), 60.9% men; 2012–16: 67.6 (59.2–73.8), 67.5% men]. The five-year incidence rate of cancer was 20.9 and 20.2 per 1,000 person-years in 1997 and 2016, respectively. In a multivariable Cox regression model, the hazard rates between index years 1997 (reference) and 2016 were not significantly different [hazard ratio 1.09 (0.97–1.23)]. The five-year absolute risk of cancer did not change with advancing calendar year, going from 9.0% (1997–2001) to 9.0% (2012–16). Five-year cumulative incidence of survival for HF patients increased with advancing calendar year, going from 55.9% (1997–2001) to 74.3% (2012–2016).

Conclusion

Although cancer rates during 1997–2016 have remained stable within 1–6 years after the HF diagnosis, long-term survival following a HF diagnosis has increased significantly.

Atopic dermatitis and food allergy — population prevalence in the United States and Australia is quantified: AD prevalence increased from 7.4% in 1997–1999 to 12.5% in 2009–2011, and food allergy prevalence increased from 3.4% in 1997–1999 to 5.1% in 2009–2011. In a survey of 38,408 US households, the prevalence of FA in children was 7.6%; within that cohort, physician-diagnosed AD in children with convincing FA was 16.2% in all ages and 22.7% in those aged 0 to 2 years. Using oral food challenges in the Australian HealthNuts cohort, FA prevalence was 11% at 1 year and 3.8% at 4 years; 20% of children with eczema were allergic to peanut, egg white, or sesame seed versus 4% without eczema, and one year olds with eczema were 6 times more likely to have an egg allergy and 11 times more likely to have a peanut allergy than those without eczema.

### Changes in the treatment of pediatric femoral fractures: 15-year trends from United States kids' inpatient database (KID) 1997 to 2012 [^b3026e81]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The options for treating femoral fractures in children and adolescents have evolved over the last 2 decades to include a variety of nonoperative and operative methods. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in the types of treatment for pediatric femoral fractures in the United States from 1997 to 2012.

Methods

From discharge estimates for 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012 in the Kids' Inpatient Database, data were extracted using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, and Clinical Modification for pediatric femoral fracture treatments. Patients included were 0 to 17 years old and were categorized into 5 age groups: younger than 1, 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 17 years.

Results

A total of 74,483 estimated discharges were recorded for pediatric patients with femoral fractures in the database for years 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012. A total of 12,986 pediatric femoral fractures were estimated for 1997 and 9813 for 2012, which was statistically different (P < 0.0001). Significantly fewer fractures were treated with closed reduction alone in 2012 than in 1997 in age groups 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 17 years. Children aged 5 to 9 had more frequent open reduction and internal fixation in 2012 than in 1997, whereas adolescents aged 15 to 17 had less frequent open reduction and internal fixation in 2012 than in 1997.

Conclusions

Although the number of femoral shaft fractures overall has decreased, the frequency of operative treatment has increased significantly in patients 5 to 9 years of age. Knowledge of these trends can guide educational efforts and resource allocation, but further study is necessary to determine procedure-specific (eg, nailing, plating, external fixation) trends and their clinical and economic impacts.

This study examines how the dissemination of stenting and procedural shifts to high-volume facilities have affected short-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

Discharge information from the 1994 and 1997 US Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used. Data from 1994 involved 84,036 angioplasties, 27.3% of which were performed for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), at a time when stents were generally unavailable. Data from 1997 included 118,548 angioplasties, 30.2% of which were performed for AMI and 59% of which involved stenting. Outcomes included same-admission mortality and same-admission bypass grafting surgery (CABG).

Results

Compared with 1994, in 1997 stents were in widespread use, and there was a significant shift in PCI procedures to high-volume facilities. There was no significant difference in overall mortality rates between 1994 and 1997. However, same-admission CABG rates were lower in 1997 than in 1994 for the AMI group (2.9% vs 4.7%, P < .0001) and for the no-AMI group (1.8% vs 3.0%, P < .0001), which was attributable almost entirely to stenting. For 1997 only, patients receiving stents had a lower mortality rate than patients undergoing PCI without stenting (AMI 2.7% vs 4.7%, P < .0001, no AMI 0.7% vs 0.9%, P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Despite the dissemination of stenting and shifts to high-volume facilities, overall mortality rates after PCI have not significantly changed. However, patients undergoing stenting in 1997 had a significantly lower mortality rate than patients who did not undergo stenting, suggesting that stents may prevent inhospital deaths. Furthermore, same-admission CABG rates have decreased dramatically, an association seen with the introduction of stenting, but not with volume shifts.

### Low birth weight in S ã o Luís, northeastern Brazil: trends and associated factors [^53ebf6ba]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data was abstracted from two birth cohorts performed in the municipality of São Luís, the capital of Maranhão state, located in Northeastern Brazil, with a population of 1,014,837 inhabitants in 2010. São Luís has a human development index (HDI) of 0.768, the first in the state of Maranhão and the 249th in Brazil.

The first cohort included 2,831 hospital births from March 1997 to February 1998 and its methods have been published previously. The second included 5,236 hospital births from the São Luís BRISA birth cohort project named "Etiologic factors of preterm birth and consequences of perinatal factors on children's health: birth cohorts in two Brazilian cities", which studied samples of births in the Brazilian cities of São Luís and Ribeirão Preto.

Data from the two birth cohorts are population based. Hospital births comprised 96.3% of all births in 1997/98 and 98% in 2010. Maternity hospitals where less than 100 deliveries were performed were excluded from the study. This represented only 2.2% of the deliveries in 1997/98 and 3.3% in 2010. Thus, the sampling frame consisted of 94.1% of all births in 1997/98 and 94.7% in 2010.

The sample was stratified by maternity hospital with sharing proportional to the number of births at each facility. In each maternity hospital sampling was systematic and all live births and stillbirths were listed in order of occurrence. The sampling interval was seven in 1997/98 and three in 2010. A random number from 1 to 7 in 1997/98, and from 1 to 3 in 2010 was drawn to determine the starting point for each study unit. Thus one out of seven births in 1997/98 and one out of three births in 2010 were randomly selected for interview. Losses due to refusal or early discharge from hospital occurred in 5.8% of cases in 1997/98 and in 4.6% in 2010.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^b555f94d]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Opportunistic infections in children with HIV — U.S. trends and pneumonia risk are highlighted as follows: Among children born during 1997 to 2016, the number of infants experiencing their first opportunistic infections decreased from 432 during 1997 to 2001 to 24 during 2012 to 2016, with the biggest decrease in P. jirovecii pneumonia; despite fewer hospitalizations, the rates and adjusted odds of bacterial outcomes remained higher among hospitalized children with HIV compared with children without HIV from 2003 to 2012; and children with HIV who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy and present with pneumonia are more likely to be bacteremic and to die than children without HIV with pneumonia.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Variation in predictors of primary care career choice by year and stage of training [^003d8b09]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Context

It is not known whether factors associated with primary care career choice affect trainees differently at different times or stages of medical education.

Objective

To examine how role models, encouragement, and personal characteristics affect career choice at different stages (medical school vs residency) and periods (1994 vs 1997) of training.

Design

A split-panel design with 2 cross-sectional telephone surveys and a panel survey in 1994 and 1997.

Participants

A national probability sample of fourth-year students (307 in 1994, 219 in 1997), 645 second-year residents in 1994, and 494 third-year residents in 1997. Of the fourth-year students interviewed in 1994, 241 (78.5%) were re-interviewed as third-year residents in 1997.

Main Outcome Measure

Primary care (general internal medicine, general pediatrics, or family medicine) career choice.

Results

Having a primary care role model was a stronger predictor of primary care career choice for residents (odds ratio [OR], 18.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 11.2 to 28.8 in 1994; OR, 43.7; 95% CI, 24.4 to 78.3 in 1997) than for students (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 4.3 to 10.2; no variation by year). Likewise, peer encouragement was more predictive for residents (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3 to 8.9 in 1994; OR, 16.6; 95% CI; 9.7 to 28.4 in 1997) than for students (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.2; no variation by year). Orientation to the emotional aspects of care was consistently associated with primary care career choice across stages and years of training.

Conclusions

The effect of peer encouragement and role models on career choice differed for students and residents and, in the case of residents, by year of training, suggesting that interventions to increase the primary care workforce should be tailored to stage of training.

### Cancer risk following surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids-a population-based, sibling-controlled cohort study in Sweden [^cafa635e]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We performed a cohort study including all individuals born during 1932–2016 in Sweden, whose parents were also born in Sweden, according to the Swedish Total Population Register. We followed these individuals from January 1st, 1980, or date of birth, whichever came later, to a first diagnosis of cancer, emigration out of Sweden, death, or December 31st, 2016, whichever came first, through cross-linkages to the Swedish Cancer Register, Total Population Register, and Causes of Death Register, using the individually unique personal identification numbers in Sweden. If an individual had a cancer diagnosis, emigrated out of Sweden, or died before cohort entry, we excluded them from the cohort. The final cohort included 4,953,583 individuals. We identified all newly diagnosed cancers during the follow-up of the cohort from the Swedish Cancer Register, which has since 1958 collected information on all incident malignancies in Sweden. We studied first the risk of any cancer and then by specific sites and types of cancer. Additional File 1: Table S1 shows the diagnostic codes used to define different cancer types.

We identified tonsillectomy, adenotonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy from the Swedish Patient Register, which has since 1964 recorded information on hospital-based inpatient care in Sweden. The Register records admission and discharge dates, primary and secondary diagnoses, as well as surgical procedures. Although the Register has nationwide coverage for inpatient care since 1987, it covered more than 80% of all inpatient care in the country since 1980. From 2001 onward, the Register has also included more than 80% of hospital-based outpatient care records in Sweden. We used surgical codes 2710 before 1997 and EMB10 since 1997 for tonsillectomy, 2720 before 1997 and EMB20 since 1997 for adenotonsillectomy, and 2720 and 2730 before 1997 and EMB30 since 1997 for adenoidectomy. We also used EMB99 since 1997 to define other resection or excision of tonsils or adenoids, but there was no corresponding code before 1997. As these procedures have been exclusively performed during inpatient care until 2006 in Sweden, we identified the surgical codes from both inpatient and outpatient care.

### Association of SV40 with human tumors [^ff65dd91]. Oncogene (2002). Low credibility.

In 1994, PCR and protein studies suggested that SV40 DNA sequences and proteins were present in 29/48 (60%) USA human mesothelioma samples. Sequence analysis confirmed that the sequences were homologous to SV40. One year later, SV40 was also found in 5/9 human mesotheliomas, and in 1996 SV40 was also reported to be present in 1/3 of the tumor specimens examined. These reports, in combination with an earlier study in 1992 which had detected SV40 in human brain tumors, raised concerns that SV40 was associated with certain types of human tumors, specifically mesothelioma, bone, and brain tumors. These findings raised concerns, because these tumor types are the same malignancies that had been observed in animals injected with SV40. However, a study in 1996 and a presentation made at the International Mesothelioma Interest Group, IMIG in 1997 failed to detect SV40 in mesotheliomas, suggesting the possibility that laboratory artifacts, such as PCR contamination, had caused the previous positive findings. In 1997, the FDA, the NIH, and the CDC organized an international conference in Bethesda to review the literature and to address the possibility that SV40 was present in, and was possibly the cause of, some human tumors. The results of that conference were reported the same year in a meeting review in Oncogene by Carbone and colleagues. Briefly, the consensus was that before accepting the possibility that SV40 was present in human tumors, a multi-laboratory study needed to be conducted. It was recommended that a blinded multi-laboratory study be directed by an independent scientist not previously associated with the controversial reports of SV40 in human specimens. It was also recommended that this study include laboratories that had reported positive findings as well as laboratories that had failed to detect SV40 in human specimens. Since 1997, about 30 independent reports have been published on this topic, including the multi-laboratory study. Evidence in favor and against a possible association of SV40 with human cancer was reviewed at an international consensus meeting at the University of Chicago on 20, 21 April 2001, entitled "Malignant Mesothelioma: Therapeutic Options and the Role of SV40, 2001". The main focus was the association of SV40 with mesothelioma and other human tumors. At the end of the meeting, a panel discussion, which included independent experts who had not published on this topic, critically reviewed the evidence presented at the meeting. The results of the meeting and of the final panel discussion are outlined below.

### Opposite associations of household income with adolescent body mass index according to migrant status: hong kong's "Children of 1997" birth cohort [^03168672]. International Journal of Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

In economically developed settings, household income is usually inversely associated with child and adolescent adiposity, but this association may not extend to migrants. Hong Kong is a unique developed setting to study how household income and adolescent adiposity vary by migrant status given many Hong Kong-born Chinese children were born to parents who migrated from neighboring provinces of Mainland China.

Subjects/Methods

We examined differences between the associations of absolute household income vs. relative household income on adolescent body mass index (BMI) z-score or overweight (including obesity) status using a linear or logistic model in a Chinese birth cohort (n = 5613, 68% follow-up). We focused on whether the associations differed by mother's or father's migrant status (birthplace).

Results

No association was found between absolute household income and BMI z-score among adolescents with either native or migrant mothers. However, the association of relative household income with BMI z-score varied by mother's migrant status (P-values for interaction < 0.0005). In adolescents of native born mothers, greater relative household income deprivation was associated with higher BMI z-score (0.03 z-score per USD 128 difference in Yitzhaki index, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.05). However, in adolescents of migrant mothers, greater relative household income deprivation was associated with lower BMI z-score (-0.05, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.01). Similar association of relative household income with overweight (including obesity) status was found in adolescents of native born mothers but not in adolescents of migrant mothers.

Conclusions

Relative income (mediated by social comparisons with others in society) appears to be relevant to adolescent adiposity, but the association depends on the interplay between individual characteristics (migrant background) and societal context.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^7795642e]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer mortality trends and regional screening comparisons — United States, United Kingdom, Connecticut/Seattle, and Tyrol — are summarized as follows: Age-adjusted prostate cancer mortality rates rose at an annual rate of 0.9% from 1975 through 1987 and 3% from 1987–1991, then began to fall in 1991 at about 0.6% per year; from 1994 through 2005 they fell 4.1% per year, dropping below the 1985 (pre-PSA) rate in 1997, and by 2006 had fallen to levels last observed in the 1940s. In Connecticut versus Seattle, initial trends were "not consistent with a screening benefit", despite earlier PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening in Seattle; mortality rates were "virtually identical in the first few years after the emergence of screening", with later trends showing similar age-adjusted mortality patterns and screening-rate differences that "had converged by 1997", and overall trends "are not inconsistent with a possible beneficial effect of screening". U.S.–U.K. comparisons "have not always reached the same conclusions", with one analysis finding differences "too small to conclude that PSA screening was contributing to a reduction in deaths", while another reported "a striking decline… between 1994 and 2004", yet attribution to screening alone is difficult due to differing screening and treatment patterns. In Tyrol (Austria), an aggressive campaign began in 1993 with free PSA testing without digital rectal examination (DRE) for men ages 40 years to 79 years, and nearly all potentially curable men underwent modified radical prostatectomy.

### In-hospital mortality for children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome after stage I surgical palliation: teaching versus nonteaching hospitals [^66c6fc05]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Teaching hospitals are perceived to provide a higher quality of care for the treatment of rare disease and complex patients. A substantial proportion of stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) may be performed in nonteaching hospitals. This study compares the in-hospital mortality of stage I palliation between teaching and nonteaching hospitals.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Kids' Inpatient Database 1997 and 2000. Patients with HLHS undergoing stage I palliation were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic and procedural codes.

Results

Seven hundred fifty-four and 880 discharges of children with HLHS undergoing stage I palliation in 1997 and 2000, respectively, were identified. The in-hospital mortality for the study population was 28% in 1997 and 24% in 2000. Twenty percent of stage I palliation operations were performed in nonteaching hospitals in 1997. Two percent of operations were performed in nonteaching hospitals in 2000. In 1997 only, in-hospital mortality remained higher in nonteaching hospitals after controlling for stage I palliation hospital volume and condition-severity diagnoses. Low-volume hospitals performing stage I palliation were associated with increased in-hospital mortality in 1997 and 2000.

Conclusions

Patients with HLHS undergoing stage I palliation in nonteaching hospitals experienced increased in-hospital mortality in 1997. A significant reduction in the number of stage I palliation procedures performed in nonteaching hospitals occurred between 1997 and 2000. This centralization of stage I palliation into teaching hospitals, along with advances in postoperative medical and surgical care for these children, was associated with a decrease in mortality. Patients in low-volume hospitals performing stage I palliation continued to experience increased mortality in 2000.

### Opportunistic illnesses in children with HIV infection in the United States, 1997–2016 [^725cbd9c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Among children with HIV infection, opportunistic illness (OI) rates decreased after introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1997. We evaluated whether such decreases have continued.

Methods

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National HIV Surveillance System for children with HIV living in the US during 1997–2016 was used to enumerate infants experiencing the first OI by birth year and OIs among all children < 13 years of age (stratified by natality). We calculated the time to first OI among infants using Kaplan-Meier methods.

Results

Among infants born during 1997–2016, 711 first OIs were diagnosed. The percentage of the first OIs diagnosed in successive 5-year birth periods was: 60.0% (1997–2001), 24.6% (2002–2006), 11.3% (2007–2011), and 3.4% (2012–2016). For every OI, the number of first cases decreased nearly annually. Time to first OI increased in successive birth periods. Among children < 13 years of age, 2083 OI were diagnosed, including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, candidiasis, recurrent bacterial infection, wasting syndrome, cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteriosis and herpes simplex virus. The rate (#/1000 person-years) decreased overall (60–7.2) and for all individual OIs. Earlier during 1997–2016, rates for all OIs were higher among foreign-born than US-born children but later became similar for all OIs except tuberculosis.

Conclusions

Among children with HIV in the US, numbers and rates of all OIs decreased during 1997–2016. Earlier, OI rates were highest among non-US-born children but were later comparable with those among US-born children for all OIs except tuberculosis.

### Trends in the prevalence of asthma symptoms and allergic diseases in Israeli adolescents: results from a national survey 2003 and comparison with 1997 [^98bc1cbe]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the temporal trends in the prevalence of asthma symptoms and allergies in Israeli adolescents.

Methods

A modified version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire was administered to a national sample of Jewish and Arab schoolchildren in Israel. The results were compared to a similar survey conducted in 1997.

Results

Asthma prevalence was 7.0% in 1997 and 6.4% 2003 respectively (p = 0.1). Wheezing in the past 12 months decreased significantly from 17.9% in 1997 to 13.8% in 2003 (p < 0.001). Allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis increased from 9.4% to 10.5%, and from 5.9% to 8.7% respectively. The prevalence of allergic disease remained higher in Jewish compared with Arabs.

Conclusions

The prevalence of asthma symptoms decreased in Israel from 1997 to 2003 while there was an increase in allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^4930915e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) — epidemiology and transmission in HIV-infected children — features early-life exposure, peak infant risk, and substantial incidence declines in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era. By ages 2 to 4 years, more than 80% of children have antibodies to Pneumocystis, and among HIV-infected children the highest incidence is in the first year of life with cases peaking at ages 3 to 6 months. U.S. surveillance reported declining PCP infection rates from 25 in 1994 to 18 in 1996 to 6 in 2001; another cohort observed a 95% decline in cases per 100 child-years from 5.8 to 0.3, and incidence was 1.3 during the pre-cART era (1981–1988) versus < 0.5 during 2001–2004. In African autopsy series, PCP was present in 16% of children who died with HIV/AIDS during 1992 and 1993, in 29% during 1997 and 2000, and in 44% during 2000 and 2001. Transmission is not firmly established but airborne human-to-human transmission is likely; intrauterine transmission is considered rare with one report of 1 of 8 infants born to mothers with AIDS and PCP during pregnancy having evidence of infection. The single most important susceptibility factor is the status of cell-mediated immunity, with severe compromise reflected by decreased CD4 T lymphocyte count and percentage.
