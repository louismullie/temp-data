## Question

If patient had a polyp found on colonoscopy and recommended 5 year follow up, can they do FIT test or do they need to do colonoscopy next?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, after a colonoscopy found a polyp and a 5-year follow-up was recommended, the next test should be a FIT or a colonoscopy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the polyp details that determined the 5-year interval. Then, I should verify what the US Multi-Society Task Force says about surveillance modality after polypectomy. Next, I will check whether FIT has any role in this context and what the risks are of substituting FIT for colonoscopy. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any exceptions where FIT might be considered, making sure I anchor this to current guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. A 5-year surveillance recommendation typically reflects removal of 1–2 small (< 10 mm) tubular adenomas without advanced features, placing the patient in a low-risk category for metachronous advanced neoplasia; importantly, this assumes a high-quality baseline colonoscopy with complete polypectomy and adequate prep, which are prerequisites for applying standard intervals [^e0364b2c] [^0c89dbbf].

> Wait, let me verify the surveillance modality question. The US Multi-Society Task Force explicitly recommends colonoscopy as the surveillance test after polypectomy, with intervals tailored to risk features; it does not endorse substituting FIT for colonoscopy in this setting, and in fact advises against interval fecal testing during the surveillance window because of high false-positive rates and lack of supportive evidence, which would lead to unnecessary early colonoscopies [^e0364b2c] [^683f704e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any guideline allows FIT as an alternative here. The Multi-Society Task Force's surveillance recommendations are built around colonoscopy intervals based on baseline findings, and while average-risk screening can use FIT, that is a different context than post-polypectomy surveillance; there is no recommendation to replace scheduled surveillance colonoscopy with FIT in patients with prior adenomas, and doing so would risk missing interval lesions that colonoscopy can detect and remove [^e0364b2c] [^3ff816fc].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about the rationale. FIT is a screening test for average-risk populations and, when positive, mandates diagnostic colonoscopy; it is not designed to surveil patients with established adenomas, where direct visualization is required to detect and resect metachronous polyps, and substituting FIT would create a two-step process that delays definitive evaluation and could miss lesions [^523759d0] [^43829886].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot undergo colonoscopy due to comorbidity or refusal? In that exceptional scenario, some guidance allows considering noncolonoscopy modalities for average-risk screening, yet even then, after a polyp has been found, the risk profile is no longer average and colonoscopy remains preferred; if colonoscopy is truly not feasible, shared decision-making may consider alternatives, but this is off-label for surveillance and should be individualized with acknowledgment of the evidence gap and potential harm from delayed detection [^e0364b2c] [^a18855cf].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to avoid any ambiguity. For a patient with prior adenoma removal and a recommended 5-year surveillance interval, the next test should be a colonoscopy, not FIT; FIT is inappropriate for surveillance in this context and could yield false positives that trigger unnecessary procedures without the benefit of direct polyp detection and removal [^e0364b2c] [^683f704e].

---

For a patient with a polyp found on colonoscopy and a recommended 5-year follow-up, **FIT is not appropriate** for surveillance [^683f704e] because it is a screening tool for average-risk patients, not for post-polypectomy surveillance [^e0364b2c]. The next step should be a **colonoscopy at the recommended 5-year interval** [^e0364b2c], as colonoscopy is the standard for detecting and removing interval lesions and is supported by current guidelines [^e0364b2c]. FIT should only be used if the patient cannot undergo colonoscopy, and even then, a positive FIT still requires colonoscopy [^523759d0].

---

## Current guidelines for post-polypectomy surveillance

The US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (USMSTF) provides **clear recommendations** for post-polypectomy surveillance based on the number, size, and histology of polyps:

| **Polyp characteristics** | **Recommended surveillance interval** |
|-|-|
| 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm | 7–10 years [^e0364b2c] |
| 3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm | 3–5 years [^e0364b2c] |
| 5–10 adenomas < 10 mm | 3 years [^e0364b2c] |
| Advanced adenomas (≥ 10 mm, villous features, or high-grade dysplasia) | 3 years [^e0364b2c] |
| > 10 adenomas | 1 year [^e0364b2c] |

---

These recommendations assume a **high-quality baseline colonoscopy** with complete polyp removal and adequate bowel preparation [^e0364b2c]. If the baseline colonoscopy was suboptimal, earlier surveillance may be warranted [^d2bc9161].

---

## Role of FIT in post-polypectomy surveillance

FIT is primarily a **screening tool** for average-risk individuals, not for post-polypectomy surveillance [^523759d0]. The USMSTF explicitly states that interval fecal testing (FIT or FOBT) is not recommended within the first 5 years after an adequate baseline colonoscopy, as it has a high false-positive rate and may lead to unnecessary early colonoscopies [^683f704e]. If FIT is performed and returns positive, the patient must still undergo colonoscopy, which is the definitive diagnostic and therapeutic procedure [^523759d0].

---

## Evidence supporting colonoscopy over FIT for surveillance

Colonoscopy is the gold standard for post-polypectomy surveillance because it allows direct visualization and removal of recurrent or new polyps. Studies show that **colonoscopy surveillance reduces colorectal cancer incidence and mortality**, particularly in patients with advanced adenomas or multiple polyps [^e32cdcd5]. In contrast, FIT lacks sufficient sensitivity for advanced adenomas and is not validated for post-polypectomy surveillance [^523759d0].

---

## Risks and limitations of FIT in this context

Using FIT for post-polypectomy surveillance carries several **risks and limitations**:

- **False positives**: High false-positive rates can lead to unnecessary colonoscopies and patient anxiety [^683f704e].
- **False negatives**: FIT may miss significant lesions, leading to delayed detection of advanced neoplasia or cancer [^523759d0].
- **Lack of evidence**: There is insufficient evidence supporting FIT for post-polypectomy surveillance [^683f704e].

---

## Clinical scenarios where FIT might be considered

FIT may be considered only in **specific scenarios** where the patient cannot undergo colonoscopy due to medical comorbidities, patient preference, or resource limitations. Even then, a positive FIT result still necessitates colonoscopy, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^523759d0].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For a patient with a polyp found on colonoscopy and a recommended 5-year follow-up, **FIT is not appropriate** for surveillance. The next step should be a **colonoscopy at the recommended 5-year interval** [^e0364b2c]. FIT should only be used if the patient cannot undergo colonoscopy, and a positive FIT result still requires colonoscopy [^523759d0].

Supplementary appendix A — approach to surveillance — lists PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions specifying colonoscopy surveillance timing and target populations with stated outcomes. Questions include "Is repeat colonoscopy at 10 y preferred to earlier surveillance in patients with normal colonoscopy?" and "Is no repeat colonoscopy preferred to colonoscopy at 10 y or earlier in patients with normal colonoscopy?". For patients with "1–2 small (< 10 mm) nonadvanced adenomas", the questions ask whether "surveillance at 5 y" is preferred to "surveillance at 10 y", and whether surveillance is preferred to "no surveillance". For sessile serrated adenoma/polyp groups, questions compare "surveillance at 3 y" versus "surveillance at 5 or 10 y" in those with "size ≥ 10 mm and/or with dysplasia" and those with "size < 10 mm with no dysplasia". Additional questions address advanced adenoma and evaluate whether "surveillance at 3 y" is preferred to "surveillance at 5 or 10 y", and assess similar 3-year versus 5- or 10-year intervals for "adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size" and for "adenoma containing high-grade dysplasia". Outcomes across questions include "Detection of adenoma, advanced adenoma, and/or CRC", "Reduction CRC incidence", and "Reduction CRC mortality".

Colonoscopy surveillance — interval fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) before scheduled surveillance is not advised after an adequate baseline colonoscopy. If the patient has an adequate baseline colonoscopy, surveillance colonoscopy should be based on the current guidelines, and patients should not have interval fecal blood testing if colonoscopy is planned. The task force recommends that interval fecal testing not be performed within the first 5 years after colonoscopy; there is currently insufficient evidence to support this practice, and the likelihood of false-positive test results is high, which would result in unnecessary early colonoscopies. If a fecal blood test is performed in the first 5 years after colonoscopy, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation, and the clinician's judgment to repeat colonoscopy could consider the prior colonoscopy findings, completeness of examination and bowel preparation, and family history.

Surveillance colonoscopy rationale and evidence — colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality "are decreasing secondary to improvements in risk factor exposure, screening, treatment, and perhaps exposure to surveillance among patients with polyps", and because some patients have persistently increased CRC risk and many have increased risk for advanced neoplasia on follow-up, surveillance colonoscopy to attempt to reduce CRC risk "is clinically rational and recommended". The evidence base "has strengthened and has helped to support close follow-up for some groups, as well as less intensive follow-up for others", yet "more and better data are needed to fully understand underlying risk, ideal surveillance intervals to apply for optimizing CRC prevention and early detection".

US Multi-Society Task Force — risk stratification and surveillance intervals: Screening and surveillance intervals are based on stratification of risk for metachronous advanced neoplasia, and evidence after a normal colonoscopy has strengthened the recommendation to defer repeat screening for at least 10 years. Among patients with polyps, new data suggest that patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm are at lower than average risk for incident and fatal colorectal cancer (CRC) and can undergo colonoscopy at longer intervals, while individuals with advanced neoplasia remain at greater than population risk after polypectomy; emerging data support less frequent surveillance for those with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm in size. Two studies suggest that exposure to surveillance colonoscopy after baseline polypectomy (compared to no surveillance) may reduce incident CRC among high-risk patients, though more data are needed on the incremental benefit for reducing incidence and mortality.

### Follow-up colonoscopy after positive FIT test-NCI… [^d56bf8be]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

FIT is one of the most widely used colorectal cancer screening tests worldwide. Experts generally recommend that people repeat this test every 1 to 2 years. People with a positive FIT test result are advised to have a colonoscopy to investigate the cause of the bleeding because a FIT test alone cannot diagnose cancer. A follow-up, or diagnostic, colonoscopy can find not only colorectal cancer but also precancerous growths, or polyps, that doctors can remove during the procedure, reducing the risk of future cancers. If cancer is detected, treatment is usually the next step. Many successful colorectal cancer screening programs, including those in the United States, use some combination of stool-based tests, such as FIT, and screening colonoscopy, Dr. Corley said, so the new study results "are very relevant to settings in the United States". The program offers free FIT testing once every 2 years to people 50–69 years old. Stool samples collected at home are sent in for analysis.

People with a positive FIT result are contacted by phone by trained individuals and a follow-up colonoscopy exam is offered free of charge. The study included 111, 423 people who had a positive FIT test, of whom 88, 013 people had a follow-up colonoscopy as part of the program and 23, 410 did not. Nearly all of the people who had a follow-up colonoscopy did so within a year of the positive FIT result. The researchers compared the numbers of new colorectal cancer cases diagnosed, deaths from colorectal cancer, and deaths from any cause in the two groups over time for up to 10 years after an initial positive FIT result. During the study period, fewer than 1% of people in each group died of colorectal cancer. However, those who did not get a follow-up colonoscopy were about twice as likely to die of colorectal cancer over a 10-year period as those who did have a follow-up colonoscopy.

In the colonoscopy group, the number of new colorectal cancers diagnosed went up sharply in the first 6 months or so after a positive FIT result and leveled off after that. The initial sharp rise was expected, the researchers noted, due to colorectal cancer being found during follow-up colonoscopy. The low incidence of colorectal cancer after that was likely due to the early detection of cancers and the removal of precancerous lesions during colonoscopy, Dr. Breslau explained.

Risk after first surveillance — Across all studies, individuals with low-risk adenoma at baseline and no adenoma at first surveillance had low rates of high-risk adenoma on follow-up, ranging from 1% to 6.6%; across all but one of the studies reviewed, individuals with high-risk adenoma at both baseline and subsequent surveillance examination have > 18% rate of metachronous high-risk adenoma on follow-up, supporting our recommendation for follow-up colonoscopy in 3 years.

Follow-up after removal of 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm — interval guidance and re-evaluation: we considered a recommendation of 10 years alone rather than a range of 7- to 10-year follow-up after removal of 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm in size, and existing evidence supports that these patients are at lower than average risk for CRC; the 7- to 10-year range was chosen because of ongoing uncertainty regarding whether the observed lower than average risk for CRC could be reduced further by exposure to surveillance and because exposure to surveillance colonoscopy in some studies may have contributed to the low risk; ongoing work may clarify whether surveillance improves outcomes and whether characteristics such as size < 6 mm may guide choosing a shorter 7-year vs longer 10-year interval; the Task Force recognizes that many patients with 1–2 nonadvanced adenomas < 10 mm previously received a 5-year or other interval shorter than 7–10 years, and based on new evidence and the current 7- to 10-year recommendation, if feasible, we suggest that physicians may re-evaluate such patients and reasonably choose to provide an updated recommendation for follow-

### Outcomes at follow-up of negative colonoscopy in average risk population: systematic review and meta-analysis [^45ce39cf]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Colonoscopy is considered a powerful tool for reducing the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer and is recommended as a primary screening test by major medical authorities worldwide. For the general population at average risk — that is, people with no personal history of colorectal cancer, adenomas, or inflammatory bowel disease, no hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome, and no family history of colorectal cancer — major American and European guidelines recommend colonoscopic screening at 10 year intervals.

However, this interval is mostly justified either by the assumed natural history of progression of adenomas into carcinomas or by anecdotal evidence relying on administrative claims data or linkage to cancer incidence registries. The actual outcomes of a follow-up screening colonoscopy, which should be paramount in defining a re-screening interval, are rarely referred to as a basis for screening recommendations. For instance, the recommendation of the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines is based solely on a study with mortality as the endpoint, reporting incident cancers and deaths from colorectal cancer. The German Guideline Program in Oncology cites one small repeat colonoscopy study from 1996 with a mean interval between examinations of 5.5 years, as well as further indirect evidence from case-control studies, in which cases were composed of only participants with colorectal cancer. Moreover, despite these guideline recommendations, several studies have suggested considerable overuse of repeat screening colonoscopy before the end of the recommended interval.

Comprehensive, high quality evidence on the prevalence of findings at repeat screening colonoscopies is needed to substantiate and possibly refine guideline recommendations, as well as to strengthen the efficiency of screening practice by decreasing overuse. We reviewed and summarised the available evidence from studies on the prevalence of findings at follow-up colonoscopies conducted at various time intervals after negative colonoscopy in people at average risk for colorectal cancer.

Recommendations after colonoscopy and polypectomy — high-grade dysplasia: For patients with adenoma containing high-grade dysplasia completely removed at high-quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 3 years (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). The previously cited cohort study from the United States, as well as 1 additional cohort study, have confirmed and extended evidence to support high-grade dysplasia as a risk factor for metachronous advanced neoplasia and CRC.

Follow-up of positive noncolonoscopy screening tests — timeliness and management: Appropriate follow-up to a positive (noncolonoscopy) test is a timely colonoscopy, which is an integral part of the screening process and not complete until performed; repeating a positive stool-based test to decide on colonoscopy is not an appropriate screening strategy. In a retrospective cohort of 70,124 patients with a positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT), no significant differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk were seen when colonoscopy occurred 7 to 9 months after FIT, but after delays of 10 months or more risks increased, and were even higher when delayed 12 months or more (odds ratio, 2.25 for any cancer and 3.22 for advanced-stage disease). Completion of follow-up is suboptimal: failure to complete colonoscopy within 12 months has been documented in more than one-half of patients in some settings, and across 4 U.S. health systems colonoscopy follow-up at 12 months varied from 58% to 83%.

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^d218ff9f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force — risk stratification and surveillance intervals after polypectomy note that patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm are at lower than average risk for incident and fatal colorectal cancer (CRC) and can undergo colonoscopy at longer intervals, while individuals with advanced neoplasia remain at greater than population risk. Data are emerging to support less frequent surveillance among individuals with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, and 2 studies suggest that exposure to surveillance colonoscopy after baseline polypectomy may reduce risk for incident CRC among high-risk patients. Recommendations are unchanged for advanced adenoma, including those with adenoma ≥ 10 mm, with evidence to support close surveillance in 3 years strengthened. One year, rather than a more general recommendation for < 3-year follow-up colonoscopy for individuals with > 10 adenomas at a single examination, has been recommended to simplify follow-up, although the evidence base has not been markedly strengthened; emerging evidence suggests that individuals with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm are at low risk for metachronous neoplasia.

Scope and exclusions — this review applies to average-risk individuals, excluding specific high-risk groups, and focuses on follow-up detection outcomes. It applies to average-risk individuals and excluded patients with hereditary syndromes associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), and studies including patients with inflammatory bowel disease or prior history of CRC were excluded. It evaluated findings and the detection of CRC, advanced adenoma, or any adenoma during the follow-up period.

### Patients without colonoscopic follow-up after abnormal fecal immunochemical tests are often unaware of the abnormal result and report several barriers to colonoscopy [^f454ffee]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study identified several patient-reported challenges to diagnostic colonoscopy after abnormal FIT among those without colonoscopic follow-up. Future research should include qualitative studies with patients and their providers to better characterize challenges discussing FIT results and the importance of colonoscopy. Patients might benefit from understanding upfront that abnormal FIT results require additional evaluation, and the medical community might benefit from additional education about the appropriate use of FIT, repeat FIT testing, and recommendations for colonoscopic follow-up. Given limited exisiting data, more work must also be done to inform providers of the optimal management approach for patients with an abnormal FIT and a recent normal colonoscopy. Additional research in these areas will improve FIT screening programs, enhance management and counseling of patients with abnormal FIT results, and contribute to multimodal interventions to improve colonoscopic follow-up after abnormal FIT.

Surveillance colonoscopy evidence and bias — studies comparing surveillance versus no surveillance "should seek to avoid" several biases, including excluding cancers diagnosed within 1 year and comparing non-surveillance to those who survived cancer free and received surveillance, which "may be considered a form of immortal time bias"; very few randomized trials exist, with the U.S. National Polyp Study as the only randomized controlled trial that compared a very short 1- vs 3-year follow-up interval among baseline adenoma, while a European randomized trial is underway.

### Risk factors for metachronous colorectal cancer and advanced neoplasia following primary colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c3980250]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Existing guidelines have clear expectations on the surveillance of patients after curative resection, albeit they are based on low levels of evidence. Recommendations are not nuanced with consideration of risk factors. About 50% of metachronous CRC occur within 2 years after the primary CRC and hence the first colonoscopy after CRC treatment is critical for patients. Australian guidelines published by Cancer Council Australia and endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (last updated in 2017) recommend a colonoscopy 1 year after curative primary resection and then, after a clear colonoscopy, a further colonoscopy every 5 years. This approach is a one-size-fits-all which could be more targeted if risk factors could be identified, including this systematic review and meta-analysis. For example, more intensive screening could be recommended for those with a synchronous CRC or polyps at the time of diagnosis of first CRC.

Section 1: Approach to surveillance — comparative questions specify colonoscopy surveillance intervals and outcomes. In patients with > 10 nonadvanced adenomas, colonoscopy surveillance in < 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y, with outcomes including detection of adenoma, advanced adenoma, and/or CRC, reduction CRC incidence, and reduction CRC mortality. In patients with high adenoma volume, colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 5 or 10 y. In patients with baseline nonadvanced adenoma and normal colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 10 y. In patients with baseline advanced adenoma and normal colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 10 y. In patients with baseline advanced adenoma and advanced adenoma colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y.

Conclusions

Despite the elevated risk of CRC among individuals with abnormal FIT results, rates of follow-up colonoscopy in a non-integrated FQHC were substantially below the 80% target set by the Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to surveillance after curative-intent therapy, surveillance colonoscopy, USMSTF 2016 guidelines recommend to perform the next colonoscopy after 3 years (4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) and then 5 years (9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) after the 1-year colonoscopy. Perform subsequent colonoscopies at 5-year intervals until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. Decide on intervals between colonoscopies in accordance with published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals if neoplastic polyps are detected. Do not use these intervals in patients with Lynch syndrome.

### Final recommendation statement: colorectal cancer: screening [^ca386d60]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

How to implement this recommendation?

Screen all adults aged 45 to 75 years for colorectal cancer. Several recommended screening tests are available. Clinicians and patients may consider a variety of factors in deciding which test may be best for each person. For example, the tests require different frequencies of screening, location of screening (home or office), methods of screening (stool-based or direct visualization), preprocedure bowel preparation, anesthesia or sedation during the test, and follow-up procedures for abnormal findings.

Recommended screening strategies include:

- High-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (HSgFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year
- Stool DNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years
- Computed tomography colonography every 5 years
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years + annual FIT
- Colonoscopy screening every 10 years

Selectively screen adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer.

Discuss together with patients the decision to screen, taking into consideration the patient's overall health status (life expectancy, comorbid conditions), prior screening history, and preferences.

What are other relevant USPSTF recommendations?

### Why is the FORTE study… [^d251b317]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

What is the FORTE study. The FORTE study will help to determine if certain people can wait for a follow-up colonoscopy after a routine screening colonoscopy. It is a randomized clinical trial for people who have one or two small, noncancerous polyps removed during a routine screening colonoscopy. Such people usually get repeat colonoscopies 5 years and 10 years later. FORTE will help determine if these people can wait 10 years before a follow-up test. A total of 9, 500 people who have had one or two benign polyps removed during a routine screening colonoscopy will be assigned by chance to one of two study groups. In one group, participants will have repeat colonoscopies at both 5 and 10 years. In the other group, participants will have their next colonoscopy exam at 10 years.

What are the goals of the FORTE study. People participating in the trial will be assigned by chance to one of two study groups. People in one group will have follow-up colonoscopies at 5 years and 10 years. Those in the other group will have their next colonoscopy at 10 years, in keeping with current guidelines for those with negative results. By comparing colorectal cancer rates in the two groups, researchers will learn if waiting 10 years for a follow-up colonoscopy is as good at preventing colorectal cancer as follow-up colonoscopy exams at both 5 years and 10 years. Why is the FORTE study important. Several studies suggest that the risk of colorectal cancer developing after a colonoscopy in which one or two small polyps were removed is similar to that of people who had a colonoscopy with no polyps found. People without polyps are recommended to return in 10 years. The recommended follow up for people with one or two small adenomas is 5 to 10 years.

Small adenomas (1–2, < 10 mm) — in 7 prospective polyp surveillance studies, individuals with a history of polyps had metachronous advanced neoplasia risk of 11.5% and those with concurrent distal and proximal small adenomas had 11.0% absolute risk; in a separate study of 4496 patients with 1–2 nonadvanced adenomas, incident CRC risk was similar for proximal only vs distal only adenomas (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.7–2.8). The authors considered 10 years alone rather than a range of 7- to 10-year follow-up after removal of 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm, but state that the 7- to 10-year range was chosen because of uncertainty about benefit of surveillance and possible contribution of surveillance to observed low risk; they anticipate ongoing work may clarify benefits and whether characteristics such as size < 6 mm can guide choosing a shorter 7-year vs a longer 10-year interval.

### Screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians (version 2) [^a18855cf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for tailoring CRC screening: Clinicians should assess their patients' baseline risk for CRC (e.g., personal and family history of CRC and polyps) and be attentive to race and ethnicity of patients who have experienced worse CRC health outcomes to ensure access to and receipt of recommended screening. Starting CRC screening between the ages of 50 and 60 or screening less frequently (e.g., colonoscopy every 15 y) is likely reasonable for some adults at average risk for CRC who prefer to be screened less frequently. When selecting a CRC screening test, a stool test may not be an ideal screening strategy for patients who may be unable or unwilling to follow up every other year. Screening with colonoscopy or FS is less frequent than stool tests, but bowel preparation, anesthesia, and sedation increase the risk for aspiration and dehydration. For stool-based tests, an abnormal result with a FIT or gFOBT requires a follow-up colonoscopy; FIT requires one stool sample without dietary restrictions, whereas gFOBT requires 3 stool samples and dietary restrictions. FIT and gFOBT require a higher frequency of screening compared with FS or colonoscopy, and FIT and gFOBT can be done at home.

Large serrated lesions (SSP or HP) ≥ 10 mm — For patients with SSP ≥ 10 mm at a high-quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 3 years (Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with HP ≥ 10 mm, repeat colonoscopy in 3–5 years, with a 3-year follow-up interval favored if there is concern about pathologist consistency in distinguishing SSPs from HPs, quality of bowel preparation, or complete polyp excision, whereas a 5-year interval is favored if such concerns are low; the Task Force recommends photo documentation verifying polyp size relative to an open forceps or open snare of known size. Supporting context includes that 47% of SSPs 10–20 mm had evidence of incomplete resection and that the Task Force recommends 3-year follow-up for individuals with SSPs ≥ 10 mm in size, and 3- to 5-year follow-up for individuals with HP ≥ 10 mm.

### Low rate of large polyps (> 9 mm) within 10 years after an adequate baseline colonoscopy with no polyps [^594c7db4]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Guidelines recommend a 10-year interval between screening colonoscopies with negative results for average-risk individuals. However, many patients are examined at shorter intervals. We investigated outcomes of individuals with no polyps who had repeat colonoscopy in < 10 years.

Methods

Data were collected using the National Endoscopic Database, from 69 gastroenterology centers, on 264,184 asymptomatic subjects who underwent screening colonoscopies from 2000 through 2006, were found to have no polyps, and received another colonoscopy examination within < 10 years.

Results

No polyps were found in 147,375 patients during a baseline colonoscopy; 17,525 patients (11.9%) had a follow-up colonoscopy within < 10 years, including 1806 (10.3%) who received the follow-up colonoscopy within < 1 year. The most common reason for repeating the examination within 1 year was that the first was compromised by inadequate bowel preparation or incomplete examination. Of these patients, 6.5% (95% confidence interval: 5.3–7.6) had large polyp(s) > 9 mm-a proportion similar to the prevalence in the average-risk screening population. Reasons that examinations were repeated within 1–5 years included average-risk screening (15.7%), family history of colon polyps or cancer (30.1%), bleeding (31.2%), gastrointestinal symptoms (11.8%), or a positive result from a fecal blood test (5.5%). If the baseline examination was adequate, the incidence of large polyps within 1–5 years after baseline colonoscopy was 3.1% (95% confidence interval: 2.7–3.5) and within years 5–10 years was 3.7% (95% confidence interval: 3.3–4.1).

Conclusions

Repeat colonoscopies within 10 years are of little benefit to patients who had adequate examinations and were found to have no polyps. Repeat colonoscopies are beneficial to patients when the baseline examination was compromised.

### Patients without colonoscopic follow-up after abnormal fecal immunochemical tests are often unaware of the abnormal result and report several barriers to colonoscopy [^d4885d0e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States (U.S.) and accounts for 8.3% of cancer deaths overall. The disease is largely preventable by screening, and early detection improves outcomes. Over 90% of individuals with stage I disease will survive at least 5 years, compared to less than 15% of those diagnosed at an advanced stage. The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) reaffirmed the importance of CRC screening in their 2016 screening guidelines, making a grade A recommendation to screen all average-risk individuals age 50 to 75 and outlining several screening strategies. One of the recommended screening modalities, the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), is a commonly used, noninvasive, and inexpensive screening option with high participation rates. Accordingly, the most recent Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) CRC screening guidelines recommend FIT as one of two first-tier screening tests along with colonoscopy.

The FIT detects the globin portion of human hemoglobin in stool. Individuals with evidence of globin in the stool must undergo diagnostic colonoscopy to determine if there is a precancerous and/or cancerous lesion in the colon that has led to the abnormal (i.e. positive) result. While abnormal FIT results may represent benign lesions (i.e. hemorrhoids, hyperplastic polyps, normal colon), follow-up testing with colonoscopy aims to detect adenomas and colorectal carcinoma. Thus, FIT is a two-step screening process that is only effective when those with abnormal results undergo colonoscopy.

Despite these fundamental aspects of FIT screening, CRC screening programs struggle to achieve high rates for colonoscopic follow-up after abnormal FIT results. Across healthcare settings in the U.S. follow-up rates are far below the national benchmark of 80% colonoscopy completion after abnormal FIT. Patients with an abnormal FIT have a CRC prevalence of 2.9 to 7.8%. Low follow-up rates are associated with late stage CRC at diagnosis and CRC-related death. Lack of follow-up also reduces the cost-effectiveness of screening and worsens inequities in CRC screening and CRC outcomes.

### Outcomes at follow-up of negative colonoscopy in average risk population: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8c2f4d10]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Limitations of this review

Our review and meta-analysis has several limitations. Firstly, it is entirely based on observational studies, which may be affected by confounding factors associated with use of colonoscopy. In addition, the proportion of participants with index and follow-up colonoscopies, compared with those with only a first colonoscopy, was generally low. This suggests potential for selection bias, as participants with repeated examinations either might be more health conscious or may have had a diagnostic reason to return. However, willingness to undergo screening is unlikely to be a predictor of neoplastic findings, and the summary estimates including mixed study populations deviated only slightly from those for participants at average risk.

Secondly, a considerable proportion of studies in our review also included participants with a family history of colorectal cancer, for whom some guidelines recommend shorter intervals as they might still be at higher risk for colorectal cancer. However, their inclusion suggests that the true prevalences for participants at average risk might even be lower.

Thirdly, considerable heterogeneity existed in the design of the included studies. As a result, the statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analyses was substantial and could not be significantly reduced in sensitivity analyses. Even if categorised per interval, a variety of factors will contribute to intra-group heterogeneity, including population characteristics and factors outside the scope of this study, such as the skills of individual endoscopists.

Implications for colorectal cancer screening

Although any neoplasms were detected in more than 20% of participants even at colonoscopies conducted within five years of a negative colonoscopy, detection of advanced neoplasms within 10 years was rare. This finding suggests that recommendations of 10 year intervals for colonoscopy screening in this low risk group may be adequate. As the large majority of non-advanced lesions are commonly thought to have a very low potential for transition to cancer, the high median values for detection of any neoplasms should not be regarded as a rationale to repeat screening earlier than after 10 years.

As previously noted, the long lasting lower risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia after a negative colonoscopy is not to be interpreted as a protective effect of colonoscopy because no polyps were removed. Rather, our study corroborates the notion that participants who were found to be free of polyps at an index colonoscopy at screening age have an inherently lower risk.

Surveillance colonoscopy after removal of adenoma — impact varies by risk features. Surveillance after baseline removal of adenoma with high-risk features (eg, size ≥ 10 mm) may reduce incident colorectal cancer (CRC), but impact on fatal CRC is uncertain (Low quality of evidence). After removal of adenoma with low-risk features (such as 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm), the incremental impact on incident and fatal CRC is uncertain (Low quality of evidence). In a UK cohort of 11,944 patients with intermediate-risk adenoma, defined as 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, at median 7.9 years follow-up 42% did not receive surveillance, and exposure to 1 or 2 surveillance examinations was associated with a 43%–48% relative reduction in incident CRC risk (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40–0.80; and HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.84).

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^3fa4e8a8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

This document updates the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations of the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. CRC screening tests are ranked in 3 tiers based on performance features, costs, and practical considerations. The first-tier tests are colonoscopy every 10 years and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as the cornerstones of screening regardless of how screening is offered. Thus, in a sequential approach based on colonoscopy offered first, FIT should be offered to patients who decline colonoscopy. Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as tests of choice when multiple options are presented as alternatives. A risk-stratified approach is also appropriate, with FIT screening in populations with an estimated low prevalence of advanced neoplasia and colonoscopy screening in high prevalence populations. The second-tier tests include CT colonography every 5 years, the FIT-fecal DNA test every 3 years, and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years. These tests are appropriate screening tests, but each has disadvantages relative to the tier 1 tests. Because of limited evidence and current obstacles to use, capsule colonoscopy every 5 years is a third-tier test. We suggest that the Septin9 serum assay (Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash) not be used for screening. Screening should begin at age 50 years in average-risk persons, except in African Americans in whom limited evidence supports screening at 45 years. CRC incidence is rising in persons under age 50, and thorough diagnostic evaluation of young persons with suspected colorectal bleeding is recommended. Discontinuation of screening should be considered when persons up to date with screening, who have prior negative screening (particularly colonoscopy), reach age 75 or have < 10 years of life expectancy. Persons without prior screening should be considered for screening up to age 85, depending on age and comorbidities. Persons with a family history of CRC or a documented advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative age < 60 years or 2 first-degree relatives with these findings at any age are recommended to undergo screening by colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40, whichever is earlier. Persons with a single first-degree relative diagnosed at ≥ 60 years with CRC or an advanced adenoma can be offered average-risk screening options beginning at age 40 years.

### Follow-up colonoscopy after an abnormal stool-based colorectal cancer screening result: analysis of steps in the colonoscopy completion process [^85856f49]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, accounting for an estimated 51,000 deaths in 2019. Due to increased screening, CRC incidence and mortality has declined considerably over the past four decades, however many people who should be screened still do not get screened. Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are a low-cost alternative to colonoscopy for identifying patients at risk of CRC, however, for FITs to be effective, patients who receive an abnormal FIT result must obtain a timely follow-up colonoscopy in order to remove precancerous polyps or find cancer in early forms that can be successfully treated. Troublingly, follow-up colonoscopy rates are low in most US healthcare settings and are particularly low in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), where published rates range from 18 to 57%. These rates are well below the 80% target set by the Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer. Compared with health care settings that have integrated specialty care services, FQHCs face unique challenges in coordinating care with specialty colonoscopy providers located in separate health care systems.

Delays in receiving follow-up colonoscopy are associated with increased CRC incidence and mortality. Lee and colleagues reported a 31% higher risk of CRC and a two-fold higher risk for advanced stage disease among adults who delayed colonoscopy by 6 months or more compared to those who obtained a colonoscopy within 1–3 months of an abnormal FIT. Similar findings were reported in a Kaiser Permanente study, where a 10-month delay was associated with a 48% increase in CRC risk. Meester and colleagues used modeling to estimate a 4% increase in CRC incidence and 16% increase in mortality among adults who delayed follow-up colonoscopy by 12 months versus those who received it within 2 weeks.

For many patients, obtaining a follow-up colonoscopy can be a complex process, often requiring the completion of several steps, including obtaining a referral to a gastroenterology (GI) practice; possibly attending a pre-procedure visit; arranging an escort and transportation to and from the procedure; completing bowel preparation; and attending the colonoscopy procedure. Each of these steps can create compounding barriers to colonoscopy completion. Analyses of qualitative interviews with patients have identified several barriers, including lack of knowledge about the need for colonoscopy, difficulty arranging transportation to and from the procedure, concerns about cost, inability to leave work to attend the procedure, fear of discomfort, and difficulty completing bowel preparation.

Where to read the full recommendation statement?

Visit the USPSTF website (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org) to read the full recommendation statement. This includes more details on the rationale of the recommendation, including benefits and harms; supporting evidence; and recommendations of others.

The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

USPSTF indicates US Preventive Services Task Force.

Currently, the only stool DNA test approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is a multitarget stool DNA test that also includes a FIT component, referred to as sDNA-FIT in this recommendation. When stool-based tests reveal abnormal results, follow-up with colonoscopy is needed for further evaluation.

Among the stool-based tests, screening with annual FIT or annual sDNA-FIT provides an estimated greater life-years gained than annual high-sensitivity gFOBT or sDNA-FIT every 3 years. Additionally, modeling estimates that screening with sDNA-FIT annually would result in more colonoscopies than annual screening with FIT. However, sDNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years is estimated to provide a reasonable balance of life years gained per estimated follow-up colonoscopy compared with no screening.

Currently, there is uncertainty around the accuracy of high-sensitivity gFOBT to detect colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas, although it is likely lower than the accuracy of FIT and sDNA-FIT, and high-sensitivity gFOBT is more difficult for patients to administer.

However, randomized trials demonstrate direct evidence of decreased deaths from colorectal cancer when screening with non–high-sensitivity gFOBT is performed.

### Faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) versus colonoscopy for surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness study [^ab4ed143]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from adenomas, and adenoma removal reduces CRC incidence and mortality. Some patients remain at increased risk of CRC postpolypectomy, and national guidelines recommend surveillance by colonoscopy. The UK surveillance guidelines recommend different strategies for patients at low risk, intermediate risk and high risk. Surveillance is not recommended for low-risk patients (with one to two adenomas < 10 mm), while 3 yearly surveillance is recommended for intermediate-risk patients (with three to four adenomas < 10 mm or at least one ≥ 10 mm). High-risk patients (with five or more adenomas < 10 mm, or three or more adenomas with at least one ≥ 10 mm) are recommended colonoscopy at 1 year before commencing 3 yearly surveillance.

Colonoscopy surveillance is associated with reduced CRC incidence; however, this procedure can have serious complications and be uncomfortable and anxiety inducing. Colonoscopy surveillance places great demand on endoscopy services, accounting for 20% of colonoscopies in the UK. Further increases in endoscopy demand due to widespread implementation of CRC screening and higher rates of primary care referrals for suspected CRCgive grounds for finding alternative surveillance methods.

The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) may be an alternative. Like the guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT), FIT detects occult blood in faeces, although it detects globin rather than haem, making it more specific for human blood.FIT is replacing gFOBT in CRC screening programmes because of its ease of use, increased uptake, quantitative analysis and greater sensitivity for advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN). The English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) is planning to introduce FIT in 2018.

FIT has been extensively evaluated for screening, with sensitivity estimates of a single low-threshold FIT for CRC approaching 90%. There are few studies on FIT for surveillance, and these reported sensitivities for CRC of 70%–100%, although they included patients attending surveillance for personal or family histories of CRC. We therefore developed the 'FIT for Follow-Up' study to investigate the potential utility of FIT for postpolypectomy surveillance, looking specifically at patients deemed at intermediate-risk following screening within the BCSP. We focused on intermediate-risk patients as they account for most surveillance colonoscopies in the UK. Here we report the diagnostic accuracy of annual FIT for CRC and advanced adenomas (AAs) over 3 years versus 3 yearly colonoscopy, alongside estimates of cost-effectiveness.

U.S. Multi-Society Task Force colorectal cancer (CRC) screening — average-risk testing and quality oversight: We recommend colonoscopy every 10 years or annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) as first-tier options for screening the average-risk persons for colorectal neoplasia (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). We recommend that physicians performing screening colonoscopy measure quality, including the adenoma detection rate (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence), and we recommend that physicians performing FIT monitor quality (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients who refuse colonoscopy and FIT, we recommend CT colonography every 5 years or FIT–fecal DNA every 3 years (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). We suggest that capsule colonoscopy (if available) is an appropriate screening test when patients decline colonoscopy, FIT, FIT–fecal DNA, CT colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we suggest against Septin 9 for CRC screening (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Recommendations on fecal immunochemical testing to screen for colorectal neoplasia: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^523759d0]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Recommendation/Summary — fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for colorectal neoplasia screening: With 1-time application, FIT tests are approximately 80% sensitive for cancer detection and approximately 20%–30% sensitive for advanced neoplasia detection, so to enhance advanced adenoma detection, repeated applications of FIT are required and we recommend repeated testing to maximize effectiveness. Individuals choosing FIT should understand the need for recurring testing and for colonoscopy to evaluate a positive FIT result, and programs to track cycles of testing are encouraged to facilitate completion. Given the high positive predictive value of FIT for cancer detection, colonoscopy is recommended when the test is positive, not repeat FIT. Strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence.

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^14792472]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

FIT–fecal DNA test for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening — specificity, costs, interval comparisons, and follow-up are summarized as follows: Specificity is lower than fecal immunochemical test (FIT) alone, with 86.6% in persons with normal colonoscopy or nonadvanced lesions and 89.8% in those with normal colonoscopy versus 96% for the FIT test alone, and it was only 83% in persons aged > 65 years. Costs are high at approximately $600 for privately insured patients and about $500 for Medicare patients, about 10 times the direct costs of annual FIT. Programmatically, specificity of every 3-year testing with the FIT–fecal DNA test may be approximately equal to the anticipated specificity over 3 years of annual FIT testing, but annual FIT is more effective and less costly than FIT–fecal DNA every 3 years. For patients with a positive FIT–fecal DNA result and a negative high-quality colonoscopy, asymptomatic patients do not need the colonoscopy repeated or evaluation of the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract.

### Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk adults: 2018 guideline update from the American cancer society [^76616b97]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed among adults and the second leading cause of death from cancer. For this guideline update, the American Cancer Society (ACS) used an existing systematic evidence review of the CRC screening literature and microsimulation modeling analyses, including a new evaluation of the age to begin screening by race and sex and additional modeling that incorporates changes in US CRC incidence. Screening with any one of multiple options is associated with a significant reduction in CRC incidence through the detection and removal of adenomatous polyps and other precancerous lesions and with a reduction in mortality through incidence reduction and early detection of CRC. Results from modeling analyses identified efficient and model-recommendable strategies that started screening at age 45 years. The ACS Guideline Development Group applied the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria in developing and rating the recommendations. The ACS recommends that adults aged 45 years and older with an average risk of CRC undergo regular screening with either a high-sensitivity stool-based test or a structural (visual) examination, depending on patient preference and test availability. As a part of the screening process, all positive results on noncolonoscopy screening tests should be followed up with timely colonoscopy. The recommendation to begin screening at age 45 years is a qualified recommendation. The recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 years and older is a strong recommendation. The ACS recommends (qualified recommendations) that: 1) average-risk adults in good health with a life expectancy of more than 10 years continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years; 2) clinicians individualize CRC screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history; and 3) clinicians discourage individuals older than 85 years from continuing CRC screening. The options for CRC screening are: fecal immunochemical test annually; high-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test annually; multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years; colonoscopy every 10 years; computed tomography colonography every 5 years; and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.

### Colorectal cancer screening and surveillance [^45238de4]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and women. The incidence and mortality rate of the disease have been declining over the past two decades because of early detection and treatment. Screening in persons at average risk should begin at 50 years of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine screening after 75 years of age. Options for screening include high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing annually, flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years with high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing every three years, or colonoscopy every 10 years. In 2012, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer updated its surveillance guidelines to promote the appropriate use of colonoscopy resources and reduce harms from delayed or unnecessary procedures; these guidelines provide recommendations for when to repeat colonoscopy based on findings. Adenomatous and serrated polyps have malignant potential and warrant early surveillance colonoscopy. Patients with one or two tubular adenomas that are smaller than 10 mm should have a repeat colonoscopy in five to 10 years. Repeat colonoscopy at five years is recommended for patients with nondysplastic serrated polyps that are smaller than 10 mm. Patients with three to 10 adenomas found during a single colonoscopy, an adenoma or serrated polyp that is 10 mm or larger, an adenoma with villous features or high-grade dysplasia, a sessile serrated polyp with cytologic dysplasia, or a traditional serrated adenoma are at increased risk of developing advanced neoplasia during surveillance and should have a repeat colonoscopy in three years. More than 10 synchronous adenomas warrant surveillance colonoscopy in less than three years. Colonoscopy may be repeated in 10 years if distal, small (less than 10 mm) hyperplastic polyps are the only finding.

Case Summary

A healthy 52-year-old woman without any family history presents for a health maintenance appointment and opts for a fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer screening after reviewing her options. After a positive result, she is referred for colonoscopy. She is found to have 3 small (< 10 mm) polyps that are completely resected via snare polypectomy and return as tubular adenomas on histologic examination. It is recommended that she return for repeat colonoscopy in 3 years, at which point she has a normal examination with excellent preparation by an experienced endoscopist and is given the option to return to her average-risk screening interval.

FIT-based screening program quality metrics — colonoscopy quality and participation/completion benchmarks — highlight process measures and observed rates: Priority quality indicators for colonoscopy include cecal intubation rate, adenoma detection rate, and use of recommended surveillance intervals, and the success of any FIT-based program is predicated in part on the quality of colonoscopy for positive tests. When the test on a given cycle is negative, systems should re-engage patients for the follow cycle (generally 1 year). Given similarities to gFOBT, program data are informative: Ontario reported 29.8% participation and, when gFOBT was positive, 74.6% proceeded to colonoscopy in 6 months; higher participation was reported in England (52%) and Finland (70%), with England's follow-up colonoscopy rate at 83%. Across FIT-based programs, participation rates of 60% appear consistent across rounds, and colonoscopy completion rates for positive tests are in the 80%–90% range.

We continue to recommend that persons with a family history of CRC in a first-degree relative diagnosed at < 60 years undergo colonoscopy every 5 years beginning at age 40 years or 10 years before the age the relative was diagnosed, whichever comes first, and patients with a positive family history who decline colonoscopy should be offered fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening. For families meeting criteria for family colon cancer syndrome X, persons should undergo colonoscopy at least every 3 to 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative. When first-degree relatives have documented advanced serrated lesions (SSPs ≥ 10 mm in size, or an SSP with cytologic dysplasia, or a traditional serrated adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size), we recommend that screening for first-degree relatives of persons with advanced serrated lesions should be similar to the screening of first-degree relatives of persons with advanced conventional adenomas.

### Follow-up colonoscopy after an abnormal stool-based colorectal cancer screening result: analysis of steps in the colonoscopy completion process [^6bfcf0b2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The median time to follow-up colonoscopy that we observed, 83 days, was within the range reported in prior studies (64 days to 184 days). Our observed time to colonoscopy was within the 90-day benchmark set by the PROSPR initiative, suggesting that patients who successfully access GI services generally are able to obtain a timely procedure. Notably, we observed a 37.5-day variation in median time to follow-up colonoscopy across GI referral sites, (range = 75 to 112.5 days).

Nearly 40% of patients with no follow-up colonoscopy had no reason documented in their medical record. Among those for whom a reason was documented, the most common reasons were that the patient declined, missed, or canceled an appointment, or could not be reached. These findings were similar to those of prior research by our team showing that common reasons were a patient's declination or appointment no-show (55%), having a recent prior colonoscopy (22%), or that the patient could not be reached (13%). Our current study extends these findings by specifying the distribution of reasons for each intermediate step. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of competing health concerns and being given a second FIT (to repeat the test) as key barriers for patients who did not receive a referral; and of having had a recent colonoscopy, lacking insurance authorization/ medical clearance, or having inadequate bowel prep as key barriers for patients with who completed a pre-procedure visit but did not receive a colonoscopy. Notably, these reasons are not always patient-reported, and leave unanswered questions about why patients may have declined or failed to show up for an appointment. Such information could be obtained from direct patient interviews. Moreover, the low proportion of charts with documented reasons for no colonoscopy may underscore the need to promote informed discussions between providers and patients about the risk of late cancer detection among patients who discontinue the screening process. Improving the documentation of reasons for no follow-up could better inform future interventions to improve follow-up care.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^ab55537d]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance — older age and individualized decisions are emphasized. For patients aged 75–85 years, the USPSTF recommends against continued routine screening but argues for individualization based on comorbidities and findings of any prior colonoscopy, and this age group may be more likely to benefit from surveillance, depending on life expectancy. It is the opinion of the MSTF that the decision to continue surveillance should be individualized, based on an assessment of benefit, risk, and comorbidities.

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^56cdbab1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Table 3 — terms and definitions for colonoscopy quality and polyp risk categories define key thresholds and criteria. Average risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) is the absence of inflammatory bowel disease, family history of CRC, hereditary syndrome associated with increased risk, serrated polyposis syndrome, or personal history of CRC. Normal colonoscopy is a colonoscopy where no adenoma, SSP, TSA, HP ≥ 10 mm, or CRC is found. Low-risk adenoma is 1–2 nonadvanced adenomas < 10 mm in size. Advanced adenoma is 1 or more of the following findings: adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size, adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology, or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Advanced neoplasia is 1 or more of the following findings: adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size, adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or CRC. High-risk adenoma is 1 or more of the following findings: advanced neoplasia or 3 or more adenomas. Adequate adenoma detection rate (ADR) is ADR ≥ 30% in men and ≥ 20% in women. Adequate bowel preparation is bowel preparation adequate for visualization of polyps > 5 mm in size. Complete examination is complete colonoscopy to cecum with photo documentation of cecal landmarks (appendiceal orifice, terminal ileum, or ileocecal valve). High-quality examination is examination complete to cecum with adequate bowel preparation performed by a colonoscopist with adequate adenoma detection rate and attention to complete polyp excision. The authors state, "We propose moving forward that rather than using categories such as 'high-risk adenoma' or 'low-risk adenoma', that research articles specify the individual criteria being captured by the category (eg, use 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm instead of the term low-risk adenoma) because evidence supporting level of risk for various criteria are constantly evolving".

### Recommendations on fecal immunochemical testing to screen for colorectal neoplasia: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^9f0b8768]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) program quality metrics — Priority quality indicators for colonoscopy include cecal intubation rate, adenoma detection rate, and use of recommended surveillance intervals, and program workflow should ensure that once the FIT target population is identified the FIT is delivered, completed, and returned; FIT will be effective only when completed, and there is evidence that navigation tools can help in this regard.

### AGA white paper: roadmap for the future of colorectal cancer screening in the United States [^eaa5d41a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Post-colonoscopy surveillance — adenoma detection rate (ADR) implications and intervals emphasize avoiding unnecessary procedures: "After completion of a high-quality colonoscopy examination in which no colonic neoplasia is found, there is no need for further screening tests for a 10-year interval", and "Colonoscopy is ineffective when performed at earlier intervals in patients without adenoma because the yield of finding AN is low". The document urges restraint: "We should actively focus on culture that minimizes inappropriate overuse of colonoscopy for screening and surveillance". For individuals with a history of adenomatous polyps, "Adenoma detection rates (ADRs), which are correlated inversely with postcolonoscopy CRC rates, have increased over time", and "Increased ADRs result in expansion of the population placed into colonoscopy-based surveillance programs". Resource constraints are noted: "In a setting in which opportunistic screening predominates, the extent to which the burden of surveillance colonoscopy for polyps limits the ability to bring new patients to screening is undefined but may constrain colonoscopy resources". The intensity of follow-up is questioned: "Data suggest that a history of small adenoma alone may not be a strong predictor of metachronous AN, and the benefit of surveillance colonoscopy at intervals of fewer than 10 years is not entirely clear". A modeling estimate quantified risk by detector performance: "Meester et al estimated that the lifetime risk for CRC was 12.5 per 1000 patients for high adenoma detectors and 26.6 per 1000 patients for low detectors".

### AGA clinical practice update on strategies to improve quality of screening and surveillance colonoscopy: expert review [^df4e64bd]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — surveillance intervals after colonoscopy — patients harboring advanced precancerous lesions should have a follow-up colonoscopy ≤ 3 years after the index examination. In contrast, average-risk patients who undergo a high-quality colonoscopy negative for precancerous polyps or with only small distal hyperplastic polyps have a very low risk of future neoplasia and should not be rescreened for 10 years. There is also increasing evidence that patients with 1–2 small adenomas (and especially 1–2 diminutive adenomas) are not at significantly elevated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the general population, and endoscopists should consider assigning a 10-year follow-up interval for this group as well.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American cancer society [^5c2647b6]. CA (2006). Low credibility.

Adenomatous polyps are the most common neoplastic findings uncovered in people who undergo colorectal screening or have a diagnostic workup for symptoms. It was common practice in the 1970s for these patients to have annual follow-up surveillance examinations to detect additional new adenomas as well as missed synchronous adenomas. As a result of the National Polyp Study report in 1993, which demonstrated clearly in a randomized design that the first postpolypectomy examination could be deferred for 3 years, guidelines published by a gastrointestinal consortium in 1997 recommended that the first follow-up surveillance be 3 years after polypectomy for most patients. In 2003, these guidelines were updated, colonoscopy was recommended as the only follow-up examination, and stratification at baseline into lower and higher risk for subsequent adenomas was suggested. The 1997 and 2003 guidelines dealt with both screening and surveillance. However, it has become increasingly clear that postpolypectomy surveillance is now a large part of endoscopic practice, draining resources from screening and diagnosis. In addition, surveys have demonstrated that a large proportion of endoscopists are conducting surveillance examinations at shorter intervals than recommended in the guidelines. In the present paper, a careful analytic approach was designed addressing all evidence available in the literature to delineate predictors of advanced pathology, both cancer and advanced adenomas, so that patients can be more definitely stratified at their baseline colonoscopy into those at lower or increased risk for a subsequent advanced neoplasia. People at increased risk have either three or more adenomas, or high-grade dysplasia, or villous features, or an adenoma ≥ 1 cm in size. It is recommended that they have a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy. People at lower risk who have one or two small (< 1 cm) tubular adenomas with no high-grade dysplasia can have a follow-up in 5 to 10 years, whereas people with hyperplastic polyps only should have a 10-year follow-up as average-risk people. Recent papers have reported a significant number of missed cancers by colonoscopy. However, high-quality baseline colonoscopy with excellent patient preparation and adequate withdrawal time should minimize this and reduce clinicians' concerns. These guidelines were developed jointly by the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American Cancer Society to provide a broader consensus and thereby increase utilization of the recommendations by endoscopists. Adoption of these guidelines nationally can have a dramatic impact on shifting available resources from intensive surveillance to screening. It has been shown that the first screening colonoscopy and polypectomy produces the greatest effects on reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with adenomatous polyps.

Key guidelines questions

The initial step of the GDG process was to compile a long list of potential questions to be covered by the guidelines. These were subsequently discussed and revised in an iterative process, until the final list was produced:

What are the aims and principles of post-polypectomy and post-cancer resection surveillance?
Who should be commenced on post-polypectomy surveillance? Which polyp factors confer higher future risk of CRC? Multiplicity Size Morphology Histological subtype (degree of villous component in adenomas) Dysplasia grade Colonic location Which patient factors confer higher future risk of CRC? Age Sex Body mass index (BMI) Smoking Family history of CRC Which colonoscopic factors confer higher future risk of CRC? Completion to caecum Bowel prep quality Endoscopist quality Enhanced detection technologies How should such factors be used to stratify risk and produce a composite surveillance strategy? Can a risk threshold be set to determine who requires surveillance?
At what interval(s) should surveillance be performed?
Ongoing surveillance Can the findings at index and first surveillance (S1) colonoscopies be used to determine who needs a second surveillance (S2)? When (and in whom) can surveillance be stopped? Relating to patient age/comorbidity Relating to colonoscopy findings
Special situations Are special considerations required for patients who are below the national bowel cancer screening lower age limit? How does the quality of index colonoscopy affect surveillance recommendations?
Other surveillance cohorts How should surveillance be performed following surgical resection of CRC? How should surveillance be performed following endoscopic resection of CRC? How can serrated polyp follow-up be incorporated into these guidelines? How should these guidelines integrate with the BSG/ACPGBI Large Non-Pedunculated Colorectal Polyp (LNPCP) guidelines? How should these guidelines integrate with the BSG/ACPGBI Hereditary CRC guidelines?
Other surveillance modalities Can CT colonography (CTC) be used for surveillance? Can faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) be used for surveillance? Can colon capsule be used for surveillance? How does the risk of cumulative radiation dose balance with CRC risk in CTC surveillance?
Other questions What are the risks associated with surveillance colonoscopy? What information should the patient receive and how should patients be involved in the surveillance process? How should polyp size be measured? How does optical diagnosis of polyp type align with the guidelines? How should the guidelines be implemented? What is the anticipated change in workload from these surveillance guidelines? What are the key unanswered research questions?

128 clinical questions were created from the long-list of guidelines questions (online supplementary appendix 1).

### Colonoscopy surveillance after colorectal cancer resection: recommendations of the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^38d59139]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance after colorectal cancer resection — We recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection of colon or rectal cancer receive their first surveillance colonoscopy 1 year after surgery (or 1 year after the clearing perioperative colonoscopy). We recommend that, after the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (i.e., 4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) and then 5 years (i.e., 9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy). Subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy; if neoplastic polyps are detected, the intervals between colonoscopies should be in accordance with published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals, and these intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.
