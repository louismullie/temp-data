## Question

Should statins be used for congestive heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether statins should be used for congestive heart failure, and if so, in whom and how to apply the evidence clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the heart failure phenotype and stage because HFrEF and HFpEF behave differently. Then, I should verify what the major randomized trials (CORONA and GISSI-HF) actually showed and what their limitations are. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile them with observational data. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility and competing risks. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline uncertainties that warrant future trials, making sure I double-check for any internal inconsistencies along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: congestive heart failure spans HFrEF and HFpEF, and the stage matters because prevention (stage A/B) differs from treatment of symptomatic disease (stage C/D). I should confirm that contemporary guidelines emphasize statins to prevent incident HF and adverse events in patients with MI/ACS or high ASCVD risk, rather than as a disease-modifying therapy for established HF per se, which aligns with the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA and ESC guidance [^115QkGK1] [^1175CZA9] [^114essUS].

> Wait, let me verify the pivotal trials before drawing conclusions. CORONA randomized 5,011 older adults with ischemic systolic HF to rosuvastatin 10 mg vs placebo and did not reduce the primary composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke (HR ~0.92, P = 0.12), though there was a signal for fewer hospitalizations; importantly, the population was elderly with advanced HF and high competing risks, which could blunt detection of modest ASCVD benefits [^111eVtMe] [^1116tXUC]. GISSI-HF, including ischemic and nonischemic HF, likewise showed no reduction in all-cause mortality or death/CV hospitalization with rosuvastatin 10 mg, confirming neutrality for hard outcomes in symptomatic HF cohorts [^113jGTPa]. Hold on, I should also check subgroup signals: a pooled reanalysis suggested fewer MIs in ischemic HF, indicating possible ASCVD event reduction even if overall outcomes were neutral, which is mechanistically coherent but hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^1123Ga14].

> I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from prevention to treatment. Meta-analyses of primary/secondary prevention statin trials show modest reductions in HF hospitalizations, supporting a preventive role, but these were not trials of established HF; thus, they cannot be used to claim disease-modifying benefit in symptomatic HF, and I should be explicit about that boundary to avoid misinterpretation [^112SypQG] [^112PiVAF]. But wait, what if statins help HFpEF specifically? Observational studies in HFpEF repeatedly associate statin use with lower mortality and fewer hospitalizations, yet these are nonrandomized and vulnerable to confounding, so I must not infer causality from association here [^114sVPzd] [^116uDk9D] [^116v7bwv].

> Next, I should review guideline synthesis to anchor practice. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline gives a Class I recommendation for statins in patients with recent or remote MI/ACS to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse CV events, which operationalizes statins for secondary prevention in ischemic cardiomyopathy and pre-HF stages rather than as HF therapy itself [^1175CZA9] [^112qvngk]. The ESC 2021 guideline similarly recommends statins to prevent or delay HF and HF hospitalizations in high-risk or CVD patients, again reflecting prevention rather than treatment of established HF [^114essUS]. For HFrEF due to ischemic heart disease who are not already on a statin, the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline allows consideration of moderate-intensity statin to reduce ASCVD events, which is a permissive, individualized stance rather than a mandate [^1112qa4z] [^111EAVdL].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility and competing risks, because this often explains discordant trial results. In HFrEF, cardiomyocyte loss, neurohormonal activation, and arrhythmic death dominate; pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects may be insufficient to alter the trajectory, and the proportion of statin-preventable ischemic events falls as non-atherothrombotic competing risks rise, limiting power and clinical impact in trials like CORONA and GISSI-HF [^116E47Kg] [^1116tXUC]. In contrast, HFpEF is more tightly linked to systemic inflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and atrial fibrillation; statins' anti-inflammatory and endothelial effects could theoretically modify this biology, but without randomized data, this remains hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^111TRinq] [^114f4PG8].

> I should double-check safety and drug–drug interactions in HF patients. Rosuvastatin was safe in CORONA and GISSI-HF without excess adverse events, supporting tolerability in advanced HF, though I need to remain vigilant for muscle symptoms and liver enzyme elevations as with any statin [^113jGTPa] [^112k7nPY]. Hold on, I should verify interactions: sacubitril/valsartan can increase exposure to atorvastatin via transporter inhibition, so if used together, I would monitor for statin-related adverse effects and consider dose adjustment or an alternative statin if clinically indicated [^115ari7C]. Ivabradine coadministration appears to have no clinically meaningful interaction with simvastatin, which is reassuring for common HF regimens [^115mau5N].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical approach, but let me first confirm I'm aligning with the evidence hierarchy. For established HFrEF, do not start a statin solely for HF; instead, use statins when there is a standard ASCVD indication such as prior MI/ACS, clinical ASCVD, or high-risk primary prevention by cholesterol guidelines, and consider moderate-intensity therapy if not already on treatment, recognizing the permissive language for ischemic HFrEF [^1175CZA9] [^1112qa4z] [^111EAVdL]. For HFpEF, I should avoid implying causality from observational data; however, if the patient meets primary prevention criteria (e.g., diabetes, CKD, or elevated LDL-C with intermediate risk), it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for ASCVD prevention while acknowledging the uncertain HF-specific benefit pending randomized trials [^111EAVdL] [^114f4PG8] [^111TRinq]. For patients already on statins at HF diagnosis, I should not discontinue, as there is no evidence of harm and potential ASCVD benefit may persist even if HF outcomes are unaffected [^117Aq7Gg].

> But wait, what about real-world signals that seem to contradict the RCTs? Large observational cohorts in HFrEF and HFpEF show lower mortality and fewer hospitalizations with statins, yet these designs cannot reliably adjust for unmeasured confounding; thus, they should be viewed as hypothesis-generating and not as justification to treat HF per se with statins outside standard indications [^116v7bwv] [^112gC7QN] [^112AWDJV]. I should confirm that my bottom line remains consistent: statins are not a disease-modifying therapy for established HF, but they remain important for ASCVD risk reduction in appropriate patients with HF, especially those with ischemic etiology or high-risk profiles [^11125HmX] [^111EAVdL].

> Finally, I need to ensure I articulate uncertainties and future directions. The most pressing gap is the lack of RCTs in HFpEF; given plausible biology and consistent observational signals, a dedicated randomized trial in HFpEF without ASCVD is warranted to test whether statins confer outcome benefits beyond atherosclerosis prevention, and until then, shared decision-making is prudent [^114f4PG8] [^111TRinq]. I should also note that while PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL-C and MACE in ASCVD populations, they have not shown reductions in HF hospitalizations, reinforcing that lipid-lowering alone may not translate into HF-specific benefits in advanced disease [^111q23Qm].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: statins should not be initiated solely to treat congestive heart failure; use them according to ASCVD prevention guidelines in patients with HF who have ischemic etiology or meet primary/secondary prevention criteria, avoid discontinuation if already prescribed, and recognize that HFpEF remains a promising but unproven area awaiting randomized evidence [^1175CZA9] [^111EAVdL] [^114f4PG8].

Statins are **not routinely recommended** for established heart failure without an atherosclerotic indication, as large RCTs (CORONA, GISSI-HF) [^113jGTPa] showed no reduction in mortality or HF hospitalizations [^notfound]. However, statins remain indicated for **primary and secondary prevention** of ASCVD in HF patients with high-risk features or ischemic etiology [^111EAVdL] [^1112qa4z], and should not be discontinued if already prescribed for valid indications [^117Aq7Gg]. Observational data suggest potential benefit in HFpEF [^114sVPzd] [^114f4PG8], but **RCTs are needed** before routine use in HFpEF is advised [^111UHhSK].

---

## Evidence from major randomized controlled trials

Two large RCTs specifically evaluated statins in HF: CORONA (rosuvastatin 10 mg) in 5,011 patients with ischemic systolic HF [^111pUR47] and GISSI-HF (rosuvastatin 10 mg) in 4,574 patients with chronic HF of any etiology [^113jGTPa]. Both showed **no significant reduction** in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or HF hospitalizations versus placebo, despite substantial LDL-C lowering [^notfound].

---

## Meta-analyses and observational studies

Meta-analyses largely align with RCTs, showing **no significant benefit** in established HF [^112SypQG]. Observational studies have reported associations between statin use and improved outcomes, particularly in HFpEF [^114sVPzd] [^114f4PG8]; however, these are limited by confounding and selection bias, and cannot establish causality [^116v7bwv].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Guidelines reflect the RCT evidence: statins are **not recommended solely for HF** in the absence of ASCVD indications [^11125HmX]. They remain indicated for primary and secondary prevention in HF patients with elevated ASCVD risk or ischemic etiology [^11125HmX] [^1112qa4z], and should not be discontinued if already prescribed for valid indications [^117Aq7Gg].

---

## Potential mechanisms of benefit and harm

Statins have pleiotropic effects (anti-inflammatory, endothelial, antithrombotic) that could theoretically benefit HF [^111ToZ8G], especially HFpEF [^111TRinq]. However, these effects have not translated into consistent clinical benefit in established HF, possibly due to competing risks (arrhythmia, renal failure, cancer) and the non-atherothrombotic nature of advanced HF [^1116tXUC].

---

## Safety considerations

Statins are generally safe in HF; CORONA and GISSI-HF reported no significant safety signals [^112k7nPY]. Clinicians should monitor for **myopathy and hepatic effects**, and consider drug interactions (e.g. with sacubitril/valsartan) [^115ari7C].

---

## Specific populations: HFpEF and non-ischemic HF

Evidence for statins in HFpEF is limited to observational studies suggesting improved outcomes [^114sVPzd] [^114f4PG8]; however, **RCTs are needed** before routine use is recommended [^114EZmap]. In non-ischemic HF, there is no RCT evidence supporting statins solely for HF management [^111eVtMe].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Established HF without ASCVD**: Statins are not recommended solely for HF management [^11125HmX].
- **HF with ASCVD or high risk**: Statins are indicated for primary/secondary prevention per ASCVD guidelines [^115QkGK1] [^1175CZA9].
- **HFpEF**: Routine statin use is not recommended pending RCT data [^11125HmX] [^114f4PG8].
- **Discontinuation**: Do not stop statins solely due to HF diagnosis if there is a valid ASCVD indication [^117Aq7Gg].

---

Statins are **not routinely indicated** for established HF without ASCVD, but remain important for ASCVD prevention in high-risk HF patients. Routine use in HFpEF awaits definitive RCTs [^111TRinq].

### Statin use in heart failure: a cause for concern? [^116rVW3a]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Statins are effective in the prevention of coronary events and the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. However, their efficacy and safety in patients with heart failure (HF) are unknown. In this review, we discuss the evidence for the efficacy and safety of statin therapy in patients with HF.

Methods

We reviewed all original English-language, peer-reviewed journal articles published from 1985 to 2005 obtained from a search of the MEDLINE database. We focused on evidence for the efficacy and safety of statins based on data from patients with HF enrolled in major statin trials, analysis of the impact of statin use in patients with HF, and randomized clinical trials examining the effects of statins on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HF.

Results

The major primary and secondary prevention statin trials largely excluded patients with HF. Statin use was also limited in randomized HF trials. Subgroup and retrospective analyses, and evidence from prospective cohort studies of statin use in patients with HF suggest statins improve cardiovascular prognosis in HF. The limited small randomized clinical trials also suggest statins improve symptoms, ejection fraction, and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with HF.

Conclusions

A growing weight of evidence suggests that statins have beneficial effects in HF. At this time, there is little evidence to support withdrawing or withholding statins from patients with HF. Ongoing randomized controlled trials that examine the efficacy of statin therapy in patients with HF should clarify the role of these agents in the context of HF.

### Statin therapy in heart failure: prognostic effects and potential mechanisms [^113nUgAt]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The use of statins as therapy for heart failure remains controversial. Nevertheless, many of the pleiotropic effects of statins are potentially applicable in heart failure. Although early statin trials excluded patients with heart failure because of concerns that lowering serum cholesterol could worsen an already poor prognosis, statin treatment has not been shown to have adverse effects on either cardiovascular events or mortality, and recent experimental and clinical studies have shown promise of benefit. Two large, ongoing trials should provide definitive evidence of the value of statin therapy for patients with heart failure. Pending those results, it is reasonable to follow current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines in this high-risk population.

### Effects of statin therapy on the development and progression of heart failure: mechanisms and clinical trials [^116QCxqL]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Statin therapy has been shown to effectively lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular events. Statins also appear to exert other favorable effects, including anti-inflammatory actions and improvement in endothelial function. Statin therapy may therefore yield important clinical benefits in patients with heart failure-a physiologic state characterized by systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

Methods and Results

This review summarizes basic and clinical investigations regarding the role of statin therapy in heart failure, focusing on potential mechanisms and preliminary clinical data. There is now extensive evidence suggesting that statins improve endothelial function, inhibit neurohormonal activation, restore autonomic balance, reduce inflammation, and prevent ventricular remodeling. Retrospective and small-scale prospective studies suggest that statins prevent the development of heart failure and reduce mortality in patients with established HF.

Conclusion

Preliminary evidence supports a role for statins in improving surrogate markers and clinical outcomes in ischemic and nonischemic heart failure. Large-scale randomized clinical trials are needed to definitively address this important topic.

Stage B HF — statins and prevention of heart failure: In multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs), statins have been shown to prevent adverse cardiovascular events in patients with an MI, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and with high cardiovascular risk, and these trials have also shown that statin therapy reduces the risk of incident HF; a meta-analysis of 6 RCTs of patients with an ACS showed that intensive statin therapy reduced hospitalizations for HF, and a larger collaborative meta-analysis of up to 17 major primary and secondary prevention RCTs showed that statins reduced HF hospitalization.

Statins are being hailed as the new aspirin — but are they beneficial for patients with heart failure?

### A statin in the treatment of heart failure? Controlled rosuvastatin multinational study in heart failure (CORONA): study design and baseline characteristics [^111pUR47]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Previous prospective outcome studies of statins have not provided any guidance on benefit-risk in patients with heart failure.

Aim

The primary objective is to determine whether rosuvastatin (10 mg) reduces the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (time to first event). The first secondary endpoint is all-cause mortality.

Methods

CORONA is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Briefly, men and women, aged ≥ 60 years with chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure of ischemic aetiology and ejection fraction ≤ 0.40 (NYHA class III and IV) or ≤ 0.35 (NYHA class II) were eligible if they were not using or in need of cholesterol lowering drugs.

Results

Mean age was 73 years (n = 5016; 24% women), with 37% in NYHA II and 62% in NYHA III, ejection fraction 0.31, total cholesterol 5.2 mmol/L. Sixty percent have a history of myocardial infarction, 63% hypertension, and 30% diabetes. Patients are well treated for heart failure with 90% on loop or thiazide diuretics, 42% aldosterone antagonists, 91% ACE inhibitor or AT-I blocker, 75% beta-blockers, and 32% digitalis.

Conclusion

CORONA is important for three main reasons: (1) A positive result is very important because of the high risk of the population studied, the increasing prevalence of elderly patients with chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure in our society, and the health economic issues involved. (2) If negative, new mechanistic questions about heart failure have to be raised. (3) If neutral we can avoid unnecessary polypharmacy.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to management of pre-HF, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate statins to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events in patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or ACS.

### Initiation of statins for primary prevention in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114EZmap]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Statins are highly effective cholesterol-lowering medications used for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)and are recommended for both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD. However, the benefits of statins in individuals with heart failure (HF) are uncertain and remain an area of ongoing debate. Patients with HF were excluded from many of the early landmark studies examining the efficacy of statins; and the 2 major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of statins specifically in participants with pre-existing HF did not improve outcomes. Indeed, in the CORONA (Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure) study, rosuvastatin failed to improve the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or fatal stroke compared to placebo over a median of 32.8 month; and in the GISSI-HF (Rosuvastatin in patients with chronic heart failure) trial, rosuvastatin failed to improve time to death, or time to death or cardiovascular hospitalization (coprimary endpoints) compared to placebo. Based on these studies, professional cardiology societies currently do not recommend statins for HF outside of other indications such as coronary artery disease.

Notably, the CORONA and GISSI-HF trials primarily included HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) participants. Consequently, the role of statins in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unclear. Given the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, statins have been suggested as a potentially important pharmacologic therapy for a condition that until recently has had few therapeutic options. Although several observational studies have suggested statins may be beneficial in HFpEF, inferences from these studies have been limited by sample size, narrow geographic representation, and limited attempts to address confounding by indication. Using the national Veterans Health Administration (VA) data, we sought to examine a large cohort of patients with HFpEF to generate high-level observational data on the association of statins with mortality and ASCVD events in HFpEF.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Special populations — symptomatic heart failure, hemodialysis, and pregnancy — are highlighted as requiring individualized care, and existing data regarding the use of statins in patients with symptomatic heart failure are equivocal because such patients have been largely excluded from randomized controlled trials; the CORONA and GISSI-HF trials directly addressed the use of statins in patients with symptomatic heart failure.

### Statin therapy in heart Failure with Preserved ejection fraction: the need for randomized evidence [^114f4PG8]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomized evidence investigating the role of statin therapy in chronic heart failure has been restricted to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The 2 major randomized clinical trials, namely CORONA (Rosuvastatin in Older Patients with Systolic Heart Failure)and GISSI HF (Effect of rosuvastatin in patients with chronic heart failure), conducted in patients with HFrEF with and without ischemic heart disease failed to demonstrate efficacy of statin therapy in reducing both atherothrombotic and heart failure related events. While trials in HFrEF have been largely neutral, the role of statins in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has not been systematically investigated. Most previous studies evaluating the relationship between statin use and outcomes in HFpEF have been observational in nature and are limited either by small sample size, inability to reliably differentiate the 2 main heart failure phenotypes (ie, HFrEF and HFpEF) and methodological limitations such as confounding by indication.

It is in this context that the study performed by Orkaby et algains importance as the investigators have performed comparative effectiveness research evaluating the role of statins in HFpEF using nationwide data from the Veterans Health Administration. After excluding patients with prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and baseline statin use, the authors identified 7,970 veterans with HFpEF, of which 47% were started on statin during the follow-up period. Over a median follow-up of 6 years, statin use was associated with a 22% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality. Additionally, statin use was associated with a lower hazard for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.74–0.84), all-cause hospitalizations (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.60–0.80), and heart failure related hospitalizations (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59–0.88).

### Drug insight: statins for nonischemic heart failure – evidence and potential mechanisms [^111ToZ8G]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

While 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, have a well-established in role in the treatment and prevention of ischemic coronary artery disease, their utility in the setting of heart failure (HF) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction remains under investigation. Although a reduction in LDL is the major effect of statin therapy, pleiotropic effects have been demonstrated, which could be responsible for the reduction in morbidity and mortality seen with statin use in patients with HF. Patients with both ischemic and nonischemic HF have been shown to have improved survival with statin therapy, and patients receiving statin therapy are less likely to develop HF. Studies have demonstrated that statins reduce inflammation, improve endothelial function, decrease thrombogenicity, and improve LV and autonomic function. In this Review, we present the literature supporting the pleiotropic effects of statin therapy in patients with HF or LV dysfunction, and discuss the mechanisms by which statins might elicit the improvements in morbidity and mortality seen in these patients.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

### Statin use in heart Failure: a rebirth? [^1165Wbxt]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the puzzling challenges in clinical cardiology has been the difficulty with regard to the demonstration of a benefit from statin therapy in patients with heart failure, even in those with ischemic heart failure. Nearly 15 years ago, the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA)and the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio del Sopravvivenza nell'Insufficienza cardiaca (GISSI-HF)trials evaluated statin therapy in heart failure populations. CORONA largely randomized those with ischemic heart failure while GISSI-HF included ischemic and nonischemic heart failure patients. Both studies were deemed negative and heralded an end to an otherwise long run of successful clinical trials evaluating statin therapy in a variety of clinical conditions.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1175CZA9]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Stage B (patients with pre-HF) — preventing clinical heart failure (HF) recommendations include: In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent MI and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with a recent or remote history of MI or ACS and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to reduce total mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF (Class 1, Level C-LD). In patients with LVEF ≤ 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level C-LD).

### Are the effects of drugs to prevent and to treat heart failure always concordant? The statin paradox and its implications for understanding the actions of antidiabetic medications [^116E47Kg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Most treatments for chronic heart failure are effective both in preventing its onset and reducing its progression. However, statins prevent the development of heart failure, but they do not decrease morbidity and mortality in those with established heart failure. This apparent discordance cannot be explained by an effect to prevent interval myocardial infarctions. Instead, it seems that the disease that statins were preventing in trials of patients with a metabolic disorder was different from the disease that they were treating in trials of chronic heart failure. The most common phenotype of heart failure in patients with obesity and diabetes is heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In this disorder, the anti-inflammatory effects of statins might ameliorate myocardial fibrosis and cardiac filling abnormalities, but these actions may have little relevance to patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), whose primary derangement is cardiomyocyte loss and stretch. These distinctions may explain why statins were ineffective in trials that focused on HFrEF, but have been reported to produce favourable effects in observational studies of HFpEF. Similarly, selective cytokine antagonists were ineffective in HFrEF, but have been associated with benefits in HFpEF. These observations may have important implications for our understanding of the effects of antihyperglycaemic medications. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have had neutral effects on heart failure events in people at risk for HFpEF, but have exerted deleterious actions in HFrEF. Similarly, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, which exert anti-inflammatory effects and reduce heart failure events in patients who are prone to HFpEF, may not be effective in HFrEF. The distinctions between HFrEF and HFpEF may explain why the effects of drugs on heart failure events in diabetes trials may not be relevant to their use in patients with systolic dysfunction.

### Statin use in heart Failure: a rebirth? [^1174Dumi]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Why might these data be strongly supportive of statin use in patients with heart failure when 2 large, well-executed randomized clinical trials failed to show a benefit?

First, we should acknowledge that the CORONA trial did support a "benefit trend" in patients randomized to statin therapy, albeit only an 8% relative risk reduction. But, one should always consider the impact of external generalizability on clinical trial data. There is always a potential for randomized trials to fail to select the appropriate patient groups to study leading either to erroneous conclusions or an inability to generalize to populations not well represented in the trials under evaluation. RWE supplements data from randomized trials by clarifying efficacy questions when narrowly defined trials fail to answer such question and RWE broadens our understanding with regard to efficacy and safety.

Second, the Intermountain study had a longer duration of follow-up than either the CORONA or GISSI-HF trials. The median follow-up was 4.5 years, substantially longer than the 2.73 years in GISSI-HF and modestly longer than the 3.9 years in CORONA. A substantial number of the Intermountain patients were followed for an even longer period. It is important to realize that statins work by preventing ASCVD-related clinical events, yet their benefit is dependent on adequate exposure (lipid reductions and anti-inflammatory actions) over time. The recent trends, including with GISSI-HF and CORONA, to design outcomes trials with a shorter (2–3 years) time period to evaluate an investigational product vs placebo or comparator potentially biases studies toward placebo or comparator, not the active product under evaluation if potential benefit is not allowed time to adequately accrue. Many trials now utilize models that incorporate event-driven goals with a minimum or fixed amount of follow-up time which allows for robust safety and efficacy determinations.

Third, some have criticized the CORONA and GISSI-HF trials as having an overly selective or biased participant type of enrollment. The broadly captured population under study by Intermountain reinforces the generalizability of the findings and helps clinicians understand how statin therapy is useful in heart failure.

### Impact of statin therapy in heart Failure Patients: results of a large real-world experience [^117L933H]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of statins (HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors) in patients with heart failure (HF) is controversial. In patients without HF, statins reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including HF-related events. In contrast, no benefit was observed in statin-treated HF patients in 2 randomized, controlled trials: CORONA (Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Study in Heart Failure) and GISSI-HF (Gruppo di Ricerca Heart Failure). However, issues with generalizability of these trials have been raised that may limit their applicability to general clinical practice.

Given strong evidence for the broad treatment benefits of statins for ASCVD reduction documented prior to CORONA and GISSI-HF, including from observational studies in HF, a major concern is raised for the possibility of selection bias against enrolling patients at high individual ASCVD risk and with statin-preventable event reduction in these randomized trials, which may have had an important impact on trial outcomes. Characteristics of concern in these trials include advanced age, advanced HF stages, low percentage of ischemic HF patients, low frequency of ischemic events, and high frequency of treatment discontinuations (eg, 31% in GISSI-HF). Furthermore, in clinical practice, treatment with statins continues to be common, that is, reported to be one-half or more of HF patients.

As a result of ongoing controversy and uncertainties about risk/benefit of statins in HF, current international guidelines provide a mixed message. They support selective use in high-risk patients with ASCVD but do not recommend universal application in otherwise statin-qualified patients. Therefore, given the uncertainty of benefit and safety of statins in HF patients, we analyzed the impact of statin therapy on outcomes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in a contemporary, large, single health care system.

### Statin treatment and clinical outcomes of heart failure among Africans: an inverse probability treatment weighted analysis [^116Nj3tt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) has become a major public health and clinical priority worldwide. 1 With the world's aging population coupled with epidemiological transition, the burden of HF is expected to rise in the foreseeable future. 1, 2 Statins are well known to reduce cardiovascular events, 3, 4 and remain key to preventing HF. More recently there have been some discussions about potential benefit of statins for treatment of established HF because of various pleiotropic (ie, non‐cholesterol‐lowering) effects. 5

Notwithstanding the benefit of statin therapy in prevention, the evidence for the role of statins in the treatment of established HF remains unclear. A number of nonrandomized studies and post hoc analyses of randomized control trials (RCTs) evaluating treatments other than statins suggest that statin therapy improves clinical outcomes in patients with HF, 6, 7 and benefits were also shown in several small RCTs identifying improved surrogate and mortality outcomes in HF. 8, 9, 10 In contrast, large RCTs — the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Study in Heart Failure (CORONA) study 11 and Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Insufficienza cardiaca (GISSI‐HF) 12 — which were undertaken to evaluate these promising findings, did not show significant outcome benefits in primary end points compared with placebo. The result from the CORONA trial, however, did show significant reductions in hospitalizations and improved survival in subgroups of patients with low galectin‐3 13 and N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide 14 levels on rosuvastatin therapy.

It is noteworthy that CORONA and GISSI‐HF evaluated the same drug (rosuvastatin) and dose (10 mg). Two subsequent meta‐analyses of RCTs 15, 16 that included the CORONA and GISSI‐HF trials found no significant outcome benefit of statin therapy versus placebo in HF. A closer examination of the management of RCTs included in the meta‐analyses shows that the researchers treated the statins as if they were a uniform class of drugs, which they are not, and thus failed to compare the effects of statin types utilized in each trial. Within the statins, there are 2 different types, which can be identified by their hydrophilicity or lipophilicity. Rosuvastatin (hydrophilic statin) evaluated in CORONA and GISSI‐HF is suggested to have played a critical part in the neutral outcome in both large RCTs and possibly skewed previous meta‐analyses toward the results of these 2 large trials.

### Impact of statin therapy in heart Failure Patients: results of a large real-world experience [^112AWDJV]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of statins in patients with heart failure (HF) is controversial. In patients without HF, statins reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, including HF-related events. However, in some large studies, no benefit was seen in statin-treated HF patients.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of statin therapy in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

Intermountain Healthcare medical records identified patients with a HF diagnosis and an ejection fraction of ≤ 40%. Patients prescribed and not prescribed a statin were compared for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (death, myocardial infarction, stroke) (median of 4.5 years follow-up). Statin use was defined as use at or after a HF diagnosis but at least 60 days before MACE or end of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the relationship between statin use and outcomes.

Results

A total of 15,010 patients (n = 9,641 [64%] on statins) were studied. Statin use was associated with more frequent ASCVD risk factors yet a lower risk of MACE risk (adjusted HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.51–0.56; P < 0.0001). Benefit was similar for primary and secondary prevention patients and for prior and new statin prescriptions. Using time-varying hazard ratio analysis, the longer the patient was on a statin, the greater the reduction in risk of MACE (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

These results suggest a potential benefit of selective statin use in the real-world management of HFrEF patients with ASCVD or at high ASCVD risk.

### Statin use in heart Failure: a rebirth? [^111eVtMe]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

GISSI-HF and CORONA

The GISSI-HF trial randomized 4,574 patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart failure to rosuvastatin 10 mg daily or placebo for 3.9 years. The primary end points were time to death and time to death or admission for heart failure. The hazard ratios (HRs) for the time to death was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.898–1.122, P = 0.943) and time to death or admission for heart failure was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.908–1.112, P = 0.903). The CORONA trial randomized 5,011 participants with ischemic heart failure to rosuvastatin 10 mg or placebo for a median time of 32.8 months with a primary outcome composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and/or nonfatal stroke. The primary end point HR was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83–1.02, P = 0.12). While the primary end point was not significantly reduced, there were fewer hospitalizations in those randomized to rosuvastatin.

Multiple hypotheses have been advanced about why statin therapy failed to reduce significantly the measured primary end points in both trials but especially CORONA. Perhaps it was a type 2 statistical error due to an inadequate sample size or number of accrued events. Others have suggested that the recruited population was too old and/or that symptomatic advanced heart failure may produce clinical sequela which cannot be mitigated by statin therapy. Regardless, most clinicians remained perplexed as to why statin therapy was not demonstrated as beneficial in the heart failure population.

### Statins and exercise training response in Heart failure patients: insights from HF-ACTION [^112P64m3]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess for a treatment interaction between statin use and exercise training (ET) response.

Background

Recent data suggest that statins may attenuate ET response, but limited data exist in patients with heart failure (HF).

Methods

HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) was a randomized trial of 2,331 patients with chronic HF with ejection fraction ≤ 35% who were randomized to usual care with or without ET. We evaluated whether there was a treatment interaction between statins and ET response for the change in quality of life and aerobic capacity (peak oxygen consumption and 6-min walk distance) from baseline to 3 months. We also assessed for a treatment interaction among atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin and change in these endpoints with ET. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed for each endpoint, adjusting for baseline covariates.

Results

Of 2,331 patients in the HF-ACTION trial, 1,353 (58%) were prescribed statins at baseline. Patients treated with statins were more likely to be older men with ischemic HF etiology but had similar use of renin angiotensin system blockers and beta-blockers. There was no evidence of a treatment interaction between statin use and ET on changes in quality of life or exercise capacity, nor was there evidence of differential association between statin type and ET response for these endpoints (all p values > 0.05).

Conclusions

In a large chronic HF cohort, there was no evidence of a treatment interaction between statin use and short-term change in aerobic capacity and quality of life with ET. These findings contrast with recent reports of an attenuation in ET response with statins in a different population, highlighting the need for future prospective studies.

### The effect of statin therapy on heart failure events: a collaborative meta-analysis of unpublished data from major randomized trials [^112SypQG]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The effect of statins on risk of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and HF death remains uncertain. We aimed to establish whether statins reduce major HF events.

Methods and Results

We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled endpoint statin trials from 1994 to 2014. Collaborating trialists provided unpublished data from adverse event reports. We included primary- and secondary-prevention statin trials with > 1000 participants followed for > 1 year. Outcomes consisted of first non-fatal HF hospitalization, HF death and a composite of first non-fatal HF hospitalization or HF death. HF events occurring < 30 days after within-trial myocardial infarction (MI) were excluded. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with fixed-effects meta-analyses. In up to 17 trials with 132 538 participants conducted over 4.3 [weighted standard deviation (SD) 1.4] years, statin therapy reduced LDL-cholesterol by 0.97 mmol/L (weighted SD 0.38 mmol/L). Statins reduced the numbers of patients experiencing non-fatal HF hospitalization (1344/66 238 vs. 1498/66 330; RR 0.90, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.84–0.97) and the composite HF outcome (1234/57 734 vs. 1344/57 836; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99) but not HF death (213/57 734 vs. 220/57 836; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.17). The effect of statins on first non-fatal HF hospitalization was similar whether this was preceded by MI (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68–1.11) or not (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84–0.98).

Conclusion

In primary- and secondary-prevention trials, statins modestly reduced the risks of non-fatal HF hospitalization and a composite of non-fatal HF hospitalization and HF death with no demonstrable difference in risk reduction between those who suffered an MI or not.

### Association between use of statins and mortality in patients with heart failure and ejection fraction of ≥ 50 [^114sVPzd]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is poorly understood, but may involve a systemic proinflammatory state. Therefore, statins might improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction defined as ≥ 50%.

Methods and Results

Of 46 959 unique patients in the prospective Swedish Heart Failure Registry, 9140 patients had heart failure and ejection fraction ≥ 50% (age 77 ± 11 years, 54.0% women), and of these, 3427 (37.5%) were treated with statins. Propensity scores for statin treatment were derived from 40 baseline variables. The association between statin use and primary (all-cause mortality) and secondary (separately, cardiovascular mortality, and combined all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization) end points was assessed with Cox regressions in a population matched 1:1 based on age and propensity score. In the matched population, 1-year survival was 85.1% for statin-treated versus 80.9% for untreated patients (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.89; P < 0.001). Statins were also associated with reduced cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.98; P = 0.026) and composite all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003).

Conclusions

In heart failure with ejection fraction ≥ 50%, the use of statins was associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms should be evaluated and the effects tested in a randomized trial.

Can SGLT‐2 Inhibitors Be Beneficial in the Treatment of HF?

Results from current CVOTs show promise for SGLT‐2 inhibitors in the prevention of HF in patients with T2D across a spectrum of cardiovascular risk. Whether SGLT‐2 inhibitors can be beneficial in the treatment of HF remains to be elucidated; efficacy in the prevention of HF does not necessarily translate to efficacy in the treatment of HF — the GISSI‐HF (GISSI Heart Failure) and CORONA (Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure) trials exemplify this notion. Despite statins being the cornerstone pharmacological intervention in the prevention of heart disease, in both the GISSI‐HF and CORONA trials, rosuvastatin failed to show benefit in patients with chronic HF. 65, 66

### Effect of rosuvastatin in patients with chronic heart failure (the GISSI-HF trial): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113jGTPa]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Large observational studies, small prospective studies and post-hoc analyses of randomised clinical trials have suggested that statins could be beneficial in patients with chronic heart failure. However, previous studies have been methodologically weak. We investigated the efficacy and safety of the statin rosuvastatin in patients with heart failure.

Methods

We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 326 cardiology and 31 internal medicine centres in Italy. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with chronic heart failure of New York Heart Association class II-IV, irrespective of cause and left ventricular ejection fraction, and randomly assigned them to rosuvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 2285) or placebo (n = 2289) by a concealed, computerised telephone randomisation system. Patients were followed up for a median of 3.9 years (IQR 3.0–4.4). Primary endpoints were time to death, and time to death or admission to hospital for cardiovascular reasons. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00336336.

Findings

We analysed all randomised patients. 657 (29%) patients died from any cause in the rosuvastatin group and 644 (28%) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.00 [95.5% CI 0.898–1.122], p = 0.943). 1305 (57%) patients in the rosuvastatin group and 1283 (56%) in the placebo group died or were admitted to hospital for cardiovascular reasons (adjusted HR 1.01 [99% CI 0.908–1.112], p = 0.903). In both groups, gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequent adverse reaction (34 [1%] rosuvastatin group vs 44 [2%] placebo group).

Interpretation

Rosuvastatin 10 mg daily did not affect clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure of any cause, in whom the drug was safe.

### Comparison of effects of statin use on mortality in patients with heart failure and preserved versus reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^116uDk9D]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Randomized trials showed no survival benefit with statin therapy in heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Whether these results are generalizable to HF patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or with mid-range ejection fraction is unclear. In a cohort of 13,440 patients with HF, 9,903 (73.7%) were treated with statins. The association between statin use and all-cause mortality was assessed with Cox proportional hazard regression models and survival time inverse probability weighting propensity scores analyses. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error variance were applied to estimate the rate ratios (RR) for hospitalization. The association between statin treatment and clinical outcomes differed by ejection fraction group. In patients with HFpEF, statin use was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.81, p < 0.001; average treatment effect [ATE] 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.84, p = 0.007) and reduced all-cause hospitalization (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.89, p < 0.001). In contrast, in patients with HFrEF, no significant association was observed between statin use and mortality (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.0, p = 0.054; ATE 0.41, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.93, p = 0.11) or hospitalization (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.04, p = 0.17). Similarly, in patients with mid-range ejection fraction, there was no significant association with reduced mortality (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95, p = 0.02, ATE 0.3, 95% CI -0.84 to 1.43, p = 0.61) or hospitalization (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.27, p = 0.44). In conclusion, statin use was associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with HFpEF but not in patients with HFrEF or mid-range ejection fraction.

### Impact of statin therapy in heart Failure Patients: results of a large real-world experience [^112k7nPY]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Although HF patients were poorly represented in early statin trials, these observational studies suggested safety and benefit. However, disappointing results followed in 2 randomized, controlled trials, CORONA and GISSI-HF. Although no adverse safety signals were observed, cardiovascular benefit was not demonstrated. The CORONA trial enrolled 5,011 patients with ischemic systolic HF and age 60 years or more to rosuvastatin 10 mg daily or placebo and followed them for an average of 33 months. Expected reductions in LDL-C were seen, and no adverse safety concerns were observed. However, a significant reduction in the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke was not achieved (HR: 0.92; CI: 0.83–1.02; P = 0.12) although a reduction in cardiovascular hospitalizations was noted. The subsequent GISSI-HF trial enrolled 4,574 patients with HF classes 2 to 4 of nonischemic or ischemic etiology and with or without reduced ejection fraction and, similarly, randomized them to rosuvastatin 10 mg daily or placebo. Over a follow-up of 3.9 years, the expected reductions in LDL-C occurred, and no adverse safety concerns were raised, but neither death nor the combination of death and cardiovascular hospitalization was reduced.

To what extent these results are generalizable to general clinical practice has been a source of controversy. For example, a 2019 systematic review of 17 studies, including 2 randomized clinical trials and 15 prospective cohort studies comprising 88,100 patients, provided evidence of statin benefit for patients with HF, including 18 to 23% reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization. Our large real-world observational experience supports this proposed benefit of statins in HF.

Lee et alassessed the impact of statin therapy in patients with HF across the spectrum of ejection fractions treated by Kaiser Permanente in California. Statins were beneficial in HFpEF patients, but the trend to reduction in mortality did not reach significance in the HFrEF cohort (HR: 0.86; P = 0.054); rate ratio for HF hospitalization was 0.92. Their population differed from ours with a smaller proportion of whites (49% vs 89%) and with a smaller percentage with coronary artery disease (CAD)/ASCVD (30.5% vs 57.4%), followed for a shorter time (2.5 years). These differing characteristics may explain, at least in part, the differing extent of statin impact on outcomes.

Endpoints and Impact From Associated Statin Use

The Intermountain data are extremely impressive and provocative, and expand what we know about statin use in heart failure beyond the evidence of CORONA and GISSI-HF. There is likely some degree of bias that cannot be accounted for statistically despite multivariable modeling and best efforts by the investigators. Nonetheless, these data demonstrate a consistent reduction across cardiac, cerebrovascular, and heart failure-associated clinical events and lower overall mortality in those treated with statins. These data add a RWE perspective to a growing body of evidence supporting a benefit from statin use in heart failure patients.

### Prevention and management of chronic heart failure in management of asymptomatic patients [^111sdVqN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Symptomatic heart failure is preceded by a somewhat prolonged asymptomatic stage in many patients. The number of patients with asymptomatic heart dysfunction is about 4-fold greater than the number of patients with clinically overt heart failure. Pharmacologic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers (in particular carvedilol) of asymptomatic patients with systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can prevent or delay the occurrence of symptoms and reduce mortality in the long term. Thus, it would be of utmost importance to recognize and appropriately treat these patients before they develop heart failure symptoms. The cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic heart dysfunction in the general population and in cohorts at risk has not been extensively evaluated. A normal electrocardiogram has a high negative predictive value in patients at risk. Echocardiography is the best tool for diagnosis and characterization of heart dysfunction, but extensive use is limited by availability and cost. Natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) are very sensitive markers of heart dysfunction and volume overload, and their measurement has been proposed as a first-line test to select patients who need echocardiography. The definition of the etiology of LV dysfunction — in particular, of the ischemic etiology — has prognostic and therapeutic implications. In addition to revascularization, pharmacologic treatment with antiplatelets and statins is helpful in preventing new ischemic events and the development of heart failure. The prevention, or at least the delay, of clinical manifestations of heart failure is strongly related to an effective approach to the asymptomatic stage. Therefore, it is important to educate the entire medical community, particularly physicians in the primary care setting, about recognition and treatment of these patients.

### Rationale and design of the GISSI heart failure trial: a large trial to assess the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and rosuvastatin in symptomatic congestive heart failure [^1113mh4m]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The GISSI Heart Failure project is a large-scale, randomized, double-blind study designed to investigate the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and rosuvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic heart failure.

Methods and Results

Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV heart failure, already receiving optimized recommended therapy, will be recruited in a nation-wide network of more than 300 cardiology and internal medicine services to be randomly allocated to treatment with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (1 g daily) or the corresponding placebo. Patients with no clear indication or contraindication to cholesterol-lowering therapy will be further randomized to receive low-dose rosuvastatin (10 mg daily) or placebo. According to data available in heart failure registries, it is expected that 70% of the patients will be suitable to enter both components of the trial, which assume the same co-primary endpoints: (a) 15% reduction of all-cause mortality and (b) 20% reduction of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalizations. The trial is event-driven and will continue either until at least 1252 deaths have been recorded or a reduction of all-cause mortality will satisfy the significance boundaries, which have been established to stop the study. The recruitment of the planned sample size of approximately 7000 patients randomized in the n-3 PUFA trial is expected to be completed within 18 months from the trial start. As of February 29, 2004, 4624 heart failure patients have been included in the trial.

Conclusion

The GISSI-HF project, with its protocol articulated into two independent randomization schemes, has the aim and the power to verify the hypothesis that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and rosuvastatin can favorably modify the prognosis of patients with symptomatic heart failure.

Primary prevention and pre–heart failure care: Primary prevention is important for those at risk for HF (stage A) or pre-HF (stage B), and stages of HF were revised to emphasize the terminologies of "at-risk for HF" for stage A and "pre-HF" for stage B; healthy lifestyle habits are recommended, blood pressure should be controlled, and SGLT2i are recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and either established cardiovascular disease or at high cardiovascular risk. Natriuretic peptide biomarker–based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent development of left ventricular dysfunction or new-onset HF (pre-HF, stage B), validated multivariable risk scores can also be useful to estimate subsequent risk of incident HF, and in asymptomatic patients with LVEF ≤ 40% (pre-HF, stage B), ACEi, ARB, evidence-based beta blockers, statins, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are recommended in certain patients.

### Do statins reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in patients with heart failure? A pooled individual-level reanalysis of CORONA and GISSI-HF [^1123Ga14]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Current guidelines do not explicitly recommend statin use in heart failure (HF). Relatively low numbers of atherothrombotic events among HF patients, in the context of their elevated competing risks for non-atherothrombotic causes of death, may have prevented previous analyses of clinical trials from detecting a benefit for statins. We pooled data from two landmark trials of HF patients not on statin therapy randomized to rosuvastatin 10mg daily vs. placebo, CORONA and GISSI-HF, in order to improve our power to detect statistically significant differences in atherothrombotic events. We also accounted for competing risks from other causes of death.

Methods and Results

We used competing risks analyses to evaluate atherothrombotic events in the context of death from other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes. We also performed traditional Cox survival analyses of the same data with the intention that these statistical approaches would be complementary. CORONA participants (n = 5011, median follow-up 32.8months) were older and sicker than GISSI-HF participants (n = 4574, median follow-up 46.9months) by design. Rosuvastatin decreased risk for myocardial infarction (MI) among CORONA and GISSI-HF participants with ischaemic aetiology of HF (hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.66–0.99, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between rosuvastatin and placebo in risks for stroke or death from other causes.

Conclusion

This individual-level reanalysis of two landmark trials demonstrates a small but statistically significant decreased risk for MI among patients with ischaemic HF randomized to rosuvastatin vs. placebo. Rosuvastatin appears to be effective in preventing MI in ischaemic HF patients not already on statins.

### Initiation of statins for primary prevention in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111TRinq]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Potential mechanisms

The mechanisms for which statins may be beneficial in HFpEF are not yet clear. Our findings were among adults without baseline ASCVD and were consistent across pooled-cohort, 10-year risk categories. This suggests that the benefits of statins for HFpEF go beyond its impact on atherosclerosis. Statins have multiple biological effects — although they are principally used as cholesterol-lowering agents, they also have pleiotropic effects with capacity to reduce inflammation. This is relevant for HFpEF because its pathophysiology is closely linked to systemic inflammation, with consequent derangements in microvasculature, nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate availability, and changes in titin phosphorylation. Based on myocardial biopsies from individuals with HFpEF, statins lower levels of myocardial nitrotyrosine (a marker of oxidant stress), reduce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and resting tension, and increase myocardial protein kinase G activity. Statins are also known to lower risk of atrial fibrillationwhich leads to remodeling of the left atrium and is an important pathophysiologic feature of HFpEF. This could represent another etiologic mechanism.

It is also possible that the impact of statins is mediated through physical parameters such as frailty, which is highly prevalent in HFpEF and is closely intertwined with the pathophysiology of HFpEF. Taken together, our work here further supports the need for additional mechanistic studies that include detailed cardiovascular imaging data and biomarkers, as well as extracardiac markers of aging such as physical frailty. We additionally call for a trial specifically examining the effect of statins in adults with HFpEF without prior ASCVD. Of note, statins have a unique mechanism of action compared to other guideline-directed agents for HFpEF, most of which were not in routine use for HFpEF during the study period. This provides additional rationale for statins to serve as add-on therapy for patients with HFpEF, though more evidence is needed.

Clinical implications and future directions

The current joint society guidelines on the management of HF recommend statins in patients with a history of prior or recent MI to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse CVD events. Notably, in prevalent HF, there are no specific recommendations for the primary prevention of future adverse events within the current guidelines. This is largely based on the neutral findings of the CORONA and GISSI-HF trials for HFrEF. However, the lack of RCTs testing statins in HFpEF precludes any meaningful recommendations for this unique HF phenotype. Our study has important implications on a 2-decade search for a therapy to improve survival in HFpEF; in particular, it lays the groundwork for trials to examine the benefits of statins in HFpEF, which may shape future clinical practice.

### Statin therapy is associated with improved survival in ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure [^112pNyUN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to investigate the impact of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy in patients with advanced heart failure (HF).

Background

Although statins are known to reduce mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD), the impact of statin therapy in patients with HF has not been well studied. Both the potential risks and benefits of statins in HF have been described.

Methods

We studied a cohort of 551 patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction [EF] ≤ 40%) referred to a single university center for clinical management and/or transplant evaluation. Survival without the necessity of urgent heart transplantation was determined.

Results

The patients' mean age was 52 ± 13 years; mean EF was 25 ± 7%. Forty-five percent of the cohort had CAD, and 45% were receiving statin therapy, including 73% and 22% of CAD and non-CAD patients with HF, respectively. Patients receiving statins were significantly older and more likely to be male, with higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. The EF and cholesterol levels were similar between treated and non-treated patients. Statin use was associated with improved survival without the necessity of urgent transplantation in both non-ischemic and ischemic HF patients (91% vs. 72%, p < 0.001 and 81% vs. 63%, p < 0.001 at one-year follow-up, respectively). After risk adjustment for age, gender, CAD, cholesterol, diabetes, medications, hemoglobin, creatinine, and New York Heart Association functional class, statin therapy remained an independent predictor of improved survival (hazard ratio 0.41 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.94).

Conclusions

Statin therapy is associated with improved survival in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic HF. Randomized trials are needed for confirmation of a therapeutic benefit.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^116axqAR]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Let us consider the four placebo-controlled trials testing rosuvastatin. They were conducted in patients with post-infarct left ventricular dysfunction, chronic kidney failure and in primary prevention. Regarding the first two RCTs, CORONA and GISSI-HF already discussed above with the RCTs testing n-3, some experts argue that the failure of rosuvastatin to reduce the risk in these specific patients was not surprising because almost no CVD complications or deaths were expected to fall into the category that statins could prevent, for example, myocardial ischemia or infarction and stroke. Actually, as shown in Table 2 in the CORONA article, this view is totally wrong, as 588 and 554 ischemic coronary events were recorded in the two groups in CORONA. In addition, 283 and 272 cardiac deaths occurred in ischemic coronary events against only 191 and 193 deaths due to worsening heart failure, a type of death not expected to be prevented by the statin. In other words and in accordance with the cholesterol-statin theory, the risk of most of these ischemic events should have been reduced by the statin treatment. Thus, unexpectedly the statin failed in CORONA despite striking reduction of cholesterol levels as well as the inflammatory marker CRP!

In fact, the large numbers of ischemic complications in CORONA were not unexpected - neither the sponsors nor the investigators were naive enough to launch a very expensive trial without the hope that rosuvastatin will be effective - because 100% of the recruited patients were survivors of a previous myocardial infarction and thus expected to be at high risk of recurrence, the best situation in theory to prescribe a statin and demonstrate its effectiveness. The fact that they also had various degrees of post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction and some symptoms of chronic heart failure does not change the problem, as perfectly understood by the sponsor when launching the trial. As a matter of fact, when looking at the effects of rosuvastatin in function of the severity of the symptoms of chronic heart failure, there was again no difference between the groups: those with mild heart failure (NYHA class II) symptoms also had no reduction of the primary endpoint: 219 vs. 217 events in the placebo group.

### Initiation of statins for primary prevention in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111UHhSK]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Among Veterans with HFpEF without known CVD, statins were associated with reduced all-cause mortality and MACE. These findings should be confirmed in a future RCT.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Statins, a readily accessible and highly effective class of lipid-lowering therapy for primary prevention of ASCVD, may lower the risk of adverse outcomes in adults who have HFpEF without concurrent ASCVD.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Statins could be considered for prevention of mortality, MACE, and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF. Future RCTs are needed to support these findings.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115mau5N]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Heart failure medication — ivabradine use with statins is characterized as follows: Ivabradine is a specific inhibitor of the I f current in the sinoatrial node and, unlike β-blockers, does not modify myocardial contractility and intracardiac conduction. In 2015, ivabradine was approved in the United States to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with stable, symptomatic, chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction ≤ 35%) who are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate ≥ 70 bpm and either are on maximally tolerated doses of β-blockers or have a contraindication to a β-blocker. Although ivabradine is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4-mediated oxidation, specific DDI studies have shown no clinically significant effect of ivabradine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of simvastatin, though available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on combination therapy with statins are limited at this time.

### The effect of statin therapy on heart failure events: a collaborative meta-analysis of unpublished data from major randomized trials [^112PiVAF]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Our analysis was designed to investigate the effect of statin therapy on the development of HF and so could not address statins' potential effect on repeat HF hospitalization in those with existing HF. However, the effect size we observed with statins was similar to that observed in the CORONA trial which compared rosuvastatin to placebo in patients with established systolic HF [5011 participants of whom 1291 were hospitalized (2408 events) for HF, HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82–1.02]. In CORONA, statin therapy significantly reduced both the risk of repeat HF admissions and the overall number of admissions.

Strengths of this meta-analysis include the following: first, it represents the largest systematic analysis evaluating the effect of statin therapy on HF events with over 132 000 participants and over 570 000 patient-years of follow-up for the main analyses. This provided power to detect potentially modest effects. Second, unpublished data were collected allowing us to provide information on homogenous HF endpoints, as far as possible. And third, access to trial data allowed harmonization of data and assessment of relevant subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Potential weaknesses include the following: first, the analyses were conducted with summary-level data, not with individual participant data, and we combined trial-specific RRs because not all trials could provide HRs for the outcomes of interest. Second, HF outcomes were not pre-specified in many trials which may have affected the quality of the data available for post hoc analysis, and it was not possible to use a uniform definition for HF events due to the nature of the data; however, limited heterogeneity for all the analyses provides some confidence that any such variation did not introduce systematic bias. Third, data were missing for some of the HF endpoints and not all major statin trials could be included. Fourth, we were unable to conduct a formal statistical comparison of the HF risks of participants who did and did not experience a within-trial MI prior to developing HF, but the large degree of overlap for these respective results strongly suggests that there was no difference between them. Fifth, we did not have access to data regarding the likely aetiology of HF though, based on the characteristics of the trial participants, relatively few are likely to have developed preserved ejection HF. Sixth, we were unable to compare outcomes in men and women.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis of data from major trials demonstrated that statin therapy modestly reduced the risk of non-fatal HF hospitalization and the composite outcome of HF death and non-fatal hospitalization over 4.3 years.

### Statin therapy and clinical outcomes in heart failure: a propensity-matched analysis [^1128Bejh]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The influence of statin therapy in heart failure (HF) has been of considerable interest. The objective of this study was to determine if statins are associated with improved outcomes in patients discharged after hospitalization for HF.

Methods

Patients admitted to Ontario hospitals between 1999 and 2001 with HF were identified in the Enhanced Feedback For Effective Cardiac Treatment study. Propensity score methods were used to assess 5-year outcomes in the overall cohort as well as in 4 subgroups: those with coronary artery disease (CAD) or without (NoCAD), and those with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) or with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). Of the 6451 HF patients, 1121 were discharged with a prescription for a statin.

Results

In propensity analysis stratified on matched pairs in a Cox proportional hazards model, statins were associated with improved mortality at 5 years overall (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, P = 0.05) and in those with CAD (HR 0.79, P = 0.008). Similarly, statins were associated with lower risk of the combined end point in the CAD group (HR 0.85, P = 0.045).

Conclusions

Among patients with HF discharged from hospital, statin therapy was associated with improved outcomes, particularly in patients with CAD. Stratification by ejection fraction did not differentially impact the effect of statins in patients with HF.

### Effect of high-dose atorvastatin on hospitalizations for heart failure: subgroup analysis of the treating to new targets (TNT) study [^112vKYoo]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Statins reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients, but their potential benefit as treatment for heart failure (HF) is less clear.

Methods and Results

Patients (n = 10,001) with stable coronary disease were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin 80 or 10 mg/d and followed up for a median of 4.9 years. A history of HF was present in 7.8% of patients. A known ejection fraction < 30% and advanced HF were exclusion criteria for the study. A predefined secondary end point of the study was hospitalization for HF. The incidence of hospitalization for HF was 2.4% in the 80-mg arm and 3.3% in the 10-mg arm (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.94; P = 0.0116). The treatment effect of the higher dose was more marked in patients with a history of HF: 17.3% versus 10.6% in the 10- and 80-mg arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.88; P = 0.009). Among patients without a history of HF, the rates of hospitalization for HF were much lower: 1.8% in the 80-mg group and 2.0% in the 10-mg group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.16; P = 0.34). Only one third of patients hospitalized for HF had evidence of preceding angina or myocardial infarction during the study period. Blood pressure was almost identical during follow-up in the treatment groups.

Conclusions

Compared with a lower dose, intensive treatment with atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease significantly reduces hospitalizations for HF. In a post hoc analysis, this benefit was observed only in patients with a history of HF. The mechanism accounting for this benefit is unlikely to be due primarily to a reduction in interim coronary events or differences in blood pressure.

### Association is not causation: treatment effects cannot be estimated from observational data in heart failure [^116v7bwv]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Statins

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

Two large RCTs showed a neutral effect of rosuvastatin on mortality in HFrEF (one trial included a small number of patients with HFpEF). Sixteen non-randomized studies reported 17 estimates of the 'effect' of statin treatment in HFrEF. Of these, 14 reported an association between statin use and better outcome, whereas only three found no association, (Table 5).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

The use of statins has not been evaluated in a randomized trial in patients with HFpEF, therefore, no relevant non-randomized studies were identified.

Mixed/unspecified heart failure phenotype

One large statin trial included patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF and showed no effect of treatment on mortality. Eleven observational studies reported 12 estimates of the 'effect' of a statin in patients with a mixture of HFrEF and HFpEF phenotypes, or where EF was not specified. Of these, 11 reported an association between statin use and better outcome, with only one describing no relationship between treatment and mortality(Table 5).

Digoxin

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

A single RCT, the Digitalis Investigators Group (DIG) trial, showed that, in sinus rhythm, digoxin had a neutral effect on death but reduced the risk of HF hospitalization. Nine non-randomized studies reported 10 estimates of the 'effect' of digoxin treatment in HFrEF, with five concluding digoxin was harmful, four reporting a neutral effect, and one suggesting digoxin was beneficial(Table 6).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

A single randomized trial of modest size, the DIG ancillary trial in HFpEF (n = 988), showed no effect of digoxin on mortality in patients with HFpEF in sinus rhythm, although the estimate of the effect of treatment was not robust because of limited power. Four observational studies were identified, one suggesting that non-randomized digoxin treatment was beneficial, and three showing a neutral association between treatment and mortality, (Table 6).

Mixed/unspecified heart failure phenotype

The combined main and ancillary DIG trials showed a neutral effect of digoxin on mortality. Fourteen observational studies reported effect estimates for digoxin in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in combination, or where EF was not specified. These studies reported 16 estimates of 'treatment-effect'. Seven found an association between the use of digoxin and a higher mortality, seven were neutral, and two suggested better outcomes associated with digoxin use, (Table 6).

### An economic evaluation of rosuvastatin treatment in systolic heart failure: evidence from the CORONA trial [^115nSmvo]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Clinical trial

The CORONA trial assessed the effects of rosuvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic systolic heart failure. Patients were allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to 10 mg rosuvastatin or matching placebo. Patients were recruited at 378 centres in 21 countries. The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee at each of the participating hospitals, and patients provided written informed consent. An economic analysis plan was drafted in advance of the data being released. The plan was developed using a slice of treatment-blinded trial data.

Details of the trial have been reported elsewhere, but in short patients aged 60 years or older with chronic symptomatic (NYHA functional class II–IV) heart failure of ischaemic aetiology and with an ejection fraction of ≤ 0.40 (≤ 0.35 if NYHA class II) were included. Patients already on a statin (or other lipid lowering drug) or considered by their own doctor to need (or have a contraindication to) a statin were not randomized. Lipid lowering treatment could not be stopped to make a patient eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, patients who had been treated with a statin previously were not eligible for randomization until 6 months after withdrawal of the statin.

The primary trial outcome was the composite of CV mortality, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke, analysed as time to the first event. The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, any coronary event, CV mortality, and number of hospitalizations (for CV causes, unstable angina, and worsening heart failure).

### Relation of statin therapy to risk of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction [^112LXiJL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that statin therapy reduces hospitalizations for heart failure (HF). However, few data exist regarding the role of statins in preventing HF after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In addition, the potential impact of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) and coexisting functional mitral regurgitation (MR) on the efficacy of statin therapy was not considered. We prospectively studied 1,563 patients with AMI. The primary endpoint was readmission for the treatment of HF. The effect of statin therapy initiated before hospital discharge was evaluated using a Cox model, adjusting for clinical variables, a propensity score for statin therapy, LVEF, and MR grade. Patients with recurrent infarctions were censored. Statins were prescribed in 1,048 patients (67.1%) before hospital discharge. During a median follow-up of 17 months, admissions for HF were lower in patients receiving statins (6.5% vs 14.8%; unadjusted hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.63, p < 0.0001). In a multivariable Cox model, statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction of hospitalization for HF (HR 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.89, p = 0.009). There was a significant interaction between MR and statin therapy (p = 0.039), such that the beneficial effect of statins on HF hospitalizations was most pronounced in patients without concomitant MR and absent in patients with hemodynamically significant MR. In conclusion, in patients with AMI statin therapy initiated before hospital discharge significantly reduces subsequent hospitalizations for HF. The effect of statins is driven largely by the reduction in events in patients without concomitant hemodynamically significant MR.

### Initiation of statins for primary prevention in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction [^11659VrL]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 7,970 Veterans with prevalent HFpEF, free of ASCVD at baseline, and who were regular users of VA care, nearly half were initiated on statin therapy over a mean follow-up of 6 years. New statin use was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality, MACE, and both all-cause and HF hospitalizations (Central Illustration). This has important implications on a 2-decade search for a therapy to improve survival in HFpEF; in particular, it strengthens the foundation for a potential RCT to examine the effect of statins in HFpEF.

Central Illustration
Association of New Statin Use With All-Cause Mortality, MACE, and Hospitalizations in Veterans HFpEF and No Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease

ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; HF = heart failure; HFpEF = heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; MACE = major adverse cardiovascular events.

In the context of the current literature

Data remain limited on the utility of statins in HF. Two major RCTs, CORONA and GISSI-HF have been predominantly conducted in participants with HFrEF. In the CORONA trial, 5,011 individuals aged at a mean of 73 years with NYHA functional class II-IV HF had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 31%. With randomization to rosuvastatin 10 mg or placebo and follow-up over nearly 33 months, there was no significant benefit associated with statin therapy in prevention of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or fatal stroke and secondary outcomes of CVD mortality and any coronary events. The GISSI-HF trial, which included 4,575 participants with a mean age of 68 years, did not require a specific LVEF threshold, but ultimately enrolled mostly participants with HFrEF (mean LVEF of 33%). The initiation of rosuvastatin 10 mg over a follow-up of 47 months demonstrated no significant difference in the endpoints of all-cause mortality or the composite of mortality and hospitalization from CVD causes in both ischemic and nonischemic HF when compared to placebo. Despite inclusion of any LVEF, a major limitation of this study was that a total of 461 participants had an LVEF > 40% precluding meaningful inferences regarding statins in patients with HFpEF.

### The effect of statin therapy on heart failure events: a collaborative meta-analysis of unpublished data from major randomized trials [^114bt2wW]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two researchers (R.C. and D.P.) independently reviewed abstracts and manuscripts to identify relevant trials. A third reader (J.J.M.) resolved any discrepancies. An assessment of study design and quality for each trial was made using the Jadad score. Our search strategy identified 23 potentially suitable trials for which unpublished data were sought. (Figure 1). The study was conducted according to published Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Unpublished tabular data were collected regarding the numbers of participants who experienced a non-fatal hospitalization for HF, the number that died due to HF, and the number that suffered either a non-fatal HF hospitalization or HF death (composite HF outcome) in each arm. Investigators were asked to detail the number of participants with HF at randomization in both treatment arms (where available), LDL-cholesterol levels at randomization and 1 year, and the number of participants who suffered a within-trial non-fatal MI. Numbers with incident HF events were also requested separately in only those participants without HF at baseline. Heart failure events occurring < 30 days after within-trial MI were specifically excluded from unpublished data sought from collaborating trials. This decision was driven by the following considerations: events within 30 days of MI would have been variably recorded as many participants would still have been in hospital due to the index MI (i.e. some events would still not be captured by assessing HF hospitalization); development of HF soon after MI may be transient, reflecting cardiac stunning, and may not necessarily lead to chronic HF; and if participants developed clinically significant HF they may well have suffered a subsequent HF hospitalization in the trial anyway. Of the 23 trials, 17 trials. were able to provide unpublished HF data, with HF events occurring < 30 days after within-trial MI excluded. These results were analysed for the main HF analyses. For the remaining six trials, HF outcomes were available from four trials (three with published data;, one with unpublished data). Data regarding timing of incident cases of HF with regard to within-trial (i.e. post-randomization) MI were not available in these four trials with the result that HF events within 30 days of MI could not be excluded and their results were therefore only combined with the full dataset in sensitivity analyses. Two authors (D.P. and R.C.) independently abstracted and tabulated information about the number of participants without HF at baseline and incident cases of HF according to randomization group in those trials where only published data were available.

### Who does not need a statin: too late in end-stage renal disease or heart failure? [^117Aq7Gg]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

Current guidelines from large randomised trials recommend that all patients with diabetes type 2 or coronary artery disease after myocardial infarction should be treated with statin drugs. However, the recent 4D and CORONA trials show no improvement in mortality in elderly patients with ischaemic heart failure and patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis with the onset of statin treatment. The survival benefit from statin treatment appears to stem primarily from the prevention of progression of coronary artery disease. In clinical conditions where coronary artery disease does not significantly contribute to the cause of death statins seem to be less effective. In patients at risk for organ damage, statin treatment, therefore, has to be started early in the course of the disease. The effect of statin withdrawal in ischaemic heart failure or in patients with advanced renal disease is not known. On the basis of the available evidence, current statin treatment should not be stopped in these patients.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115ari7C]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Heart failure medication — sacubitril/valsartan and statin interactions are summarized as follows: Sacubitril/valsartan is a combination of a neprilysin inhibitor with the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and is indicated (approved in 2015 in the United States) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (New York Heart Association class II–IV), typically used in place of an angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Although CYP450 enzyme–mediated metabolism of sacubitril is minimal, in vitro data indicate that sacubitril inhibits OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, and OAT3 transporters. In a single phase II study, coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan with atorvastatin resulted in an increased Cmax of atorvastatin and its metabolites, indicating a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with statins.

### Statin therapy in heart Failure with Preserved ejection fraction: the need for randomized evidence [^113sVErp]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Some of the limitations of the study include the issues faced by all observational studies despite the robust study design. Individuals initiated on statin will differ in several ways from those who did not get one. Individuals in the nonuser group might have contraindications, including frailty and while overlap weighting methods adjust for the known differences between the 2 groups, there may still be residual confounding from unmeasured variables.

This well-conducted study has yielded important hypothesis-generating observations on the clinical efficacy of statin for primary prevention in a well-defined real-world HFpEF cohort with reliable long-term follow-up. We agree with the authors on the need for randomized evidence to confirm these important findings. However, such an randomized controlled trial would be extremely challenging to conduct as it would necessitate recruitment of patients with no indication for statin, that is, nonischemic HFpEF with low risk for ASCVD (69% of the participants in EMPEROR-PRESERVED (Empagliflozin in Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial were already on statin therapy prior to randomization). Such a trial would also reliably answer the question of statin pleiotropy in HFpEF. Finally, the study findings also emphasize the importance of aggressive primary prevention in patients with HFpEF with intermediate and high risk for ASCVD in clinical practice, where the uptake of statins is still far from optimal!

### Initiation of statins for primary prevention in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111RCGbS]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, no RCTs have investigated the potential benefit of statins in HFpEF. However, there have been several observational studies. In a meta-analysis of 11 observational studies that included 17,985 patients with HFpEF, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of mortality (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.49–0.74; P < 0.001). Another meta-analysis that included only studies that employed propensity score methods to address confounding by indication (4 observational studies; n = 5,536) also reported a mortality benefit among statin users (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.49–0.97; P = 0.030). However, these studies were not restricted to primary prevention of ASCVD (42%-64% had underlying coronary artery disease); 2 had a sample size of < 200 patients;, and the majority of patients studied were from 2 European countries, Poland and Sweden. In addition to examining endpoints beyond ASCVD, including mortality and both HF and all-cause hospitalizations, our study extends the literature by investigating the benefit of statins for preventing primary MACE. Furthermore, the mean follow-up time for our study at 6 years was longer than the majority of studies included in both meta-analyses.

Our results are comparable to the propensity-adjusted cohort study that included 24,598 naive patients with newly diagnosed HF. Among those who initiated a statin, there was a 24% reduction in risk of all-cause mortality and 21% reduction in HF hospitalization compared to non-statin users. However, 80% of those studied had prior coronary heart disease, and while 29% of the statin users and 22% of the non-statin users had HFpEF, analyses were not stratified by type of HF. Additionally, this study demonstrated that event rates remained significantly lower in subgroups stratified by the presence or absence of baseline coronary heart disease. The analyses conducted in our study are novel in that they focus specifically on a cohort with HFpEF for primary prevention of CVD, and the methods employed in our study uniquely consist of both a new user study design and propensity score methods to address confounding by indication.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

n-3 fatty acids and statins — prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD): Both n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids and statin therapies may have a role in the prevention of SCD, with early evidence including a meta-analysis of 19 observational and RCTs and a randomized trial in recent myocardial infarction (MI) showing that fish oil 1 g/d reduced mortality due to fewer SCD; however, subsequent RCTs have not replicated these benefits and have shown n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to be ineffective, although patients can be reassured of their safety. In contrast, statin medications clearly reduce mortality and appear to reduce the risk of SCD related to ischemic heart disease, with secondary analyses from MADIT-CRT, SCD-HeFT, AVID, and DEFINITE showing less SCD risk among patients on statins, but this effect in heart failure (HF) was not confirmed in 2 prospective RCTs of rosuvastatin in HF (CORONA and GISSI-HF).

### Impact of statin therapy in heart Failure Patients: results of a large real-world experience [^1116tXUC]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials and observational or registry studies cannot definitively elucidate biological mechanisms of benefit (or harm), which require separate mechanistic trials. However, the possibility that discrepancies between the 2 randomized trials, our trial results, and prior registry and observational studies could be due to study design issues deserves exploration. One concern is for selection biases against enrolling patients at high individual ASCVD risk and/or at risk for statin-preventable events in these trials, which could have had an important impact on trial outcomes. Trial subject characteristics considered to potentially explain the lack of benefit in CORONA and GISSI-HF include advanced age (eg, mean 73 years in CORONA), advanced HF stages (ie, high percentage of classes 2 and 3), a low percentage of ischemic HF patients (ie, in GISSI-HF), populations with a low frequency of ischemic events (reduced power to show benefit), and a high frequency of treatment discontinuations (eg, 31% in GISSI-HF).

As age and severity of HF advance, the proportion of deaths due to ASCVD causes diminishes substantially and is overtaken by competing risks. These competing mortality risks include end-stage HF, sudden arrhythmic death, renal failure, and cancer, to name a few. As the proportion of statin-responsive events declines, the power to discern a treatment effect in moderate-sized studies such as CORONA and GISSI-HF also declines.

An additional concern is investigator selection bias of the kind we refer to as the "equipoise bias" or "equipoise paradox". If the expectation of benefit is strong in clinicians' minds for certain patients or patient subsets, an important bias exists to not enroll them in a placebo-controlled trial but to treat them outside of the trial. Several examples of "equipoise bias" have been observed in revascularization trials. For example, in the BARI (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation) trial, which tested coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) revascularization in patients with multivessel CAD, 1,829 of 4,039 qualified patients were randomized, and the other 2,010 patients made up a registry. BARI physicians were able to select PCI rather than CABG for 65% of these registry patients, who underwent PCI revascularization without compromising long-term survival, even though the outcomes of PCI were inferior to CABG in randomized patients. The extent to which equipoise bias underlies CORONA and GISSI-HF results deserves further consideration.

### Prognostic impact of statin intensity in heart failure patients with ischemic heart disease: a report from the CHART-2 (chronic heart failure registry and analysis in the tohoku district 2) study [^111JctMF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statins — HMG‐CoA (3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl–coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors — have been widely used for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic events in patients with and those at risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as a number of studies have shown a beneficial impact on clinical outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 In contrast, the prognostic impact of statins in patients with heart failure (HF) has been controversial: 2 large landmark trials of HF patients — CORONA (Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure) and GISSI‐HF (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Insufficienza cardiaca–Heart Failure) — failed to demonstrate prognostic benefits of statins in those patients. 8, 9 Nevertheless, several observational studies have shown a salutary impact of statin therapy in HF patients, 10, 11, 12 and individual‐level reanalyzes of the CORONA and GISSI‐HF studies have demonstrated a modestly but significantly decreased risk of myocardial infarction. 13 It remains to be examined whether statins could benefit HF patients and particularly those with IHD, which has been rapidly increasing worldwide as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. 14, 15, 16

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend intensive statin therapy with high or moderate intensity for high‐risk patients for secondary prevention of ASCVD, rather than targeting low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels. 17 This recommendation is based on findings that intensive lipid‐lowering therapies with strong statins have more favorable outcomes in IHD patients. 18, 19, 20 However, it remains controversial whether the beneficial prognostic impact of strong statins is attributable to intensive reduction in LDL‐C levels in IHD patients. 21 In contrast to the ACC/AHA guidelines, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the Japanese Circulation Society guidelines recommend treatments targeting LDL‐C levels for secondary prevention of ASCVD. 22, 23 In the present study, we examined the prognostic impact of statin use in ischemic HF patients, with special reference to statin intensity and LDL‐C levels, using our database for the CHART‐2 (Chronic Heart Failure Registry and Analysis in the Tohoku District 2) study. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30

### 2022 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association / Heart Failure Society of America guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary [^113vV3GJ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (AHA/ACC/HFSA) Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure replaces the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure and the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure. The 2022 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose and manage patients with heart failure.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, reviews and other evidence conducted in human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies published through September 2021 were also considered. This guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published through December 2021.

Results and Conclusions

Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data. Value statements are provided for certain treatments that have high-quality published economic analyses.

### Association between use of statins and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: prospective propensity score matched cohort study of 21 864 patients in the Swedish heart failure registry [^112gC7QN]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, randomized trials of statins did not demonstrate improved outcomes. However, randomized trials may not always be generalizable. The aim was to determine whether statins are associated with improved outcomes in an unselected nationwide population of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction overall and in relation to ischemic heart disease (IHD).

Methods and Results

In the Swedish Heart Failure Registry, 21864 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (age ± SD, 72 ± 12 years; 29% women), of whom 10345 (47%) were treated with statins, were studied. Propensity scores for statin use were derived from 42 baseline variables. The associations between statin use and outcomes were assessed with Cox regressions in a population matched 1:1 based on propensity score and age and in the overall population with adjustment for propensity score and age. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality; HF hospitalization; and combined all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization. Survival at 1 year in the matched population was 83% for statin-treated versus 79% for untreated patients (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; P < 0.001). In the unmatched population, 1-year survival was 85% for statin-treated versus 79% for untreated patients, hazard ratio after adjustment for propensity score and age was 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.89; P < 0.001). No examined baseline variables interacted with statin use except for IHD (P = 0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.82, P < 0.001) with IHD and 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.85–1.07; P = 0.430 without IHD. Statin use was also associated with reduced risk for all 3 secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

In an unselected nationwide population of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, statins were associated with improved outcomes, specifically in the presence of IHD. This contrasts with previous randomized controlled trials. Additional randomized controlled trials with more generalized inclusion or focused on IHD may be warranted.

Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Although important progress has been made in the management of HF, this condition remains a common cause of morbidity and death. Since the publication of the previous sets of guidelines for the management of HF, new diagnostic and therapeutic options for HF have emerged. Now, both the ESC and the ACC/AHA/HFSA have simultaneously published an update of their guidelines incorporating, among others, recommendations for the use of new pharmacological therapies for the treatment of HF. For this Viewpoint article, we have asked the chairs of the ESC Task Force, the chairs of the ACC/AHA/HFSA Writing Committee, and an independent opinion leader in the field to offer their expert insight into the new guidelines, highlighting what is new, what the main differences are between the two sets of guidelines, and what steps should be taken to improve the guidelines in future updates.

### Alirocumab after acute coronary syndrome in patients with a history of heart failure [^1139rFQZ]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

In CORONA, 5011 patients with NYHA class II–IV ischaemic HF were randomly assigned to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg/day or placebo. Rosuvastatin did not reduce the primary outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke.

In the CORONAand GISSI-HFstudies, the intensity of randomized statin therapy was moderate (10 mg rosuvastatin), which lowered LDL-C by 45.0% at 3 monthsand 32.0% at 1 yearfrom an untreated baseline. In the current study, patients were randomized to alirocumab or placebo on a background of intensive statin therapy, and alirocumab produced a further reduction of LDL-C by a mean of 63.4%. As in CORONAand GISSI-HF, the effects of the lipid-lowering intervention in patients with a history of HF were neutral.

In an analysis from the CORONA trial and Heart Protection Study, patients had a decrease in the benefit of rosuvastatin and simvastatin, respectively, with higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, suggesting that there may be a transition point of less severe HF where patients with HF may benefit from statins.

In BIOSTAT-CHF (BIOlogy Study to TAilored Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure), which included 2174 patients with worsening HF, multivariable analysis revealed a positive linear association between PCSK9 levels and the risk of mortality, and also with the composite of mortality and unplanned HF hospitalization. This led to the hypothesis that higher PCSK9 levels may contribute to worsening HF. A corollary would be that PCSK9 inhibitors would be beneficial in patients with a history of HF and reduce MACE and hospitalizations for HF. However, the current findings do not support this hypothesis.

### Effects of statin therapy according to plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration in the controlled rosuvastatin multinational trial in heart failure (CORONA): a retrospective analysis [^113zuaHQ]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We examined whether the antiinflammatory action of statins may be of benefit in heart failure, a state characterized by inflammation in which low cholesterol is associated with worse outcomes.

Methods and Results

We compared 10 mg rosuvastatin daily with placebo in patients with ischemic systolic heart failure according to baseline high sensitivity-C reactive protein (hs-CRP) < 2.0 mg/L (placebo, n = 779; rosuvastatin, n = 777) or ≥ 2.0 mg/L (placebo, n = 1694; rosuvastatin, n = 1711). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Baseline low-density lipoprotein was the same, and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein by 47% in both hs-CRP groups. Median hs-CRP was 1.10 mg/L in the lower and 5.60 mg/L in the higher hs-CRP group, with higher hs-CRP associated with worse outcomes. The change in hs-CRP with rosuvastatin from baseline to 3 months was -6% in the low hs-CRP group (27% with placebo) and -33.3% in the high hs-CRP group (-11.1% with placebo). In the high hs-CRP group, 548 placebo-treated (14.0 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 498 rosuvastatin-treated (12.2 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients had a primary end point (hazard ratio of placebo to rosuvastatin, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.98; P = 0.024). In the low hs-CRP group, 175 placebo-treated (8.9 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 188 rosuvastatin-treated (9.8 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients experienced this outcome (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.34; P > 0.2; P for interaction = 0.062). The numbers of deaths were as follows: 581 placebo-treated (14.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 532 rosuvastatin-treated (12.6 per 100 patient-years) patients in the high hs-CRP group (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.00; P = 0.050) and 170 placebo-treated (8.3 per 100 patient-years) and 192 rosuvastatin-treated (9.7 per 100 patient-years) patients in the low hs-CRP group (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.43; P = 0.14; P for interaction = 0.026).

Conclusions

In this retrospective hypothesis-generating study, we found a significant interaction between hs-CRP and the effect of rosuvastatin for most end points whereby rosuvastatin treatment was associated with better outcomes in patients with hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/L.

Therapy with HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (lipid-altering agents) should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease from hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or multiple risk factors for CHD, atorvastatin can be started simultaneously with diet restriction.

1.3 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in Adults

In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or a family history of early coronary heart disease, atorvastatin is indicated to:

Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI)
Reduce the risk of stroke
Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina

In adult patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, atorvastatin is indicated to:

Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction
Reduce the risk of stroke

In adult patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, atorvastatin is indicated to:

Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction
Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke
Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures
Reduce the risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF)
Reduce the risk of angina

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

2016 ACC/AHA/HFSA focused update — methodology and recommendation framework are outlined as follows: The term guideline-directed evaluation and management (GDEM) refers to care defined mainly by ACC/AHA Class I recommendations. For recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States. The Class of Recommendation (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE) are derived independently of each other according to established criteria; the COR indicates the strength of recommendation, and the LOE rates the quality of scientific evidence. Recommendations in this focused update reflect the new 2015 COR/LOE system, in which LOE B and C are sub-categorized for the purpose of increased granularity. Modernization includes adoption of a "knowledge byte" format with concise text (ideally < 250 words) hyperlinked to supportive evidence.

### Alirocumab after acute coronary syndrome in patients with a history of heart failure [^111q23Qm]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Statins have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in most patients in primary or secondary preventionbut failed to show benefit in two large clinical trials in patients with a history of heart failure (HF). These findings were surprising considering the high cardiovascular event rate in patients with HF and substantial representation of patients with ischaemic HF in the two trials: 40% of patients in the GISSI-HF (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Insufficienza Cardiaca-Heart Failure) trialand 100% in CORONA (COntrolled ROsuvastatin multiNAtional Trial in Heart Failure).

Two large, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with stable or acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial included patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), while the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial included patients with clinically evident stable atherosclerosis. However, neither trial demonstrated an effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on hospitalizations for HF.

Whether PCSK9 inhibitors reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or reduce hospitalizations for HF in patients with a history of HF is unknown. We therefore addressed these questions using data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial that compared the PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab with placebo in patients with a recent ACS.

Aim

The "2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" replaces the "2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" and the "2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure". The 2022 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with heart failure.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies, published through September 2021, were also considered. This guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published through December 2021. Structure: Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data. Value statements are provided for certain treatments with high-quality published economic analyses.

### Statin therapy and clinical outcomes in myocardial infarction patients complicated by acute heart failure: insights from the EPHESUS trial [^1133mX4Y]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Several clinical trials have shown that in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), statin therapy improves cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, but in these trials patients with acute heart failure (HF) were excluded or only a few were included. In patients with chronic HF, statin therapy does not reduce all-cause or CV mortality. We aimed to assess the association between statin therapy and clinical outcomes in the setting of acute HF with systolic dysfunction complicating acute MI.

Methods and Results

We performed a post-hoc analysis in 6632 patients included in the EPHESUS trial. The mean age of patients was 64 years and 71% were male. Overall, 47% of patients had a statin prescribed at baseline. Cox regression models and a secondary analysis using propensity score matching were fit to assess the association between statin prescription and clinical outcomes. During a mean follow-up of 16 ± 7 months, all-cause death occurred in 385 (12%) patients with and in 647 (18%) patients without a statin (P < 0.001). After extensive adjustment, the risk of all-cause death was 20% lower in patients on statin [hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69–0.92, P = 0.001]. This positive association was mostly due to a lower risk of CV death (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65–0.88, P = 0.0002). In contrast, statin use was associated with a higher risk of non-CV hospitalizations (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.33, P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that patients with acute HF complicating acute MI may benefit from being on statin therapy. Prospective clinical trials are required to validate these findings.

Figure 2
Association Between Statin Use and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in 7,970 U.S. Veterans With HFpEF Free of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease at Baseline, Stratified by Age, Race, Sex, Frailty, Diabetes, and ASCVD Risk Category

Events/N = # of deaths per # of person-years of follow-up; RD = weighted incidence rate difference (ie, the # of fewer deaths per 1,000 Person-years for statin users vs nonusers).

Secondary outcomes

Over the course of the study period, there were 7,256 hospitalizations, including 4,632 HF-specific hospitalizations. RR for all-cause hospitalization was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.60–0.80) and for HF-specific hospitalization was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59–0.88), Table 2. There were no significant interactions when stratified by age, race, sex, frailty status, diabetes history, or ASCVD risk category (Supplemental Figures 4 and 5).

Sensitivity analysis

When the cohort was restricted to those with 2 or more statin prescriptions during follow-up, results remained consistent for all outcomes (Supplemental Table 2).

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117SCKvy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The care of patients with chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction should be determined by the evidence from large‐scale randomized controlled trials that form the basis of accepted standards of practice. Numerous guideline documents have issued recommendations to clinicians. 1, 2 These describe the treatments that should be prescribed (class I); those that are appropriate but are not mandated (class II); and those that should not be used (class III). However, guidelines typically do not describe what constitutes an acceptable standard of care. As a result of this uncertainty, practitioners who adhere to only one or two recommendations could contend that they are treating patients with heart failure 'in accordance with the guidelines'.

### Statins, beta blockers improve outcomes after MI with CHF… [^112RastG]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

In many patients with cardiovascular disease, lipid-lowering treatment appears to decrease the rate of subsequent cardiovascular mortality. The potential benefit of statin drugs in patients with congestive heart failure is less clear. Hognestad and associates reviewed data from the Optimal Trial in Myocardial Infarction with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan to retrospectively evaluate the value of in-hospital initiation of a statin drug and a beta blocker in patients with acute myocardial infarction and CHF, and the occurrence of any drug interaction between the statin and the beta blocker. In the OPTIMAAL trial, patients with CHF and acute MI were given losartan or captopril. The morbidity and mortality end points decreased in the patients given captopril. Among the study population, 1, 971 patients received statins and beta blockers. Mean follow-up time in all patients was 3. 1 years.

Review of all-cause mortality demonstrated that treatment with statins alone was associated with a significant relative risk reduction of 55. 2 percent, while treatment with beta blockers alone was associated with a significant relative risk reduction of
46. 1 percent. The effect of taking both medications on discharge was even greater, with a relative risk reduction of 72. 7 percent compared with no treatment. Although these decreases in risk were somewhat lower after adjusting for risk variables that existed before patients were included in the study, the trend toward decreased risk remained for all-cause mortality as well as cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and repeat infarction. The authors conclude that combined treatment with statins and beta blockers early after MI complicated by CHF improves outcomes. The effects of these drugs taken together appear to be additive.

### ACC / AHA release updated guideline on the treatment of… [^117PWpLb]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Decades of research have demonstrated an association between high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Randomized controlled trials have found that treating with statins reduces ASCVD events. What Is New in the Guideline. FOUR STATIN BENEFIT GROUPS This updated guideline focuses on reducing the risk of ASCVD in four statin benefit groups: persons with clinical ASCVD target levels. Although many clinicians use target levels, evidence has shown that using the maximum tolerated statin intensity in persons who will benefit reduces ASCVD events. The absolute risk reduction in ASCVD events associated with statin therapy can be estimated by multiplying the 10-year ASCVD risk by the anticipated relative risk reduction based on the intensity of the statin. The net ASCVD risk-reduction benefit is approximately the number of potential ASCVD events prevented with statin therapy vs. the number of potential excess adverse effects. PRIMARY PREVENTION IN PERSONS WITHOUT DIABETES AND WITH LDL-C LEVEL OF 70 TO 189 MG PER DL. If the 10-year risk of ASCVD is 5% to less than 7. 5%, treatment with a moderate-intensity statin is reasonable.

Before initiating statin therapy, it is reasonable for clinicians and patients to engage in a discussion about the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, adverse events, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences. HEART FAILURE AND HEMODIALYSIS There are no recommendations on initiating or discontinuing statin therapy in patients with New York Heart Association class II through IV ischemic systolic heart failure or in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.

### Effectiveness of statin therapy in adults with coronary heart disease… [^111j9j3H]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Statin therapy reduced CHD mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction 25%, all-cause mortality 16%, and CHD mortality 23%. We evaluated whether statins reduced fatal and nonfatal CHD, all-cause mortality, vascular events, and revascularization procedures. This systematic review sought to determine the magnitude of the effectiveness of statin therapy, the optimal LDL-C level at which to initiate statin therapy, whether aggressive LDL-C reduction was superior to moderate LDL-C reduction, and whether effectiveness varied according to patient characteristics, statin type or dose, pretreatment LDL-C level, or magnitude of LDL-C reduction. All-Cause Mortality. Seventeen trials provided data sufficient for pooling. Three trials were limited to patients undergoing PCI.

Three studies demonstrated a statistically significant risk reduction, and 8 favored statin therapy but were not statistically significant. Overall, statin therapy reduced all-cause mortality by 16%. A statistically significant reduction of similar magnitude was observed for studies involving either pravastatin or simvastatin. CHD Mortality. Of 19 trials that reported CHD mortality, 4 were limited to patients undergoing PCI. Three trials2, 4, 12 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in CHD mortality. Statin therapy reduced CHD mortality by 23%. This reduction was statistically significant in trials using all statins except lovastatin. When controlling for baseline LDL-C concentration, the absolute LDL-C reduction was not significantly associated with CHD mortality and was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality.

The unanticipated direction of the estimated association between the change in LDL-C concentration and mortality seems to be a consequence of the large correlation between the change in the LDL-C level and the baseline LDL-C concentration.

### Could statins help treat COVID-19? [^116Yd7Un]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

A history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and hyperlipidemia have all been associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality from COVD-19. Observational studies by Gupta and others have suggested that taking statins might not only lower blood cholesterol levels, but also reduce the risk of dying from COVID-19. Preclinical studies indicate that statins could worsen COVID-19 or at least increase the chances of infection, Italian researchers pointed out in a recent JAMA Internal Medicine article. That's because statins, along with several other classes of drugs used to treat atherosclerotic heart disease and its risk factors, upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, which happen to be SARS-CoV-2's gateway into cells. Yet theoretically, the authors noted, the same drugs may improve the clinical course of COVID-19 by reducing vasoconstriction, inflammation, and oxidation.

The aforementioned Italian study in JAMA Internal Medicine analyzed data from about 4000 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Lombardy, Italy, ICUs. Long-term treatment with statins, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, β-blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and anticoagulants before admission was associated with higher mortality but only in an unadjusted analysis. Unmeasured confounders, as opposed to the drugs themselves, could explain that observation, the authors noted. The higher anticoagulant dose did not reduce mortality, the authors reported recently in JAMA. Because the statin vs placebo arm of the trial excluded people who'd already been taking statins, more patients had to be enrolled to reach a goal of 600 needed to adequately power that arm, and it was unblinded only in early May, principal investigator Behnood Bikdeli, MD, MS, said in an interview.

At the ACC meeting, Bikdeli reported findings from the study's statin group that were similar to the anticoagulant group findings. Twenty milligrams per day of atorvastatin did not reduce 30-day mortality compared with the placebo, said Bikdeli, a physician-investigator in cardiovascular medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital who is originally from Iran.
