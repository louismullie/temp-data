## Question

do people with carcinoid syndrome have difficulty with medications?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether people with carcinoid syndrome have difficulty with medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why symptom control is inherently hard. Then, I should verify how effective first-line somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are and why they often fail over time. Next, I will examine specific drug-related challenges, including tachyphylaxis, bioavailability, adverse effects, and polypharmacy. After that, I need to review patient-reported barriers to adherence and quality-of-life impact. Finally, I will consider rescue strategies, alternative agents, and practical solutions, before synthesizing a conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiological context that makes medication management difficult in carcinoid syndrome, because I need to ensure the downstream issues are framed correctly. Carcinoid syndrome reflects oversecretion of serotonin and other vasoactive mediators that drive diarrhea, flushing, and bronchospasm; chronic exposure also leads to carcinoid heart disease and mesenteric fibrosis, compounding symptomatology and limiting drug responsiveness, so the clinical picture is intrinsically challenging to pharmacologically suppress over time [^116C2cp4] [^111MAPTJ] [^111YNh77] [^1122embH].

> Next, I should review the cornerstone therapy and its limitations. SSAs (octreotide LAR, lanreotide) are first-line and help a substantial proportion, but symptomatic control is partial and often wanes; response rates for flushing/diarrhea hover around 50–70%, with about 60% responding initially and many losing effect within the first year, and the need for rescue short-acting octreotide is common, which already signals medication difficulties [^114ByYVf] [^116SiHtQ] [^111aCjN1] [^1147vQQH].

> Wait, let me verify the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic issues that can undermine SSA therapy, because these often get overlooked. Therapeutic levels after octreotide LAR can take 10–14 days to reach, necessitating bridging with short-acting octreotide, and over time some patients exhibit declining drug levels and loss of control, while paradoxical responses to switching between lanreotide and octreotide suggest variable in vivo pharmacodynamics and possible absorption problems at injection sites, all of which can masquerade as treatment failure [^111fbprJ] [^1143jaqu] [^115VwnAe] [^115LhgNz] [^115yVZDu].

> I will now examine tachyphylaxis and refractoriness, since these directly cause "difficulty with medications". Patients frequently develop escape from SSA control, requiring dose escalation, shorter intervals, or add-on therapies; this cycle of escalation and partial response contributes to perceived medication failure and burdensome regimens, with guideline pathways explicitly addressing "refractory carcinoid syndrome" as a common clinical state [^117QmHHP] [^114iSnwc] [^111zNjGY].

> Hold on, I should review adverse effects and secondary conditions that complicate therapy. Long-term SSAs can cause exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with steatorrhea, worsening diarrhea and mimicking refractory carcinoid syndrome; bile acid diarrhea from ileal resection or cholecystectomy, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and mesenteric ischemia are common mimics that require separate treatment, and all of this can make patients appear "difficult to treat" with SSAs alone if the differential is not addressed [^113iZ7go] [^115iqp72] [^1171DgST] [^113hXFpB].

> Let me consider the polypharmacy burden, because I need to ensure we are capturing the full medication complexity. Beyond long-acting SSAs, many patients require short-acting octreotide for breakthroughs, antidiarrheals like loperamide or diphenoxylate, pancreatic enzymes for steatorrhea, bile acid sequestrants, and increasingly telotristat ethyl; patients with carcinoid heart disease add diuretics and may face procedural prophylaxis, all of which increase pill/injection counts, side effects, and monitoring needs [^114iSnwc] [^114pcMHG] [^111zNjGY] [^112E2CaX] [^116R6onr].

> Next, I should review patient-reported outcomes and adherence barriers, since "difficulty" is not just biochemical. Qualitative studies and surveys show profound impacts of diarrhea and flushing on social functioning, sleep, work, and anxiety; patients report needing to map bathrooms, avoid travel, and feeling stigmatized, and a large proportion lack access to rescue octreotide despite breakthrough symptoms, which directly undermines perceived medication effectiveness and adherence [^1119BEoU] [^111aCjN1] [^114sWS9L].

> I should double-check whether patients themselves characterize medication challenges explicitly. In interviews and exit studies, patients consistently describe trying multiple medications with only partial success, frustration with rescue needs, and side effects from antidiarrheals, while expressing meaningful satisfaction when a therapy like telotristat reduces bowel movements, reinforcing that medication difficulties are a lived reality rather than a clinician inference [^1119BEoU] [^1131gvS6] [^114xWGy1].

> But wait, what if we are missing non–carcinoid causes of diarrhea that make medicines seem ineffective? I need to ensure we account for the differential. Guidelines emphasize ruling out steatorrhea, bile acid diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, SIBO, and mesenteric ischemia before declaring SSA failure; treating these comorbidities can salvage apparent medication nonresponse and clarify true pharmacologic refractoriness [^113iZ7go] [^113hXFpB] [^115tPCnW].

> Next, I should review practical solutions that mitigate medication difficulties. Strategies include SSA dose/frequency escalation, overlapping short-acting octreotide during initiation or breakthroughs, switching between octreotide and lanreotide in selected cases, and adding telotristat ethyl for refractory diarrhea; ondansetron can be a low-risk symptomatic bridge in select patients, and nutritional support with pancreatic enzymes and diet modification can address malabsorption, all of which require proactive monitoring and titration [^117QmHHP] [^111zNjGY] [^114yi7Yw] [^112D33XK] [^115iqp72].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly, but I should verify that I have tied the threads to evidence. Yes, people with carcinoid syndrome commonly have difficulty with medications because the disease biology is inherently pharmacoresistant, first-line SSAs achieve only partial and often transient control, tachyphylaxis and bioavailability issues are frequent, adverse effects and comorbid GI conditions complicate interpretation of response, polypharmacy is burdensome, and patient-reported functional limitations degrade adherence and quality of life; addressing these difficulties requires structured reassessment of the diarrhea differential, guideline-concordant SSA optimization, timely add-on therapies like telotristat, and patient-centered symptom control strategies [^116C2cp4] [^114ByYVf] [^117QmHHP] [^114yi7Yw] [^114iSnwc] [^111aCjN1].

---

Patients with carcinoid syndrome often experience **medication challenges** due to persistent diarrhea and flushing despite somatostatin analogs (SSAs) [^114ByYVf], and may develop tachyphylaxis or SSA-induced steatorrhea [^1171DgST]. Telotristat ethyl is added for refractory diarrhea [^114yi7Yw], but adherence is hindered by frequent dosing, side effects, and high cost [^notfound]. Management is complicated by drug interactions, malabsorption, and the need for individualized, multidisciplinary care [^113iZ7go] [^114JTfZa].

---

## Common medications and their challenges

### Somatostatin analogs (SSAs)

- **Mechanism**: Inhibit hormone secretion, controlling diarrhea and flushing [^112VRuFk].
- **Limitations**: About 50% have persistent symptoms; tachyphylaxis and steatorrhea are common [^114ByYVf] [^112D33XK] [^1171DgST].
- **Administration**: Long-acting injections every 4 weeks; short-acting octreotide for breakthroughs [^111fbprJ].

---

### Telotristat ethyl

- **Mechanism**: Inhibits serotonin synthesis, reducing diarrhea [^113wZEvF].
- **Limitations**: Three daily pills; GI side effects and high cost limit adherence [^116R6onr].
- **Effectiveness**: Reduces bowel movements by ~30% in refractory cases [^notfound].

---

### Antidiarrheal agents

Antidiarrheals such as loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, and bile acid sequestrants are used for persistent diarrhea [^114iSnwc] [^117QmHHP]. Their **limitations** include incomplete control and dose-related side effects (constipation, nausea) [^notfound].

---

## Factors contributing to medication difficulties

### Persistent symptoms

Persistent symptoms include **breakthrough diarrhea and flushing** that remain common despite SSAs [^114ByYVf], and **refractory syndrome**, in which symptoms persist despite maximal therapy [^114xjaYP].

---

### Side effects and tolerability

Side effects and tolerability issues include **steatorrhea** from SSA-induced pancreatic insufficiency [^1171DgST] and **GI symptoms** such as nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation from antidiarrheals and telotristat [^116R6onr].

---

### Drug interactions

Drug interactions include **serotonin syndrome risk** with SSRIs, triptans, and MAO inhibitors, and **QT prolongation** with ondansetron and other QT-prolonging drugs.

---

### Patient-specific factors

Patient-specific factors include **malabsorption** from bowel resection or mesenteric fibrosis [^113hXFpB] and **adherence issues** due to frequent dosing, side effects, and cost [^111aCjN1].

---

## Strategies to overcome medication difficulties

### Individualized treatment plans

Individualized treatment plans include **multidisciplinary care** coordinated by oncology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, and cardiology [^112EuUjw], and **dose adjustments** with SSA escalation, interval shortening, or switching agents [^117QmHHP].

---

### Patient education and support

Patient education and support include **education** on adherence, side-effect management, and symptom tracking, and **support groups** to improve adherence and quality of life [^113CB4tQ].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **regular assessment** of symptoms, biochemistry, and imaging [^1122embH], and **patient-reported outcomes** to guide therapy adjustments [^113cUhVW].

---

Patients with carcinoid syndrome face **significant medication challenges**, including persistent symptoms, side effects, interactions, and adherence barriers. Effective management requires individualized, multidisciplinary care, patient education, and regular monitoring to optimize symptom control and quality of life [^1122embH].

### Differential diagnosis of diarrhea in patients with neuroendocrine tumors [^115tPCnW]. Pancreas (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinoid syndrome experience diarrhea that can have a debilitating effect on quality of life. Diarrhea also may develop in response to other hormonal syndromes associated with NETs, surgical complications, medical comorbidities, medications, or food sensitivities. Limited guidance on the practical approach to the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in these patients can lead to delays in appropriate treatment. This clinical review and commentary underscore the complexity in identifying the etiology of diarrhea in patients with NETs. Based on our collective experience and expertise, we offer a practical algorithm to guide medical oncologists and other care providers to expedite effective management of diarrhea and related symptoms in patients with NETs.

### Breakthrough symptoms remain an unmet need in symptomatic patients with neuroendocrine tumors and carcinoid syndrome [^114sWS9L]. Pancreas (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to assess the effects of breakthrough carcinoid syndrome symptoms on well-being in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients insufficiently controlled on long-acting somatostatin analog (SSA) and to assess patient experience with treatment options, physician communication, and disease information sources.

Methods

This study surveyed US NET patients from 2 online communities, experiencing at least one symptom, by utilizing a 64-item questionnaire.

Results

One hundred patients participated: 73% female, 75% age 56 to 75 years, and 93% White. Primary tumor distribution was as follows: gastrointestinal NET (n = 55), pancreatic NET (n = 33), lung NET (n = 11), and other NET (n = 13). All patients were actively treated with one long-acting SSA and experiencing breakthrough symptoms: diarrhea, flushing, or other (13% experienced one, 30% two, 57% greater than two). More than one third of treated patients experienced carcinoid-related symptoms daily. Sixty percent of respondents reported not having short-acting "rescue" treatment available, impacting well-being though anxiety or depression (45%), trouble exercising (65%), sleeping (57%), employment (54%), and maintaining friendships (43%).

Conclusions

Breakthrough symptoms remain an unmet need, even in treated patients with NETs. Though still relying on physicians, NET patients are now also using the Internet. Improved awareness of optimal SSA use may improve syndrome control.

Most Commonly Reported Symptoms Attributed to CS

Table VI summarizes the symptoms attributed to CS. Participants generally described diarrhea as the most severe and frequent symptom. Most participants were actively seeking treatment to decrease their diarrhea and had varying levels of success with multiple medications. Urgency related to diarrhea was described as severe, and participants mentioned difficulty controlling their bowels, which often was associated with bowel-related accidents. The frequency of diarrhea was usually the participants' main concern. Improvement in this symptom was most commonly described as a reduction in the frequency of bowel movements. Several participants described being embarrassed or anxious about dining out in public and/or traveling due to their diarrhea, and needing to be aware of bathroom locations when they did leave the house.

All of the participants (n = 11 [100%]) reported experiencing abdominal pain, while 6 of the participants (55%) also reported having abdominal cramping, a symptom that the participants reported as distinct from abdominal pain. Both pain and cramping were symptoms that participants experienced daily and caused some of the participants to take pain medications due to the severity.

Nine of the participants (82%) reported that they experienced flushing. Their experiences were consistent in some ways; all of them reported redness/flushing in the face and most of them reported that these experiences were not painful or very noticeable. Four of the participants mentioned that they knew that they were experiencing flushing only when someone asked about it during an episode. Nine participants (82%) reported being tired or experiencing fatigue. Participants described having to nap or rest during the day because they felt exhausted and had no energy. One participant mentioned being able to sleep 20 of 24 hours. This symptom was described as severe, and participants felt fatigued even after a full night of rest. Some participants noted that sleep interruptions, often related to diarrhea, would cause them to be tired the next day. Fatigue also affected participants' ability to complete daily activities, such as work and family obligations, and caused irritability and problems with mental acuity.

INTRODUCTION

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are thought to arise from neuroendocrine cells and are often found in the gastrointestinal tract; these tumors occur in ~2 per 100,000 persons. Approximately 3 in 10 people with NETs will develop symptoms known as carcinoid syndrome (CS). Patients with CS generally have advanced, metastatic disease and a survival rate lower than that in patients without CS. Common symptoms of CS include diarrhea; flushing of the upper chest, neck, and face; abdominal pain; difficulty breathing; and heart valve dysfunction.

Because CS is relatively rare, there is little experience in formally characterizing the condition with standardized patient-reported outcomes questionnaires. Furthermore, clinical trials in CS have small sample sizes, making it difficult to capture statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes with standardized instruments. In this situation, careful review of individual responses becomes especially important, and an interview approach in which the patient can provide a first-hand description of their clinical trial experience is particularly valuable.

Telotristat etiprate is a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor developed to treat CS by reducing the production of serotonin within the metastatic neuroendocrine tumor cell. Initial evidence of efficacy was obtained in a 4-week placebo-controlled Phase II clinical study of telotristat etiprate. In that study, patients were treated in escalating-dose cohorts, and were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either telotristat etiprate or placebo. Clinical response (defined as at least a 50% reduction in bowel movement frequency for at least 2 weeks) was observed in 5 of 18 patients (28%) treated with telotristat etiprate compared with 0 of 5 patients on placebo. There was only 1 overall evaluation of the patient experience, a weekly question (with a "yes" or "no" answer) about the presence of adequate relief of gastrointestinal symptoms of CS. Adequate relief was reported in 10 of 18 telotristat etiprate–treated patients (56%) during at least 1 of the first 4 weeks of treatment, compared with zero patients on placebo.

Introduction

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a rare type of tumor that arise from cells of the diffuse endocrine system, rather than cells from a specific organ or tissue, making them biologically and clinically diverse, and are often detected when incurable in advanced stage. A subset of NETs, functional tumors, are able to oversecrete peptides and other biological substances normally secreted by neuroendocrine cells (e.g. serotonin, insulin, gastrin, and glucagon), resulting in characteristic hormonal syndromes (e.g. carcinoid syndrome, insulinoma). Although NETs can occur throughout the body, over half of NETs arise within the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas (i.e.g.astroenteropancreatic [GEP] NETs) and approximately 25% in the lung. The primary tumor location, along with other factors (e.g. age, sex, histologic features, and stage at diagnosis), is also linked to prognosis in patients with NETs. For example, in a recent analysis of US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, median overall survival for all patients with NETs was 9.3 years, but significant differences in median overall survival were observed between patients with lung NETs (5.5 years) and those with GEP NETs in locations such as the rectum (24.6 years) and appendix (> 30.0 years).

The incidence and prevalence of NETs in the United States are rising and may be attributed to increased disease awareness and improved diagnostic technology, thereby leading to earlier disease detection and stage migration. According to a study using the US SEER database, there has been a 6.4-fold increase in the age-adjusted incidence of NETs from the years 1973 to 2012. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence of NETs in the United States was estimated to be over 171,000 (as of January 2014). In addition, it is estimated that 19% of patients with NETs in the United States have carcinoid syndrome, representing an 8% increase from the years 2000 to 2011.

Neuroendocrine tumors are associated with significant burden and have a detrimental influence on quality of life among affected individuals. Symptoms commonly reported among patients with NETs and/or carcinoid syndrome include pain, fatigue, diarrhea, flushing, abdominal discomfort, and trouble sleeping.

### Symptom management for well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: ASCO guideline [^113aYtPB]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Carcinoid syndrome — first-line therapy uses long-acting SSA after excluding other causes of diarrhea, with supporting details on administration and surgical considerations: For patients with symptoms of carcinoid syndrome (ie, flushing and/or diarrhea), therapy with a long-acting SSA should be offered as first-line therapy, following exclusion of other causes of diarrhea (Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong). Due to body habits, octreotide LAR may be suboptimally absorbed and symptoms may be better managed with subcutaneous lanreotide LAR, and if using depot octreotide LAR, overlap with subcutaneous octreotide is often required within the first few weeks. If liver metastases are resectable, surgery may be discussed either first or in conjunction with SSAs, and decisions should consider effectiveness of SSAs, performance status, potential improvement in symptoms, overall survival, and goals of care.

Future direction

Better trials are needed to compare the analogs. Head-to-head, randomized comparisons are needed with the different long-acting analogs outlining a clear definition of the patient population. A placebo-controlled trial, using different somatostatin analogs with different specificities for SSTR and carried out among well-characterized patients with NETs for a sufficient period of time, should be aimed at establishing an appropriate dose range that achieves blood levels optimally saturating SSTRs.

In this day of evidenced-based medicine, orphan diseases such as NETs may have great difficulty fulfilling the requirements of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in a sufficiently large population of subjects. Since there are no centers with a sufficiently large population to carry out these needed studies, it behooves NET-oriented researchers to pool resources. In this way, larger scale multicenter studies may eventually yield rewarding results. Without this cooperative effort, our expectation can probably never exceed a Category II recommendation or acceptance.

Determining the reasons for differences in response may require evaluation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of different long-acting analogs compared with their short-lived counterparts. In addition, the presence of different receptor subtypes and their specificity in different NET tumor types might dictate a need for tailoring somatostatin analogs to the tumor.

The disappointing results with somatostatin analogs on tumor growth over the last 3 decades should spur investigators into seeking new and alternate approaches to controlling tumor growth, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, or combination therapies that include interferons.

Additionally, many studies have focused upon diarrhea and flushing, but ignored the remainder of the vast symptom complex of NETs. Indeed, none have looked into the effects of cardiovascular disease, bronchospasm, or bone metastases. Since these are slow-growing tumors with a relatively long period of stable growth and tumor mass not readily amenable to treatment, QOL measures are needed to address all symptoms that may beset the patient with an NET.

### Symptom management for well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: ASCO guideline [^117QmHHP]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Refractory carcinoid syndrome — definition and SSA-directed adjustments: Refractory carcinoid syndrome refers to persistent symptoms of diarrhea or flushing despite a stable SSA dose. For patients with refractory carcinoid syndrome, options include dose escalation or increased injection frequency of the current long-acting SSA, and/or administration of a subcutaneous short-acting SSA (in addition to the long-acting SSA) (Evidence quality: Low; Strength of recommendation: Conditional). Examples include increasing octreotide LAR from 30 mg once every 4 weeks to 30 mg once every 3 weeks, or once every 2 weeks; increasing octreotide LAR dose to 40 mg or 60 mg once every 4 weeks; or increasing lanreotide autogel from 120 mg once every 4 weeks to 120 mg once every 3 weeks or 2 or 3 weeks. Given short-acting SSAs often require 2–3 doses per day, they should ideally be used only short term, and patients with poorly controlled diarrhea should be assessed for other causes and treated with pancreatic enzymes or bile acid sequestrants when appropriate.

Carcinoid syndrome — differential diagnosis of diarrhea should precede somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy, as causes can be multifactorial and long-acting SSAs themselves have been associated with diarrhea; these reasons should be ruled out before therapy, and this guidance is a Good Practice Statement with care tailored to patient preferences. (General note) Recommended care should be accessible to patients whenever possible; possible causes include short bowel syndrome postsurgery, intestinal ischemia due to mesenteric fibrosis or lymph node metastases, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency causing steatorrhea, and long-acting SSAs have also been associated with diarrhea following long-term use, typically secondary to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.

### Carcinoid syndrome and perioperative anesthetic considerations [^117RmFXb]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Carcinoid tumors are uncommon, slow-growing neoplasms. These tumors are capable of secreting numerous bioactive substances, which results in significant potential challenges in the management of patients afflicted with carcinoid syndrome. Over the past two decades, both surgical and medical therapeutic options have broadened, resulting in improved outcomes. The pathophysiology, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and perioperative management, including anesthetic considerations, of carcinoid syndrome are presented.

### Understanding the patient experience with carcinoid syndrome: exit interviews from a randomized, placebo-controlled study of telotristat ethyl [^1131gvS6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Telotristat ethyl, an oral tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, is intended to treat carcinoid syndrome by reducing serotonin production. Telotristat ethyl was evaluated in TELESTAR, a Phase III study for patients who had carcinoid syndrome with at least 4 bowel movements (BMs) per day and who were receiving somatostatin analogue therapy. This interview substudy was conducted to provide insight into the patient experience in TELESTAR and to help understand whether reductions in BM frequency (the primary end point) and other symptoms were clinically meaningful.

Methods

Participating sites were asked to invite (before randomization) all eligible patients to telephone interviews scheduled at the end of the double-blind treatment period. Patients and interviewers were blinded to treatment.

Findings

All 35 interviewed participants reported diarrhea and/or excessive BMs at baseline. Patients reported that these symptoms negatively affected emotional, social, physical, and occupational well-being. Prespecified criteria for treatment response (achieving ≥ 30% reduction in BM frequency for at least 50% of the days) were met by 8 of 26 patients taking telotristat ethyl and 1 of 9 patients taking placebo. All 8 patients taking telotristat ethyl described clinically meaningful reductions in BM frequency and were very satisfied with the ability of the study drug to control their carcinoid syndrome symptoms. Overall, reports of being very satisfied were observed in 12 patients taking telotristat ethyl and 0 taking placebo.

Implications

Patient interviews revealed that TELESTAR patients, at baseline, were significantly affected by their high BM frequency. Patient reports of their clinical trial experience supported the significance of the primary end point and clinical responder analysis in TELESTAR, helping identify and understand clinically meaningful change produced by telotristat ethyl.

### Symptom diaries of patients with midgut neuroendocrine tumors treated withLu-DOTATATE [^115ZvqUw]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the midgut are the most common type of gastrointestinal NET, affecting approximately 0.63–1.65 patients per 100,000 standard population per year, and are associated with 5-y survival rates of less than 50% in patients with metastatic disease. Patients with advanced midgut NETs frequently develop symptoms due to tumor growth or hormone secretion. Carcinoid syndrome, the hormonal disorder most closely associated with midgut NETs, consists primarily of diarrhea and flushing. Carcinoid syndrome has been found to be present in 32%–72% of patients with midgut NETs.

Carcinoid syndrome is caused by the secretion of serotonin and other vasoactive substances. Patients with chronic elevations of blood serotonin may also develop carcinoid heart disease, which ultimately leads to right ventricular dysfunction and to substantial morbidity and mortality. Abdominal pain is another symptom frequently associated with midgut NETs and is most commonly related to tumor volume and tumor-associated desmoplasia but can also develop as a result of hormone secretion.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as experience of symptoms, self-assessments of health or treatment, or formal health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaires are important instruments to inform clinicians about the effects of treatment on the patient's health status as a composite of beneficial treatment effect and side effects. PROs in a randomized controlled trial setting are particularly useful to evaluate the impact of a study drug on the patient's health status and are becoming more important from a regulatory point of view as they capture the patient perspective regarding the disease, burden of the disease, and impact of treatments. To date, few clinical studies in NETs have reported a HRQoL benefit, highlighting the general difficulty in demonstrating a positive PRO measures outcome in cancer trials. Disease progression in patients with NETs is associated with a deterioration in HRQoL, due both to tumor growth and to progressive carcinoid syndrome.

### Management of diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome [^114o5xkn]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

CS DIARRHEA

Patients with CS diarrhea experience watery, loose stools multiple times a day — sometimes associated with considerable urgency — and the management can be very challenging. In addition to CS, patients with NETs can have other causes of diarrhea, discussed in detail below. Broad consideration of this differential diagnosis is required to optimize management.

Because the symptoms of CS are often nonspecific, a delay in diagnosis is common. Detected early, NETs can often be cured with surgery; unfortunately, many will eventually recur, often more than 5 to 10 years after surgery. Most NETs are diagnosed as advanced metastatic disease, however, at which point surgical cure is not possible and treatment is focused on symptom management.

Quality of Life

Increased frequency of bowel movements, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, and cutaneous flushing correlate with decreased quality of life (QoL). When compared to non-NET cancer populations and population norms, patients with NETS have high rates of depressionand cognitive impairment, decreases in overall physical function, impairment in sleep, fatigue, and anxiety.

Diarrhea has a particularly prominent adverse impact on physical, emotional, and social well-being. Interventions to improve individual daily activities and productivity can improve health-related QoL and reduce stress in patients with NETs. In a longitudinal study of 59 patients, fatigue and dyspnea were identified as the worst aspects of physical distress and depression as the worst aspect of emotional distress.

Economic Burden

Diarrhea has a significant medical and economic impact. Carcinoid syndrome diarrhea accounts for 1.5-fold higher total healthcare spending and almost a 2-fold higher risk of CS-related hospitalizations compared to when diarrhea is not present. A substantial financial burden has been demonstrated in NET patients in the United States, particularly in the first year after receipt of the diagnosis and regardless of whether patients received surgery or medical therapy. Reduction in CS diarrhea–related healthcare expenditures may be achievable through preventive treatment and appropriate management of diarrhea.

A study evaluating the economic burden of illness in patients with malignant GI NETs concluded that the mean annual cost was over $70,000 US dollars (USD; based on 2012 USD), higher than the national average of approximately $38,000 USD for all cancers. A separate study of 625 patients with NETs undergoing medical or surgical therapy concluded that the significant costs may be associated with the slow progression of the disease and that there is an unmet need for GI NET patients for additional effective therapies targeting improvement in outcomes, leading to lower healthcare resource use and cost utilization.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Carcinoid syndrome diarrhea remains a very significant clinical problem with substantial symptom burden resulting in reduced QoL and negative financial impact in patients with metastatic NETs. Although tumor-directed therapy, especially SSAs, remains active, diarrhea may become refractory to conventional therapy. It is important to rule out and treat common morbidities that may mimic CS diarrhea, especially steatorrhea, short gut, dysmotility, and bile acid malabsorption. Telotristat ethyl is a novel agent inhibiting the tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in the production of serotonin by NETs, which is the main driver of CS diarrhea. It has demonstrated statistically significant reductions in bowel movement frequency. However, many patients receiving concurrent SSAs and telotristat ethyl continue to suffer from diarrhea. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with DOTATATE lutetium-Lu-177 can alleviate diarrhea in some patients, but better treatments are still needed for patients with poorly controlled symptoms. With a better understanding of the symptomatology and pathophysiology of NET symptom burden, our hope is that standard and novel therapies can be deployed for optimal patient benefit.

### Patient-reported symptom experiences in patients with carcinoid syndrome after participation in a study of telotristat etiprate: a qualitative interview approach [^1156L5Hx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

While these observations clearly suggested that telotristat etiprate has biological activity, key questions remained as to the clinical relevance of these findings. Furthermore, the optimal strategy to assess patient-reported outcomes in Phase III clinical development was unclear. To help address these issues, retrospective interviews of Phase II clinical trial participants were performed.

The objectives of the interviews were to characterize the participants' CS experiences and to identify the important changes they experienced in their symptoms during the clinical trial of telotristat etiprate, during the 4-week, blinded, dose-escalation phase and/or the open-label extension phase.

### Management of diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome [^111yvovi]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) arise from enterochromaffin cells found in neuroendocrine tissues, with most occurring in the gastrointestinal tract. The global incidence of NETs has increased in the past 15 years, likely due to better diagnostic methods. Small-bowel NETs are frequently associated with carcinoid syndrome (CS). Carcinoid syndrome diarrhea occurs in 80% of CS patients and poses a substantial symptomatic and economic burden. Patients with CS diarrhea frequently suffer from diarrhea and flushing and report corresponding impairment in quality of life, requiring substantial changes in daily activities and lifestyle. Treatment paradigms range from surgical debulking to liver-directed therapies to treatment with somatostatin analogs, nonspecific anti-diarrheal agents, and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor. Other causes of diarrhea, including steatorrhea, short bowel syndrome, and bile acid malabsorption, should be considered in NET patients with refractory diarrhea. More therapeutic options are needed for symptomatic management of patients with NETs, and better understanding of the pathophysiology can empower clinicians with improved patient care.

14.3 Carcinoid Syndrome

Study 4 was a multicenter, randomized, 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 115 patients with histopathologically-confirmed neuroendocrine tumors and a history of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhea) who were treatment naïve or stable on another somatostatin analog and who were randomized 1:1 to receive lanreotide injection 120 mg (n = 59) or placebo (n = 56) by deep subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. Patients were instructed to self-administer a short-acting somatostatin analog (octreotide) as rescue medication as needed for symptom control. The use of rescue therapy and the severity and frequency of diarrhea and flushing symptoms were reported daily in electronic patient diaries. During the 16 week double-blind phase, the primary efficacy outcome measure was the percentage of days in which patients administered at least one injection of rescue medication for symptom control. Average daily frequencies of diarrhea and flushing events were assessed secondarily.

The patient population had a mean age of 59 years (range 27 to 85 years), 58% were female and 77% were Caucasian. Patients in the lanreotide arm experienced 15% fewer days on rescue medication compared to patients in the placebo arm (34% vs. 49% of days, respectively; p = 0.02). The average daily frequencies of diarrhea and flushing events in patients treated with lanreotide Injection (and rescue medication) were numerically lower relative to patients treated with placebo (and rescue medication), but were not statistically significantly different via hierarchical testing.

### Efficacy, safety and unmet needs of evolving medical treatments for carcinoid syndrome [^114U1NqM]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

This review reports on the currently available medical treatment options for the control of symptoms due to carcinoid syndrome in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. The efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of approved drugs such as somatostatin analogues (SSA), telotristat ethyl (TE) and interferon-alpha, are reviewed. Somatostatin analogues remain the standard treatment of carcinoid syndrome based on the high expression of somatostatin receptors and the resulting inhibition of secretion of bioactive compounds; their use is associated with relatively mild AEs, involving mainly the gastrointestinal system, and being usually transient. Although dose escalation of SSA remains an unapproved option, it is clinically implemented to alleviate symptoms in refractory carcinoid syndrome and supported by the most recent guidelines. The side effects associated with the increased dose are in general mild and consistent with standard dose of SSA. Telotristat ethyl, an oral inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis, represents a rather novel innovative treatment option in patients with carcinoid syndrome suffering from diarrhea and complements the standard therapy of SSA. Given the low toxicity profile, TE may be considered an early add-on treatment to SSA in patients with uncontrolled carcinoid syndrome. However, further prolonged follow-up of patients treated with TE may be needed to exclude potential AEs, such as liver toxicity or depressed mood, in patients with long-term treatment. Interferon alpha is a cytokine with direct inhibitory effect on hormone secretion and tumor cell proliferation and an approved therapy in carcinoid syndrome but is associated with significant AEs in the majority of the patients requiring frequently dose reduction. The finding of a more favorable tolerability of pegylated interferon needs to be confirmed in a prospective study.

### Shifting paradigms in the pathophysiology and treatment of carcinoid crisis [^113LseiL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Carcinoid crisis is a potentially fatal condition characterized by various symptoms, including hemodynamic instability, flushing, and diarrhea. The incidence of carcinoid crisis is unknown, in part due to inconsistency in definitions across studies. Triggers of carcinoid crisis include general anesthesia and surgical procedures, but drug-induced and spontaneous cases have also been reported. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinoid syndrome are at risk for carcinoid crisis. The pathophysiology of carcinoid crisis has been attributed to secretion of bioactive substances, such as serotonin, histamine, bradykinin, and kallikrein by NETs. The somatostatin analog octreotide has been considered the standard of care for carcinoid crisis due to its inhibitory effect on hormone release and relatively fast resolution of carcinoid crisis symptoms in several case studies. However, octreotide's efficacy in the treatment of carcinoid crisis has been questioned. This is due to a lack of a common definition for carcinoid crisis, the heterogeneity in clinical presentation, the paucity of prospective studies assessing octreotide efficacy in carcinoid crisis, and the lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of carcinoid crisis. These issues challenge the classical physiologic model of carcinoid crisis and its common etiology with carcinoid syndrome and raise questions regarding the utility of somatostatin analogs in its treatment. As surgical procedures and invasive liver-directed therapies remain important treatment modalities in patients with NETs, the pathophysiology of carcinoid crisis, potential benefits of octreotide, and efficacy of alternative treatment modalities must be studied prospectively to develop an effective evidence-based treatment strategy for carcinoid crisis.

### Patient-reported symptom experiences in patients with carcinoid syndrome after participation in a study of telotristat etiprate: a qualitative interview approach [^114xWGy1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose:

Telotristat etiprate, a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, was previously evaluated in a Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with carcinoid syndrome (CS) and diarrhea not adequately controlled by octreotide. The objective of the current study was to characterize the symptom experiences of patients participating in that trial.

Methods:

Consenting patients participated in one-on-one, qualitative interviews focused on eliciting symptoms they had experienced in association with their CS diagnosis and recollection of symptom changes they experienced while participating in the Phase II trial.

Findings:

Among the 23 patients who participated in the previous 4-week dose-escalation study, 16 were eligible for interviews and 11 participated in the present study. The median time from study completion to the interview was 31 months; 4 of 11 patients were receiving telotristat etiprate in a follow-up, open-label trial at the time of interview. All of the patients (100%) described diarrhea as a symptom of CS, with effects on the emotional, social, and physical aspects of their lives. Improvement in diarrhea during the study was described by 82% of participants, and was very impactful in several patients. Results led to the design and implementation of a larger interview program in Phase III and helped to establish a definition of clinically meaningful change for the clinical development program.

Implications:

The diarrhea associated with CS can have a large impact on daily lives, and patient interviews can characterize and capture clinically meaningful improvements with treatment. Identifier:

### Practical considerations when providing palliative care to patients with neuroendocrine tumors in the context of routine disease management or hospice care [^115iqp72]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of diarrhea for palliative care and end-of-life

Determining the underlying cause of diarrhea in patients with NETs is critical because diarrhea can be related to other causes, such as pancreatic insufficiency related to prior pancreatic resection or SSA therapy, effects of bowel resection, bile-acid induced diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal issues. Therefore, it is essential to exclude or treat these causes of diarrhea. In addition, some patients with carcinoid syndrome-associated diarrhea may have symptoms that become refractory to SSA over time. An option in this situation includes adding telotristat ethyl, an oral inhibitor of serotonin synthesis. In the phase III TELESTAR clinical trial, patients with carcinoid syndrome experiencing four or more bowel movements per day (BMs/day) while on SSAs were randomized to receive either telotristat ethyl or placebo. Telotristat ethyl resulted in a 42–44% mean reduction in daily bowel movements compared with placebo. Additional strategies to improve carcinoid syndrome diarrhea have included increasing the dose or frequency of SSAs, addition of short-acting subcutaneous octreotide for breakthrough symptoms, and use of antidiarrheal therapies including loperamide, diphenoxylate-atropine, deodorized tincture of opium, or other nonspecific medications.

Nutrition and metabolism are altered in many patients with GEP-NETs. Among patients with carcinoid syndrome, the risk of malnutrition is due to reduced food intake, food intolerance, malabsorption, and diarrhea. These complications can impact patients' quality of life and functioning. Fat-soluble vitamins and niacin deficiency exist among patients with NET, particularly those on treatment with SSAs. For patients with diarrhea, a low fiber/low residue diet with small, frequent meals is an important management component. Some food, such as amine-rich substances, can trigger carcinoid syndrome and should be avoided. The involvement of a nutritionist to assess individual needs and requirements regarding nutritional supplementation is recommended.

### Patient-reported symptom experiences in patients with carcinoid syndrome after participation in a study of telotristat etiprate: a qualitative interview approach [^113Nojuj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The findings from this qualitative interview study suggest that bowel movement frequency in patients with CS is a clinically relevant end point with a significant impact on patients' lives. The results also suggest that telotristat etiprate may improve key aspects of CS that are important to patients. These observations have guided the selection of end points, instruments, and an interview substudy in the Phase III clinical program for telotristat etiprate. The approach described for identifying relevant symptoms and their impact on daily life may be relevant to patient-reported outcomes strategies for other oncology studies and studies of other rare conditions.

### The endocrine tumor summit 2008: appraising therapeutic approaches for acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome [^115VwnAe]. Pituitary (2010). Low credibility.

There is overwhelming evidence based on clinical trials, case reports, and case control studies indicating that somatostatin analogs are safe and have the ability to control certain symptoms of carcinoid tumors. Nonetheless, the trials have been relatively small and of short duration. Numerous small studies make it clear that octreotide LAR can control symptoms among approximately two-thirds of subjects, but that escape occurs at varying intervals of time for flushing and diarrhea, requiring the use of short-acting analogs that seem to have greater efficacy. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear and may relate to a variety of reasons such as bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and dynamics, or even changes in the bioavailability of different batches of the drugs.

A paradox is seen regarding response to lanreotide in patients failing octreotide and vice versa. Although the binding to the SSTR of each agent appears to be the same in vitro, these peptides differ sufficiently so that their action in vivo appears to defy the SSTR binding rules. Accruing evidence reveals that loss of bioavailability of octreotide LAR needs to be monitored using blood levels. Escape from control may not reflect loss of efficacy of the drug, tachyphylaxis, appearance of antibodies, or mutation in the cell type of the tumor, but simply a state of decreasing bioavailability. Furthermore, the vast symptom complex and its potential multitude of mechanisms, many of which are not susceptible to inhibition by SST alone, may require combinations with agents targeting the alternate pathogenetic mechanisms.

We describe a 53-year-old male patient, with a known history of metastatic carcinoid tumour of the lung, who developed a variety of symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome and subsequently a carcinoid crisis. Although bronchial carcinoid tumours are very rarely associated with symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome, a subset may develop a severe hypersecretory syndrome and exhibit an aggressive behaviour. In cases with excessive tumour load and difficult-to-control hypersecretory syndrome, management by a specialized multidisciplinary team using evidence-based regimens is mandatory to deal with the life-threatening carcinoid crisis, to improve patients' outcome and quality of life.

### Long-term safety experience with telotristat ethyl across five clinical studies in patients with carcinoid syndrome [^1167wF9V]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinoid syndrome experience considerable morbidity and mortality; carcinoid syndrome may be associated with shorter survival. Carcinoid syndrome is linked to tumoral secretion of serotonin and other bioactive substances. The subsequent debilitating diarrhea and urgency to defecate pose significant health risks. In previous studies, telotristat ethyl, a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, was effective and well tolerated in treating carcinoid syndrome diarrhea. We present pooled safety data from five clinical trials with telotristat ethyl in patients with carcinoid syndrome.

Subjects, Materials, and Methods

Adverse events reported during telotristat ethyl treatment were pooled from two phase II and three phase III clinical trials in 239 patients with carcinoid syndrome. Long-term safety of telotristat ethyl and causes of hospitalization and death were reviewed; overall survival was estimated.

Results

Mean (median; range) duration of exposure and follow-up was 1.3 years (1.1 years; 1 week to 5.7 years), with 309 total patient-years of exposure. Leading causes of hospitalization were gastrointestinal disorders or were related to the underlying tumor and related treatment. Survival estimates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 93%, 88%, and 77%. Nearly all deaths were due to progression or complication of the underlying disease; none were attributable to telotristat ethyl. There was one death in year 4.

Conclusion

Based on long-term safety data, telotristat ethyl is well tolerated and has a favorable long-term safety profile in patients with carcinoid syndrome.

Implications For Practice

Carcinoid syndrome can cause persistent diarrhea, even in patients treated with somatostatin analogs. Across five clinical trials in patients with carcinoid syndrome, telotristat ethyl has been well tolerated and efficacious, providing clinicians with a new approach to help control carcinoid syndrome diarrhea, in addition to somatostatin analog therapy. By reducing the stool frequency in patients with carcinoid syndrome whose diarrhea is refractory to anticholinergics, such as loperamide and atropine/diphenoxylate, and somatostatin analog dose escalation, improvement in quality of life becomes an achievable goal.

Carcinoid syndrome

Symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, and bronchospasm within the clinical spectrum of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) require dedicated therapy. An incompletely appreciated spectrum of peptides and amines is responsible for increased gut motility, vasodilation, and fibrotic complications observed in CS patients. Supportive measures such as avoiding food or stress that evokes complaints and antidiarrheals such as loperamide or codeine phosphate can offer alleviation of symptoms. Chronic diarrhea in CS patients can be multifactorial and include causes such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bile acid sequestration, bacterial overgrowth, or short bowel, often seen after abdominal surgery. Clinicians should treat these conditions accordingly with either dietary modifications, pancreatic enzymes, antibiotics, or cholestyramine.

Targeted medical treatment has been available for decades since the advent of somatostatin analogues (SSAs). Besides their role in NET diagnostics, SSA-induced SSTR activation inhibits the secretion of a variety of humoral factors by NETs. Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have described that SSAs can induce a symptomatic response for CS in 65% to 74% of patients. This efficacy appears to be equal across all relevant SSA formulations. Biochemical response after SSA use measured by a reduction in urinary 5-HIAA levels is also considerable at 39% to 51%. Long-acting formulations such as octreotide LAR and lanreotide autogel should be commenced once the diagnosis of CS is confirmed. Caution should be applied to patients with nearly obstructed bowel as initiation of the SSA can induce an obstructive ileus. In these cases a trial of short-acting SSAs may be considered. SSAs are generally well tolerated by patients, but adverse effects include a change in bowel movements and stool consistency, nausea, steatorrhea, myalgia, injection reactions, diabetes mellitus, and in the long term cholelithiasis. Most of the adverse effects are low grade and self-limiting, requiring little need for dose reduction in patients. In cases of symptoms refractory to a standard dose, clinicians may consider increasing the SSA dose further. Strategies include reducing the injection interval or increasing the injection dose of long-acting formulations or adding subcutaneous "rescue" octreotide. There is no benefit of switching to the multi-SSTR-targeting pasireotide in CS patients.

Statement 6: a monthly injection of the depot form of lanreotide or octreotide results in consistent control of hormone levels and symptoms in patients with carcinoid syndrome

Rationale and definition of statement

Completely effective treatment of carcinoid tumors remains somewhat elusive. It is therefore appropriate to carefully examine this broader topic as we investigate evidence on the statement above. The statement initiates several points of interest — the use of somatostatin analogs, the level of both symptom and hormonal control, as well as the consistency of this control — requiring some review.

Evaluation of the effects of any treatment to control symptoms should at least include the major symptom complex and, if possible, those less frequently recognized. The symptom complex of carcinoid tumors includes flushing in 94%; diarrhea in 78%; cardiac-related complications in 37%; abdominal cramps in 51%; telangiectasia in 25%; bronchoconstriction, edema, and cyanosis in 17–18%; and arthritis, proximal myopathy, and pigmentation in about 7%. A recent retrospective analysis of 392 patients also found hypertension in 45.9% and diabetes in 9.7% of patients.

Neuroendocrine Tumors and Carcinoid Syndrome

Pathophysiology and Symptomatology

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the widely diffused neuroendocrine cell system frequently present substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Well‐differentiated NETs, traditionally known as carcinoid tumors, are the most common type of NET, with an estimated incidence of more than 12,000 U.S. cases annually (6.98 per 100,000 persons in 2012). The prevalence of NETs is estimated at 175,000 people in the U.S. NETs of gastrointestinal (GI) origin include the appendix and ileum (the most common), the respiratory tract, the genitourinary system, and several organs. Both incidence and prevalence of NETs are rising, and NETs are anticipated to emerge from rare disease status within the next decade.

Patients with advanced, functional NETs may experience symptoms related to tumoral secretion of serotonin and peptide hormones, such as gastrin, glucagon, insulin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and, rarely, somatostatin, parathyroid hormone‐related protein, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, growth hormone, and thyroid‐stimulating hormone. Most of these tumors are malignant and predominantly associated with increased plasma serotonin levels, which drive symptoms in small‐bowel tumors. These augmented serotonin levels, as well as increased activity from other potential substances such as histamine, kallikrein, prostaglandins, and tachykinins, may mediate a serious condition called carcinoid syndrome (CS), which manifests as episodic facial flushing; urgent, debilitating diarrhea; and potential development of fatal cardiac valvular fibrosis and mesenteric fibrosis. Carcinoid syndrome is estimated to occur in 30%–40% of patients with well‐differentiated GI NETs.

Ultimately, all patients develop symptomatic progression of CS when on an SSA. Therefore, once CS treatment is initiated, physicians should actively monitor the patient's status for a clinical, biochemical, and radiological response. Symptom relief should be monitored monthly in the first 2–3 months and, once achieved, at intervals of 4–6 months. Biochemical and imaging tests can be evaluated every 4–6 months. 4B.

Q6: What are the general recommendations for the initial management of CHD?

All patients diagnosed with CHD should be managed by a MDT (see also Q11). 2A
The two main goals of management are aggressive reduction of hormonal secretion by the tumour and management of CHD and RHF, when present. A holistic approach must be taken, with consideration of NET status, CHD severity/symptoms, and nutritional and general performance status of the patient. For tumour and CS control (see also Q5). In patients with symptomatic RHF, standard treatments, including loop/thiazide diuretics, aldosterone antagonist therapy and cautious fluid and salt restriction, can improve patient's symptoms but must be used judiciously to avoid a paradoxical worsening of symptoms because of a reduction in cardiac output. The doses depend on the individual context, patients' blood pressure, renal function, other co‐morbidities, or medications. Patients with CHD require lifelong clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic monitoring to facilitate early identification of disease progression. It is important to note that CHD can progress rapidly, and patients should have regular NT‐proBNP and echocardiograms at intervals of 6–12 months. 4A

NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors — carcinoid syndrome hormone control states that carcinoid syndrome primarily occurs in patients with metastatic well-differentiated NETs originating in the distal small intestine and proximal colon (midgut), with signs and symptoms including flushing, diarrhea, wheezing (rare), and CHD. Carcinoid crisis is a potentially life-threatening form often triggered by tumor manipulation or anesthesia and is typically associated with hypotension, diarrhea, and blood pressure fluctuation; in patients with carcinoid syndrome, invasive procedures should ideally be performed in centers with experienced anesthesiologists. During surgical procedures for patients who develop hemodynamic instability that could indicate carcinoid crisis, octreotide should be available as needed; doses of octreotide (100–500 mcg IV) can be used, potentially followed by IV infusion of octreotide (50–300 mcg/h). Therapeutic levels of octreotide would not be expected to be reached for 10–14 days after LAR injections. Short-acting SC octreotide PRN can help address suboptimal symptom control quickly, and vasopressors can be used for severe and/or prolonged hypotension. Prophylactic administration of octreotide prior to surgery can be utilized although intraoperative complications can still arise, and the routine use of prophylactic octreotide has been called into question. Refractory flushing or diarrhea is defined as suboptimal symptom control in the setting of long-acting SSAs (octreotide LAR or lanreotide) used in approved doses. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Evaluation of lanreotide depot / autogel efficacy and safety as a carcinoid syndrome treatment (elect): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114GKSPf]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lanreotide depot/autogel 120 mg for the control of carcinoid syndrome (CS) symptoms in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).

Methods

This was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00774930). Patients with/without prior somatostatin analog (SSA) use were randomized to lanreotide depot/autogel 120 mg or placebo every 4 weeks, with access to short-acting octreotide as rescue medication. The primary endpoint was the percentage of days in which short-acting octreotide was used, which was assessed from daily diaries using an analysis of covariance including the stratification variables baseline short-acting octreotide use and frequency of diarrhea/flushing. The proportions of patients experiencing treatment success was a supportive analysis. Adverse events were recorded at all visits.

Results

A total of 115 patients were enrolled (lanreotide, n = 59; placebo, n = 56). The adjusted mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) percentage of days with rescue octreotide use (primary endpoint) was significantly lower in the lanreotide (33.7%; 95% CI, 25.0%-42.4%) versus the placebo group (48.5%; 95% CI, 39.6%-57.4%), representing an absolute difference of -14.8% (95% CI, -26.8% to -2.8%; p = 0.017). The odds ratio of full/partial treatment success (≤ 3 days short-acting octreotide use weeks 12 to 15) was significantly greater with lanreotide than placebo (2.4; 95% CI, 1.1–5.3; p = 0.036). No new safety concerns were identified, and lanreotide was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Lanreotide depot/autogel is effective for the control of CS symptoms in patients (SSA-naïve or experienced) with NETs.

Q5: How to manage CS?
First line management

SSA, octreotide or lanreotide, are the mainstay of CS treatment.SSA bind to SSTR which are expressed by most NET cells, the presence of which is confirmed by increased tumour uptake on SRI. SSA inhibit the secretion of several hormones and vasoactive substances, improving symptoms in up to 70% and decreasing u5‐HIAA levels in approximately 46% of CS patients. 2aA
It is not mandatory, but strongly recommended, to have a positive SRI to start therapy with SSA (Consensus opinion). 2B
Octreotide is available as a short‐acting subcutaneous/intravenous or a long‐acting release (octreotide LAR) formulations, the latter being administered intramuscularly 30 mg/4 weeks. Because drug concentration reaches a plateau at 14 days from injection, patients with mild CS can start with octreotide LAR 30 mg alone. 2bA
Lanreotide Autogel® is available as a depot formulation of 60 mg, 90 mg and 120 mg and administered s.c. at a dose of 120 mg/4 weeks; drug concentration reaches a steady state in the first day, dispensing the need for concomitant short‐acting octreotide.
When CS symptoms are moderate/severe, administration of the long‐acting SSA (octreotide LAR or lanreotide Autogel®) should be combined with short‐acting octreotide 100 μg to 500 μg every 6–8 h, for up to 2 weeks or as a rescue therapy when CS is not controlled. 3bA
SSA are safe and well‐tolerated, with only 1 to 11% of patients requiring discontinuation as a result of adverse events.
Short‐term adverse events are mild, including pain/engorgement at injection site, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, flatulence, and hyperglycaemia.
Long‐term adverse events include fibrotic nodules at injection sites, cholelithiasis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, occurring in 5%–15% of cases; diabetic patients need close follow‐up, as anti‐glycaemic treatment intensification may be needed. Prophylactic cholecystectomy to avoid cholelithiasis should be considered cautiously during resection of primary small bowel NETs because it may worsen diarrhoea in patients with previous small bowel resection. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (steatorrhoea) develops in almost one‐quarter of patients receiving SSA, with more than 90% occurring after 6–24 months of treatment; it can be treated with oral pancreatic enzymes supplements.
Dose reduction of octreotide LAR from 30 mg to 20 mg and lanreotide Autogel® from 120 mg to 90 mg can be offered to patients who are intolerant of higher dosages. Alternatively, the injection frequency can be reduced beyond every 4 weeks.
Although there are no randomised controlled trials powered to directly compare SSA for CS, octreotide and lanreotide are similarly safe and effective in managing CS and tumour growth. 3bA

### Management of diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome [^1149Lddc]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors that arise from enterochromaffin cells with traits of both nervous system and hormone-producing cells. Neuroendocrine tumors are principally characterized by originating site, grade, and stage, as well as functional status. Most (70%) are found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but NETs may occur in other sites, including the lungs. Within the GI tract, the most common sites are the small bowel, rectum, and colon, followed by the pancreas, stomach, and appendix.

Management of anxiety and depression related to hormonal syndromes for palliation and at the end of life

Symptoms of anxiety and depression are normal given the uncertainties of living with NETs at all stages, including at the end of life. In patients with small intenstine (SI) NET, the prevalence of depression and anxiety is 50 and 35%, respectively. These symptoms may be due to various causes, including the release of biogenic amines (5-HIAA). In addition to the management of hormone excess with SSA (or other medications for other functional NETs), first-line antidepressants such as SSRIs appear safe in NET patients with and without carcinoid syndrome.

La Salvia et al. study showed that mood disturbances, including depression and anxiety, psychoses, cognitive impairment, and sleeping alterations, are reported in NET patients, especially in patients with carcinoid symptoms, and negatively impact health-related quality of life and are associated with reduced survival rates. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas also are associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression. The principal cause is the dysfunction of the noradrenergic system. Consequently, early medical intervention to achieve remission of the symptoms can improve the patient's physical and mental well-being.

Management of mesenteric fibrosis for palliation and at the end of life

Mesenteric fibrosis (MF) can affect patients with SI-NETs. Many SI-NETs either present or develop mesenteric lymph node metastases (despite often having a small primary tumor of < 1cm). The lymph node metastasis can grow silently and often induce MF in the surrounding tissue of the mesentery. SI-NETs can release several growth factors and vasopeptides that can cause various symptoms such as flushing and diarrhea but can also cause tissue damage such as carcinoid heart disease and fibrosis leading to MF. MF may occur in up to 50% of SI-NETs with encasement of prominent blood vessels such as the superior mesenteric vessels. MF can create contraction and tethering of bowel loops, obstruction, intussusception, and possibly ischemia. This can produce severe pain and discomfort (especially postprandial), diarrhea, ascites, malabsorption, and malnutrition, as well as ischemic-related complications. MF can significantly impact the quality of life of patients with NETs and especially at the end of life. Unfortunately, it is not well-diagnosed or recognized in many patients with SI-NET.

### Patient-reported outcomes with lanreotide autogel / depot for carcinoid syndrome: an international observational study [^111Ug5Qx]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lanreotide Autogel/Depot effectively controls symptoms in patients with carcinoid syndrome associated with neuroendocrine tumours. Data on patient-reported outcomes are sparse.

Aim

To evaluate the effect of lanreotide on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) with carcinoid syndrome.

Methods

This was an international, open-label, observational study of adults with neuroendocrine tumours and history of diarrhoea, receiving lanreotide for > 3 months for relief of carcinoid syndrome symptoms. The primary PRO measure was satisfaction with diarrhoea control. Secondary PRO measures included severity, change in symptoms and impact on daily life of diarrhoea; and patient satisfaction with flushing control.

Results

Of 273 patients enrolled, 76% were 'completely' or 'rather' satisfied with diarrhoea control; 79% reported improvement in diarrhoea with lanreotide. The proportion of patients with 'mild', 'minimal', or 'no diarrhoea' increased from 33% before treatment to 75% during treatment; 75% were unconcerned about the impact of diarrhoea on daily life. Satisfaction with flushing control amongst patients with significant flushing at treatment initiation was 73%.

Conclusions

Lanreotide treatment was associated with improvements in symptoms as well as a range of PROs in patients with neuroendocrine tumours and carcinoid syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01234168).

### The endocrine tumor summit 2008: appraising therapeutic approaches for acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome [^114va5UQ]. Pituitary (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite considerable progress in defining criteria for disease control in patients with acromegaly, a number of controversies exist regarding the use of GH and IGF-I measurements towards this end. Similarly, the use of somatostatin analogs in the treatment of acromegaly has strikingly altered disease outcomes for patients with this disease, as well as symptom control for patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). However, issues of use of these medications preoperatively in patients with acromegaly, dosing intervals, and treatment efficacy remain. In the Summit proceedings summarized, an expert panel was asked to examine a number of controversial statements pertaining to current therapeutic approaches in the management of acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome (Table 1). Evidence both supporting and contradicting the statement was presented, and panelists were asked to decide, based on the evidence in the literature, on their degree of acceptance of each statement. The results from the Summit voting were compared with the findings of an electronic survey containing the same statements as voted on by the workshop panel. The 100 respondents consisted of endocrinologists and neurosurgeons, all of whom treat patients with either acromegaly or neuroendocrine and/or pituitary tumors. Survey respondents have practiced from 1 to 10 years and represented various geographic regions of the United States.

Functioning NENs and specific syndromes

The majority of NENs are non-functional. Suppression of hormone and peptide secretion in those with functional syndromes is fundamental to patient management (table 7). The presence of carcinoid syndrome is typically associated with metastatic small intestinal NENs but can also occur in lung, pancreatic, and ovarian NENs. 'Curative' resection of the NEN and metastases will alleviate GI symptoms from hormone hypersecretion. If resection is not possible, suppression of hormone secretion using somatostatin analogues is needed (table 7).

Due to the heterogeneity of NENs, some systemic therapy options overlap with the treatment of other cancers. GI symptoms in those receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy or TKIs should be managed as previously detailed in this guidance.

### Patient-reported symptom experiences in patients with carcinoid syndrome after participation in a study of telotristat etiprate: a qualitative interview approach [^114oE98o]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Participants

All recruiting sites from the Phase II clinical trial (LX1606.202)were invited to join the present qualitative interview study, and 2 of the 8 sites chose to participate. A member of each site's study staff contacted potential participants to explain the purpose, procedures, benefits, and risks of the present interview-based study using a standardized recruitment script. If the patient was interested in participating, the site's staff member documented eligibility and obtained written informed consent and the participant was scheduled for an interview. All study procedures were approved by an institutional review board.

Participants meeting the following inclusion criteria were eligible for the study: participation in the previous telotristat etiprate Phase II clinical trial; 18 years of age or older; able to participate in a one-on-one telephone interview; able to read, speak, and understand English and complete all study assessments; and willing and able to provide written informed consent before the interview. Participants with a cognitive or other impairment (eg, vision or hearing) that would have interfered with completing the interview were not eligible for the study.

Interview Procedures

Before each participant's telephone interview, he or she received a packet that contained an introductory letter, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Gastrointestinal NET questionnaire (GI. NET-21), the EORTC Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire (QLQ-C30; EORTC 2012), and a Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics form. The questionnaires were in a sealed envelope and participants were directed not to open these materials until instructed to do so by the interviewer. Participants were asked to return the materials at the conclusion of the interview.

Trained and experienced interviewers, blinded to treatment arm, conducted the one-on-one interviews over the telephone using a prescripted interview discussion guide to assess the participants' symptom experiences. The interview began with confirmation of the patient having previously provided written informed consent, followed by an overall explanation of the study; the interview then moved into a prescripted discussion of the patient's experiences with symptoms of CS. The interviews were audio-recorded and then subsequently transcribed.

### Carcinoid heart disease: current understanding and future directions [^1123ycfY]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Carcinoid tumors are rare and aggressive malignancies. A multitude of vasoactive agents are central to the systemic effects of these tumors. The additional burden of cardiac dysfunction heralds a steep decline in quality of life and survival. Unfortunately, by the time carcinoid syndrome surfaces clinically, the likelihood of cardiac involvement is 50%. Although medical therapies such as somatostatin analogues may provide some symptom relief, they offer no mortality benefit. On the other hand, referral to surgery following early detection has shown increased survival. The prompt recognition of this disease is therefore of the utmost importance.

### Oral ondansetron offers effective antidiarrheal activity for carcinoid syndrome refractory to somatostatin analogs [^112D33XK]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are standard for symptomatic patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). However, most patients experience tachyphylaxis, and limited options exist for this so-called "refractory carcinoid syndrome". Recently, 5-HT 3 antagonist ondansetron has been associated with reduction of bowel movement in a small series. The aim of this analysis was to assess effectiveness of ondansetron for symptomatic treatment of carcinoid syndrome.

Design and Patients

We have analyzed patients given ondansetron as bridging therapy for refractory carcinoid syndrome. The dose was 2 × 8 mg for 5 days, followed by reduction to 1 × 8 mg in case of benefit.

Results

A total of 14 patients with small bowel NETs metastatic to the liver were identified. All patients had been treated with SSAs for a median time of 18 months before aggravation of diarrhea. One patient had to be excluded because of an underlying infectious cause of diarrhea. The median number of daily bowel movements was 7 (range, 5–13) before initiation of therapy. At this time, seven patients had stable disease, whereas six patients showed radiological progression with symptomatic breakthrough. All 13 patients were scheduled for salvage therapy. Remarkably, in 85% (11/13) ondansetron resulted in a clinically relevant decrease of bowel movements to a median of 3 (1–4). The median time of ondansetron intake was 29 days (7 days to 29 months). In four patients, diarrhea recurred after initial improvement at an interval of 22–43 days, whereas the remaining seven had an ongoing benefit, including two long-term responders who refused further therapy because of pronounced decrease of symptoms (ondansetron for 14+ and 29+ months).

Conclusion

Ondansetron offers symptomatic relief in the majority of patients. Although there was no influence on 5-HIAA levels, evidence from two patients suggests prolonged benefit.

Implications For Practice

Somatostatin analogs are standard treatment in patients with carcinoid syndrome and have an overall response rate of up to 50%. This symptomatic benefit, however, is lost in many patients because of the development of tachyphylaxis or tumor progression. Patients with this "refractory carcinoid syndrome" pose a therapeutic challenge and are sometimes faced with a detrimental effect on quality of life. In this article, the authors suggest the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist ondansetron as potential symptomatic therapy for patients with refractory diarrhea due to carcinoid syndrome. Although the number of patients in this retrospective series is limited, treatment was easily applicable, feasible, and safe and resulted in an ongoing symptomatic benefit in 85% of patients, including two long-term responders.

2.4 d. Carcinoid crisis and othercomplications

Carcinoid crisis is a potentially life‐threatening complication of uncontrolled CS caused by the sudden release of high levels of serotonin and other vasoactive substances from a NET, especially in patients with refractory CS (RCS; see Section C. b.). It can occur spontaneously, but more frequently as result of tumour biopsy, surgical manipulation, use of sympathomimetic drugs, anaesthesia or different cytolytic therapies (hepatic embolisation) and sometimes because of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). It is defined by abrupt flushing, severe shifts in blood pressure with haemodynamic instability, profuse diarrhoea, and distressing bronchospasm with wheezing(Table 3). Other specific complications of CS patients are summarised in Table 3.

### TELEPRO: patient-reported carcinoid syndrome symptom improvement following initiation of telotristat ethyl in the real world [^111aCjN1]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is known to cause significant clinical morbidity with substantial effects on quality of life [1] [2] [3] [4]. Patients with carcinoid syndrome diarrhea (CSD) require more medical care and have more hospitalizations and higher health care costs than their peers without CSD [5]. The prevalence of pretreatment CS symptoms among patients enrolled in a recent phase III clinical trial was considerable, including bowel movement‐related issues (97%), flushing (86%), and abdominal pain (63%) [2]. The majority of patients (80%) reported meaningful reductions in quality of life and work productivity (43%) [2].

Since the 1980s, somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy has been the first‐line medical management approach for CS symptoms and CSD [6] [7] [8]. Approximately 60% of patients may be responsive to initial SSA long‐acting release (LAR) treatment, but they have shown a loss of effect over time, resulting in refractory symptoms [9] [10] [11] [12]. Other treatment options with the potential to palliate CS or delay its progression include hepatic arterial embolization and peptide receptor radiotherapy, which are generally recommended for patients with radiographic progression rather than those with symptom progression in the setting of stable disease [13].

Carcinoid syndrome and biomarker evaluation in bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors — Bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise about 20% of all lung neoplasms, and ectopic serotonin production can produce the carcinoid syndrome in about 1% to 5% of these patients. Carcinoid crisis can be prevented, aborted, or treated with IV octreotide acetate. To diagnose carcinoid syndrome, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) is measured in 24-h urine collections and the specificity of the urinary 5-HIAA test is close to 90%. Serum NET biomarkers, such as neuron-specific enolase and chromogranin A, should be measured; an elevated chromogranin A occurs in 75% of carcinoid tumors and 60% of SCLCs and has the highest reliability and accuracy among the biomarkers of NETs. Neuron-specific enolase and 5-HIAA are highly specific but not very sensitive (sensitivity, 32.9% and 35.1%, respectively). Because up to 80% of bronchopulmonary NETs express somatostatin receptors, radionuclide-labeled octreotide scintigraphy is useful in detecting tumors that may be missed by other diagnostic studies. Whenever feasible, surgery is the first-line treatment of bronchial carcinoids; metastatic disease is not curable, and symptom control is important; somatostatin analogs are effective and other therapies include serotonin receptor blockers, interferon, and antidiarrheal medications.

### The endocrine tumor summit 2008: appraising therapeutic approaches for acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome [^115LhgNz]. Pituitary (2010). Low credibility.

A prospective multicenter study of 93 patients with pre-existing control on octreotide subcutaneous (SC), was one of the earliest papers on the efficacy of octreotide LAR in carcinoid syndrome. After a washout period, octreotide LAR efficacy was compared with that of octreotide SC. Octreotide SC produced complete or partial success in 58.3% patients whereas the response to octreotide LAR was somewhat dose-dependent (66.7% with 10 mg; 71.4% with 20 mg; and 61.9% with 30 mg), although rescue medication was required in 40–60% cases. This has raised a question regarding bioavailability of octreotide in the LAR preparation.

Woltering et al. in a retrospective chart review, report that plasma octreotide levels after 30, 60, 120 mg/month octreotide LAR fell with time and as a result, might not have been reaching receptor saturation levels. While this may partially account for the relative lack of efficacy of octreotide LAR in controlling symptoms, there are other possible explanations. Any "position statement" on symptom control warrants cautious interpretation.

Carcinoid syndrome — diarrhea and flushing management — long-acting SSAs (octreotide LAR and lanreotide) are highly active for control of both flushing and diarrhea, and telotristat 250 mg TID can be considered specifically for patients with refractory diarrhea secondary to carcinoid syndrome in combination with long-acting SSA, noting symptomatic benefit can sometimes be delayed for several weeks after initiation of the drug; patients who experience symptom exacerbation towards the end of each 4-week SSA cycle can often benefit from more frequent administration (ie, every 3 weeks), and dose escalation can also sometimes benefit patients with refractory symptoms; short-acting octreotide, given subcutaneously, administered at doses of 100–250 mcg every 8 hours as needed, can be prescribed to patients with suboptimal control of flushing and/or diarrhea; serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron can improve refractory carcinoid syndrome diarrhea; treatments that effectively cytoreduce secretory metastatic tumors are likely to palliate hormonal symptoms, with surgical cytoreduction or hepatic arterial embolization highly effective at control of flushing and/or diarrhea for liver-dominant disease, and PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate has been associated with delay in diarrhea progression; nonspecific antidiarrheals (ie, loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, tincture of opium) can be beneficial for management of refractory diarrhea, regardless of cause.

### Inhibition of peripheral synthesis of serotonin as a new target in neuroendocrine tumors [^113wZEvF]. The Oncologist (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The carcinoid syndrome represents a set of signs and symptoms associated with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that occur primarily when metastases are developed in the liver, resulting in the worsening of quality of life. Serotonin plays a central role in the physiology of carcinoid syndrome by promoting intestinal motility. Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) have widely demonstrated their efficacy as symptomatic relievers of carcinoid syndrome, but this control is ephemeral, being reduced by approximately 50% within the first year. The exact mechanisms of resistance to SSAs are not fully understood, but it is believed that serotonin might be involved. Patients with carcinoid syndrome present with a significant increase in serotonin plasma levels and, consequently, in the soluble urinary metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid. Telotristat etiprate is a potent inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin, that has demonstrated in the phase III TELESTAR clinical trial a significant improvement in the control of bowel movements in patients with NETs who have carcinoid syndrome and who have progressed to an SSA. Based on these results, telotristat etiprate has emerged as a potential new option in the treatment algorithm of symptomatic control of functioning NETs. However, some issues need to be clarified, such as the safety profile of the drug outside clinical trials, the benefit in quality of life, and the possible impact on tumor growth, as well as its role within sequencing or combination treatment strategies with pre-existing drugs effective in NET treatment.

Implications For Practice

This article reviews the literature about carcinoid syndrome, which affects patients diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors. Few articles have been published about this syndrome and its pathophysiology. Somatostatin analogs provide symptomatic relief; however, patients may become refractory to this strategy, usually within the first year of treatment. In this context, as an agent with an innovative mechanism of action, telotristat etiprate has demonstrated activity in a phase III trial, and findings may offer a path to an improve quality of life and prolonged survival for certain patients.

### Symptom management for well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: ASCO guideline [^112VRuFk]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Carcinoid syndrome in neuroendocrine tumors — Carcinoid syndrome is the most common hormonal complication associated with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) and is much more commonly diagnosed in patients with intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) than in pancreatic NETs (panNETs). Symptoms arising from elevated levels of serotonin and other active amines and peptides include flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and, in advanced NETs, carcinoid heart disease, which can lead to right heart failure because of regurgitation and stenosis of the right-sided heart valves. Carcinoid crisis is rare and involves the sudden onset of hemodynamic instability because of massive release of vasoactive substances and may occur after an abdominal procedure. Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the most frequently used first-line therapy for functional NETs and have also demonstrated efficacy with respect to tumor control. SSAs are synthetic analogs of somatostatin that bind to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) on NETs and inhibit hormonal secretion.

RESULTS

Sample Description

A total of 11 participants were interviewed for the study between December 20, 2012, and February 15, 2013, and 10 of the interview participants returned all of the postinterview study materials. Reported sociodemographic characteristics (Table I) and clinical disease characteristics (Table II) are based on these 10 participants. The calculated mean time between end of participation in the telotristat etiprate core study and this study interview was 29.5 months.

Site staff at the telotristat etiprate study sites also provided clinical information on the participants (Table III). All of the participants (100%) had NETs that had metastasized; the most commonly reported metastatic site was the liver (n = 9 [82%]). Four of the 11 participants (36%) were in the open-label phase of the telotristat etiprate clinical trial at the time of their interviews. A majority of the participants (n = 9 [82%]) were on long-acting octreotide treatment and had received, on average, 1 injection in the past month. Two participants (18%) had received embolizations since exiting the telotristat etiprate clinical trial.

### Patient-reported symptom experiences in patients with carcinoid syndrome after participation in a study of telotristat etiprate: a qualitative interview approach [^11249GVe]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Therefore, a strategy of repeating the interviews in Phase III of development of telotristat etiprate was chosen as a means of supplementing the standardized questionnaire. The interviews in Phase III were to be done prospectively at the time of completion of double-blind treatment. Patients were to be interviewed only once (no baseline interview) to minimize their burden. The interviews were to include questions about whether the changes that patients experienced were meaningful, and participant responses would be analyzed in relation to the objective data on bowel movement frequency obtained from electronic diaries.

The results of the present study should be interpreted with consideration of a few limitations. First, the study comprised a fairly small sample of 11 participants, and only those patients who had participated in the earlier clinical trial were eligible for the interview study. Second, only 2 of 7 centers that enrolled patients into the Phase II trial agreed to participate in the patient interview study, thus reducing the number of potentially eligible participants from 23 to 16. At the time of the interviews, only 4 of the participants were in the open-label phase of the clinical trial, while the others had completed their trial participation; thus, recall accuracy and bias may have been issues as, for most patients, there was a long gap between study participation and the interview. This time lag (> 2 years for several individuals) was related to the processes of interview protocol development and ethics committee approval, which were initiated after the results from the double-blind portion became available. However, most of the patients appeared to have had very good and detailed recollections of their experiences, as evidenced by the detailed and consistent descriptions of their symptom and treatment experiences that they were able to provide during the interviews. As CS is very rare, a qualitative approach with interviews has been highly informative. Finally, those who agreed to participate in the interviews may have been more willing to participate due to a positive response to therapy, and further, those who were participating in the open-label extension phase of the study were obviously aware of their treatment status.

### Patient-reported experience of diagnosis, management, and burden of neuroendocrine tumors: results from a large patient survey in the United States [^112J3Nkz]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a diverse group of malignancies that originate in neuroendocrine cells throughout the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and lungs. Neuroendocrine tumors are rare, although incidence rates have risen substantially in the United States (partly in response to improvements in diagnosis and increased awareness), with an age-adjusted incidence of 5.25/100,000 people in 2004. Neuroendocrine tumors can be clinically symptomatic because of the secretion of hormones (termed functional tumors) or silent/nonsecretory tumors, which are generally symptom free (nonfunctional). Lack of clear symptoms associated with NETs leads to delays in diagnosis, often until advanced stages of the disease when symptoms become more pronounced.

Several types of medical specialists and health care professionals may be involved in the diagnosis and staging of NETs, requiring patients to undergo potentially repetitive and extensive examinations. The wide array of imaging techniques, biochemical testing, and expertise that are required to characterize the location and grade of the primary tumor and the extent of metastatic disease could possibly lead to patients receiving conflicting treatment plans and misdiagnoses. A large number of health care resources are also required for the long-term management of NETs, with qualitative studies highlighting the lack of a clear pathway of care for patients with NETs. Neuroendocrine tumor management should be highly individualized based on the burden and symptoms associated with the tumor and whether the aim of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms or prevent tumor growth. Difficulty in achieving an accurate diagnosis, limited access to NET-specific treatment centers or information about NETs, and inadequate support as part of ongoing care have been highlighted in previous studies as issues. A multidisciplinary approach has been proposed to streamline the care of patients with NETs, involving the collaboration of diverse medical disciplines to optimize diagnosis, staging, and management, with the aim of enhancing clinical outcomes and improving patient satisfaction.

### Current best practice in the management of neuroendocrine tumors [^114JTfZa]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms are rare tumors that display marked heterogeneity with varying natural history, biological behavior, response to therapy and prognosis. Their management is complex, particularly as a number of them may be associated with a secretory syndrome and involve a variety of options. A number of factors such as proliferation rate, degree of differentiation, functionality and extent of the disease are mostly utilized to tailor treatment accordingly, ideally in the context of a multidisciplinary team. In addition, a number of relevant scientific societies have published therapeutic guidelines in an attempt to direct and promote evidence-based treatment. Surgery remains the treatment of choice with an intention to cure while it may also be recommended in some cases of metastatic disease and difficult to control secretory syndromes. Long-acting somatostatin analogs constitute the main treatment for the majority of functioning tumors, whereas specific evolving agents such as telotristat may be used for the control of carcinoid syndrome and related sequelae. In patients with advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection, treatment options include locoregional therapies, long-acting somatostatin analogs, molecular targeted agents, radionuclides, chemotherapy and recently immunotherapy, alone or in combination. However, the ideal time of treatment initiation, sequence of administration of different therapies and identification of robust prognostic markers to select the most appropriate treatment for each individual patient still need to be defined.

### Management of diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome [^1171DgST]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Use of SSAs, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management and control of CS, may contribute to worsening of diarrhea. One of the more common adverse reactions of chronic use of SSAs is steatorrhea, with frequency of 26% to 65% for lanreotide (dose related), and 36% to 61% for octreotide. Steatorrhea associated with SSAs results from inhibition of meal-stimulated digestive enzymes from the pancreas. Although stool collection for fat content analysis can be helpful for diagnosis, a more practical approach is empiric therapy with pancreatic enzymes. The importance of taking the enzyme supplements with meals and snacks should be stressed and the dose titrated upward until desired effects are achieved. Fecal elastase-1 has been reported as a reliable diagnostic test, especially in symptomatic patients, but is uncommonly used.

Bile acid malabsorption may also cause diarrhea in patients with NETs, particularly among those who have undergone resection of the terminal ileum and/or right colon or cholecystectomy. Identification of bile acid-induced diarrhea is important as specific therapy, such as bile acid-sequestrant therapy is available. Assessing levels of serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one can help detect bile acid malabsorption, although availability of this test is limited. A quantitative analysis of total and bile acid fraction on 48-hour stool testing can confirm the diagnosis. In practice, empiric therapy with bile acid sequestrants can be tried, and clinical improvement strongly suggests bile acid malabsorption as the cause of the diarrhea.

Patients who have undergone extensive small-bowel resections can have diarrhea secondary to short bowel syndrome. This can lead to significant malabsorption and weight loss, and, in extreme cases, parenteral nutrition is necessary. The onset of such diarrhea can usually be traced back to the time of surgery. Resections of longer segments of the small bowel, especially those > 100 cm, may lead to additional steatorrhea, complicating both the diagnosis and therapy. This form of diarrhea may be suspected when high doses of octreotide, administered subcutaneously, do not improve the diarrheal state.

Management Options

Treatment planning in patients with NETs is a complex and complicated process due to heterogeneity of the tumors and multiple treatment options and approaches available. In patients with NETs and CS managing the symptoms of hormone excess is one of the key considerations during treatment decision making. Treatment guidelines, such as those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and North American Neuroendocrine Society, elevate the importance of CS management in addition to tumor control.

### New treatments for the carcinoid syndrome [^115CHehb]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoids, are rare and insidiously growing tumors. Related to their site of origin, tumors can be functional, causing various forms of the carcinoid syndrome, owing to the overproduction of serotonin, histamine, or other bioactive substances. They often invade adjacent structures or metastasize to the liver and elsewhere. Treatment includes multimodal approaches, including cytoreductive surgery, locoregional embolization, cytotoxic therapy, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and various targeted therapies with goals of symptom relief and control of tumor growth. This article summarizes current and emerging approaches to management and reviews several promising future therapies.

Dietary Modification

Although dietary modifications for management of specific GI symptoms for NET patients are recommended through patient websites and healthcare provider interviews, there is no clear evidence to be found within the literature that would scientifically attest to their efficacy and neither of the major treatment guidelines provides dietary advice. However, anecdotal evidence for symptom improvement in NET patients has been observed by the authors in their clinical practice with recommendation for frequent small meals and avoidance of aged cheeses and fermented foods with high amine content by patients with secretory diarrhea. A retrospective chart review of 69 patients with gastric NETs and diarrhea who received an amino acid-based glucose-free medical diet with electrolytes reported 80% of patients had subjective improvement of diarrheal symptoms and 51% reported > 50% reduction in diarrhea frequency.

Surgical Cytoreduction

Resection of liver metastases can quickly decrease tumor bulk, especially in patients with completely resectable or mostly resectable liver metastases. More than 80% to 90% tumor volume debulking can promptly resolve symptoms of diarrhea and flushing and may translate to improved survival.

Liver-Directed Therapies

Use of liver-directed therapies, such as transarterial chemoembolization, transarterial embolization, radioembolization (selective internal radiation therapy), or radiofrequency ablation, may contribute to reducing tumor burden and hormone release and increase response to medical therapy to control the symptoms of NET-related hormone-excess states in patients with refractory disease. Liver-directed therapy can effectively control symptoms in patients with liver-dominant metastases. Of the available modalities, none has emerged as being superior, and toxicities differ among the available modalities. Small, retrospective studies and 1 very small prospective trial have suggested similar efficacy of the different hepatic arterial interventions. – There are concerns about excessive cumulative hepatic radiotoxicity in patients who receive both selective internal radiation therapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and even in patients who receive selective internal radiation therapy alone.

Q2: What is the differential diagnosis of CS?

The most common symptoms in CS (flushing, diarrhoea, their combination) may represent manifestations of other clinical entities. Also, patients with an established CS, on treatment, can experience deterioration of their symptoms from other causes.
Diarrhoea in CS is always secretory, persists with fasting, may occur during the night and is associated with abdominal discomfort and faecal urgency. Sometimes, to prove "secretory" diarrhoea, an estimation of faecal fluid "osmotic gap" is needed, with an "osmotic gap" of < 50 mOsm kg –1 being diagnostic for secretory diarrhoea. 4C However, in other NETs (e.g. VIPomas, gastrinomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas [MTC]), as well as in systemic mastocytosis, diarrhoea is also secretory, and the differential diagnosis should be based primarily on laboratory findings.
Patients with CS treated with somatostatin analogues (SSA) may experience deterioration of previously controlled diarrhoea, or ongoing diarrhoea which never responded to SSA. Other causes of diarrhoea, NET‐related (steatorrhoea secondary to SSA, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, mesenteric ischaemia, bile salt malabsorption or short‐bowel syndrome), or NEN‐unrelated (colitis, gastroenteritis), need to be excluded. 5A The diagnosis of steatorrhoea as a result of SSA‐induced pancreatic insufficiency is based on stool features (pale, "oily", difficult to be flushed from the toilet) and may be confirmed by low faecal elastase or pragmatically by a trial of pancreatic enzymes. 5B Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is noted in patients with mesenteric fibrosis or multiple previous surgery, being associated also with bloating and/or flatulence and its diagnosis is established with an "H2 breath test". 4B Mesenteric ischaemia‐related diarrhoea can be suspected by the patient's history and abdominal CECT findings. Patients who have undergone right hemicolectomy may develop bile salt malabsorption‐associated diarrhoea. This diagnosis is usually based on history and confirmed, when available, with tauroselcholic (selenium‐75) acid (SeHCAT) scan, or pragmatically by a trial with bile acid sequestrants. 4B A short bowel syndrome, defined as a length of functional small bowel < 200 cm may occur after extensive intestinal resection.
Flushing in the context of CS has been described in Section B. Flushing can be noted in other NENs (MTC) as well as in some non‐NENs entities (menopause, systemic mastocytosis, anxiety). The key characteristics allowing the distinction of CS‐associated flushing from flushing from other causes are summarised in Table 5.

Uncontrolled CS Diarrhea — Treatment Strategies

Despite use of SSAs, patients may become refractory to treatment and experience symptom progression. Treatment options used in clinical practice for refractory CS include SSA dose escalation, interferon, and surgical, embolic, and radiation therapies. A retrospective analysis reported that among 239 patients with symptomatic NETs 62% had symptom progression while on octreotide LAR 30 mg, 81% [of the 239] had limited improvement in flushing, and 79% [of the 239] had improvement in diarrhea after the first-dose escalation to either 40 or 60 mg. Dose escalation can be considered for patients with suboptimal symptom control on standard doses and can be done by either increasing the long-acting dose, shortening the interval between doses, or using concomitant subcutaneously administered octreotide. If patient symptoms worsen the week immediately prior to the next scheduled dose, shortening of the dosing interval may be an appropriate course of action. For patients who do not have their symptoms under control at any time during each treatment cycle, a trial of increasing the dose may be a better strategy.

Switching SSAs is another treatment approach; however, there are limited data from small studies and case reports to support this approach. In a small phase 2 trial of 15 patients with progressive metastatic NETs (7 of which were of midgut origin) while receiving lanreotide 30 mg biweekly, the switch to octreotide LAR 30 mg led to overall biochemical and symptomatic response of 41% and 82%, respectively. Currently, there is very limited evidence to suggest that a switch from one SSA to another will result in improved control of CS symptoms or tumor growth; this practice cannot be routinely recommended based on the available data. Furthermore, despite these treatment strategies, patients are likely to continue to experience progression of CS diarrhea symptoms and continue to have 4 or more daily bowel movements.

Octreotide acetate (octreotide) is the most prescribed and most studied somatostatin congener, or analog, for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and carcinoid syndrome, the latter of which may be characterized by debilitating diarrhea and flushing. Approved in the U.S. more than 30years ago, octreotide is widely used to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and has been shown to demonstrate antiproliferative activity. The two formulations available in the U.S. include a subcutaneous immediate-release (IR) injection introduced in 1989 and a long-acting repeatable (LAR) intramuscular injection approved in 1999. Lanreotide depot (lanreotide), a more recent somatostatin congener, has been available in the U.S. since 2014. Despite widespread use of octreotide LAR, several key challenges exist with the current depot-based treatment paradigm. Studies indicate that LAR formulations are associated with continued unmet patient needs, owing in part to a loss of bioactivity over time that may necessitate progressive supplemental treatment with IR octreotide to adequately control symptoms. Clinicians should understand the key differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of the LAR and IR formulations that may contribute to bioactivity loss and somatostatin receptor desensitization. In addition, there is a need to re-evaluate the role of IR octreotide in combination with depot therapy to provide consistent bioavailability and better control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms. The purpose of this review is to explore all these issues and to re-establish a rationale for the IR formulation, particularly with respect to novel use cases and its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: There is a need to re-evaluate the role of immediate-release octreotide in combination with depot therapy to provide consistent bioavailability and better control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms.

Background

Considered to be rare, neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that are becoming more prevalent worldwide. Within the United States, population-based retrospective cohort studies have found incidence rates have increased 6.4 fold over the past five decades; and similarly in Canada, incidence rates had increased from 2.48 to 5.86 per 100,000 per year. Prognostic factors, such as primary site of the NET, tumour stage, and pathological grade, have been reported to predict survival outcomes for people with NETs. Although most commonly found in gastrointestinal and bronchopulmonary sites, NETs can originate almost anywhere in the body, and therefore survival rates can also vary. The severity of symptoms associated with NETs and symptom burden can also differ between patients. Depending on the secretory potential of the tumour, tumours that secrete hormones and are functional in nature can lead to clinical syndromes that produce highly distressing symptoms for patients. For others, the presentation of NETs that are non-functional can be indolent and asymptomatic in nature even with widespread disease. Like many other rare cancers, due to their non-specific presentation and the lack of awareness within the community and in clinical settings, NETs are poorly understood.

Navigating through a diagnosis of NETs presents unique challenges for both patients and clinicians. First, attaining an accurate diagnosis is often delayed due to the nature of symptoms patients present with; commonly misdiagnosed with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or dyspepsia. Patients report difficulties in navigating through unclear treatment pathways and disease management with no disease-specific supportive care available that addresses the specific needs of the NET patient population. Low levels of satisfaction with the organisation of care have also been reported and are often associated with impaired psychosocial function and increased anxiety.

The priority of needs reported by the NET patient population has predominantly been within psychological, physical, and daily living, and health system information domains, with information needs being most prevalent for patients diagnosed within the previous 6 months. However, despite the prominent need for disease-related information, it has been previously found that 69% of newly diagnosed patients reported either not receiving any written information about their cancer, or when it was received, not understanding it. Most patients access disease-related information online; nevertheless, two-thirds of newly diagnosed NET patients do not find the online information resources useful.

Abstract

Octreotide acetate (octreotide) is the most prescribed and most studied somatostatin congener, or analog, for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP‐NETs) and carcinoid syndrome, the latter of which may be characterized by debilitating diarrhea and flushing. Approved in the U.S. more than 30 years ago, octreotide is widely used to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and has been shown to demonstrate antiproliferative activity. The two formulations available in the U.S. include a subcutaneous immediate‐release (IR) injection introduced in 1989 and a long‐acting repeatable (LAR) intramuscular injection approved in 1999. Lanreotide depot (lanreotide), a more recent somatostatin congener, has been available in the U.S. since 2014.

Despite widespread use of octreotide LAR, several key challenges exist with the current depot‐based treatment paradigm. Studies indicate that LAR formulations are associated with continued unmet patient needs, owing in part to a loss of bioactivity over time that may necessitate progressive supplemental treatment with IR octreotide to adequately control symptoms. Clinicians should understand the key differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of the LAR and IR formulations that may contribute to bioactivity loss and somatostatin receptor desensitization. In addition, there is a need to re‐evaluate the role of IR octreotide in combination with depot therapy to provide consistent bioavailability and better control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms.

The purpose of this review is to explore all these issues and to re‐establish a rationale for the IR formulation, particularly with respect to novel use cases and its use during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Implications for Practice

There is a need to re‐evaluate the role of immediate‐release octreotide in combination with depot therapy to provide consistent bioavailability and better control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms.

Finally, the Summit panel considered the use of somatostatin analogs in the management of NETs. There was a consensus that this therapy can control a number of symptoms due to carcinoid tumors, although studies have been of short duration. However, in contrast to the data in acromegaly, escape may occur, requiring the use of short-acting analogs. This escape may reflect tachyphylaxis, development of antibodies, changing cell populations in the tumor, and/or decreasing bioavailability. In addition, although somatostatin analogs can control disease symptoms, hormone hypersecretion, and tumor growth in many patients with acromegaly, these analogs are not effective in treating tumor burden in NETs.

Management

Intuitively, optimising somatostatin analogue therapy should reduce circulating vasoactive substances and carcinoid syndrome and therefore may stabilise CHD. However, to date there is no evidence to support this effect. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been associated with an elevated risk of progressive heart disease.

Medical management of pure right heart failure is limited and consists of relieving symptoms of right heart failure with diuretic therapy.

Cardiac surgery

Cardiac surgery offers definitive therapy for symptoms. Marked symptomatic improvement of at least one New York Heart Association class occurs after valve replacement. A median survival of 6 years compares favourably with medically treated patients, but perioperative mortality is significant.

Telotristat ethyl was generally well tolerated, with nausea and headache being the most commonly reported adverse events. Long-term follow-up for up to 6 years has shown no new safety concerns and positive impact on relief of CS symptoms is maintained.

Bile Acid Sequestrants

In confirmed cases of bile acid-induced diarrhea or, in the right clinical scenario, an empiric trial of bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevelam), is reasonable. Therapy typically is started at a low dose and titrated to response.

Antidiarrheals

Although therapy with nonspecific antidiarrheals, such as loperamide or diphenoxylate, may improve the diarrhea, evidence from prospective trials is lacking and there can be substantial side effects, especially with the use of anticholinergic drugs in the elderly. It is important to note that antidiarrheals do not address the underlying changes in motor function associated with CS diarrhea, nor to do they reduce circulating serotonin.

### Diagnosing and managing carcinoid Heart Disease in patients With Neuroendocrine tumors: an expert statement [^111YNh77]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Carcinoid heart disease is a frequent occurrence in patients with carcinoid syndrome and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of carcinoid heart disease is poorly understood; however, chronic exposure to excessive circulating serotonin is considered one of the most important contributing factors. Despite recognition, international consensus guidelines specifically addressing the diagnosis and management of carcinoid heart disease are lacking. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in multiple aspects of screening and management of the disease. The aim of these guidelines was to provide succinct, practical advice on the diagnosis and management of carcinoid heart disease as well as its surveillance. Recommendations and proposed algorithms for the investigation, screening, and management have been developed based on an evidence-based review of the published data and on the expert opinion of a multidisciplinary consensus panel consisting of neuroendocrine tumor experts, including oncologists, gastroenterologists, and endocrinologists, in conjunction with cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons.

Assessment of QoL

Metastatic disease is a common presentation in patients with NETs; therefore, often the aim of treatment is to improve QoL rather than achieve a cure. It is therefore recommended that QoL should be assessed regularly throughout management.

Patients with NETs, in spite of long-term and metastatic disease, often perceive their health-related QoL as good, but the treatment options available to these patients are expensive and are not without side effects. The data derived from QoL measurement may be helpful to both patients and clinicians in decisions about treatment options. It can be used to help inform economic analyses and resource allocation and to influence healthcare policy. QoL data may also be useful in highlighting those areas where we need to develop interventions for the amelioration or prevention of treatment-related problems. A specific QoL score questionnaire for patients with NETs is in phase IV validation. At present, the best tool to assess health-related QoL in patients with NETs is the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer's Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C-30.

Treatment

Objectives

The aim of treatment should be curative where possible but it is palliative in the majority of cases. Patients often maintain a good QoL for a long period despite having metastases. Although rate of growth and malignancy are variable, the aim should always be to maintain a good QoL for as long as possible. For all patients, the aim is to keep the patient free from disease and symptoms for as long as possible.

Surgery

General approach

Surgery is the only curative treatment for NETs. As with all gastrointestinal tumours, the conduct of surgery with intent to cure depends on the method of presentation and the stage of disease. Specific issues with NETs include determining the extent of local and distant tumours, identification of synchronous non-NETs, recognition of fluid and electrolyte depletion from diarrhoea, and, in advanced cases, detection of less obvious cases of carcinoid syndrome as well as detection of cardiac abnormalities. The treatment plan should be modified accordingly, whether to meet immediate or long-term objectives, within a multidisciplinary framework. With NETs, if the primary lesion is < 2 cm in diameter (depending on the site of origin), the incidence of metastasis is low. However, nodal or liver metastases are found at presentation in 40–70% of patients.

b Second and further lines of management — refractory CS (RCS),

RCS is defined by recurring or persisting CS symptoms and increasing or persistently high u5‐HIAA levels despite the use of maximum label doses of SSA. RCS may be divided into either non‐aggressive or aggressive, based on symptoms burden (< or ≥ 4 BM/day, and/or < or ≥ 5 flushing episodes/day, respectively) together with disease stability (stable or progressive), hepatic burden (< or ≥ 50% liver involvement), and/or the presence of CHD.

Patients with RCS may suffer from an incapacitating burden of symptoms, as well as CS‐related complications such as CHD.
The initial work‐up of suspected RCS consists of a thorough investigation of the differential diagnosis of worsening CS symptoms, measurement of u5‐HIAA and appropriate tumour imaging.
The causes of RCS remain obscure, but radiological and/or biochemical tumour progression should be differentiated from the differential diagnoses of worsening CS.
Differential diagnosis of RCS (Figure 2) includes problems with SSA administration, SSA tachyphylaxis, SSA‐induced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, infectious/inflammatory diarrhoea, mesenteric fibrosis, and worsening of diarrhoea in patients whose primary small bowel NET was surgically removed. Clinicians should be aware of causes of false positive elevations of u5‐HIAA, such as serotonin‐reuptake receptor inhibitors, acetaminophen, and consumption of serotonin‐rich foods (e.g. bananas, pineapple, tomatoes, plums, eggplant, avocado, kiwi, fruits in general, nuts) prior to the urinary test. Decreased SSA absorption consequent to fibrosis at the injection sites may develop in patients receiving long‐term SSA. Worsening of CS 2–3 weeks after SSA injection may imply tachyphylaxis; more frequent doses (octreotide LAR 30 mg/2–3 weeks or lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg/2 weeks), [2bA] increased octreotide LAR dosage to 60 mg every 4 weeks or switching to the alternative SSA can be considered. 3bA Overall, SSA dose‐escalation offers symptom improvement in nearly 80% of cases, whereas only 29% of patients show further reduction in u5‐HIAA levels.
It is important to re‐assess all patients with RCS for CHD with an echocardiogram and NT‐proBNP (see CHD work‐up session). Once administration problems and differential diagnoses are excluded, NET‐directed therapies should be added to SSA, aiming at tumour control that also improve CS (dose‐escalation of SSA, loco‐regional therapies, PRRT, everolimus and interferon‐alpha) or direct hormone secretion control (telotristat ethyl).

Neuroendocrine Tumors and CS

Small-bowel NETs associated with CS are most commonly identified in the terminal ileum. Carcinoid syndrome has also been reported in patients with more proximal and appendiceal NETs. Most patients with CS have liver metastases at the time of the emergence of CS symptoms. Localized small-bowel NETs can produce biologically active substances, but symptoms are usually absent as these substances are inactivated in the liver. Substances produced in the liver are released into the systemic circulation, with some inactivation taking place in the lungs. Pelvic NETs (primary or metastatic), as well as NETs metastatic to lymph nodes and bones, can result in CS in the absence of liver metastases. Thoracic NETs and foregut NETs (bronchus, stomach, and duodenum) are less likely to cause CS, although a recent study suggested a higher prevalence of CS among patients with lung NETs than previously reported. Recent studies have suggested that pancreatic NETs may occasionally produce serotonin, resulting in CS. –

In an analysis of the proportion of patients 65 years or older with NETs and CS and associated clinical factors between April 2000 and December 2011 from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare databases, 9512 eligible patients were diagnosed with NETs, of whom 1786 (19%) had CS. The proportion of patients with NETs and CS increased from 11% of 465 patients in 2000 to 19% of 854 patients in 2011 (P < 0.0001). Patients with CS were more likely to be female (61%; P = 0.0003) and non-Hispanic white (84%; P < 0.0001). Carcinoid syndrome was associated with inferior survival.

GEP-NET epidemiology and functional syndromes — key figures: In the United States, the age-adjusted incidence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) per 100,000 persons rose from 4.9 in 2000 to 8.19 in 2018. In a study of data gathered between 2000 and 2011, 32.4% of 2,211 patients with small bowel NETs had symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Approximately 10%-20% of patients with pancreatic NETs (panNETs) are reported to have one of several clinical syndromes as a result of hormone excess.

6 E. SUMMARY

This ENETS guidance paper, developed by a multidisciplinary consensus task force, provides up‐to‐date and practical advice on the diagnosis and management of CS and CHD, based on recent developments and using the recent ENETS Echo synoptic report in CHD patients. Hopefully, these recommendations will pave the road for more standardised care for our CS and CHD patients resulting in improved outcomes. Upcoming studies aimed to fulfill the gap will allow us to focus on many unmet needs in this field.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Xermelo was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 90 patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and carcinoid syndrome diarrhea. Patients reported between 4 to 12 bowel movements daily despite the use of SSA therapy at a stable dose for at least 3 months [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Placebo or Xermelo 250 mg was administered three times daily for 12 weeks. Concomitant anti-diarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide) were used by 43% (36% and 51% in the placebo and Xermelo group, respectively), pancreatic enzyme replacement medications by 39% (36% and 42% in the placebo and Xermelo group, respectively), and opioid analgesics by 29% (24% and 33% in the placebo and Xermelo group, respectively) of patients during the 12-week double-blind period of the trial.

Table 1 below lists adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 5% in the Xermelo group (N = 45) and at an incidence greater than placebo (N = 45) during the 12-week placebo-controlled period of the trial.

In another placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with carcinoid syndrome diarrhea and less than 4 bowel movements per day, the following additional adverse reactions, not listed in Table 1, of abdominal pain (including upper and lower abdominal pain, abdominal distention and gastrointestinal pain) and constipation were reported in at least 5% of patients in the Xermelo treated group and at an incidence greater than placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Less Common Adverse Reactions:

The following is a list of adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of patients receiving Xermelo during the 12-week placebo-controlled period of the clinical trial:

Investigations: increased alkaline phosphatase, increased alanine aminotransferase, and increased aspartate aminotransferase.

Fecaloma was reported in one patient treated with Xermelo during the 36-week open-label extension period following the 12-week double-blind period of the trial.

Dose escalation of somatostatin analogs (SSAs) for carcinoid syndrome — octreotide long-acting repeatable: The current recommended dose of long-acting octreotide is 30 mg once every 4 weeks to control diarrhea and flushing associated with carcinoid syndrome or VIPoma, and the only prospective comparative study looked at octreotide long-acting repeatable 30 mg once every 3 weeks v historical controls receiving 30 mg once every 4 weeks; with the higher dose, Forty percent reported normalization, and 60% reported control of symptoms (flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm), and based on limited evidence, the use of an increased dose of SSAs appears to improve symptoms with minimal increased risk of toxicity although there has been little study on the rate of adverse events with increased doses of SSAs.

### Frequency of carcinoid syndrome at neuroendocrine tumour diagnosis: a population-based study [^116n8Hqi]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) can secrete bioactive amines into the bloodstream, causing carcinoid syndrome, with symptoms including flushing and diarrhoea. However, carcinoid syndrome frequency in the NET population has never been rigorously assessed, nor has its relationship to presenting clinicopathological characteristics. This analysis assessed the proportion of patients with NETs and carcinoid syndrome in the United States and associated clinical factors.

Methods

We identified patients (≥ 65 years of age) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, excluding those with pancreatic tumours or small-cell or large-cell lung cancer, as well as those without complete data. We assessed the incidence of patients with at least two insurance claims of flushing, diarrhoea, or carcinoid syndrome during the 3 months before and after NET diagnosis. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with and without carcinoid syndrome using χ 2 tests. We used the Cochran-Armitage trend test to identify trends in carcinoid syndrome incidence and Cox regression to assess the relationship between carcinoid syndrome and survival.

Findings

Between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2011, 9512 eligible patients were diagnosed with NETs, of whom 1786 (19%) had carcinoid syndrome. The number of patients with NETs and carcinoid syndrome increased from 50 (11%) of 465 patients in 2000 to 160 (19%) of 854 in 2011 (p < 0·0001). The proportion of patients with carcinoid syndrome compared with those without did not differ significantly with respect to age at diagnosis (p = 0·65), geographical region (p = 0·054), or urban versus rural status (p = 0·53). Patients with carcinoid syndrome were more frequently female than male (p = 0·0003). Race was associated with a significant difference in the reported incidence of carcinoid syndrome (p < 0·0001), as was tumour grade, stage, and primary tumour site (all p < 0·0001). Patients with carcinoid syndrome had a shorter overall survival (median 5 years [95% CI 4·5–5·4]) than did those without carcinoid syndrome (5·6 years [5·4–5·9]; hazard ratio 1·102 [1·016–1·194]; p = 0·019). Use of octreotide (p < 0·0001) and chemotherapy (p = 0·003) were more common in patients with carcinoid syndrome than in those without it, whereas surgery was used more frequently in patients without carcinoid syndrome (p = 0·009); use of radiotherapy was not significantly associated with the presence of carcinoid syndrome at diagnosis (p = 0·07).

Interpretation

This population-based analysis reveals that carcinoid syndrome is significantly associated with tumour grade, stage, and primary tumour site, and leads to shorter survival compared with those patients without carcinoid syndrome. An improved understanding of the heterogeneity of presenting symptoms among patients with NETs might permit more tailored assessment and management than at present and enable future research into the effect of carcinoid syndrome control on patient survival.

PRRT — role in refractory carcinoid syndrome and SSA continuation: PRRT is usually relevant in the setting of tumor growth and may be preferred for control of symptoms of persistent refractory carcinoid syndrome following attempts to control symptoms with previously recommended therapy options, such as dose escalation of SSAs, liver-directed therapy, or telotristat ethyl (Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Conditional). Concomitant use of SSAs in patients with carcinoid syndrome following PRRT is recommended.

To establish a diagnosis, patients should have abdominal and pelvic imaging and chest imaging in select cases, a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and assign a tumor grade, somatostatin receptor-based imaging, and biochemical evaluation. Standard imaging procedures consist of contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), frequently in conjunction with somatostatin receptor–based imaging. Gallium 68 DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/MRI somatostatin receptor–based imaging is preferred over somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (Octreoscan, Curium US LLC, Maryland Heights, Mo), given the superior sensitivity of PET imaging. –

Biochemical assessment is essential in patients with clinical evidence of hormone hypersecretion. Testing of amine markers (eg, serotonin, histamine), as well as neuropeptide biomarkers such as chromogranin A, pancreastatin, gastrin, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal peptide should be considered based on the presentation. The production of serotonin is best assessed by measuring the serotonin metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), either in a fasting plasma sample or a timed urine collection. Plasma 5-HIAA levels correlate well with 24-hour urine levels and are more convenient. Serotonin measurement is generally not needed. Chromogranin A remains the most commonly used marker but suffers from a lack in both sensitivity and specificity and the results rarely change the management. Pancreastatin has been suggested as a marker for tumor burden in both pancreatic NETs and small-bowel NET, – but awaits further validation.

3 B. DIAGNOSIS

The presence of CS should be actively scrutinised by history taking, physical examination, and laboratory analysis.

Q1: How should the clinician assess a patient with suspected CS and CHD at presentation, and during the follow‐up?
Clinical evaluation of these patients is challenging. However, some clinical key findings may help when CS is suspected.

Diarrhoea is often the presenting symptom of CS, with a prevalence as high as 60–80% among NET patients with elevated urinary 5‐HIAA (u5‐HIAA); it is defined as alterations in stool consistency, frequency, volume, and weight. It may be intermittent or continuous, and the coexistence of increased frequency (≥ 3 loose stools) as well as reduced consistency for greater than 4 weeks defines chronic diarrhoea. Personal/family history of chronic/neoplastic gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal surgery, and co‐existence or history of pancreatic or systemic diseases should also be investigated.
Flushing, a clinical hallmark of CS, is reported in over 90% of cases (either by the patient and/or by his/her family members); it is an intermittent or persistent sensation of warmth together with skin erythema, usually involving the head, neck, and upper part of the torso, with telangiectasia in longstanding disease. In CS, flushing is usually not associated with sweating ('dry flushing'). It is the result of circulating vasoactive substances, inducing cardiovascular abnormalities (hypo‐/hypertension, brady‐/tachycardia). Specific flushing features depend on the primary tumour and four different types of flushing have been described in CS: The first type is the diffuse, erythematous flush, usually affecting the face, neck, and upper chest. This flush is commonly of short duration, lasting from 1 to 5 min, and is related to the debut of CS. The second type is similar to the first type but is violaceous and may last longer, together with facial telangiectasia, being observed in long‐term CS from advanced intestinal NETs and is normally not felt by the patients because they have become adapted to the flushing reaction. The third type is prolonged, lasting for hours up to several days, sometimes involving the whole body, being associated with profuse lacrimation, swelling of the salivary glands, hypotension, and facial oedema. It is usually associated with lung NETs. The fourth type (mediated by histamine production), bright red and patchy, may be seen in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and advanced type 1 gastric NETs. Rarely, type 3 gastric NEN may lead to " atypical carcinoid syndrome " in which flushing can be cherry red, patchy, sharply demarcated, serpiginous, and pruritic.
Bronchospasm is a rare manifestation of the CS, being reported in approximately 15% of patients, tending to develop concurrently with flushing, sneezing and dyspnoea and linked to histamine and serotonin secretion by the tumour.
All patients with CS should be questioned and examined for symptoms and physical signs of CHD and consequent RHF including fatigue, dyspnoea, elevated jugular venous pressure, heart murmurs, hepatomegaly, peripheral oedema, and/or ascites. Over 11–27% of patients with moderate to severe tricuspid damage have no or mild symptoms, resulting in delay in diagnosis. Because clinical assessment alone lacks sensitivity to detect CHD, specific biochemical and imaging examinations are required in all patients with CS (Figure 1).
Early malnutrition screening should be planned in all patients with CS, and regularly repeated during follow‐up.

### Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors treatment-NCI… [^114maM5D]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Option Overview Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors.
- The following types of treatment are used:

- Surgery
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- Hormone therapy
- Treatment for carcinoid syndrome may also be needed.
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Targeted therapy
- Treatment for gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up care may be needed. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow.

The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Hormone therapy Hormone therapy with a somatostatin analog is a treatment that stops extra hormones from being made. GI neuroendocrine tumors are treated with octreotide or lanreotide which are injected under the skin or into the muscle. Octreotide and lanreotide may also have a small effect on stopping tumor growth.
- Hormone therapy with a somatostatin analog stops extra hormones from being made. Carcinoid syndrome is treated with octreotide or lanreotide to lessen flushing and diarrhea. Octreotide and lanreotide may also help slow tumor growth.
- Interferon therapy stimulates the body's immune system to work better and lessens flushing and diarrhea. Interferon may also help slow tumor growth.
- Taking medicine for diarrhea.
- Taking medicine for skin rashes.
- Taking medicine to breathe easier.
- Taking medicine before having anesthesia for a medical procedure. Other ways to help treat carcinoid syndrome include avoiding things that cause flushing or difficulty breathing such as alcohol, nuts, certain cheeses and foods with capsaicin, such as chili peppers. Avoiding stressful situations and certain types of physical activity can also help treat carcinoid syndrome. For some patients with carcinoid heart syndrome, a heart valve replacement may be done.
