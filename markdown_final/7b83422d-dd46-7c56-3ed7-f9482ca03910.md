## Question

When to consider pcp prophylaxis in patients with prednisolone with history of Allogrneic bone marrow transplantation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to consider Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis in a patient with a history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who is now receiving prednisolone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risk of PCP in allogeneic transplant recipients and how long that risk persists. Then, I should verify how prednisolone modifies that risk and whether there is a dose–duration threshold that triggers prophylaxis. Next, I will review guideline-based recommendations for timing, duration, and agent selection. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, monitoring, and how to individualize decisions, including when to stop prophylaxis safely.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk context. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation confers a substantial and time-dependent risk of PCP, with most cases historically clustering early after transplant and a meaningful late risk in those with ongoing immunosuppression; without prophylaxis, incidence estimates around 2.5% have been reported, and late infections often occur after prophylaxis is stopped, underscoring the need for sustained prevention in at-risk patients [^dbb52669].

> Wait, let me verify the standard prophylaxis window. Standard practice is to provide PCP prophylaxis from engraftment through at least 6 to 12 months post-transplant, and many centers extend to a full year; importantly, if chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is present or immunosuppression continues beyond a year, prophylaxis should be maintained for the duration of immunosuppression and for some time after it ends, given persistent T-cell defects and late infection risk [^c4e13116] [^dae33af1].

> I need to check how prednisolone changes the equation. Prednisolone, like other systemic corticosteroids, is a major independent risk factor for PCP in non-HIV immunocompromised hosts; the most consistently cited threshold is prednisone (or equivalent) at or above 20 mg daily for at least 4 weeks, with risk rising as dose and duration increase, and tapering does not immediately restore host defenses, so the risk persists during and shortly after the steroid course [^27ce7a25] [^b2d2dcd8] [^e32ff97d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether transplant-specific guidance aligns with oncology and rheumatic disease thresholds. The ASCO/IDSA cancer guideline explicitly recommends PCP prophylaxis when regimens include prednisone equivalents of 20 mg daily or more for at least 1 month, and transplant guidance emphasizes continuing prophylaxis for the entire duration of immunosuppression in cGVHD, which frequently includes prednisolone, so prednisolone at or above 20 mg daily in an allogeneic transplant recipient clearly meets criteria for prophylaxis during and beyond the standard post-transplant window if steroids continue [^27ce7a25] [^b2d2dcd8] [^dae33af1] [^9f3b6900].

> Let me consider the practical trigger points. I should confirm that prednisolone 20 mg daily for 4 weeks or more is the key threshold; many transplant and oncology pathways operationalize this as a hard trigger to start or continue TMP-SMX, and even lower daily doses can be sufficient when combined with other immunosuppressants or in the setting of cGVHD, so I need to ensure I account for cumulative immunosuppression rather than steroids alone [^27ce7a25] [^dae33af1] [^9f3b6900].

> Next, I should review duration and when it is safe to stop. If prednisolone is ongoing, prophylaxis should continue for the duration of steroid therapy and, in many cases, for at least 3 to 6 months after immunosuppression is discontinued, given the lag in immune reconstitution; in cGVHD, some guidelines advise prophylaxis for the entire duration of immunosuppression and even longer in select high-risk scenarios, so I need to individualize based on lymphocyte recovery, concurrent agents, and GVHD status [^c4e13116] [^dae33af1] [^9f3b6900].

> I will now examine agent selection and alternatives. TMP-SMX is first-line; typical regimens include one double-strength tablet daily or three times weekly, with attention to renal function, potassium, and marrow suppression risks; if TMP-SMX is not tolerated, atovaquone or dapsone are reasonable alternatives, though TMP-SMX has the strongest evidence and should be preferred when feasible, especially in transplant recipients with higher risk profiles [^a93faad2] [^c4e13116] [^4c102ad4].

> But wait, what if the patient is already beyond the usual 6 to 12 month post-transplant window and now starts prednisolone for cGVHD flare or another indication? I should confirm that late-onset PCP risk is real and that prophylaxis is indicated anew in this situation; indeed, late PCP clusters in patients with ongoing immunosuppression and low CD4 counts, and transplant cohorts show cases occurring months after stopping prophylaxis, so starting or resuming prophylaxis with prednisolone exposure is appropriate and guideline-concordant [^dbb52669] [^dae33af1] [^9f3b6900].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework. Start or continue PCP prophylaxis if prednisolone is 20 mg daily or more for at least 4 weeks, or if there is ongoing immunosuppression for cGVHD regardless of exact steroid dose, and continue for the duration of steroids plus at least 3 to 6 months after stopping immunosuppression; if prednisolone is below 20 mg daily but there are additional risk factors such as cGVHD, lymphopenia, or concurrent immunosuppressants, consider prophylaxis based on cumulative risk and patient-specific factors, recognizing that many transplant patients meet criteria even at lower steroid doses when other risks coexist [^27ce7a25] [^dae33af1] [^9f3b6900].

> I should double-check special scenarios. In patients with repeated or prolonged steroid bursts, cumulative exposure matters; even if each burst is shorter than 4 weeks, the aggregate risk may justify prophylaxis, particularly in cGVHD or with other immunosuppressants; conversely, if prednisolone is rapidly tapered and discontinued with recovery of lymphocyte counts and no ongoing immunosuppression, stopping prophylaxis after a cautious interval may be reasonable, but I need to ensure close follow-up for early infection signs given the narrow therapeutic window in non-HIV PCP [^dae33af1] [^c4e13116] [^25b63b3a].

> Finally, I need to ensure monitoring and counseling are in place. Check renal function and potassium with TMP-SMX, screen for G6PD deficiency if considering dapsone, and counsel on adherence because breakthroughs often reflect interruptions rather than true prophylaxis failure; maintain a high index of suspicion for PCP in immunocompromised patients with dyspnea and hypoxemia, and remember that early treatment improves outcomes, so delays in recognition or therapy should be avoided [^a93faad2] [^25b63b3a] [^3e48b483].

Patients with a history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who are receiving prednisolone should receive **PCP prophylaxis** when the prednisolone dose is ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks [^27ce7a25] or when there is ongoing immunosuppression from chronic GVHD or other immunosuppressants [^dae33af1]. TMP-SMX is **first-line** [^a93faad2]; if not tolerated, use atovaquone or dapsone [^4c102ad4]. Continue prophylaxis for the duration of steroid therapy and for at least 6 months after stopping immunosuppression, or until CD4+ count is ≥ 200 cells/µL, whichever is longer [^c4e13116] [^f777a7ea].

## Risk factors for PCP in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients

Allogeneic BMT recipients are at **high risk** for PCP due to prolonged immunosuppression and T-cell dysfunction [^c4e13116]. Key risk factors include:

- **High-dose corticosteroids**: Prednisolone ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks significantly increases PCP risk [^27ce7a25] [^b2d2dcd8].
- **Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)**: Ongoing immunosuppression for GVHD maintains high risk [^dae33af1] [^9f3b6900].
- **Low CD4+ T-cell counts**: CD4+ < 200 cells/µL is a strong predictor of PCP risk [^f996132e].

## Guidelines for PCP prophylaxis in allogeneic BMT recipients receiving prednisolone

Current guidelines recommend **PCP prophylaxis** in allogeneic BMT recipients receiving prednisolone under the following conditions:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Prednisolone ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks | Initiate prophylaxis [^27ce7a25] [^b2d2dcd8] |
| Chronic GVHD requiring ongoing immunosuppression | Initiate prophylaxis for the duration of immunosuppression [^dae33af1] [^9f3b6900] |
| Autologous or allogeneic BMT (standard risk) | Prophylaxis for at least 6–12 months post-transplant [^c4e13116] |

---

## Recommended prophylactic regimens

TMP-SMX is **first-line** [^a93faad2]; alternatives are used for intolerance:

- **First-line regimen**: TMP-SMX 1 double-strength tablet daily or 1 single-strength tablet daily [^a93faad2].
- **Alternative regimens**: Atovaquone 1,500 mg orally twice daily, dapsone 100 mg orally daily, or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly [^a93faad2] [^4c102ad4].

---

## Duration of prophylaxis

The duration of prophylaxis depends on the **clinical context**:

- **Standard-risk patients**: Continue for at least 6–12 months post-transplant, or until 3–6 months after discontinuation of all immunosuppressive therapy, whichever is longer [^c4e13116].
- **High-risk patients (e.g. chronic GVHD)**: Continue for the duration of immunosuppression and for at least 6 months after stopping immunosuppression [^dae33af1] [^9f3b6900].
- **Patients with low CD4+ counts**: Continue until CD4+ count is ≥ 200 cells/µL for at least 3 months [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of prophylaxis

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure **efficacy and safety**:

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for hematologic toxicity, renal impairment, and hypersensitivity reactions with TMP-SMX [^notfound].
- **Adjust based on tolerance**: Switch to alternatives if TMP-SMX is not tolerated [^a93faad2] [^4c102ad4].
- **Reassess risk**: Periodically reassess PCP risk as immunosuppression is tapered or discontinued [^c4e13116].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness of prophylaxis

PCP prophylaxis significantly reduces **incidence and mortality** in immunocompromised patients, including allogeneic BMT recipients [^6a053d51]. TMP-SMX prophylaxis reduces PCP incidence by approximately 85% and PCP-related mortality by about 83% [^6a053d51].

---

## Special considerations

- **Drug interactions**: Be aware of interactions between TMP-SMX and other immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate, which may increase toxicity risk [^3754570e].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients on adherence and recognition of PCP symptoms to ensure timely intervention [^02567e19].

---

Patients with a history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who are receiving prednisolone should receive **PCP prophylaxis** when the dose is ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks or when there is ongoing immunosuppression. TMP-SMX is first-line, with alternatives for intolerance, and prophylaxis should continue for the duration of steroid therapy and for at least 6 months after stopping immunosuppression, or until CD4+ count is ≥ 200 cells/µL.

DISCUSSION

Our study focused on PCP prophylaxis in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy for solid tumours or haematologic malignancy. Although the mechanisms of immune compromise in this population are multifactorial, corticosteroid therapy is a significant and readily identifiable risk factor, providing opportunity for modification of prescribing practices relevant to prophylaxis.

We have identified differences in proportion of patients with solid tumours receiving chemoprophylaxis compared to patients with haematologic malignancy. This may be attributed to the use of prescriber guidelines within some groups of haematology patients at PMCC. However, even in this group, a large proportion (36.4%) were not prescribed chemoprophylaxis, and the observed number of cases of PCP (seven out of 13) in haematology patients would suggest significant under-prescribing. Our estimation of incidence of PCP is based upon a number of assumptions, including consistency of hospital bed-days, indications for corticosteroid therapy, and proportion of solid and haematological malignancy treated at PMCC during the study period. Community-based prescription of corticosteroid therapy was not captured, leading to possible overestimation of incidence.

In our series, predisposing corticosteroid therapy was not administered in 11 patients with PCP. Only two cases had solid tumours, suggesting that the vast majority of at-risk patients with solid tumours can be identified on the basis of corticosteroid therapy. Nine cases had haematological malignancy. Given the heterogeneity of potential risk factors in this subgroup, distinct recommendations for prophylaxis must be based upon the underlying disease or predisposing chemotherapy. For example, chemoprophylaxis should be administered for 6 months following engraftment in allogeneic transplant recipients. This may be extended where immunosuppressive therapy or chronic GVHD persists beyond 6 months. Chemoprophylaxis should be considered in autologous stem cell transplant recipients with underlying lymphoma or leukaemia, intense conditioning regimens, or recently administered fludarabine or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Patients receiving alemtuzumab therapy should receive PCP chemoprophylaxis for at least 2 months after therapy.

Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis is effective in patients not infected with HIV.showed that TMP–SMX (administered on weekends only) eliminated all cases of PCP in a population of heart transplant recipients, compared to 4% incidence prior to prophylaxis. TMP–SMX has been shown to be an effective prophylaxis in patients with cancer. Daily and thrice weekly dosing regimens have demonstrated equivalence in patients with leukaemia, and twice weekly dosing has been shown to be effective in allogeneic transplant recipients.

Alternative agents

As demonstrated in HIV-infected patients, alternative prophylactic agents may be used, but are associated with higher rates of failure. Dapsone prophylaxis (50 mg three times per week) in allogeneic transplant recipients has a significantly higher incidence of failure when compared to TMP–SMX. Aerosolised pentamidine (150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg per month) used after bone marrow transplantation has been shown to be inferior to TMP–SMX for PCP prophylaxis and associated with an increased risk for developing toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients with antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Safety and tolerability of atovaquone prophylaxis (1500 mg daily) has been demonstrated in autologous stem cell transplant recipients, but studies of efficacy in non-HIV-infected patients are lacking. Use of clindamycin (300 mg daily) and primaquine (15 mg daily) for prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients is associated with a higher risk for developing PCP than the TMP–SMX prophylaxis. Efficacy of clindamycin/primaquine for prophylaxis in patients with malignancy has not been reported.

Due to ease of administration and medical costs, we recommend that dapsone be used as second-line prophylaxis if TMP–SMX is contraindicated or not tolerated (Table 3). Nebulised pentamidine may also be used, and atovaquone may be considered in patients unable to tolerate TMP–SMX or dapsone.

Duration of prophylaxis

Although some have recommended that prophylaxis continue for 1 month after discontinuation of corticosteroids, extended duration may be required with other concurrently administered immunosuppressive therapies. For example, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil and fludarabine have all been associated with development of PCP in the absence of corticosteroid treatment, although the absolute risk is unclear. We recommend continued primary prophylaxis or lifelong secondary prophylaxis in the setting of ongoing immunosuppression (Table 3).

Prophylaxis in at-risk patients

In all, 73 patients receiving corticosteroid therapy of sufficient dose and duration were identified during the defined 6-month period. Of these, 22 (30%) had haematological malignancy and 51 (70%) had solid tumours. Table 2 lists the frequency of diseases in these populations. Figure 1 shows all patients who received ⩾25 mg prednisolone or ⩾4 mg dexamethasone daily for ⩾4 weeks, and the proportion who were also administered PCP prophylaxis. Significantly fewer at-risk patients with solid tumours received prophylaxis compared to patients with haematologic malignancy (3.9 vs 63.6%, P < 0.0001).

During this 6-month period, one case of PCP occurred in a patient not receiving chemoprophylaxis. Using the number of patients receiving corticosteroid therapy without PCP chemoprophylaxis as the denominator (57 patients in 6 months), the estimated crude incidence is 18 PCP cases per 1000 patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy for ⩾4 weeks.

Compared with untreated patients, those who received prophylaxis had fewer episodes of PCP and lived longer. Adverse reactions were common and included nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash, although these reactions also occurred commonly among patients who were not receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Only five patients had to discontinue prophylaxis. For patients receiving secondary prophylaxis, the regimen of 300 mg every 4 weeks was associated with substantially fewer episodes of PCP than the regimen of 30 mg every 2 weeks. There are insufficient data currently available from patients receiving primary prophylaxis to demonstrate statistically significant treatment effects among the regimens. The most common adverse effects during treatment were cough and, less frequently, wheezing — particularly among smokers and patients with a history of asthma.

On the basis of these interim results and existing epidemiologic data from natural-history studies, the Food and Drug Administration approved a treatment IND for aerosol pentamidine as both primary and secondary prophylaxis, recommending the 300-mg dose every 4 weeks and recommending delivery via the Respirgard II jet nebulizer. The indication for primary prophylaxis in the treatment IND is a CD4+ count of less than 200/mm3. These findings have been submitted to the FDA. A study using the Fisons nebulizer and three different doses of aerosol pentamidine has also been completed in the United States and is currently being evaluated.

RECOMMENDATIONS On the basis of the data summarized above and the opinions of individual members of the panel of experts, the Public Health Service recommends that — unless contraindications exist — physicians should initiate prophylaxis against PCP for any HIV-infected adult patient who has already had an episode of PCP, even if the patient has been receiving zidovudine. Unless contraindicated, prophylaxis should also be initiated for HIV-infected patients who have never had an episode of PCP if their CD4+ cell count is less than 200/mm3 or if their CD4+ cells are less than 20% of total lymphocytes. Since none of the regimens has been shown to be completely protective against PCP for HIV-infected persons, patients who receive prophylaxis should be monitored closely for evidence of PCP, as well as other pulmonary infections. If prophylaxis is discontinued, the patient will again be at increased risk for developing PCP.

Prophylaxis failures have been reported in which persons given aerosol pentamidine, especially at low doses, later had PCP in the upper lobes of the lung.

Patients who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are at risk for infection, particularly during the period of neutropenia. 1Neutrophils are critical to provide host defense against infection, particularly bacterial and fungal infection. The risk of infection increases with the depth and duration of neutropenia, and the greatest risk occurs in patients who experience profound, prolonged neutropenia after chemotherapy, which is most likely to occur in the period before engraftment during hematopoietic cell transplantation and after induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is an intervention that can reduce the risk of infection in immunosuppressed patients.

However, because of drug-related adverse effects as well as concerns with antimicrobial resistance, cost considerations, and the physiologic importance to the host of maintenance of equilibrium in the diversity and density of the host microbiome, the decision to administer prophylaxis requires a balance of benefits versus harms. The previous version of this guideline recommended antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis for higher-risk patients and recommended that there was not a high enough baseline risk of febrile neutropenia and infection-related mortality in lower-risk patients to warrant routine administration of these agents. 6This version of the guideline includes updated meta-analyses of antimicrobial interventions for the prevention of febrile neutropenia. The update of the 2013 ASCO Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prophylaxis for Immunosuppression in Adults Treated for Malignancy is being carried out in partnership with the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Background

Human pneumocystosis is a fungal infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, a cosmopolitan and opportunistic ubiquitous fungus. P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is potentially lethal, developing mainly in the lungs of profoundly immunocompromised patients. HIV infection, organ transplants and haematological malignancies are well-defined risk factors.

A review of the literature provided arguments to consider a pathophysiological association between P. jirovecii and the use of corticosteroids, and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines recommend prophylaxis when prednisone doses exceed 20 mg/day for longer than 1 month.

We present a case of a lethal PJP in a patient with metastatic lung cancer who received corticosteroids without prophylaxis.

### An analysis of the utilisation of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy at a cancer hospital [^e32ff97d]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection seen predominantly in immunosuppressed individuals, and with increasing frequency in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-negative patients. The case fatality rate among HIV-negative patients with PCP has remained approximately 50% over the last three decades, despite identification of risk factors, including malignancy, haematologic disorders, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, organ transplantation and CD4 + lymphopenia. In patients with solid tumours or haematologic malignancy, corticosteroid therapy is the most common predisposing risk factor for developing PCP.

Identifying patients who are at risk of PCP is important, as highly effective prophylactic strategies are available. Risk assessment based on intensity of corticosteroid therapy is possible as dose, duration and tapering of corticosteroid therapy appear to impact upon the risk for development of PCP. In a study of 116 HIV-negative patients with PCP, the median daily dose of corticosteroid was equivalent to 30 mg prednisolone, and the median duration of therapy before the onset of infection was 12 weeks. Sepkowitz et al have recommended that any patient with an underlying immunologic disorder (including malignancy) who receives the equivalent of at least 20 mg of prednisolone daily for more than 1 month be given prophylaxis.

The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC) is a tertiary care cancer centre which sees the full spectrum of malignant disorders. Since 1999, guidelines for trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole (TMP–SMX) prophylaxis have been utilised in patients receiving selected high-intensity chemotherapy protocols: hyper-CVAD, VAD, CEVAD and FLAG. Adherence to the guidelines and frequency of chemoprophylaxis in other patients with haematological malignancy or solid tumours is unknown.

The aims of this study were to (1) identify the potentially preventable cases of PCP, and (2) estimate the proportional use of suitable chemoprophylaxis in patients at risk for PCP on the basis of corticosteroid therapy. Finally, we propose a strategy for PCP prophylaxis in patients with haematological malignancy or solid tumours, who receive high-dose corticosteroid therapy.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with or without AIDS, France [^02567e19]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Our findings indicate that PCP prophylaxis could improve outcomes for high-risk patients without AIDS. Among non-AIDS patients in this study, 99 (30.8%) were SOT recipients, a population for which recent guidelines recommend PCP prophylaxis for 6–12 months, a period that might be extended on the basis of level of immunosuppression and immunosuppressive drug requirements. Despite this recommendation, however, recent studies suggest that 1 month of prophylaxis would be sufficient for kidney transplant patients. Given the high rate of death in our cohort, this conclusion should be challenged. Maintaining a high index of suspicion for PCP in immunocompromised patients appears to be of the utmost importance. In addition, as with AIDS patients, every effort should be made to ensure compliance with PCP prophylaxis in non-AIDS patients. Non-AIDS patients may be less aware than AIDS patients that they are at risk for PCP. This point may be of particular relevance, as the course of PCP was significantly more acute in non-AIDS patients, with a median symptom duration of 5 (range 1–15) days compared with 21 (7–30) days for AIDS patients (p < 0.0001). Educating non-AIDS patients about PCP might result in earlier medical evaluation and hospital admission and, consequently, in shorter lengths of time to PCP diagnosis and treatment. In addition, development of rapid and minimally invasive diagnostic tests could improve the early diagnosis and treatment of PCP.

We found marked differences in death rates across patient groups. Deaths were lowest for AIDS patients and highest for HSCT recipients, and rates in our study were consistent with earlier data. Microbial co-infection rates in our study were also in agreement with earlier data. More than one fourth of our patients overall had microbial co-infection, which indicates a need for comprehensive diagnostic investigations in patients with PCP and for routine broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug therapy when findings are atypical for PCP.

Adjunctive steroid therapy has been proven to increase survival in AIDS patients with severe PCP, but 2 small retrospective studies found that adjunctive steroids had no effect on survival for non-AIDS patients. In our study, although non-AIDS patients had more severe hypoxemia and more often required invasive mechanical ventilation, they received adjunctive steroid therapy significantly less often than did AIDS patients.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^17fbd297]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the established benefits of primary PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIID, the optimal prophylaxis schedule remains uncertain. One of the most important uncertainties is the timing of discontinuation of PJP prophylaxis. TMP‐SMX carries some risk of adverse events (AEs), some of which may be severe. Therefore, minimizing exposure to TMP‐SMX while preserving its optimal prophylactic efficacy is a logical next step in building evidence for the universal recommendation for primary PJP prophylaxis. In patients with HIV, the decision to discontinue primary PJP prophylaxis is guided by CD4 counts and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Guidelines recommend the cessation of prophylaxis when CD4 counts have risen to more than 200 cells/mmand are maintained for at least three months in response to ART. However, the correlation between CD4 counts and PJP risk is less clear in patients without HIV, including those with AIID, which renders CD4 counts a less reliable surrogate measure to direct prophylaxis. Although previous studies have suggested that PJP mainly occurs when a patient receives > 15 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent, it is uncertain whether this could be a relevant indication to consider the cessation of PJP prophylaxis. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with PJP infection despite prophylaxis and to offer insights into establishing an ideal primary prophylaxis regimen for patients with AIID.

### An analysis of the utilisation of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy at a cancer hospital [^3d9cdad8]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To study the relationship between use of prophylaxis and development of PCP, a retrospective case series of all confirmed cases of PCP treated at PMCC between 1994 and 2003 was performed. The proportion of at-risk patients receiving prophylaxis was estimated by a retrospective review of hospital pharmacy records, identifying the use of prophylaxis in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy during a 6-month period (2003).

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia cases

All patients with a discharge diagnosis of PCP from 1/1/1994 to 31/12/2003 were identified by ICD9-CM or ICD10-AM code. A case was defined as a patient with morphologic evidence of Pneumocystis by toluidine blue staining and/or direct fluorescent antigen detection in a respiratory specimen (sputum, induced sputum or bronchoscopy specimen). Corticosteroid therapy was defined as administration of prednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone in addition to any chemotherapeutic regimen containing dexamethasone or prednisolone components. Only cases receiving corticosteroid therapy prior to onset of PCP were studied.

Charts were reviewed, and demographic details, clinical findings, predisposing factors and treatment outcome established for each case. Dose of corticosteroid, duration of therapy prior to onset of symptoms and tapering of doses were determined. Other possible risk factors for PCP were analysed: radiation therapy, chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Use of prophylaxis (TMP–SMX, dapsone, pentamidine), and potential reasons for lack of prophylaxis (previous drug allergy or intolerance, patient not considered high risk by treating physician, patient requiring palliative care services, noncompliance) were documented.

Prophylaxis in at-risk patients

Pharmacy records for a 6-month period (1/6/03–30/11/03) were used to identify patients at PMCC who were at risk for development of PCP on the basis of steroid therapy and underlying malignancy. At-risk cases were defined as patients who were dispensed with ⩾25 mg prednisolone or ⩾4 mg dexamethasone daily for ⩾4 weeks. Chart review was performed to determine the demographic details and to identify concurrent use of PCP prophylaxis (as defined above).

Statistical analysis

Statistical comparison of patients with haematologic malignancy and solid tumours was carried out by the χ 2 -test, with P < 0.05 deemed significant.

Results

Study population

During the study period, a total of 117 patients with PCP were admitted to the ICU for respiratory support. Nineteen of these patients were excluded from the study because they had HIV infections. After excluding patients who were initially admitted to general ward from outpatient care with other cause (n = 29), those who were transfer to our hospital (n = 1), and those with an initial chief complaint that was unrelated to respiratory symptoms (n = 17), 51 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and a new infiltration on chest radiograph were included.

The patients' baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median patient age was 52.0 (IQR 40.5–66.0) years. Thirty-five (68.6%) patients were men. The main underlying conditions associated with the development of PCP included malignancies (n = 28, 54.9%) and history of solid organ transplant (n = 18, 35.3%). All of the patients were immunosuppressed before developing PCP. Twenty-two (43.1%) patients received systemic steroids. The median prednisolone-equivalent dose was 16.1 (6.2–34.7) mg/day in patients who received systemic steroids. Two (3.9%) patients had a history of receiving prophylactic TMP/SMZ.

Panel recommendations

The following recommendations are adapted for CAR T cell therapies from the US CDC, together with the IDSA and the ASTCT guidelines for preventing infections in patients undergoing allo-HSCT:

If a patient is febrile with positive bacterial blood cultures prior to infusion, appropriate antibacterial agents should be administered and CAR T cell infusion should be delayed until the patient is afebrile with negative cultures for at least 48 hours.
If a fungal infection is suspected, lymphodepleting chemotherapy should not be administered until appropriate antifungals have been initiated and fungal infection is controlled.
If nasal washes are positive for active viral infection (except for in cases of SARS-CoV-2, see next section) yet a patient is not in distress, then therapy may proceed when symptoms improve.
All patients should undergo prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia.
Prophylaxis for HSV/VZV virus reactivation can be considered (ie, with low-dose acyclovir).
The decision to administer antibacterial, antiviral, and/or antifungal prophylaxis should be risk-adjusted based on patient characteristics (ie, pediatric vs adult patients, prior lines of myelosuppresive therapy, and infection history).
If patients have high-risk historical features, such as a history of prolonged steroid use or active high-dose corticosteroid use, or are undergoing high-dose lymphodepletion or anticytokine therapy, then antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis should be strongly considered.
All patients who develop persistent neutropenia should have antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis.
Patients with active influenza infections should be treated with antiviral therapy and infusion held until resolution of major symptoms.

### An analysis of the utilisation of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy at a cancer hospital [^28c5a47a]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is associated with high mortality in immunocompromised patients without human immunodeficiency virus infection. However, chemoprophylaxis is highly effective. In patients with solid tumours or haematologic malignancy, several risk factors for developing PCP have been identified, predominantly corticosteroid therapy. The aims of this study were to identify the potentially preventable cases of PCP in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy at a tertiary care cancer centre and to estimate the frequency of utilisation of chemoprophylaxis in these patients. Two retrospective reviews were performed. Over a 10-year period, 14 cases of PCP were identified: no cases were attributable to failed chemoprophylaxis, drug allergy or intolerance. During a 6-month period, 73 patients received high-dose corticosteroid therapy (⩾25 mg prednisolone or ⩾4 mg dexamethasone daily) for ⩾4 weeks. Of these, 22 (30%) had haematologic malignancy, and 51 (70%) had solid tumours. Fewer patients with solid tumours received prophylaxis compared to patients with haematologic malignancy (3.9 vs 63.6%, P < 0.0001). Guidelines for PCP chemoprophylaxis in patients with haematologic malignancy or solid tumours who receive corticosteroid therapy are proposed. Successful primary prevention of PCP in this population will require a multifaceted approach targeting the suboptimal prescribing patterns for chemoprophylaxis.

RESULTS

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia cases

Out of 60 patients identified with a discharge diagnosis of PCP, 35 were excluded because no microbiological confirmation of PCP was made. Of the remaining 25 patients with confirmed PCP, 11 had no corticosteroid therapy administered prior to onset of PCP. Two of these had solid tumours (colorectal adenocarcinoma, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma) and nine patients had haematological malignancy (AML (three), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two), Hodgkin's disease (two), CLL (two)). In the subgroup with haematological malignancy, a number of predisposing factors were identified: external beam radiation (three), autologous stem cell transplantation (two), and chemotherapy with fludarabine (four), cyclophosphamide (three), cytarabine (three) and methotrexate (one). P. jirovecii pneumonia was the cause of death in three out of 11 cases.

Of the 14 patients who received steroid therapy prior to onset of microbiologically confirmed PCP, incomplete data were available for one patient (steroid therapy commenced prior to transfer from another institution). This patient was not included in analysis. Among the 13 analysed cases, the mean age was 56 years (eight males, five females). Table 1 summarises the underlying malignancy and corticosteroid therapy in cases. The median duration of corticosteroid therapy prior to onset of PCP was 35 days (range 18–92), and four cases (31%) were receiving tapering doses at diagnosis of PCP. There were no cases due to failed prophylaxis (no case received prophylaxis prior to onset of PCP), documented drug allergy or intolerance precluding consideration of prophylaxis. One case was receiving palliative care services prior to onset of PCP symptoms. Mortality attributed to PCP was 8%.

### Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in non-HIV immunocompromised patients [^6a053d51]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a disease affecting immunocompromised patients. PCP among these patients is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of PCP prophylaxis among non-HIV immunocompromised patients; and to define the type of immunocompromised patient for whom evidence suggests a benefit for PCP prophylaxis.

Search Methods

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to March 2014), LILACS (to March 2014), relevant conference proceedings; and references of identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing prophylaxis with an antibiotic effective against PCP versus placebo, no intervention, or antibiotic(s) with no activity against PCP; and trials comparing different antibiotics effective against PCP among immunocompromised non-HIV patients. We only included trials in which Pneumocystis infections were available as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in each trial and extracted data from the included trials. We contacted authors of the included trials to obtain missing data. The primary outcome was documented PCP infections. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the random-effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials performed between the years 1974 and 2008 were included, involving 1412 patients. Four trials included 520 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the remaining trials included adults with acute leukemia, solid organ transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Compared to no treatment or treatment with fluoroquinolones (inactive against Pneumocystis), there was an 85% reduction in the occurrence of PCP in patients receiving prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.62; 10 trials, 1000 patients). The evidence was graded as moderate due to possible risk of bias. PCP-related mortality was also significantly reduced, RR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.94; nine trials, 886 patients) (low quality of evidence due to possible risk of bias and imprecision), but in trials comparing PCP prophylaxis against placebo or no treatment there was no significant effect on all-cause mortality (low quality of evidence due to imprecision). Occurrence of leukopenia or neutropenia and their duration were not reported consistently. No significant differences in overall adverse events or events requiring discontinuation were seen comparing trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to no treatment or placebo (four trials, 470 patients, moderate quality evidence). No differences between once daily versus thrice weekly trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were seen (two trials, 207 patients).

Authors' Conclusions

Given an event rate of 6.2% in the control groups of the included trials, prophylaxis for PCP using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is highly effective among non-HIV immunocompromised patients, with a number needed to treat to prevent PCP of 19 patients (95% CI 17 to 42). Prophylaxis should be considered for patients with a similar baseline risk of PCP.

Guideline 8.7 – KTR: pneumocystis jirovecii infection- treatment and prophylaxis

We suggest:
All patients with confirmation (microscopy or PCR) of Pneumocystis jirovecii in respiratory secretions should be treated for 14 to 21 days with co-trimoxazole orally or intravenously (15–20 mg/kg in three or four divided doses) (2B)
Patients with contraindications to treatment with co-trimoxazole should receive pentamidine (4 mg/kg/day intravenously) (2B)
Adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy may be considered in patients with severe disease (2D)
All patients should receive 3–6 months of treatment with co-trimoxazole 480 mg daily for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis following renal transplantation (1B)

Rationale

Diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) requires confirmation by microscopy or PCR from respiratory secretions (induced sputum after inhaled saline or bronchoalveolar lavage). In non-HIV infected individuals, co-trimoxazole has been shown to be effective. Co-trimoxazole has excellent bioavailability and enteral administration is preferred, although intravenous therapy may be necessary in acutely unwell patients. In patients with contraindications to co-trimoxazole, intravenous or aerosolised pentamidine is a suitable alternative although it is associated with a higher rate of side effects. Alternative agents against pneumocystis jirovecii include dapsone or atovaquone. The duration of therapy should be between 14 and 21 days. The use of additional glucocorticoid therapy is not associated with improved survival in non-HIV patients, although treatment with prednisolone has been associated with quicker recovery from severe PCP infection in one small observational study. As a result, PCP prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole is recommended and has shown to be beneficial in meta-analysis of 12 randomised studies in 1245 immunocompromised individuals.

Immunosuppressive condition associated with P. jiroveci pneumonia-induced acute respiratory failure

All but one of the 27 HIV-negative patients were receiving corticosteroids at the time of admission (Table 3). The patient who was no longer undergoing steroid treatment at the time of admission had received chemotherapy following autologous bone marrow transplantation. In renal transplant recipients, the time between transplantation and PCP diagnosis was 70 (5 to 144) months. No HIV-negative patient was neutropenic, and the blood lymphocyte count was less than or equal to 1,000 cells per microliter in 17 patients. In the 10 renal transplant recipients, a chemoprophylaxis by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had been administered for 1 month after transplantation but had been interrupted later. The peripheral CD4 count was available in 6 HIV-negative patients and was 244 (32 to 699) cells per microliter. It was higher than 300 cells per microliter in 3 of these 6 patients.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening disease in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the preferred prophylaxis but has significant toxicity. We assessed 139 consecutive HCT patients for PCP prophylaxis in our center. According to our procedures, TMP-SMX should be given as first-line prophylaxis from engraftment. In case of intolerance, atovaquone (ATO) or aerosolized pentamidine may be given. Thirteen (9.3%) patients did not receive prophylaxis because they early died. Of the 126 prophylaxed patients, 113 (90%) received TMP-SMX and 13 (10%) received ATO as first-line regimen. However, only 51/113 (45%) patients received TMP-SMX as the sole prophylaxis: 60 patients were switched to ATO because of side effect. There were 18 PCP cases: 3 occurred before engraftment, 7 occurred under ATO, 3 occurred while prophylaxis was pending the resolution of side effects, and 5 occurred after stopping prophylaxis. No cases occurred under TMP-SMX while 7 (9.6%) cases occurred under first-(n = 13) or second (n = 60)-line ATO. There are many concerns about PCP prophylaxis after HCT: patients may develop PCP before engraftment or several months after stopping immunosuppressors, and half of them do not receive TMP-SMX all along the at-risk periods. New prophylactic drugs and strategies should be evaluated.

### Adjunctive corticosteroid use and clinical outcomes in non-HIV Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [^99e7ed87]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adjunctive corticosteroids improve outcomes in HIV-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), but their role in non-HIV patients is uncertain. Prior evidence has largely been limited to binary treatment groups and has rarely accounted for daily or cumulative dose effects.

Research Question

What is the dose-response relationship between adjunctive corticosteroids and outcomes in non-HIV immunocompromised adults with PCP requiring supplemental oxygen?

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort analysis of 375 non-HIV immunocompromised adults with proven or probable PCP hospitalized between 2019–2025. All patients were hypoxemic at treatment initiation. Corticosteroid exposure was modeled as a continuous, cumulative time-varying dose over 21 days using marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for baseline covariates and time-varying illness severity.

Results

Of 375 patients, 351 (93.6%) received corticosteroids. The most common etiologies of immunosuppression were hematologic malignancy (30%), solid tumors on chemotherapy (30%), autoimmune disease (17%), and solid organ transplantation (14%); 56% required ICU admission and 44% died within 90 days. Greater cumulative steroid dose was associated with increased risk of 90-day mortality (weighted HR 1.01 per 100 mg prednisone-equivalent, 95% CI 1.00–1.02, p = 0.006). Steroid exposure was not associated with risk of intubation (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.02) or faster liberation from advanced respiratory support (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98–1.02).

Interpretation

In non-HIV PCP with hypoxemia, higher cumulative corticosteroid exposure was not associated with improved respiratory outcomes and was linked to increased mortality. Use of doses exceeding trial-tested regimens should be approached with caution.

Pneumocystis jirovecii

Efficacy of prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has mostly been examined in patients receiving treatment with glucocorticoids. The exact dose and duration of treatment with glucocorticoids cannot be defined based on the available data thus far. However, prophylaxis in patients with various AIIRD receiving prednisolone more than 15–30 mg/day for more than 2–4 weeks, has been found to reduce episodes of PCP and associated mortality(table 6). On the other hand, in a study enrolling 184 patients with giant cell arteritis treated with high doses of glucocorticoids (average starting dose of 47 mg of prednisone/day), no PCP cases were recorded, while prophylaxis for PCP was given in only 5 patients.

Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP in patients treated with GC

Data for other antirheumatic treatments beyond glucocorticoids are very limited. Katsuyama et al found that patients with RA treated with bDMARDs, having also specific risk factors for PCP development, might benefit from prophylaxis for PCP. In 214patients with RA who received prophylaxis for PCP based on the presence of at least two risk factors (age ≥ 65 years, coexisting pulmonary disease and use of glucocorticoids), no PCP cases were reported, compared with the incidence observed (0.93/100 000) for patients with the same characteristics in whom prophylaxis for PCP was administered based on physician's discretion. In addition, in a small retrospective study, it was shown that annual incidence of PCP was lower in patients treated with cyclophosphamide who received PCP prophylaxis (5.33% (95% CI 0.65% to 19.24%)), compared with those who did not (9.50% (95% CI 1.15% to 34.33%)). Of note, in all but one of these patients, glucocorticoids were coadministered (mean maximum dose of prednisone: 39 mg/day). The most common prophylactic scheme in clinical practice and in published studies is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 480 mg/day or 960 mg three times a week. However, there are a handful of studies, including a RCT, suggesting that reduced dosing regimes (eg, 480 mg every other day) are equally effective and have fewer adverse effects(online supplemental table 5).

### Occurrence of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: a 6-year retrospective study [^dbb52669]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) has become a rare opportunistic infection due to the efficacy of prophylactic regimens. We conducted a 6-year retrospective study at our institution. A total of 13 cases of PCP were diagnosed among 519 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (2.5%). In three patients, PCP occurred within the first 5 months following HSCT. These severely immunocompromised patients were receiving prophylaxis and had concomitant aspergillosis that caused rapid death in two of them. In 10 other patients, PCP occurred a median of 14.5 months after HSCT. In all these patients, PCP prophylaxis had been discontinued, mainly because of the suspected bone-marrow toxicity of the prophylactic regimen. Median CD4+ T cell count was 131/microl at diagnosis. Seven of these 10 patients were receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic graft versus host disease and three had a relapse of their hematological malignancy. One patient died from PCP despite high doses of cotrimoxazole. We conclude that PCP is still occurring after allogeneic HSCT, mainly as a late complication in patients in whom PCP prophylaxis had been prematurely discontinued. Long-term PCP prophylaxis should be maintained in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs, and in those with low CD4+ T cell counts or a relapse of their hematological malignancy.

PCP with moderate or severe disease — systemic corticosteroids indication, timing, and dosing: On the basis of studies in both adults and children, a short course of corticosteroids is recommended in cases of moderate or severe PCP, starting within 72 hours of diagnosis (AI*). Indications for corticosteroid treatment include a PaO2 value of < 70 mm Hg or an alveolar-arterial gradient of > 35 mm Hg. A commonly used scheme is prednisone 1 mg/kg of body weight/dose twice daily on days 1 through 5; 0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose twice daily on days 6 through 10; and 0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose once daily on days 11 through 21. Alternative regimens include adult dosage of prednisone 40 mg/dose twice daily on days 1 through 5; 40 mg/dose once daily on days 6 through 10; 20 mg/dose once daily on days 11 through 21, and methylprednisolone IV 1 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours on days 1 through 7; 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily on days 8 through 9; 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily on days 10 and 11; and 1 mg/kg/dose once daily on days 12–16.

Guidelines

A. Approximately 5% of patients develop Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) after renal transplantation if they do not receive prophylaxis. PCP is a severe disease, with a very high fatality rate. Therefore, all renal transplant recipients should receive PCP prophylaxis. The treatment of choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), at a dose of 80/400 mg/day or 160/800 mg every other day, for at least 4 months. Patients who are treated for rejection should receive TMP-SMX prophylaxis for 3–4 months. B. In the case of TMP-SMX intolerance, aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg once or twice per month) is an alternative for prophylaxis. C. The first-line treatment of PCP is high-dose TMP-SMX. Patients with a PaO2 of < 70 mmHg initially should be treated parenterally, and the administration of additional steroids should be considered.

5.2.8.6 Prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection

Statement 101. We suggest that adult IBD patients on triple immunosuppression and using more than 20 mg prednisolone may be offered prophylactic antibiotics for Pneumocystis jirovecii (co-trimoxazole oral 960 mg three times weekly or 480 mg daily) (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 85.7%).

Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii using co-trimoxazole has been shown to reduce incidence by 91% in a meta-analysis of studies in transplant recipients and haematological malignancy. In the Spanish registry ENEIDA study of 571 patients treated with rescue therapy, two developed P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and one died. Both had received double immunosuppression (corticosteroids and azathioprine) and had not received prophylaxis, which was given to all receiving triple immunosuppression. The risk relates as much to use of corticosteroids as to other immunosuppressive drugs. A study from the USA showed a low incidence of PJP in IBD patients despite low use of prophylaxis. There were three cases identified among 937 patients with 6066 patient-years follow-up with wide confidence intervals around the risk related to each class of immunosuppressant. Overall risk is low. PJP prophylaxis should perhaps be restricted to those on triple therapy taking ≥ 20 mg prednisolone, particularly those with other risk factors (age, frailty, comorbidity). The optimal dose regimen is unclear, but in adults co-trimoxazole 960 mg three times per week or 480 mg daily are widely used. Stevens–Johnson syndrome is a rare but devastating complication of co-trimoxazole and should be discussed with patients when offering co-trimoxazole therapy.

Pneumocystis pneumonia corticosteroid guidance indicates use when PaO2 < 70 mm Hg at room air or alveolar- arterial oxygen gradient > 35 mm Hg. Prednisone dose is 1 mg/kg body weight/dose by mouth twice daily for 5 days, then 0.5–1 mg/kg body weight/dose by mouth twice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg/kg body weight by mouth once daily for days 11 to 21. Alternative corticosteroid regimens include adult prednisone 40 mg/dose twice daily on days 1–5, 40 mg/dose once daily on days 6–10, 20 mg/dose once daily on days 11–21, and methylprednisolone IV 1 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours on days 1–7, 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily on days 8–9, 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily on days 10 and 11, and 1 mg/kg/dose once daily on days 12–16.

### Pneumocystis in metastatic lung cancer, a pragmatic approach in support of prophylaxis [^f66d8917]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In patients with lung cancer, especially with brain metastasis, corticosteroids are commonly prescribed. Life expectancy is limited to a few months or years in most cases, and physicians do not prescribe chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis spp. A retrospective study showed that fewer patients with solid tumours (3.9%) received prophylaxis compared with patients with haematological malignancies (63.6%).

Lung cancer is at low risk of PJP (< 25 cases/100 000 patient-year) like other solid tumours, excluding central nervous system cancer. But for patients having solid cancer and being treated by corticosteroids, the incidence of PJP rises to 1.3%. Furthermore, PJP is usually more abrupt and fulminantamong patients with neoplastic disease, and its mortality rate is much higher, approaching 50%, and a significant risk factor of mortality with an OR = 2.66. In different studies, 55%–87% of patients with PJP had previously used corticosteroids, and 18%–31% had a solid tumour. The most important predisposing factor for developing PJP is the use of steroids, even at a low dose (equivalent to ≥ 20 mg/day prednisone for ≥ 1 month). ATS guidelines recommend prophylaxis when prednisone doses exceed 20 mg/day for longer than 1 month.

Recent guidelinesand two general reviewsrecommend prophylaxis for patients with solid cancer receiving prolonged, high-dose corticosteroid treatment (16–25 mg of prednisolone/day or ≥ 4 mg dexamethasone daily for ≥ 4 weeks) regardless of the stage of malignancy.

Concerning the toxicity of TMP–SMX, 85% of the patients do not experience any toxic effects. So, when steroids are prescribed for a patient with cancer, especially in metastatic diseases, we prioritise a pragmatic attitude: start a prophylaxis if survival exceeds 3 months.

Learning points

Corticosteroids are a major risk factor of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), adding to the risk of PJP in lung cancer.
Guidelines recommend PJP prophylaxis by trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX) when dose > 20 mg/day.
Side effects occur in 15% of cases, and discontinuation of the prophylaxis is required in 3% of patients treated.
Our pragmatic proposal: start a primary prophylaxis if survival exceeds 3 months, and eventually discuss alternatives in case of TMP–SMX intolerance.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) — We recommend prophylaxis with posaconazole for allogeneic HSCT recipients with GVHD who are at high risk for IA (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Prophylaxis with other mold-active azoles is also effective. Voriconazole is commonly used for prophylaxis against IA in high-risk patients but did not show improved survival in clinical trials (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Prophylaxis with itraconazole is limited by tolerability and absorption (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). We recommend continuation of antifungal prophylaxis throughout the duration of immunosuppression in patients with chronic immunosuppression associated with GVHD (corticosteroid equivalent of > 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone for > 2 weeks and/or the use of other anti-GVHD therapies, such as lymphocyte-depleting agents, or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) inhibition, for refractory GVHD) (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Management of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell-associated toxicities [^d5515b6f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Age significantly impacts HGGA rates, with pediatric patients showing higher incidences than adults or adolescents due to later development of immunoglobulin subclasses and plasma cell maturation. Patients with HGGA may require immunoglobulin replacement therapy, recommended at 0.2–0.4 g/kg every 3 weeks, though more frequent substitution could be necessary under intensive care due to potentially higher immunoglobulin consumption. It is critical to prevent IgG levels from dropping below 450 mg/dL, with various polyvalent immunoglobulins considered largely equivalent in efficacy. Antiviral, antifungal, and antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered based on the absolute ANC, especially in cases of neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days. Recommendations include acyclovir, PCP prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole, antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole, and antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin might be considered, emphasizing the importance of rapid antibiotic escalation in case of fever to cover a broad spectrum of pathogens.

Infections post-CAR-T therapy, heightened by compromised humoral and cellular immune responses from HGGA and lymphodepleting chemotherapy, peak within the first 10 days. Up to 42% of infections are reported in the first month, with about 21% occurring between days 29 and 90. Infections are related to HGGA severity and CRS, with a meta-analysis reporting a 34% rate of severe infections, predominantly respiratory-tract infections. Encapsulated bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, are particularly incriminated in this setting. Despite a morbidity rate lower than 2%, severe infections develop in 23–34% of patients. Risk factors for infectious complications overlap with those for hematotoxicity and/or HGGA, including previous allogenic HCT, multiple lines of pre-treatment immunochemotherapy (> 3 lines), baseline neutropenia (ANC < 500/µL) before lymphodepleting therapy, and the need for anti-IL-6-R agents and corticosteroids.

### Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia… [^42aa997c]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor A recent JAMA Insights article reviewed indications for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis in immunocompromised adults. 1 The authors commented that patients receiving corticosteroids at doses equivalent to at least 20 mg/d of prednisone for at least 4 weeks who have an additional cause of immunosuppression. To help decide whether PCP prophylaxis for patients with autoimmune disease is indicated, clinicians can consider the number needed to treat to prevent 1 episode of PCP balanced against the number needed to harm. In a systematic review of patients with malignancies, a PCP risk greater than or equal to 6. 2% determined the threshold for prophylaxis, 2 likely exceeding the PCP risk among patients with certain autoimmune disorders.

3 Among patients with cancer, the NNT was 19 to prevent 1 case of PCP. 2 In a study of patients with rheumatic disease receiving greater than 30 mg/d of prednisone for more than 4 weeks, PCP risk was higher for certain diseases, including microscopic polyangiitis and dermatomyositis. In another study of patients with rheumatologic illnesses receiving lower doses of corticosteroids, the NNT for patients receiving greater than or equal to 15 mg/d and less than 30 mg/d of prednisone or the equivalent was 204, exceeding the NNH of 45. 5 However, the NNT fell to 31 for a "high-risk" subgroup, defined as patients with baseline lymphopenia or receiving pulse-dose steroids. 5 It is unknown whether these calculations can be extended to other autoimmune diseases or to patients receiving corticosteroids in combination with newer, targeted biologic therapies, which may be less immunosuppressive.

Although steroids are an established risk factor for PCP, there is heterogeneity in the risk conferred by the underlying disease, concomitant immunosuppressive therapies, and patient comorbidities. When available, the NNT and NNH can inform decision-making regarding PCP prophylaxis. When unavailable, careful consideration of the abovementioned factors, in addition to corticosteroid dose and duration, may enable clinicians to balance the risk and benefit of administering PCP prophylaxis.

### Evolving health effects of Pneumocystis: one hundred years of progress in diagnosis and treatment [^8b5c6190]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

2009 marks the 100th anniversary of the first description of Pneumocystis, an organism that was ignored for much of its first 50 years but that has subsequently been recognized as an important pathogen of immunocompromised patients, especially patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We present a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who died from Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) despite appropriate anti-Pneumocystis therapy. Although substantial advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of PCP have decreased its frequency and improved prognosis, PCP continues to be seen in both HIV-infected patients and patients receiving immunosuppressive medications. Pneumocystis species comprise a family of fungi, each of which appears to be able to infect only 1 host species. Pneumocystis has a worldwide distribution. Immunocompetent hosts clear infection without obvious clinical consequences. Pneumocystis has been identified in patients with other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although its clinical impact is uncertain. Immunocompromised patients develop disease as a consequence of reinfection and possibly reactivation of latent infection. In patients with HIV infection, the CD4 count is predictive of the risk for developing PCP, but such reliable markers are not available for other immunocompromised populations. In the majority of patients with PCP, multiple Pneumocystis strains can be identified using recently developed typing techniques. Because Pneumocystis cannot be cultured, diagnosis relies on detection of the organism by colorimetric or immunofluorescent stains or by polymerase chain reaction. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the preferred drug regimen for both treatment and prevention of PCP, although a number of alternatives are also available. Corticosteroids are an important adjunct for hypoxemic patients.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia in intensive care: clinical spectrum, prophylaxis patterns, antibiotic treatment delay impact, and role of corticosteroids. A French multicentre prospective cohort study [^25b63b3a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The second unexpected finding was that a non-negligible proportion of patients received the first dose of curative antibiotic treatment for PJP late: among patient not yet treated upon ICU admission, 12.7% received the first dose after the 96th hour. This is in line with what was reported years ago, suggesting that the practices of intensivists may not have evolved since then. Despite a rich literature emphasizing the high index of suspicion of PJP when caring for immunocompromised patients with diffuse pneumonia, there still remains a considerable gap between theory and practice. Our study further suggests that early treatment is of paramount importance, as it reveals that a delay of 4 days accelerated the time to death by a factor 6.75. This aligns with findings from earlier retrospective studies and one prospective study, encompassing all PJP cases, whether requiring intensive care admission or not. That study demonstrated an increased risk of mortality of 1.11 for each day of delayed treatment. For obvious ethical reasons, a randomized controlled trial comparing early versus delayed treatment is not feasible. Our study, utilizing propensity score weighting, represents the highest methodological standard achievable in this scenario. Hence, based on common sense (early treatment seems inherently preferable) and our study's findings, along with prior evidence, the question appears settled: PJP should be treated as soon as the suspicion stage, and should be systematically considered in immunocompromised individuals presenting to the ICU with pneumonia and/or acute respiratory failure.

Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in non-HIV patients with PJP has been the subject of several studies, all retrospective, some of which suggesting that corticosteroids, akin to their effects in HIV-infected patients, might improve survival, while others found no significant impact. Two recent studies, one monocentric including 130 patients, and the other multicentric including 172 solid-organ transplant receivers, used PS-IPW as we did, and found no difference in mortality between patients treated with corticosteroids at the initiation of curative antibiotic treatment and those either untreated with corticosteroids or treated late. Our results, on the other hand, suggest that corticosteroid therapy may be associated with a twofold faster occurrence of death. Therefore, to date, there is still no unequivocal answer to the question of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for PJP in non-HIV patients. A definitive answer may come from a recently completed randomized trial, the results of which are pending (NCT02944045).

### Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in inflammatory bowel disease: when should prophylaxis be considered? [^51b2d6cf]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased over the past several decades with a corresponding increase in the number of patients on combination immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids, anti-metabolites and biologic agents. The exact incidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in IBD patients is unknown but there has been an increase in the number of reports of PJP in IBD patients on combination immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

We evaluated the published literature describing PJP infections in IBD patients, as well as other non-HIV cohorts and identified risk factors for PJP infection in this group of patients. Prophylaxis and treatment regimens were reviewed.

Results

Corticosteroid therapy, lymphopenia (total lymphocyte count < 600 cells/mm), and age greater than 55 years appear to be risk factors for developing pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. In addition, PJP mortality is greater in the non-HIV cohort in contrast to the HIV population. No evidence-based guidelines for primary PJP prophylaxis exist to direct practice for gastroenterology providers.

Conclusions

Better surveillance and reporting of opportunistic infections including PJP are needed to elucidate risk factors for acquisition of infection. Gastroenterology providers should continue to evaluate the need for PJP prophylaxis on a case-by-case basis to recognize patients who may benefit from primary PJP prophylaxis. In particular, older patients on corticosteroids, multiple immunosuppressive agents, and patients with lymphopenia should be considered for prophylaxis.

A man in his late 50s with a history of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis presented with fever and mild dyspnoea. He was HIV-negative and had been on corticosteroids as immunosuppression for 6 months prior to tapering them off 1 week before presentation. He was not taking prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. After unsuccessful treatment for community-acquired pneumonia, his condition worsened and he required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Full respiratory workup including bronchoscopy revealed P jirovecii as a source for the patient's infection. He was treated successfully with a 21-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and eventually weaned off the ventilator. He has had no complications to date. In our review of this case and the existing literature, we believe that proper utilisation of prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia may have prevented our patient's transfer to intensive care unit. In our article, we discuss this issue and explore current evidence for prophylaxis.

### Clinical course, treatment and outcome of Pneumocystis pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a retrospective analysis over 17 years [^6d9f44d9]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) is a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, which almost exclusively affects immunocompromised patients. PcP has long been known for its high prevalence among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Since the implementation of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) and chemoprophylaxis its incidence has been continuously decreasing. Nowadays, most patients with HIV-associated PcP are treatment-naïve with very low CD4 cell counts; some of these patients do not know that they are HIV positive until they attend hospital. On the other hand, PcP is also frequently diagnosed in non-HIV-positive patients as immunosuppressive regimens are being increasingly used in a wide range of patient populations. Consistently, the incidence of PcP in non-HIV-positive patients is increasing.

Pneumocystis infections have first been described in preterm infants following World War II and in patients with malignancies in the late 1960s, more than a decade before the HIV epidemic emerged. Defects in cell-mediated immunity and use of glucocorticoids are among the strongest risk factors for the development of PcP.

The epidemiology of PcP has been described in several retrospective studies. A study from the Mayo Clinic in 116 non-HIV-positive patients found that most frequent underlying diseases were hematological malignancies (30%), organ transplantation (25%), autoimmune disease (22%), solid tumors (13%) and other reasons. Although, most of these reports were published more than a decade ago and might not reflect the current epidemiological situation, a report from France was published a few years ago. Roux et al. reported overall mortality of 17.4%, which was significantly higher in non-HIV-positive patients (27%) than in HIV-positive patients (4%). A few parameters such as age, prior episode of PcP, low CD4 cell count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and coinfections have been reported to predict unfavorable outcome in patients with HIV infection. Reports on outcome predictors in non-HIV-positive patients are sparse.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii infection: an emerging threat to patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^b37446fc]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

History

Pneumocystis jirovecii was first recognized as a pathogen in premature infants developing an epidemic form of interstitial plasma cell pneumonitis in European countries during the Second World War. In 1952 the Czech pathologists Vanek and Jirovec described Pneumocystis as the causative agent of this endemic pneumonia. Since then PCP has only been reported sporadically in premature infants and malnourished young children. In the 1960s PCP started to be recognized as an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised children with congenital T cell immunodeficiency and in patients with haematological neoplasm such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphomas. After the introduction of trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) as PCP chemoprophylaxis, however, its incidence markedly decreased. With the emergence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic, there was a dramatic increase in the incidence of PCP. In the 1980s PCP was the most common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, and among them > 60% developed PCP during their disease course. In the 1990s the routine use of PCP prophylaxis and the widespread use of highly active anti-retrovirus therapy brought a substantial decline in the incidence of PCP among HIV-infected persons. As a result of the increased number of patients receiving immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy for solid tumours and haematological malignancies, organ and bone marrow transplantation, and inflammatory and rheumatic diseases, the clinical significance of PCP has been recognized in HIV-negative immunocompromised individuals.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^b04aa706]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In settings with a low prevalence of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, patients with hematologic malignancies constitute the largest risk group for developing PJP. Widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has significantly lowered the incidence of PJP in high-risk hematological patients, but PJP still occurs in high-risk patients not tolerating TMP-SMX or after discontinuing prophylaxis, and in low-risk patients not receiving prophylactic treatment, in particular patients who have received treatment with high-dose corticosteroids.

The recommended first-line treatment for PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies is TMP-SMX given at a high dose, 15–20 mg/kg of the TMP component, but the evidence supporting this high dose is anecdotal. TMP-SMX therapy may cause dose-dependent adverse events, and previous studies have shown that the standard high-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP may be correlated to an increased frequency of such adverse events.

In a recent meta-analysis analyzing reduced-dose vs standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality but an 18% absolute risk reduction of adverse events with reduced doses of TMP-SMX. However, few patients with hematological malignancies were included in this study, and it is thus unclear if these findings can be generalized to a hematological population. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by comparing clinical outcomes and adverse events in hematologic patients receiving a reduced vs standard dose of TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP.

The risk of infection with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in patients undergoing chemotherapy is closely related to the intensity of corticosteroid exposure. PCP is uncommon with classical (3-weekly) R-CHOP, but the risk may be higher with biweekly R-CHOP (R-CHOP-14) due to the increased frequency of prednisolone pulses. Among 47 consecutive patients treated with R-CHOP-14 at our institution, five (11%) developed microbiologically proven PCP, with a further two (4%) having classical clinical and radiological features of PCP, but without microbiological confirmation. None of these patients were HIV-positive or had additional risk factors for PCP. Our experience suggests that PCP prophylaxis should be considered in institutions using R-CHOP-14 for the treatment of patients with aggressive lymphomas.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for adult patients with cancer-related immunosuppression: ASCO and IDSA clinical practice guideline update [^ed8d917f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline on antimicrobial prophylaxis for adult patients with immunosuppression associated with cancer and its treatment.

Methods

ASCO and IDSA convened an update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies from May 2011 to November 2016. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel.

Results

Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated systematic review.

Recommendations

Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for patients who are at high risk of infection, including patients who are expected to have profound, protracted neutropenia, which is defined as < 100 neutrophils/µL for > 7 days or other risk factors. Herpes simplex virus-seropositive patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or leukemia induction therapy should receive nucleoside analog-based antiviral prophylaxis, such as acyclovir. Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis is recommended for patients receiving chemotherapy regimens that are associated with a > 3.5% risk for pneumonia as a result of this organism (eg, those with ≥ 20 mg prednisone equivalents daily for ≥ 1 month or on the basis of purine analog usage). Treatment with a nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor (eg, entecavir or tenofovir) is recommended for patients at high risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation. Recommendations for vaccination and avoidance of prolonged contact with environments that have high concentrations of airborne fungal spores are also provided within the updated guideline. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) — We recommend prophylaxis with posaconazole for allogeneic HSCT recipients with GVHD who are at high risk for IA (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Prophylaxis with other mold-active azoles is also effective. Voriconazole is commonly used for prophylaxis against IA in high-risk patients but did not show improved survival in clinical trials (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Prophylaxis with itraconazole is limited by tolerability and absorption (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). We recommend continuation of antifungal prophylaxis throughout the duration of immunosuppression in patients with chronic immunosuppression associated with GVHD (corticosteroid equivalent of > 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone for > 2 weeks and/or the use of other anti-GVHD therapies, such as lymphocyte-depleting agents, or TNF-α inhibition, or refractory GVHD) (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Acute GVHD is a risk factor for hepatotoxicity attributable to voriconazole that requires careful monitoring in this setting.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in renal transplant recipients occurring after discontinuation of prophylaxis: a case-control study [^ad04da61]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

A case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in renal transplant recipients. Eleven cases of PCP were matched with 22 controls. Cases occurred a median of 18 months after transplantation, and none of the recipients was receiving prophylaxis. Univariate analysis showed that graft rejection, duration of steroid use, use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and lymphocytopenia at the time of prophylaxis discontinuation were risk factors for PCP. In the multivariate model, only graft rejection (OR 8.66, p 0.017) remained significantly associated with PCP. In patients with a history of graft rejection, PCP prophylaxis should be maintained, especially among those with lymphocytopenia.

Materials and methods

Patient recruitment and eligibility criteria for the discovery cohort

Our discovery cohort consisted of patients eligible for matched unrelated or matched related HSCT at the Regensburg University Medical Center with HSCT between May 2012 and February 2015. Excluded from HSCT were patients with poor performance status (Karnofsky grade < 80, corresponding to ECOG ≥ 2), progressive underlying disease, pregnancy or breast-feeding, moderate or severe cardiac insufficiency, moderate or severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine levels > 2 mg/dl), high age (> 70 years), uncontrolled acute or chronic infection or patients with liver failure (serum bilirubin > 2 mg/dl, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) ≤ 2x upper normal level). From the cohort of 172 patients that underwent HSCT in the noted time period, 13 patients with repeated HSCT were excluded obtaining a cohort of 159 patients.

Transplantation and concomitant therapy for patients in the discovery cohort

Patients were admitted to hospital 6–16 days before HSCT. Conditioning regimens included chemotherapy with or without irradiation and started between 6 and 8 days prior to HSCT. Bone marrow or peripheral-blood mononuclear cells were not T-cell-depleted or cryopreserved before HSCT. For aGvHD prophylaxis, patients received one of two immunosuppressive regimens: cyclosporine and methotrexate, or cyclosporine and mycophenolate. In case of cyclosporine-associated toxicity, the latter was replaced by tacrolimus. Prior to HSCT (days −3 to −1), additional immunosuppressive prophylaxis with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG, Grafalon) was administered in patients receiving grafts from matched unrelated donors. Initial aGVHD treatment consisted of prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day with budesonide added in the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. For gastrointestinal decontamination, all patients received prophylactic rifaximin (200 mg twice a day) from start of conditioning until engraftment (absolute neutrophil count > 500/ µL). Upon signs of infection before and after HSCT, patients were treated with systemic broad spectrum antibiotics. For routine antifungal prophylaxis, patients received fluconazole or posaconazole, for pneumocystis-pneumonia prophylaxis, patients received cotrimoxazole. Upon signs of fungal infection, patients were treated with systemic mold active antifungal agents. Following HSCT, patients were monitored in the transplant unit and discharged after 28 days if clinically possible and subsequently regularly monitored in an outpatient setting.

### PCP prophylaxis with use of corticosteroids by neurologists [^114c0f30]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is increasingly reported in patients without HIV. Corticosteroids are a major risk factor, with up to 90% of patients receiving corticosteroid treatment prior to the development of PCP. In view of this, many specialties now prescribe PCP prophylaxis to patients receiving prolonged or high-dose glucocorticoid regimens. Neurologists frequently prescribe corticosteroids but may not be as aware of the risk for PCP. Here, we review the evidence for routine PCP prophylaxis among regular glucocorticoid users and ask what guidance there is on the subject for neurologists.

### Late effects of blood and marrow transplantation [^c4e13116]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Infectious diseases

All HCT survivors have some degree of immunodeficiency, particularly during the first year after HCT. If patients are able to stop immunosuppressive medications without GvHD or recurrent disease, many recover adequate immune function by one year after HCT. Patients with chronic GvHD, however, remain immunodeficient and have a high risk of infections. Common late infections are caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, encapsulated bacteria, fungi, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus, and respiratory viruses. Patients may report more frequent episodes of upper respiratory infections and sinusitis.

All patients should receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii for at least one year after HCT or until 3–6 months after all immunosuppressive medication is discontinued, whichever occurs later. The preferred drug is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but dapsone or atovaquone could be substituted for patients who are allergic to or intolerant of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

In particular, patients with chronic GvHD are highly susceptible to encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis due to low levels of opsonizing antibodies, low CD4 + T-cell counts, poor reticuloendothelial function and suppressive effects of immunosuppressive medications on phagocytosis. Vaccination against these bacteria is recommended. Efficacy of vaccination in increasing antibody levels has been shown in several prospective studies. Chemoprophylaxis is always recommended due to the unpredictable protection provided by vaccination. The first-line drug is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but if it is not tolerated, penicillin or azithromycin is substituted until 3–6 months after discontinuation of all immunosuppressive medications.

Invasive fungal infection occurs in 1% of patients after autologous HCT and in 6%–8% of patients after allogeneic HCT. GvHD and long-term use of corticosteroids have been a major risk factor associated with onset of invasive fungal infection. As recommended in the European guidelines, mold prophylaxis with posaconazole or voriconazole may be considered for patients with GvHD requiring high-dose corticosteroid treatment.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^22d1a5b6]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

PCP prophylaxis in kidney transplant recipients — timing, frequency, duration, and alternatives are described as follows: The most typical time of onset of symptoms of PCP is 6–8 weeks following initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. There was no difference in efficacy for PCP when trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was given daily or three times per week. Although the evidence for the optimal duration of PCP prophylaxis is limited, most centers provide prophylaxis at least for 6 months and perhaps for 1 year following transplantation. Because most KTRs will remain on immunosuppression for the rest of their lives, some experts recommend a more prolonged and perhaps even indefinite use of PCP prophylaxis. Indications for the use of alternative preventive agents include the development of allergic reactions and/or drug-induced neutropenia from trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and potential alternative agents include dapsone, aerosolized pentamidine, atovaquone or the combination of clindamycin and pyrimethamine. Treatment also decreased mortality.

### Risk for infections with glucocorticoids and DMARDs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^e8744a6a]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia

Data on incidence and prevention of PJP for non-HIV related immunosuppression are best established for solid organ transplant recipients, bone marrow transplant recipients and patients with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy. There are limited data for the incidence of PJP in patients with RA. Registry data suggest a higher risk of infections with rituximab compared with TNFi. Retrospective data for RA suggest that GC play a significant role in the risk for PJP, which is supported by data from other populations. There are also limited data on the use of PJP prophylaxis for patients with RA, but both retrospective and prospective cohort analysis support the use of prophylaxis for patients with RA at risk for PJP. More robust data would be beneficial to support the use of prophylaxis for this patient population.

Hepatitis B

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that can cause acute hepatitis as well as chronic hepatitis. Some patients develop latent infections that can reactivate in the setting of immunosuppression and cause fulminant disease. Rituximab appears to have the highest risk; one retrospective study showed that in 50 RA patients at risk for reactivation, four developed HBV reactivation, two of whom developed clinically significant hepatitis and one died as a result of their illness. There does not seem to be a significant difference in risk of reactivation with non-rituximab biologics or methotrexate therapy. Considering these risks of reactivations, the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) and the American College of Rheumatology recommend routine screening for patients with RA treated with immunosuppressives. The AGA has issued guidelines for treatment as well as for prophylaxis for at risk patients. High-risk patients — those who are HBsAg and HBcAb positive treated with high-dose GCs (> 20 mg prednisone equivalent dose for 4 weeks or more) or HBcAb positive patients treated with rituximab — are recommended to take antiviral prophylaxis while on treatment and up to at least 6 months after treatment.

Non-emergent use of corticosteroids for emesis control or transfusion reactions were prohibited until day 5, but use of systemic steroids and other immunosuppressants like tocilizumab was allowed based on individual patient risk factors suggesting a poor prognosis and the patient's overall clinical status as per the discretion of the treating physician. Hematologic support using formulary granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 µg/kg/day was initiated on day 5 and was administered daily until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reached ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 /L for 3 consecutive days as per institutional standards. Infection prophylaxis against bacterial, viral, and fungal (including Pneumocystis jiroveci) pathogens were initiated per institutional practice and in accordance with the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) guidelines for post-HCT infection prevention. Weekly cytomegalovirus (CMV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed to monitor for detectable levels requiring preemptive therapy. Letermovir was given for CMV prophylaxis to CMV seropositive patients upon FDA approval in November of 2017.

Managing treatment failure in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): Clinical failure is defined as lack of improvement or worsening of respiratory function documented by arterial blood gases after 4 to 8 days of anti-PCP treatment, and failure attributed to lack of drug efficacy occurs in approximately 10% of people with HIV with mild-to-moderate PCP disease. Clinicians should wait 4 to 8 days before switching therapy for lack of clinical improvement (BIII), and in the absence of corticosteroid therapy, early and reversible deterioration within the first 3 to 5 days of therapy is typical. However, there are not any convincing clinical trial data on which to base recommendations for the management of PCP treatment failure due to lack of drug efficacy.

### Monitoring of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs in patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^3a48121d]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians — immunosuppression-related infection risk and prophylaxis in lung disease and transplant candidates explains that infection is a major complication with risks from reactivation of latent disease and new infection and may result from suppression of immune cell function or bone marrow toxicity; intense combination therapy further increases opportunistic infection risk, and lung transplant recipients are typically given prophylactic therapies to prevent infections with CMV and other DNA viruses, P jiroveci, and Aspergillus. Lung transplant recipients receiving potent immunosuppressive regimens should be uniformly and carefully screened for evidence of active or latent TB prior to wait listing for lung transplantation, and if intensive immunosuppressive therapy similar to transplant regimens is used for nontransplant indications, prophylaxis for P jiroveci should be strongly considered.

### Adjunctive steroid in HIV-negative patients with severe Pneumocystis pneumonia [^3b5d2867]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is a major cause of acute respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients. Malignant disease, steroid treatment, and transplantation of solid organs or bone marrow are the leading causes of T-cell suppression, which is associated with a high risk of opportunistic infections, including PCP. The number of patients with T-cell suppression has risen in recent years, resulting in an increased incidence of PCP. In recent studies, more than 8% of patients with hematological malignancies admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure had PCP. Mortality rates of up to 30% have been reported in cancer patients with PCP.

Studies done in the 1990s showed that adjunctive treatment with high-dose steroids (HDS) was associated with a dramatic decrease in mortality during PCP episodes in HIV-positive patients. Corresponding proof of efficacy is not available for HIV-negative patients with PCP, and findings from the three available studies, all retrospective, are conflicting. In a 1998 study in 30 patients, the 16 patients given adjunctive HDS had no difference in mortality but spent less time on mechanical ventilation compared to the 14 patients managed without steroids. The second study, reported in 1999, compared 15 patients with HDS and 8 without HDS and found no significant differences in mortality or ICU stay length. The most recent study was published in 2011 and found no significant difference in mortality between the 59 patients given HDS and the 29 other patients. More over two retrospective studies from our group could not conclude of outcome improvement with adjunctive steroid in that setting. The small sample sizes may have jeopardized the ability of these studies to detect significant differences between patients given HDS and other patients.

The pathophysiology of PCP may differ between patients with and without HIV infection. Studies have shown that HIV-negative patients with PCP were older and had a larger number of co-morbidities, longer symptom duration at diagnosis, and higher neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, compared to HIV-positive patients. Conceivably, these differences between the two populations might affect the ability of steroid therapy to provide therapeutic benefits.

Here, our objective was to determine whether HDS produced therapeutic benefits in HIV-negative patients with severe PCP requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). To increase the sample size for our investigation, we included patients from four different sources, namely, three previously published studies and a teaching-hospital ICU database.

Discussion

PJP is a significant threat to immunocompromised children, occurring through either environmental exposure or reactivation of latent infection. The primary risk factors encompass impaired cell-mediated immunity and immunosuppressive therapy, particularly in patients undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancies, HSCT, or receiving high-dose corticosteroids. A recent multicenter study highlighted that patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and solid tumors experienced more severe PJP manifestations and higher mortality rates, with prior corticosteroid therapy (prednisone ≥ 10 mg daily) emerging as the sole immunosuppressant associated with 90-day mortality. Our cohort's disease distribution - acute leukemia (50%), lymphoblastic lymphomas (30%), HLH (10%), and solid tumors (10%) - aligns with these established risk profiles, with 90% receiving high-dose corticosteroids.

PJP infections occur more frequently in patients lacking prophylaxis, with up to 25% of unprophylaxed pediatric oncology patients developing PJP during chemotherapy. The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) guidelines recommend TMP/SMX as first-line prophylaxis in pediatric hematology patients throughout chemotherapy and for 6 weeks to 6 months after completing maintenance therapy. For HSCT recipients, prophylaxis should continue from neutrophil engraftment until achieving protective immune recovery. In our institution, we recommend TMP/SMX prophylaxis (25 mg/kg daily for three consecutive days weekly) for all chemotherapy patients who can tolerate it. The reasons for non-use or discontinuation of TMP-SMX in our survey included high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy, severe liver damage, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and poor adherence of the child or parent. But analysis of our PJP cases revealed that 40% had never received prophylaxis, 50% had discontinued prophylaxis more than one month before infection, and 10% received irregular prophylaxis. These findings suggest that prophylaxis non-adherence, rather than prophylaxis failure, drives infections.

### Risk factors associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in non-HIV immunocompromised patients and co-pathogens analysis by metagenomic next-generation sequencing [^f996132e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection that predominantly affects immunocompromised hosts including those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other non-HIV immunocompromised hosts including solid organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, hematologic malignancies, connective tissue diseases, solid tumors and other autoimmune inflammatory disease that need systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant therapy. In recent years, with the advent of antiretrovirals and prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the incidence of PJP in the HIV patients has decreased significantly. However, as the widespread use of immunosuppressive drugs and antitumor therapy, the broader application of solid organ and bone marrow transplantation, the prevalence of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients has gradually increased. Studies have shown that PJP in non-HIV patients have a more progressive course and higher mortality rate (ranging from 30% to 60%) than HIV patients. Given the serious consequence of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients, it is important to find the risk factors which could be used to predict the occurrence of PJP. Guidelines for preventing PJP in HIV patients are based on CD4 + T cells less than 200 cells/µl. There are no consensus guidelines for prophylaxis of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. Previous study has reported that lymphopenia, corticosteroids and a low count of CD4 + T cells are risk factors for the development of PJP in adults with autoimmune inflammatory disorders. However, whether such cut-off value of CD4 + T cells < 200 cells/µl can be used as a PJP prophylaxis in non-HIV immunocompromised patients is inconsistent between different academics.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) treatment — moderate to severe disease. Patients who develop PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis usually can be treated effectively with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII). For moderate to severe PCP, total duration of treatment is 21 days (All); preferred therapy is TMP-SMX: (TMP 15–20 mg and SMX 75–100 mg/kg/day) IV given every 6 or 8 hours (AI), with switch to PO formulations after clinical improvement (AI). Alternative therapy includes pentamidine 4 mg/kg IV once daily infused over ≥ 60 minutes (AI), with possible dose reduction to pentamidine 3 mg/kg IV once daily in the event of toxicities (BI), or primaquine 30 mg (base) PO once daily plus clindamycin [IV 600 mg every 6 hours or 900 mg every 8 hours] or [PO 450 mg every 6 hours or 600 mg every 8 hours] (AI). Adjunctive corticosteroids are indicated in moderate to severe cases of PCP.

PCP treatment in kidney transplant recipients — agents, timing, and duration are outlined as follows: The treatment of PCP includes both the use of intravenous trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole as well as corticosteroids for KTRs with significant hypoxemia. RCTs have demonstrated that the use of corticosteroids in the first 72 hours of PCP in HIV patients resulted in improved outcome, including morbidity, mortality and avoidance of intubation. The usual duration of treatment is 2–3 weeks. The use of intravenous pentamidine isethionate should be considered in patients with proven trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole allergy. Other treatment strategies should be restricted to patients with mild PCP only.
