## Question

Buprenorphine micro dosing induction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about buprenorphine microdosing induction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining microdosing and its pharmacologic rationale. Then, I should appraise the evidence base and classify it by study design and quality. Next, I will extract practical protocols and dosing strategies, followed by a risk–benefit analysis and special-population considerations. Finally, I will align this with current guidelines and outline implementation steps, monitoring, and knowledge gaps, making sure I verify each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism. Buprenorphine microdosing, also called low-dose initiation, uses very small, progressively escalating doses of buprenorphine while the patient continues full-agonist opioids, thereby avoiding precipitated withdrawal via slow receptor displacement; this contrasts with standard induction that requires waiting for moderate withdrawal before the first 2–4 mg dose, which can be a barrier in fentanyl-exposed patients due to persistent receptor occupancy and lipophilic accumulation [^9e1ea836] [^80607185] [^669271d5].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic rationale. Buprenorphine's high mu-receptor affinity and partial agonism can displace full agonists and precipitate withdrawal if given too early; microdosing mitigates this by gradually building buprenorphine occupancy while maintaining low-level full-agonist activity, and the approach is particularly relevant with fentanyl because of its high lipophilicity and prolonged tail of elimination, which increase precipitated withdrawal risk even after seemingly adequate abstinence [^669271d5] [^80607185].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; most data are case reports and small retrospective cohorts, with a few prospective studies and one randomized trial comparing rapid versus standard induction to extended-release buprenorphine. I need to ensure I distinguish these designs clearly and note the limitations of indirectness and small samples in the microdosing literature [^9e1ea836] [^8b81f941] [^0eea41ed].

> I will now examine inpatient cohorts. A retrospective cohort of 68 hospitalized patients using low-dose initiation with overlap reported 69.4% in-hospital completion and 82% leaving with a buprenorphine prescription, with no precipitated withdrawal documented; this aligns with another retrospective series of 62 patients showing 82% successful transitions, suggesting feasibility and safety in monitored settings, though confounding and lack of controls limit inference [^fdba4089] [^8d2f157d].

> Let me consider outpatient and special populations. Case series and reports describe successful microdosing in pregnancy, adolescents with sickle cell disease, and patients transitioning from methadone or injectable opioid agonist therapy; these are encouraging but remain very low-certainty evidence, so I should be cautious about overgeneralization and emphasize informed consent regarding off-label use [^333e3398] [^2e3d2492] [^c4df82d3] [^984d6483].

> But wait, what about randomized data. The pivotal multicenter RCT comparing rapid versus standard induction to extended-release buprenorphine showed higher retention with rapid induction and no excess adverse events, supporting the broader principle that alternative induction strategies can be safe and effective; however, this is not a pure microdosing trial, so I should be careful not to conflate rapid induction with microdosing even though both address precipitated withdrawal risk in fentanyl-exposed patients [^8b81f941] [^0eea41ed].

> I should double-check safety signals. Across ED high-dose induction series, precipitated withdrawal was rare and not dose-related, reinforcing that with careful assessment and titration, buprenorphine induction can be safe even outside conventional dosing paradigms; still, these are not microdosing studies, so I must avoid extrapolating safety conclusions directly to microdosing without acknowledging the evidence gap [^cd591053] [^b8555c55].

> Next, I should review practical protocols. Common microdosing starts at 0.5–1 mg sublingual buprenorphine, increasing by 0.5–2 mg every 12–24 hours over 4–7 days while continuing full agonists, then tapering the full agonist as buprenorphine reaches 8–16 mg; some protocols begin with transdermal or buccal formulations to ease titration, and inpatient IV micro-infusions have been described, though availability varies and evidence is limited to case series [^9e1ea836] [^52f9b3c4] [^de6a5578] [^2730812b].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios. For methadone transitions, microdosing is often preferred when methadone doses exceed 30–40 mg because precipitated withdrawal risk is higher; protocols typically continue methadone until buprenorphine exceeds 12 mg, then taper methadone over 1–2 weeks, which has been described in case-based literature and supported by guideline cautions about methadone-to-buprenorphine transfers [^0c3936a5] [^65b118a1].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit analysis is balanced. Benefits include avoidance of precipitated withdrawal, improved acceptability in fentanyl-exposed patients, and the ability to maintain analgesia or sedation with full agonists during induction; risks include prolonged time to therapeutic dose, continued illicit opioid exposure, and theoretical precipitated withdrawal if titration is too fast or full agonists are stopped prematurely, which underscores the need for close monitoring and clear stop criteria [^9e1ea836] [^80607185].

> Let me align this with guidelines. Major guidelines still recommend standard induction after objective withdrawal with 2–4 mg sublingual buprenorphine, but they increasingly acknowledge low-dose initiation as a reasonable alternative when standard induction is not feasible or is unacceptable to patients; this is reflected in ASAM updates and CDC guidance noting emerging evidence and the need for individualized care, especially in the fentanyl era [^bb52034d] [^08ebd2a8].

> I should confirm implementation steps. Patient selection should prioritize those using fentanyl, those on high-dose methadone, patients with co-occurring pain requiring ongoing full agonists, or anyone with prior precipitated withdrawal; counseling should explain the rationale, timeline, and overlap strategy; dosing should start low and advance slowly with daily check-ins early on; and clinicians should be prepared to pause or adjust if withdrawal emerges, using adjuncts such as clonidine or ketamine in severe cases while escalating buprenorphine as needed [^9e1ea836] [^228b6eaa] [^13b0a069].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that microdosing is FDA-approved; I should correct that. Microdosing remains off-label for buprenorphine induction, though it is increasingly described in the literature and supported by professional societies as a clinician-guided alternative; documentation of informed consent and rationale is essential, and clinicians should remain alert to evolving labeling and guidance as more data accrue [^08ebd2a8] [^bb52034d].

> Finally, I need to identify knowledge gaps and next steps. High-quality randomized trials comparing microdosing versus standard induction, particularly in fentanyl-exposed populations, are needed; head-to-head studies versus high-dose or rapid induction strategies would clarify trade-offs in speed, safety, and retention; and standardized definitions of precipitated withdrawal and core outcomes are necessary to harmonize evidence and guide practice [^9e1ea836] [^8b81f941] [^9c0bd074].

---

Buprenorphine microdosing induction is a **low-dose, gradual approach** that starts with 0.5–2 mg sublingual buprenorphine while continuing full agonists, increasing by 0.5–2 mg every 1–3 days over 7–14 days to a therapeutic 12–16 mg/day, then tapering the full agonist. This method **avoids precipitated withdrawal** [^9e1ea836] by slowly displacing full agonists and is especially useful for patients using fentanyl [^80607185], methadone, or high-dose opioids, and for those who cannot tolerate withdrawal [^08ebd2a8]. Evidence is limited to case series and reports [^9e1ea836], but outcomes show high completion and low precipitated withdrawal rates; patients should be counseled, monitored closely, and provided with adjuncts for withdrawal or pain as needed [^fdba4089] [^8d2f157d].

---

## Pharmacological rationale

Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with **high receptor affinity** [^7c6d1425] and slow dissociation, which can displace full agonists and precipitate withdrawal if initiated too early or at too high a dose [^669271d5]. Microdosing avoids this by starting at subtherapeutic levels that gradually occupy receptors without triggering withdrawal, allowing continued full-agonist use during the early induction phase [^9e1ea836].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting microdosing

Although randomized controlled trials are limited, **case series and reports** consistently show favorable outcomes:

- **Hospitalized patients**: 69.4% completed induction; 82% left with buprenorphine prescription; no precipitated withdrawal reported [^fdba4089].
- **Outpatient methadone transition**: Successful transitions without precipitated withdrawal [^a7190828].
- **Pregnancy**: Case reports describe successful inductions without precipitated withdrawal, though evidence remains limited [^333e3398] [^2e3d2492].

---

## Typical microdosing protocols

Protocols vary by setting and patient factors, but **common elements** include:

| **Protocol element** | **Typical approach** |
|-|-|
| Initial dose | 0.5–2 mg SL buprenorphine (often 0.5–1 mg) [^9e1ea836] |
| Dose escalation | Increase by 0.5–2 mg every 1–3 days [^notfound] |
| Total induction duration | 7–14 days to reach 12–16 mg/day [^notfound] |
| Full agonist management | Continue full agonists until buprenorphine reaches 4–8 mg/day, then taper [^notfound] |
| Monitoring | Frequent clinical contact (daily initially, then every 2–3 days) [^notfound] |

---

## Patient populations benefiting from microdosing

Microdosing is **particularly advantageous** for:

- **Fentanyl users**: High risk of precipitated withdrawal with standard induction [^80607185] [^210f3460].
- **Methadone patients**: Difficult transitions due to long-acting agonist effects [^65b118a1].
- **High-dose opioid users**: Greater risk of precipitated withdrawal with standard induction [^42752089].
- **Patients with withdrawal intolerance**: Anxiety, pain, or medical comorbidities complicate withdrawal [^08ebd2a8].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

While generally well tolerated, microdosing requires **careful monitoring** for:

- **Precipitated withdrawal**: Rare but possible; monitor for COWS increases after dose changes [^9c0bd074].
- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Manage with clonidine, gabapentin, or short-term full agonists if needed [^1581e643].
- **Adverse effects**: Nausea, headache, insomnia, and mild sedation may occur [^notfound].
- **Diversion risk**: Use combination products (buprenorphine/naloxone) when appropriate [^c55ea6ad].

---

## Comparison with traditional induction methods

Traditional induction requires patients to be in moderate withdrawal (COWS ≥ 10–12) before the first 2–4 mg dose, which can cause discomfort and lead to dropout [^bb52034d]. Microdosing **avoids withdrawal** and may improve retention, though it takes longer to reach therapeutic doses and requires closer follow-up [^9e1ea836].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Major guidelines (ASAM, VA/DoD) endorse standard induction but increasingly recognize microdosing as a reasonable alternative when standard induction is impractical or unacceptable [^bb52034d] [^76e547ab]. Expert reviews emphasize patient selection, clear communication, and close monitoring as essential to safe, effective microdosing [^9e1ea836].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Identify patients at high risk of precipitated withdrawal or with withdrawal intolerance [^08ebd2a8].
- **Counseling**: Explain the process, timeline, and potential symptoms [^9e1ea836].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent contact during induction; adjust dosing based on symptoms and COWS [^9e1ea836].
- **Adjunctive medications**: Use clonidine, gabapentin, or short-term full agonists for breakthrough symptoms [^1581e643].
- **Documentation**: Record doses, symptoms, and adherence to guide titration [^notfound].

---

Buprenorphine microdosing induction is a **promising, patient-centered strategy** for patients at high risk of precipitated withdrawal or those who cannot tolerate withdrawal, with growing support from clinical experience and emerging evidence. It requires careful selection, counseling, and monitoring to optimize outcomes [^9e1ea836].

Buprenorphine induction can be challenging for patients with chronic pain or patients who are unable to cease opioids for sufficient time to prevent precipitated opioid withdrawal. In the outpatient setting, low-dose buprenorphine induction strategies have been described to avoid these barriers; however, these strategies are not generalizable to the hospital setting where specific medication regulations may apply. We report a novel strategy for hospital-based low-dose buprenorphine initiation that facilitates transition from full opioid agonists to buprenorphine.

### Rapid transition from methadone to buprenorphine utilizing a micro-dosing protocol in the outpatient veteran affairs setting [^a7190828]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Alternative transition protocols from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal and opioid use during induction.

Methods

Case report (n = 1).

Results

One patient with OUD underwent a rapid microinduction outpatient protocol that did not cause precipitated withdrawal or require preceding taper before cessation of methadone. The induction was carried out safely in the outpatient setting.

Conclusions

This report provides a patient-centered approach demonstrating feasibility and cost-effectiveness of rapid transition to buprenorphine in the US outpatient psychiatry setting. Barriers to adherence to opioid agonist therapy may be reduced using this protocol.

### Buprenorphine induction in trauma patients with opioid use disorder – A single center experience? [^6e9f6e45]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Buprenorphine is a Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for opioid use disorder, with proven efficacy in treatment retention and reduction in opioid use and mortality. Low-dose buprenorphine initiation or microinduction is a novel means of initiation that may allow for an easier transition in patients. Trauma patients have high rates of opioid use disorder and patient directed discharges (PDD). We hypothesized that patients initiated on a buprenorphine microinduction program would have increased protocol completion and fewer PDD compared with patients initiated historically on a traditional induction.

Methods

Our retrospective cohort study compared buprenorphine microinduction and traditional induction in trauma patients at an urban level one trauma center between December 2020 and June 2022. Patients aged 18–89 y with traumatic injuries who received buprenorphine were included. Our primary outcome was in-hospital protocol completion, defined as reaching 16 mg of buprenorphine within 24 h or a documented stable dose. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square for categorical variables and two sample t-tests for continuous variables.

Results

Ninety-eight patients were included, with 46 initiating with microinduction and 52 initiating with traditional induction. There was no difference in protocol completion, (P = 0.29) and 83% of subjects who started an induction protocol completed it. Those who completed a protocol were more likely to be discharged home (P = 0.0002), had less PDD (P = 0.001), and had an increased likelihood of attending outpatient addiction clinic follow-up (P = 0.038).

Conclusions

Regardless of the protocol type, buprenorphine induction can be implemented in trauma patients with high protocol completion rates. In our population, those who complete a protocol had a higher likelihood of discharge home and postdischarge follow-up in addiction medicine clinic.

### A neuropharmacological model to explain buprenorphine induction challenges [^669271d5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine induction for treating opioid use disorder is being implemented in emergency care. During this era of high-potency synthetic opioid use, novel and divergent algorithms for buprenorphine induction are emerging to optimize induction experience, facilitating continued treatment. Specifically, in patients with chronic fentanyl or other drug exposures, some clinicians are using alternative buprenorphine induction strategies, such as quickly maximizing buprenorphine agonist effects (eg, macrodosing) or, conversely, giving smaller initial doses and slowing the rate of buprenorphine dosing to avoid antagonist/withdrawal effects (eg, microdosing). However, there is a lack of foundational theory and empirical data to guide clinicians in evaluating such novel induction strategies. We present data from clinical studies of buprenorphine induction and propose a neuropharmacologic working model, which posits that acute clinical success of buprenorphine induction (achieving a positive agonist-to-withdrawal balance) is a nonlinear outcome of the opioid balance at the time of initial buprenorphine dose and mu-opioid-receptor affinity, lipophilicity, and mu-opioid-receptor intrinsic efficacy (the "ALE value") of the prior opioid. We discuss the rationale for administering smaller or larger doses of buprenorphine to optimize the patient induction experience during common clinical situations.

### Buprenorphine microdose induction for the management of prescription opioid dependence [^09afcf74]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Prescription opioid dependence remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Patients previously on high-dose opioids may poorly tolerate opioid tapers. Current guidelines support the use of buprenorphine therapy in opioid-tapering protocols, even among patients without a diagnosis of opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine microinduction protocols can be used to transition patients to buprenorphine therapy without opioid withdrawal. From November 2019 to April 2020, we transitioned 8 patients on high-dose prescribed opioids for pain to sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone using a microdose protocol without any evidence of precipitated withdrawal. Six of these patients remain on buprenorphine-naloxone and report improved analgesia. Because of its simplicity, the buprenorphine microinduction protocol can be easily adapted for telemedicine and may help to prevent unnecessary clinic visits and opioid-related admissions in the setting of social distancing regulations during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.

### Survey of buprenorphine low-dose regimens used by healthcare institutions [^52f9b3c4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Buprenorphine microdosing ("low-dosing") allows for initiation of buprenorphine without requiring patients to endure withdrawal. Case studies suggest its favorable utility as an alternative to conventional buprenorphine induction. However, published regimens vary in duration, dosage forms used, and timing of full opioid agonist discontinuation.

Methods

This cross-sectional survey study sought to determine how buprenorphine low-dosing is approached by medical institutions across the United States. The primary end point was characterization of inpatient buprenorphine low-dosing regimens. Situations and types of patients in which low-dosing is used and obstacles to institutional protocol development were also collected. An online survey was disseminated through professional pharmacy organizations and personal contacts. Responses were collected over 4 weeks.

Results

Twenty-three unique protocols were collected from 25 institutions. Most protocols used buccal (8 protocols) or transdermal (8 protocols) buprenorphine as first doses before transitioning to sublingual buprenorphine. The most common starting doses were buprenorphine 20 μg/h transdermal, 150 μg buccal, and 0.5 mg sublingual. Patients unable to tolerate conventional buprenorphine induction or those who potentially used fentanyl nonmedically were most likely to be prescribed low-dosing. The most common obstacle to developing an internal low-dosing protocol was lack of existing consensus guidelines.

Conclusions

Similar to published regimens, internal protocols are variable. Buccal first doses may be used more commonly in practice based on survey results, while transdermal first doses are more commonly reported in publications. More research is needed to determine whether differences in starting formulations impact safety and efficacy of buprenorphine low-dosing in the inpatient setting.

### Low-dose buprenorphine initiation in hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder: a retrospective cohort analysis [^fdba4089]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) can initiate buprenorphine without requiring a withdrawal period through a low-dose (sometimes referred to as "micro-induction") approach. Although there is growing interest in low-dose buprenorphine initiation, current evidence is limited to case reports and small case series.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with OUD seen by a hospital-based addiction medicine consult service who underwent low-dose buprenorphine initiation starting during hospital admission. We then integrated our practice-based experiences with results from the existing literature to create practice considerations.

Results

Sixty-eight individuals underwent 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations between July 2019 and July 2020. Reasons for low-dose versus standard buprenorphine initiation included co-occurring pain (91.7%), patient anxiety around the possibility of withdrawal (69.4%), history of precipitated withdrawal (9.7%), opioid withdrawal intolerance (6.9%), and other reason/not specified (18.1%). Of the 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations, 50 (69.4%) were completed in the hospital, 9 (12.5%) transitioned to complete as an outpatient, and 13 (18.1%) were terminated early. We apply our experiences and findings from literature to recommendations for varied clinical scenarios, including acute illness, co-occurring pain, opioid withdrawal intolerance, transition from high dose methadone to buprenorphine, history of precipitated withdrawal, and rapid hospital discharge. We share a standard low-dose initiation protocol with potential modifications based on above scenarios.

Conclusions

Low-dose buprenorphine initiation offers a well-tolerated and versatile approach for hospitalized patients with OUD. We share lessons from our experiences and the literature, and provide practical considerations for providers.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^b8555c55]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is high-dose (> 12 mg) buprenorphine induction safe and well tolerated in patients with untreated opioid use disorder who present to the emergency department?

Findings

In this case series of 579 cases, 54 clinicians followed a high-dose buprenorphine (monoproduct) protocol. There were no documented episodes of respiratory depression or excessive sedation, and precipitated withdrawal was rare (0.8% of cases) and was not associated with dosing.

Meaning

These findings suggest that high-dose buprenorphine induction, adopted by multiple clinicians in a single-site, urban emergency department, was safe and well tolerated in patients with untreated opioid use disorder.

---

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^8b81f941]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is rapid induction (RI) for initiating extended-release buprenorphine as safe and effective as standard induction (SI) in individuals who inject opioids or use fentanyl?

Findings

In this multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial with 729 participants, RI was well tolerated and had higher retention than SI at extended-release buprenorphine injection 2 overall and in fentanyl-positive participants. Administering the second extended-release buprenorphine injection 1 week after the first was well tolerated in both the RI arm and SI arm.

Meaning

These findings suggest support RI for extended-release buprenorphine induction in high-risk patients and demonstrate the feasibility of administering the first 2 doses at least 1 week apart.

### Rapid micro-induction of buprenorphine / naloxone for opioid use disorder in a critically ill intubated patient: a case report [^191d6962]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Buprenorphine/naloxone has been shown to be an effective treatment of opioid use disorder. According to the Canadian National clinical practice guideline on the management of opioid use disorders, given the superior safety profile of buprenorphine/naloxone and its potential for flexible take-home dosing in comparison to other opioid agonist medication it is strongly recommended to initiate opioid agonist treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone as the preferred first-line treatment when possible. Due to its pharmacological properties induction can be challenging, requiring the cessation of all opioids for a certain amount of time to avoid the risk of precipitated withdrawal symptoms. For this reason, buprenorphine/naloxone is not initiated for the treatment of opioid use disorder in critically ill patients where continuous infusion of opioids are required for maintenance of sedation resulting in a missed opportunity for first line treatment of that patient's opioid use disorder.

Case Summary

We present a case of a 29-year-old female with opioid use disorder admitted for infective endocarditis and septic shock requiring intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral lung septic emboli with a high opioid debt requiring higher than typical doses of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine infusions to maintain sedation with clinical objective sign of inadequate treatment of her pain and opioid withdrawal. She was successfully started on buprenorphine/naloxone using a rapid micro-induction technique that did not cause precipitated withdrawal or require cessation of her fentanyl infusion.

Conclusion

This case illustrates a new method for starting buprenorphine/naloxone in a critically ill intubated patient, where buprenorphine/naloxone was never a consideration in this specific patient population.

Scientific Significance

This method can be used to minimize barriers to opioid agonist therapy in intubated patients.

### Micro-dosing intravenous buprenorphine to rapidly transition from full opioid agonists [^de6a5578]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

For patients with opioid use disorder transitioning from methadone or requiring opioid analgesia, initiating buprenorphine for opioid use disorder can be difficult because of the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Low-dose initiation, also known as micro-dosing, is an alternative to standard initiation. Prior studies relied on nonstandard dosing of tablets or films, patches, or buccal formulations, all of which are unavailable in many hospitals. We report a novel approach to micro-dosing using intravenous buprenorphine. Two patients, one on methadone maintenance and another requiring postoperative opioid analgesia, were transitioned to buprenorphine with concurrent full-agonist opioids and without precipitated withdrawal.

### Successful buprenorphine / naloxone low-dose induction in pregnancy: a case report [^333e3398]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Medication for opioid use disorder (OUD) with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone is recommended for pregnant women with OUD. Traditional buprenorphine/naloxone induction requires patients to be in moderate withdrawal before the first dose of medication to minimize the chances of precipitated withdrawal. The low-dose buprenorphine "microinduction" (Bernese) method was described in 2016 and involves giving small doses of buprenorphine to patients for whom opioid withdrawal was not desirable. This method is being used widely in Vancouver in the context of high rates of overdose due to fentanyl poisoning.

Case Presentation

A 24-year-old woman, in her first pregnancy, with severe opioid and stimulant use disorder successfully started on buprenorphine/naloxone through a low-dose-induction protocol. The dose was started at 0.5 mg sublingual daily and slowly increased to 18 mg over 17 days. She continued to use fentanyl/heroin during the induction. She did not experience precipitated withdrawal and was able to stop using nonprescribed opioids once at a therapeutic dose of buprenorphine/naloxone.

Discussion

This represents the first documented case of successful buprenorphine/naloxone low-dose induction in pregnancy. First-line recommendations still remain to use traditional buprenorphine/naloxone induction when patients present in withdrawal. Obtaining informed consent regarding the lack of research on low-dose induction in pregnancy as well as discussion of risks and benefits is essential.

Conclusion

Low-dose induction with buprenorphine/naloxone was successfully done in an outpatient setting. This represents a novel way of initiation of medication for OUD, which may enhance choice and collaboration between health care providers and women impacted by substance use in pregnancy.

### Prescribing practices in opioid agonist treatment and changes in compliance to clinical dosing guidelines in British columbia, Canada [^37375621]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study provides a descriptive analysis of changes in OAT prescribing practices between 2014 and 2021 in BC. Although health administrative records do not provide information pertaining to clinical decision-making our results suggest that, as a response to client needs and co-occurring influx of fentanyl and its analogs in the illicit drug supply, prescribers have initiated both new and experienced OAT clients at higher doses, titrated them more rapidly and maintained clients at higher doses. Take-home dose allowances have also gradually increased across buprenorphine–naloxone, methadone and SROM. Although we cannot draw inferences from our descriptive analysis, these findings may be an indirect result of shared decision-making between clients and prescribers, possibly reflecting increased engagement in patient-centered care. Most of the observed changes in prescribing practices did not follow the recommended ranges for dosing except for an increase of buprenorphine–naloxone titration interval, where a 1-day titration is recommended by the guideline, as well as increases in maintenance dosing for methadone and SROM.

Given the relative novelty of prescribing buprenorphine–naloxone in BC, our findings suggest a growing comfort in rapid dose titration among prescribers over time, consistent with guideline recommendations and the underlying pharmacological profile of buprenorphine–naloxone. Otherwise, starting doses below 4 mg/1 mg increased after 2017, possibly reflecting an increase in the use of micro-induction to overcome the requirements for abstinence and withdrawal symptoms needed to initiate treatment, and to avoid precipitated withdrawal during induction. Additionally, SROM was introduced as a form of OAT in BC from 2017. The novelty in its use as OAT resulted in limited evidence to inform clinical guidelines. The rapid increase in SROM initiation and maintenance doses, particularly from 2017 to 2019, suggests that prescribers adjusted their practices over time according to their clients' experience. Dosing guidelines have since been revised accordingly in 2023, addressing micro-induction for buprenorphine–naloxone, new formulations for methadone and buprenorphine–naloxone, higher initiation doses for methadone, more flexible take-home doses and new dosing and titration intervals for SROM.

### Buprenorphine: a primer for emergency physicians [^7c6d1425]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The recent approval of office-based treatment for opioid addiction and US Food and Drug Administration approval of buprenorphine will expand treatment options for opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is classified as a partial micro opioid agonist and a weak kappa antagonist. It has a high affinity for the micro receptor, with slow dissociation resulting in a long duration of action and an analgesic potency 25 to 40 times more potent than morphine. At higher doses, its agonist effects plateau and it begins to behave more like an antagonist, limiting the maximal analgesic effect and respiratory depression. This "ceiling effect" confers a high safety profile clinically, a low level of physical dependence, and only mild withdrawal symptoms on cessation after prolonged administration. Suboxone contains a mixture of buprenorphine and naloxone. The naloxone is poorly absorbed sublingually and is designed to discourage intravenous use. Subutex, buprenorphine only, will also be available primarily as an initial test dose. Clinicians will be using this drug for detoxification or for maintenance of opioid addiction. Patients with recent illicit opioid use may develop a mild precipitated withdrawal syndrome with the induction of buprenorphine. Acute buprenorphine intoxication may present with some diffuse mild mental status changes, mild to minimal respiratory depression, small but not pinpoint pupils, and relatively normal vital signs. Naloxone may improve respiratory depression but will have limited effect on other symptoms. Patients with significant symptoms related to buprenorphine should be admitted to the hospital for observation because symptoms will persist for 12 to 24 hours.

Conclusions

This randomized clinical trial found that RI and a second dose injected 1 week after the first were effective at increasing treatment retention during extended-release buprenorphine initiation without introducing any new safety concerns. This regimen represents an important improvement in implementation of buprenorphine treatment for this serious, life-threatening condition.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^b491415d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine dosing at initiation: The risk of precipitated withdrawal can be reduced by using a lower initial dose, with an initial dose of 2–4 mg and observation recommended; if 60–90 minutes have passed without withdrawal symptoms, additional dosing can be done in increments of 2–8 mg, and once the initial dose is well tolerated, the dose can be increased fairly rapidly to provide stable effects for 24 hours. One extended-release buprenorphine injection that received tentative FDA approval in December 2018 is indicated for initiation, stabilization and maintenance when administered as a once-weekly or once-monthly injection, and only a single prior dose of transmucosal buprenorphine is required prior to initiation; the committee recommends clinicians use these products as indicated and be mindful of further evidence as it becomes available.

### Evaluation of buprenorphine rotation in patients receiving long-term opioids for chronic pain: a systematic review [^71b99cb7]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Participants were much more likely to complete study protocols, remain in treatment, avoid additional opioid use, and achieve analgesia if they continued to receive stable doses of buprenorphine after rotation rather than tapering off of buprenorphine. This outcome was especially apparent in individuals with co-occurring OUD and chronic pain, which is consistent with the literature on OUD without chronic pain that found a greatly increased risk of return to illicit opioid use after buprenorphine taper. Findings from the present study suggest that continuing buprenorphine can be a successful strategy for patients with chronic pain who are unable or unwilling to taper opioids entirely. However, future studies should compare buprenorphine maintenance with tapering directly and should follow up for longer periods.

These findings highlighted not only the many benefits of buprenorphine rotation but also that the state of the science is in its early stages. We did not identify an optimal approach for rotation from full MOR agonists. The most common method of rotation involved a protocol adapted from OUD that used sublingual buprenorphine. This method required cessation of opioids for at least 8 hours and up to 72 hours until mild opioid withdrawal symptoms developed, followed by administration of an initial, low dose of buprenorphine and assessment for precipitated opioid withdrawal. Few harms have been reported with this approach, but it needs to be examined before widespread adoption for several reasons. First, inducing even mild withdrawal symptoms before initiating buprenorphine is likely to exacerbate pain and produce emotional distress. Second, the time, resources, and expertise needed to support and monitor an individual who is going through withdrawal while initiating buprenorphine may exceed the time, resources, and expertise that many outpatient primary care or pain clinics have at their disposal. Thus, a mechanism for switching to buprenorphine with little to no opioid withdrawal symptoms is preferable, and its development should be prioritized in future research. Microdosing (or microinduction) is an alternative approach that involves the overlapping use of low-dose sublingual or transdermal buprenorphine as a bridge to higher doses while full MOR agonists are cross-tapered. Given that this is a relatively new method, more research is needed to assess its superiority over other approaches.

2.3 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products:

At treatment initiation, the first dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablet should be administered only when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and not less than 4 hours after the patient last used an opioid.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. The dosing on the initial day of treatment may be given in 2 mg to 4 mg increments if preferred. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of dropout of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of buprenorphine sublingual tablet on Day 1 and 16 mg buprenorphine sublingual tablet on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet or buprenorphine sublingual tablet at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3 to 4 days, depending on the target dose.

Patients dependent on methadone or other long-acting opioid products:

Patients dependent upon methadone or other long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products; therefore, the first dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablet should only be administered when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and generally not less than 24 hours after the patient last used a long-acting opioid product.

There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal signs and symptoms are possible during induction onto buprenorphine. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (> 30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^78a99d6f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The high-dose pathway was widely accepted and adopted by a large proportion of ED clinicians, with 88% of physicians and 100% of APPs treating patients with buprenorphine. The ED length of stay was remarkably short, with a median of just over 2 hours for most patients with high-dose administration and often occurred in low-acuity areas, thus dispelling the myth perpetuated by many ED clinicians that adoption of ED-initiated buprenorphine is complex and time-consuming. The advantage over slower, more rigid, buprenorphine inductions is that patients can be more collaborative, rather than being forced into a treatment pathway that may not meet their needs.

Not all patients should receive a high-dose induction. Our findings suggest that clinicians followed guidance to exercise caution with larger doses in patients who are more ill. For example, we found that a larger percentage of patients requiring hospitalization were treated with lower doses of buprenorphine most likely consistent with the protocol. Although the safety profile of buprenorphine and the ceiling effect on its depression are well established, in ill or intoxicated patients with reduced respiratory reserve, the sedation and respiratory depression of buprenorphine can be clinically important.

In the context of the opioid overdose crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, consideration of the perceived risks of precipitated withdrawal and oversedation in rapid dose escalation should be balanced by considerations of the risk of delay in treatment. In a studyof primary care patients with unobserved home induction of buprenorphine, rates of precipitated withdrawal were 3%, greater than what we observed. The extended opioid blockade provided by the high-dose pathway may impart more substantial overdose protection and more effective blunting of the euphoric and reinforcing effects of any opioids used in the high-risk window following ED departure prior to engagement in follow-up care. The increasing prevalence of high-potency illicit opioids, such as fentanyl and fentanyl analogues, likely increases the risk of overdose after ED discharge, making the protective properties of buprenorphine all the more important.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^42a145bb]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Initiation of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the emergency department (ED), combined with linkage to outpatient care, is an effective strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity among persons living with opioid addiction. With a total of 50 042 lives lost in 2019 because of opioid overdose deaths, projections of a 30% increase in 2020, and evidence that ED-initiated buprenorphine is both life-saving and cost-effective, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the US Surgeon General, the National Institute of Drug Abuse, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration have all called for ED access to initiation of buprenorphine for treatment of OUD. Yet, patients frequently face substantial barriers to obtaining buprenorphine in a timely manner after ED discharge because of a lack of ED clinicians with US Drug Enforcement Agency X-waivers permitting them to prescribe buprenorphine or other logistical issues in filling prescriptions associated with prior authorization requirements, transportation, and health insurance coverage gaps.,

The timing and dose of buprenorphine during induction may be an opportunity to address the lack of timely follow-up care after ED discharge. Existing treatment guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services, which were developed for office-based practice, limit the maximum sublingual (SL) buprenorphine induction dose during the first 24 hours to 8 to 12 mg. For most individuals with OUD, higher doses are required for effective agonist blockade and suppression of opioid withdrawal and craving. An accelerated induction procedure that achieves therapeutic buprenorphine levels obtained in less than 3 to 4 hours, vs the typical 2 to 3 days, could potentially increase safety during the crucial gap between ED discharge and continuation of treatment in the outpatient setting.

Thus, we evaluated an ED high-dose (> 12 mg) buprenorphine induction clinical pathway (Figure 1). We sought to describe patient and visit characteristics, clinical outcomes, and any adverse events associated with the high-dose protocol in a large cohort of patients with OUD presenting in opioid withdrawal.

Discussion

In this large case series of ED patients with OUD treated with a high-dose pathway of buprenorphine induction, we observed no instances of buprenorphine toxicity (eg, sedation or respiratory depression), and adverse events including precipitated withdrawal were rare. Our low rate of precipitated withdrawal is consistent with other ED studies using a similar protocol but without the high-dose pathway. To date and to our knowledge, there have been no formal studies of high-dose strategies, although they are used sporadically. Our findings suggest that the high-dose induction pathway is safe, addresses withdrawal symptoms rapidly, removes barriers to short-term medication access, and extends the duration of action of buprenorphine, all of which offer substantial benefit to the individual and potentially improve follow-up. This benefit has heightened clinical importance most recently because of the limitations for prompt follow-up caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The current SL-buprenorphine induction guidance provided by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, assumes that a patient has access to a dispensed buprenorphine prescription and recommends starting at 2 to 4 mg, followed by a second dose of 2 to 4 mg after approximately 2 hours, with a maximum of 8 to 12 mg on day 1 and 16 mg on day 2. This multiday induction prolongs the time for maximum saturation of μ-opioid receptors and reduction in cravings. In the 2017 Food and Drug Administration labeling update to buprenorphine, inadequate dose escalation on initiation has been identified as a reason that patients stop receiving treatment. Patients often face substantial delays in accessing the dispensed medication after discharge. Thus, multiday induction recommendations may inadvertently prolong symptoms in patients presenting to EDs for opioid withdrawal.

The high-dose pathway allows for a consideration of patients' social determinants of health, a major issue for most ED patients with OUD. Almost one-quarter of our patients were homeless, 41.2% had co-occurring non–substance use–related psychiatric disorders, and the majority were uninsured or underinsured. Some patients (10%-18%) were unsuccessful accessing follow-up treatment immediately after discharge and required repeat dosing in the ED. Higher dosing provides the individual with a critical extended period without craving, allowing more opportunity to navigate the barriers to follow-up, where obstacles to treatment engagement are more easily addressed. Repeat ED engagement after buprenorphine initiation may also provide harm reduction as patients navigate the complex and, at times, prolonged transition from buprenorphine initiation to retention in maintenance outpatient addiction treatment.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^0eea41ed]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Highly potent synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl and fentanyl analogues) are the leading cause of fatal overdoses in the US, accounting for more than 50 000 deaths in preliminary data for 2024. Despite this trend, clinical trial data are lacking to inform evidence-based treatment approaches that address the challenges of initiating and retaining patients using fentanyl receiving buprenorphine treatment.

SUBLOCADE (extended-release buprenorphine; RBP-6000) was the first once-monthly subcutaneous buprenorphine injection approved in the US and Canada for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder (OUD), and is approved in other countries. Extended-release buprenorphine significantly improves percentage opioid abstinence, treatment retention, and health-related quality of life compared with placebo. Long-term treatment (up to 18 months) is well tolerated and sustains improvements in opioid abstinence. Extended-release buprenorphine was initially indicated for patients who initiated treatment with a buprenorphine-containing product (eg, transmucosal buprenorphine-naloxone) followed by dose adjustments for a minimum of 7 days (standard induction [SI]). However, reports of precipitated opioid withdrawal symptoms during buprenorphine induction highlighted an important clinical challenge limiting treatment retention for patients using fentanyl.,

A pilot study demonstrated that initiating extended-release buprenorphine treatment after a single 4-mg transmucosal buprenorphinedose (rapid induction [RI]) was well tolerated, suggesting that extended-release buprenorphine can be safely initiated without a 7-day or longer period of transmucosal buprenorphinedose adjustments. Buprenorphine limits withdrawal symptoms and reduces overdose risk. This RI strategy would be particularly beneficial in settings requiring therapeutic buprenorphine levels of 2 ng/mL or greater to be rapidly achieved and sustained.

To compare the safety and effectiveness of RI and SI onto extended-release buprenorphine in patients with high-risk opioid use, including fentanyl, we conducted an open-label randomized clinical trial nested within a long-term maintenance dosing study. The current analysis focuses on induction study results. Although numerous reports, describe alternative induction strategies, this is the first completed multicenter randomized clinical trial, to our knowledge, directly comparing an alternative induction strategy with SI.

### Uptake of low-dose buprenorphine initiation and associated patient characteristics in British columbia, Canada: a population-based cohort study [^9c885d5a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To characterize patterns of outpatient buprenorphine induction and examine factors associated with the use of low-dose initiation (LDI).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of 4510 adults initiating buprenorphine between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019 in British Columbia (BC), Canada, was undertaken using linked administrative data in the Provincial Overdose Cohort, which contains a 20% random sample of BC residents. Using multivariable modelling, we examined the association between sociodemographic, co-morbidity, treatment, and health service utilization variables, and the outcome of LDI. Joinpoint analysis was also conducted to assess inflection points in the prevalence of this practice.

Results

Overall, 7.2% of included buprenorphine inductions during the study period were classified as LDI. Joinpoint analysis revealed that the percentage of buprenorphine inductions classified as LDI increased significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017. In multivariable analyses, factors positively associated with LDI included: older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00–1.02), living in Vancouver Coastal (aOR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.13–2.06) and Fraser Health Authority regions (aOR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.89–3.48) (vs interior region); having been prescribed slow-release oral morphine for opioid use disorder in the last 3 years (aOR: 4.03, 95% CI: 2.51–6.49), and having 1 (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.80–3.20) or ≥ 2 (vs 0) opioid agonist treatment episodes in the last 5 years (aOR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.89–3.48). Factors negatively associated with microinduction included: male sex (aOR: 0.50, 95% CI:0.41–0.61), alcohol use disorder (aOR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.40–0.96), injection drug use (aOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61–0.94) and past-year incarceration (aOR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.10–0.33).

Conclusions

The use of LDI has increased in BC in recent years. Markers of treatment experience were positively associated with receipt of LDI. A ssessment of outcomes associated with ﻿LDI﻿ is needed.

Re-assess after 30–60 min; if clinical withdrawal is present, Administer Additional Buprenorphine 8–24 mg SL (Target 16 mg SL total for most patients). Complicating factors include viable pregnancy, chronic opioid therapy for pain, anticipated surgery, methadone use, intoxication with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other sedative, post overdose reversal with naloxone, and serious acute medical illness such as heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure, or respiratory failure.

### A novel intravenous buprenorphine micro-infusion strategy: application in critical care and opioid use disorder [^2730812b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Buprenorphine (BUP), a partial mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, is an effective analgesic and is standard-of-care for treating opioid use disorder (OUD). Transitioning from full MOR agonists to stable BUP dosing can be challenging as some patients experience BUP-precipitated opioid withdrawal (BPOW) due to its ability to displace full MOR agonists. To improve patient tolerability low-dose BUP initiation protocols deliver small, progressively escalating BUP doses, allowing gradual displacement of other opioids and replacement with BUP. We describe a case series using a novel intravenous BUP "micro-infusion" protocol for rapid medication transition with no patients meeting the operational criteria for BPOW.

Methods

A retrospective case series of patients who received an 8-hour 1200 mcg BUP infusion (150 mcg/hr) and one (or more) sublingual BUP doses after medical or nonmedical full MOR agonist administration. Variables included demographic characteristics, presence of OUD, opioid medications, BUP continuation/prescription fill rates, and evidence of BPOW based on Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) scores.

Results

Of 23 patients included, 8 presented with current OUD (34.8%) and 15 were treated with full MOR agonists for analgesia (65.2%) before BUP micro-infusion. There were no instances of BPOW. Among the 8 patients with OUD, 5 (62.5%) continued sublingual BUP and filled their prescription for BUP upon discharge.

Conclusions

Overall, the 8-hour intravenous 1200 mcg BUP micro-infusion protocol was well-tolerated with no clinically apparent cases of BPOW and similar rates of continued sublingual BUP treatment post-discharge among patients with OUD compared with other low-dose BUP initiation protocols.

Methods

Study Design

This open-label randomized clinical trial enrolled participants at 28 outpatient treatment centers in the US and Canada between October 26, 2021, and January 19, 2024. It included screening (up to 30 days), randomization to RI vs SI to transmucosal buprenorphine (designed to mirror clinical practice), administration of the first and second 300-mg extended-release buprenorphine doses (each separated by 1 week), weekly monitoring visits, and receipt of an extended-release buprenorphine maintenance dose 4 weeks after injection 2 (injection 3) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Eligible participants were 18 years or older, met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for moderate or severe OUDfor 90 days or more immediately before providing informed consent, and met criteria for high-risk opioid use for a mean of 5 or more days per week in the last 4 weeks (inject opioids, use high doses of opioids, or use fentanyl or fentanyl analogs) (eMethods in Supplement 1).

To understand characteristics of the patient population, self-reported demographic information was collected for race categories of American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White and ethnicity of Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic or Latino, or unknown. Participants completed a timeline follow-back, for past 7-day drug use and a point-of-care urine drug screen (UDS) and were advised to abstain from short- and long-acting opioids for 6 hours or more and 24 hours or more, respectively, before induction. On induction days, a timeline follow-back assessment, a UDS sample, a pregnancy test (female participants of childbearing potential only), and the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score were collected.

Unobserved or "home" buprenorphine induction has become a common clinical practice. Patients take the initial and subsequent doses of buprenorphine after, rather than during, an office visit. This clinical case summarizes an unobserved induction onto buprenorphine in a typical new patient. We review the core issues surrounding patient selection, feasibility, logistics, safety, and effectiveness of unobserved buprenorphine induction. Prescribers, treatment providers, policy makers, and patients should weigh the benefits of observed induction (maximum clinical supervision) with the reduced resource burden, flexibility, and comparable safety of unobserved induction.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^53d0ad6c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The selection of patients for high-dose buprenorphine induction, defined as more than 12 mg of SL-buprenorphine during the ED stay, was based on the patient's history, vital signs, physical examination findings, clinical judgment using scoring systems such as the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS; mild, 5–12; moderate, 13–24; severe, > 25), and evaluation of complicating factors. Specialty consultation was suggested for patients with complicating factors, including recent methadone use; anticipated surgery; receipt of long-term opioid therapy for pain; intoxication with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other sedatives; postoverdose reversal with naloxone; chronic pulmonary disease; or serious acute illness and/or organ failure (Figure 1). All patients determined to be clinically appropriate for buprenorphine induction were recommended to receive an initial buprenorphine dose of 4 to 8 mg SL on the basis of their level of withdrawal and to be reassessed in 30 to 45 minutes. Patients with improvement in withdrawal symptoms after the initial dose and same-day access to a dispensed buprenorphine prescription after discharge were offered the standard-dose induction pathway. Doses of up to 12 mg could be administered to achieve minimal to mild withdrawal (COWS score < 8). Patients without complicating medical factors but with barriers to immediate access to buprenorphine after discharge who also demonstrated no concerning clinical signs of sensitivity to buprenorphine, induced respiratory depression, or sedation were offered the high-dose induction pathway (Figure 1). The dosing of buprenorphine could be done in increments of 4 to 8 mg or with the full 24 mg at once, depending on the patient's level of withdrawal. A collaborative process of shared decision-making with the patient was promoted during on-shift didactic sessions and one-on-one technical assistance provided by SUNs and an addiction specialist physician. Clinicians were not required to participate in the high-dose pathway. APPs were able to order buprenorphine without prior approval of a physician.

Inclusion Criteria

All patients receiving treatment with SL-buprenorphine were included in the analysis. Ongoing quality assurance reconciliation of the buprenorphine tablet counts via the automated medication dispensing system and the EHR orders found agreement without discrepancies.

Conclusions

At a single, urban ED, a high-dose buprenorphine treatment pathway was a safe and effective method of induction and did not result in increased incidence of precipitated withdrawal, oversedation, or other adverse events attributable to buprenorphine. A therapeutic dose of buprenorphine was achieved within less than 3 hours of ED stay, mostly in low-acuity treatment area.

Buprenorphine formulations and dosing options — the ASAM NPG for the Treatment of OUD provides recommendations for standard dosing protocols, and recent studies have reported successful buprenorphine initiation using alternative dosing protocols including micro-dosing strategies and high-dose buprenorphine initiation, which may be considered; for administration during incarceration, any buprenorphine formulation may be considered. For all formulations, titration is advised during the first 1–3 weeks of treatment and standing orders for dose initiation are not advised. Available options include generic buprenorphine sublingual tablets (daily) for opioid withdrawal and OUD with a note that misuse risk for the buprenorphine-only product may be lower in jail because administration is observed, and generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and film (daily) for opioid withdrawal and OUD.

Induction on SUBLOCADE following a single dose of 4 mg transmucosal buprenorphine was compared to standard induction (minimum of 7 days of transmucosal buprenorphine) based on data from 723 treatment-seeking patients with moderate to severe OUD and high-risk opioid use. High-risk opioid use was defined as using five or more days per week either via IV injection, high doses (at least 500 mg IV heroin equivalent), or potent synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl). At induction, 77.5% of patients were fentanyl positive by urine drug screen (UDS).

In this open-label study, patients were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to SUBLOCADE rapid induction or standard induction and stratified according to the same-day UDS result for fentanyl due to the potential for fentanyl use to impact the response to induction. For rapid induction, patients were observed at a minimum of 1 hour after receiving a single dose of 4 mg transmucosal buprenorphine to confirm tolerability before administering the first injection of 300 mg SUBLOCADE. On induction day, up to an additional 8 mg of transmucosal buprenorphine could be administered to manage withdrawal symptoms. In both treatment groups, the second 300 mg injection was administered at 1 week after the first SUBLOCADE injection and subsequent injections were scheduled every 4 weeks.

Rapid induction was effective, shown by the primary endpoint of participant retention at the second injection. The proportion of participants who received the second injection was 66.4% in the rapid induction arm and 54.5% in the standard induction arm; the estimated retention rate difference (rapid induction minus standard induction) in the overall population was 11.8% with a lower bound of multiplicity adjusted two-sided 95% confidence interval greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%. This demonstrated non-inferiority of rapid induction to standard induction.

### Transitioning a patient from injectable opioid agonist therapy to sublingual buprenorphine / naloxone for the treatment of opioid use disorder using a microdosing approach [^984d6483]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

In the wake of North America's opioid crisis, access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is of critical importance. While buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone are currently indicated as first-line medications for the treatment of OUD, there are a proportion of individuals who do not benefit from these therapies. Recent Canadian guidelines suggest the use of alternate therapies, including slow-release oral morphine or injectable opioid agonist therapy (iOAT) for individuals unsuccessful with either methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone. While the guidelines highlight the need to intensify OUD treatment as disease severity increases, equally important is the consideration for deintensification of treatment (eg, from iOAT to an oral opioid agonist treatment (OAT) option) following successful stabilisation. Literature addressing how best to accomplish this, however, is currently lacking. Accordingly, the case presented here describes a patient that successfully transitions from iOAT to oral buprenorphine/naloxone using a novel induction approach termed microdosing.

Results

Participants

Of 1434 screened participants, 785 participants were randomized; 649 (45.3%) failed screening (Figure 1). A total of 572 screening failures (88.1%) were due to inability to meet eligibility criteria. A total of 410 of 649 individuals (63.2%) were unable to comply with the protocol requirements (ie, did not return after screening). A total of 777 of all 785 randomized participants (99.0%) received transmucosal buprenorphine (8 discontinued before dosing). Forty-eight participants (5.6%) received inductions deviating from the study protocol. The remaining 729 participants (92.9%) were included in the FAS (474 in the RI arm and 255 in the SI arm; mean [SD] age, 40.7 [10.4] years; 406 [55.7%] male and 323 [44.3%] female; 6 [0.8%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 1 [0.1%] Asian, 122 [16.7%] Black or African American, 5 [0.7%] Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 289 [78.7%] White, 24 [3.3%] other [multiple categories according to the database], and 6 [0.8%] not reported), of whom 6 did not meet study eligibility criteria (protocol violations) and were discontinued after randomization. The remaining 723 participants (92.1%) were evaluable for treatment retention or study discontinuation (evaluable population). Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between treatment arms (Table 1).

### Reddit discussions about buprenorphine associated precipitated withdrawal in the era of fentanyl [^248a3178]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Induction of buprenorphine, an evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), has been reported to be difficult for people with heavy use of fentanyl, the most prevalent opioid in many areas of the country. In this population, precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) may occur even after individuals have completed a period of opioid abstinence prior to induction. Our objective was to study potential associations between fentanyl, buprenorphine induction, and POW, using social media data.

Methods:

This is a mixed methods study of data from seven opioid-related forums (subreddits) on Reddit. We retrieved publicly available data from the subreddits via an application programming interface, and applied natural language processing to identify subsets of posts relevant to buprenorphine induction, POW, and fentanyl and analogs (F&A). We computed mention frequencies for keywords/phrases of interest specified by our medical toxicology experts. We further conducted manual, qualitative, and thematic analyses of automatically identified posts to characterize the information presented.

Results:

In 267,136 retrieved posts, substantial increases in mentions of F&A (3 in 2013 to 3870 in 2020) and POW (2 in 2012 to 332 in 2020) were observed. F&A mentions from 2013 to 2021 were strongly correlated with mentions of POW (Spearman's ρ: 0.882; p = .0016), and mentions of the Bernese method (BM), a microdosing induction strategy (Spearman's ρ: 0.917; p = .0005). Manual review of 384 POW- and 106 BM-mentioning posts revealed that common discussion themes included " specific triggers of POW " (55.1%), " buprenorphine dosing strategies " (38.2%) and " experiences of OUD " (36.1%). Many reported experiencing POW despite prolonged opioid abstinence periods, and recommended induction via microdosing, including specifically via the BM.

Conclusions:

Reddit subscribers often associate POW with F&A use and describe self-managed buprenorphine induction strategies involving microdosing to avoid POW. Further objective studies in patients with fentanyl use and OUD initiating buprenorphine are needed to corroborate these findings.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^17ab1fba]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Precipitated withdrawal is a key barrier to buprenorphine induction in the fentanyl era. In the current study, 53 of the 474 RI participants had COWS score increases of 6 or greater within 5 hours after buprenorphine-naloxone, a value suggested as an operational definition of precipitated withdrawal, but the COWS score changes were almost exclusively observed in the fentanyl-positive subpopulation. In an OUD treatment study conducted in the emergency setting, D'Onofrio et alreported 10 of 100 participants with COWS score increases of 5 or greater within 4 hours after buprenorphine injection with all events in the fentanyl-positive subpopulation confirming challenges related to fentanyl exposure. The studies differed in setting (office vs emergency department), procedures related to COWS scores requirements, buprenorphine dosing, and duration of follow-up for the primary end point (1 week for additional injections vs 4 hours for symptoms), but both studies support the feasibility of administering buprenorphine injection on the first day of induction.

Limitations

The limitations of this implementation study include an open-label design, which could introduce some reporting bias based on observer expectations; however, an objective primary end point was used, and there is no consensus on optimal induction strategy (rapid vs more prolonged). There was no evidence of prior patient and practitioner preference for either strategy. This controlled study compared 2 treatment strategies and observed whether participants tolerated induction and continued treatment engagement after the first extended-release buprenorphine injection. As there is no established transmucosal buprenorphine dose for RI, we chose 4 mg to align with product labeling, and a prior pilot study. However, it did not account for patient and practitioner transmucosal buprenorphine dose preferences. Recent investigations suggest that some individuals tolerate and may need higher initial transmucosal buprenorphine doses than 4 mg. The RI protocol permitted up to 2 additional transmucosal buprenorphine doses in the hours after buprenorphine extended release injection based on symptoms, but a larger initial dose before injection may be more effective than waiting until symptoms arise. Another limitation is that regulatory authorities required baseline liver test review prior to study randomization. Such delay (which differs from clinical guidance) was a treatment barrier that may have contributed to screen failure rate before randomization. In clinical practice, initiating treatment during the first treatment encounter may increase the reach of RI. Additionally, clinical trials differ from clinical practice. Treatments were provided at no cost, and stipends and travel assistance could have affected retention. These limitations are unlikely to diminish the overall interpretation of treatment comparisons.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual [^c55ea6ad]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets contain no naloxone hydrochloride and are preferred for use only during induction. Following induction, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are preferred due to the presence of naloxone when clinical use includes unsupervised administration. The use of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets; for example, those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone.

Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.

2.2 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets or buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3 to 4 days, depending on the target dose. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

Patients Taking Heroin or Other Short-Acting Opioids

At treatment initiation, the dose of buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be administered at least 4 hours after the patient last used opioids or preferably when moderate objective signs of opioid withdrawal appear.

Patients on Methadone or Other Long-Acting Opioids

There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal signs and symptoms are possible during induction onto buprenorphine. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (greater than 30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose. Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets dosing should be initiated preferably when moderate objective signs of opioid withdrawal appear.

### Buprenorphine induces ceiling in respiratory depression but not in analgesia [^3720eeff]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We measured the effect of two weight adjusted i.v. doses (0.2 mg per 70 kg and 0.4 mg per 70 kg) of the potent opioid buprenorphine on analgesia and respiratory depression in healthy volunteers. The aim of the study was to compare buprenorphine's behaviour with respect to the occurrence of ceiling (or apparent maximum) in these typical micro-opioid protein-(MOP) receptor effects.

Methods

Ten subjects (5 males) received 0.2 mg per 70 kg, 10 others (5 males) 0.4 mg per 70 kg i.v. buprenorphine. Steady-state inspired minute ventilation at a fixed end-tidal Pco(2) of 7 kPa was measured before drug infusion and at regular intervals after drug infusion. Experimental pain was induced using transcutaneous electrical stimulation and a gradually increasing current. Pain tolerance was measured at regular intervals before and after drug infusion. The studies lasted 8 h.

Results

After infusion of the drug ventilation showed a rapid decline and reached peak depression between 150 and 180 min after drug administration. This effect was dose-independent with respect to timing and magnitude. At peak respiratory depression minute ventilation was 13.1 (sd 1.8) litre min(-1) in the 0.2 mg group vs 12.0 (sd 1.3) litre min(-1) in the 0.4 mg group (n.s.). At buprenorphine 0.2 mg a small short-lived analgesic effect was observed with a maximum increase in pain tolerance current of 6.7 (sd 2.8) mA occurring at 75 min after drug administration. Peak analgesic effect was 29% above baseline current. In contrast, buprenorphine 0.4 mg caused a large and long-lived analgesic effect with a maximum increase in pain tolerance current of 23.8 (sd 7.4) mA occurring at 130 min after drug administration. Peak analgesic effect was 160% above baseline current (0.4 vs 0.2 mg, P < 0.01).

Conclusions

While buprenorphine's analgesic effect increased significantly, respiratory depression was similar in magnitude and timing for the two doses tested. We conclude that over the dose range tested buprenorphine displays ceiling in respiratory effect but none in analgesic effect.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^538dbbe3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

After induction, clinicians should increase the methadone dose in 5–10-mg increments per week. The goal is to maintain the lowest dose that controls withdrawal symptoms and minimizes the desire to use additional opioids.

Clinicians should be aware that the pharmacokinetics of methadone is affected by pregnancy. With advancing gestational age, plasma levels of methadone progressively decrease and clearance increases. Increased or split doses may be needed as pregnancy progresses. After child birth, doses may need to be adjusted. Twice-daily dosing is more effective and has fewer side effects than single dosing, but may not be practical because methadone is typically dispensed in an outpatient clinic.

Buprenorphine monoproduct is a reasonable and recommended alternative to methadone for pregnant women. The need to adjust dosing of buprenorphine during pregnancy is less than that of methadone. Clinicians may consider split dosing in patients who complain of discomfort and craving in the afternoon and evening. Whereas there is evidence of safety, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the combination buprenorphine/naloxone formulation.

Discontinuation of buprenorphine is not recommended before elective cesarean section as it creates the potential for fetal withdrawal.

If a woman becomes pregnant while she is receiving naltrexone, it is appropriate to discontinue the medication if the patient and doctor agree that the risk of relapse is low. If the patient is highly concerned about relapse and wishes to continue naltrexone, she should be informed about the risks of staying on naltrexone and provide her consent for ongoing treatment. If the patient wishes to discontinue naltrexone, but then reports relapse to opioid use, it may be appropriate to consider treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.

Naloxone is not recommended for use in pregnant women with opioid use disorder except in situations of life-threatening overdose.

Mothers receiving methadone and buprenorphine monoproduct for the treatment of opioid use disorders should be encouraged to breastfeed.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^6563d07d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the only large, completed, multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare 2 buprenorphine induction strategies onto extended-release buprenorphine. In participants with high-risk opioid use, these findings demonstrate that RI onto extended-release buprenorphine is well tolerated and had higher retention than SI at the second injection (primary end point; 312 [66.4%] vs 138 [54.5%]; difference, 11.8%). Similarly, RI had higher retention than SI in more difficult-to-treat fentanyl-positive participants (difference, 14.8%). RI did not increase the frequency or severity of AEs. These data add to the evolving published evidence supporting effectiveness and safety of single-day buprenorphine initiation, with or without fentanyl use, and are consistent with other instances in which only a single transmucosal buprenorphine dose is administered prior to initiation of an extended-release buprenorphine product.

Buprenorphine induction is the first step to stable buprenorphine maintenance. The ultimate goal of RI is to reach a therapeutic buprenorphine concentration as soon as possible to manage OUD without inducing precipitated withdrawal that could jeopardize continued engagement in extended-release buprenorphine treatment. This study shows that RI with same-day administration of extended-release buprenorphine increases the number of individuals who complete induction and receive injections 2 and 3. It also supports safe administration of the second injection at least 1 week after the first. By receiving the second extended-release buprenorphine injection earlier, patients minimized the time below target plasma buprenorphine levels (≥ 2 ng/mL), which helps to control symptoms of craving and withdrawal.

Many participants in this study reported long-term opioid (including fentanyl) use, daily use, polysubstance abuse, and prior failed attempts at opioid withdrawal or maintenance treatment with buprenorphine or other medications for OUD. Fentanyl use was a particularly strong risk factor for early withdrawal symptoms and discontinuation during buprenorphine therapy initiation. Poorer outcomes associated with fentanyl use were particularly apparent in the SI treatment arm. Despite differences in timing of visits and injection, treatment retention in the fentanyl-negative SI subpopulation in this study appears broadly consistent with expectations from the original phase 3 study conducted before widespread fentanyl availability, which reported induction (run-in) failure in 161 of 665 participants (24.2%). In contrast, the high induction failure rate 94 of 196 (48%) in the fentanyl-positive SI subpopulation supports reports of more difficult buprenorphine induction in the current fentanyl-dominated era.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^47970a84]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone. This may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

Part 5: Buprenorphine

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Induction of buprenorphine should start with a dose of 2–4 mg. Dosages may be increased in increments of 2–4 mg.

Clinicians should observe patients in their offices during induction. Emerging research suggests, however, that many patients need "not" be observed and that home buprenorphine induction may be considered. Home-based induction is recommended only if the patient or prescribing physician is experienced with the use of buprenorphine. This is based on the consensus opinion of the Guideline Committee.

Once it has been established that the initial dose is well tolerated, the buprenorphine dose can be increased fairly rapidly to a dose that provides stable effects for 24 hours and is clinically effective. Buprenorphine doses after induction and titration should be, on average, at least 8 mg per day. The US FDA approves dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses. In addition, the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

### Reddit discussions about buprenorphine associated precipitated withdrawal in the era of fentanyl [^80607185]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Buprenorphine (Suboxone ®, a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone) is an effective, evidence-based treatment for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Buprenorphine has unique pharmacologic properties: it is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and has very high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor. Therefore, to avoid buprenorphine from displacing lower affinity, full agonist opioids (e.g. heroin) from the opioid receptor and causing withdrawal, patients seeking buprenorphine treatment must wait until they start experiencing withdrawal before initiating standard dosing regimens. If buprenorphine is initiated prior to withdrawal onset, it can displace residual opioids, causing an uncomfortable and sometimes severe acute withdrawal syndrome known as precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). POW has been defined as an increase in the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), which measures the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, of 6 or more while initiating buprenorphine. Fear of POW poses a barrier to both clinicians and patients to buprenorphine initiation.

Multiple recently published reports suggest that POW can occur even after waiting the recommended amount of time in patients with a history of heavy fentanyl use. It has been proposed that this phenomenon may occur due to the high lipophilicity of fentanyl, resulting in a long tail of elimination after chronic use. One study showed that in patients with OUD and chronic fentanyl use, urinary metabolites of fentanyl could be detected 2–3 weeks after last use when hospitalized in a treatment program. Additional risk of severe POW could be related to the dose or length of use of full opioid agonist used prior to buprenorphine induction, time interval to receiving buprenorphine, and other comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions that alter metabolism of opioids or symptoms of POW. One potential alternative approach to avoid POW is microdosing, which involves overlapping induction of buprenorphine in very small escalating doses while still using full agonist opioids. The "Bernese Method" is one such method, although several different regimens have been described in the medical literature. While the literature on this subject is growing, many people with OUD have discovered these methods through their own lived experiences.

### Reddit discussions about buprenorphine associated precipitated withdrawal in the era of fentanyl [^86f36d82]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Induction of buprenorphine, an evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), has been reported to be difficult for people with heavy use of fentanyl, the most prevalent opioid in many areas of the country. In this population, precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) may occur even after individuals have completed a period of opioid abstinence prior to induction. Our objective was to study potential associations between fentanyl, buprenorphine induction, and POW, using social media data.

Methods

This is a mixed methods study of data from seven opioid-related forums (subreddits) on Reddit. We retrieved publicly available data from the subreddits via an application programming interface, and applied natural language processing to identify subsets of posts relevant to buprenorphine induction, POW, and fentanyl and analogs (F&A). We computed mention frequencies for keywords/phrases of interest specified by our medical toxicology experts. We further conducted manual, qualitative, and thematic analyses of automatically identified posts to characterize the information presented. Results: In 267,136 retrieved posts, substantial increases in mentions of F&A (3 in 2013 to 3870 in 2020) and POW (2 in 2012 to 332 in 2020) were observed. F&A mentions from 2013 to 2021 were strongly correlated with mentions of POW (Spearman's ρ: 0.882; p = .0016), and mentions of the Bernese method (BM), a microdosing induction strategy (Spearman's ρ: 0.917; p = .0005). Manual review of 384 POW- and 106 BM-mentioning posts revealed that common discussion themes included " specific triggers of POW " (55.1%), "buprenorphine dosing strategies " (38.2%) and " experiences of OUD " (36.1%). Many reported experiencing POW despite prolonged opioid abstinence periods, and recommended induction via microdosing, including specifically via the BM.

Conclusions

Reddit subscribers often associate POW with F&A use and describe self-managed buprenorphine induction strategies involving microdosing to avoid POW. Further objective studies in patients with fentanyl use and OUD initiating buprenorphine are needed to corroborate these findings.HIGHLIGHTSIncrease in mentions of precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) on Reddit from 2012 to 2021 was associated with the increase in fentanyl and analog mentions. Experiences of precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) were described by individuals despite reporting prolonged periods of abstinence compared to standard buprenorphine induction protocols. People with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) on Reddit are using and recommending microdosing strategies with buprenorphine to avoid POW. People who used fentanyl report experiencing POW following statistically longer periods of abstinence than people who use heroin.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^cd591053]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Emergency departments (EDs) sporadically use a high-dose buprenorphine induction strategy for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in response to the increasing potency of the illicit opioid drug supply and commonly encountered delays in access to follow-up care.

Objective

To examine the safety and tolerability of high-dose (> 12 mg) buprenorphine induction for patients with OUD presenting to an ED.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this case series of ED encounters, data were manually abstracted from electronic health records for all ED patients with OUD treated with buprenorphine at a single, urban, safety-net hospital in Oakland, California, for the calendar year 2018. Data analysis was performed from April 2020 to March 2021.

Interventions

ED physicians and advanced practice practitioners were trained on a high-dose sublingual buprenorphine induction protocol, which was then clinically implemented.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Vital signs; use of supplemental oxygen; the presence of precipitated withdrawal, sedation, and respiratory depression; adverse events; length of stay; and hospitalization during and 24 hours after the ED visit were reported according to total sublingual buprenorphine dose (range, 2 to > 28 mg).

Results

Among a total of 391 unique patients (median [interquartile range] age, 36 [29–48] years), representing 579 encounters, 267 (68.3%) were male and 170 were (43.5%) Black. Homelessness (88 patients [22.5%]) and psychiatric disorders (161 patients [41.2%]) were common. A high dose of sublingual buprenorphine (> 12 mg) was administered by 54 unique clinicians during 366 (63.2%) encounters, including 138 doses (23.8%) greater than or equal to 28 mg. No cases of respiratory depression or sedation were reported. All 5 (0.8%) cases of precipitated withdrawal had no association with dose; 4 cases occurred after doses of 8 mg of buprenorphine. Three serious adverse events unrelated to buprenorphine were identified. Nausea or vomiting was rare (2%-6% of cases). The median (interquartile range) length of stay was 2.4 (1.6–3.75) hours.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that high-dose buprenorphine induction, adopted by multiple clinicians in a single-site urban ED, was safe and well tolerated in patients with untreated OUD. Further prospective investigations conducted in multiple sites would enhance these findings.

Buprenorphine for ED opioid withdrawal — evidence and research needs note that although quality ED studies are limited, several systematic reviews would imply buprenorphine administration is a safe and effective treatment and potentially superior to other modalities, and future research is needed to evaluate ED effectiveness and safety, determine optimal ED induction dose before discharge, evaluate injectable depot buprenorphine for subacute withdrawal after discharge, and clarify use after naloxone-precipitated withdrawal and as an alternative to naloxone in acute opioid overdose.

### Clinical case conference: strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^0c3936a5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The main advantage of the microdosing method is that the patient should only experience mild withdrawal symptoms at worst (if any) from any previous prescribed daily dose of methadone, although the negative is that the process takes a number of weeks to complete, but by the end, the patient should be on a stable daily dose of buprenorphine and no longer be on any methadone, providing a crossover in opioid agonist treatment.

The guidance developed locally for this method is to commence with sublingual 400 μg buprenorphine and gradually increase this dose every 24 hours initially by 400 μg, then as the dose has increased, increasing the dose increment at a greater rate (eg, 800 μg after dose reaches 3 mg, 1200 μg after dose reaches 8 mg, etc), whilst maintaining the methadone dose. Once the buprenorphine dose is over 12 mg, consideration to reducing the daily methadone dose can be made, up to 50%. Then as the buprenorphine increases further and the patient stabilizes on the dose, the methadone can be quickly reduced with few withdrawal symptoms expected, as the buprenorphine is occupying the majority of the receptor sites. The process can take 3 to 4 weeks to complete, but this is dependent on the individual patient and the rate of buprenorphine increase.

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl and related analogues continue to drive the overdose crisis in the United States, where over 100,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in 2022. Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) using opioid agonist therapies like methadone and buprenorphine were developed to address OUD from heroin, and they are mainstay treatment options proven to reduce overdose mortality.

Methadone and buprenorphine remain effective in reducing mortality and morbidity for individuals using fentanyl, but new challenges have emerged and may continue to evolve as other high-potency synthetic opioids become more prevalent in the drug supply. The unique pharmacodynamics of fentanyl often lead dependent individuals to use fentanyl several times per day to stave off withdrawal, resulting in development of a much higher opioid tolerance compared to heroin or prescription opioids. Buprenorphine appears to be more likely to precipitate opioid withdrawal in patients using fentanyl (vs heroin and other short-acting opioids), complicating the induction process and leading to a proliferation of different strategies for helping patients achieve induction. Methadone doses that were effective for patients using heroin seem to be less effective at eliminating fentanyl use, suggesting that higher doses may be required.

Methadone induction guidelines are conservative, focused on minimizing overdose risk from the methadone itself rather than rapidly reaching a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal. One reason for this caution is that studies of individuals conducted before the introduction of fentanyl to illicit drug markets found that risk of overdose is highest in the first 4 weeks after starting methadone. The specific reasons for this are not known, and guideline titration schedules are based on patient response to a dose at steady state, which is reached after 4–5 days given an average half-life of 24 hours. A 2013 expert panel convened by the American Society of Addiction Medicine recommended a maximum initial dose of 30 mg, followed by 5-mg increases no sooner than every 5 days. Other expert panels are marginally more aggressive, recommending an initial dose of 10–30 mg, followed by increases of 5–10 mg no sooner than every 3 to 4 days of daily dosing. Following either approach may still require several weeks, if not months, to reach an effective dose — generally estimated to be between 80 and 120 mg for people using heroin — that reduces nonmedical opioid use by suppressing withdrawal and opioid cravings. Achieving successful induction may become even more challenging in patients with co-occurring substance use disorders, such as methamphetamine use disorder, which has been linked to decreased retention rates. Another possibility for the increased mortality early in treatment with methadone, then, is ongoing nonmedical opioid use.

### Incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated opioid withdrawal in adults with opioid use disorder: a systematic review [^9c0bd074]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Buprenorphine is an evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, and the risk of precipitated withdrawal contributes to its underuse. The goal of this systematic review was to determine the incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in adults with opioid use disorder.

Methods

This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023437634). We searched Medline, Embase Classic + Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to 10 November 2023, and included original research that reported the incidence of sublingual buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in adults with opioid use disorder. Primary screening was completed by four independent reviewers. Full text review, data extraction and risk of bias assessments using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool were completed by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome was precipitated withdrawal. Secondary outcomes were baseline opioids used, induction dose, initial Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score, location of induction, definition and severity of precipitated withdrawal and adverse events. The range of incidence of precipitated withdrawal across studies was described.

Results

Our search yielded 10197 unique citations. Twenty-one cohort and five randomized trials met inclusion criteria (n = 4497, range 20–1293). The overall incidence of precipitated withdrawal ranged from 0 to 13.2%. Nine studies defined precipitated withdrawal; definitions were inconsistent. Most patients used heroin at baseline. The most common initial dose of buprenorphine was between 2 mg and 8 mg (range: 0.075mg-24mg). Initial minimum COWS score ranged from 5 to 13. Induction locations included home, inpatient, emergency department, pre-hospital, outpatient and residential units. Of the fifteen studies with cases of precipitated withdrawal, nine studies did not report the severity of withdrawal experienced. Other induction-related adverse events varied. The overall quality of included studies was poor.

Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests the incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in adults with opioid use disorder is low and should not be a barrier to use.

### Enhancing patient choice: using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^c49cd1de]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

More than 100,000 overdose deaths were reported in 2021, largely driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF). Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a first-line treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and, like methadone, reduces morbidity and mortality while increasing retention in care. Unfortunately, initiating BUP-NX has become more complicated as IMF has largely replaced heroin in the US drug supply.

Buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist, has high affinity and low intrinsic activation at the μ-opioid receptor. Because of these properties, buprenorphine can cause precipitated withdrawal if taken too soon or at a wrong dose after full agonist opioid. Unfortunately, this precipitation risk increases with regular fentanyl use — likely because of fentanyl's lipophilicity, which leads to a large volume of distribution and slow dissipation when used chronically. Patients have significant concerns about the severity of withdrawal needed to start buprenorphine as well as the risk of precipitated withdrawal; the possibility of a negative experience understandably fosters hesitance to begin treatment. –

Newer methods for BUP-NX initiation have been reported — generally categorized as very low- (or "microdosing"), low-, standard-, and high-dose (or "macrodose") protocols — each with potential benefits and risks (Table 1). Less common methods use transdermal, buccal sublingual, and intravenous buprenorphine formulations not readily available for this outpatient purpose. Additional effective, expedited approaches would empower patients, providing more choices regarding when and how quickly they can fully transition to lifesaving treatment.

TABLE 1
Methods for Transitioning From Full Agonists to Buprenorphine Using Readily Available Outpatient Formulations*

We present a novel approach for rapid outpatient BUP-NX initiation where a patient chose self-administration of intranasal naloxone to induce withdrawal, followed shortly by 24–6 mg BUP-NX. The patient provided written informed consent for publication, including review of the article.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^9483198e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine dosing after initiation: Evidence suggests that buprenorphine doses of 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses at suppressing illicit opioid use; the FDA generally recommends dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, noting limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses, and the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^08ebd2a8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In April 2021, to expand access to buprenorphine, the Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder exempted eligible physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives from previous Controlled Substances Act certification requirements related to training, counseling and other ancillary services (i.e. psychosocial services). To prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder for up to 30 patients in an office-based setting, clinicians can forgo or choose to undertake training but must still receive a waiver from SAMHSA. Information about qualifications and the process to obtain a waiver are available from SAMHSA.

Additional recommendations have been published on initiation, use, and monitoring of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder is usually combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal film or tablet (e.g. Suboxone), to reduce the potential for misuse of buprenorphine when injected. Naloxone is poorly absorbed orally; however, if buprenorphine/naloxone is manipulated and injected, naloxone can trigger opioid withdrawal. In 2018, long-acting injectable formulations of buprenorphine became available. As a partial agonist, buprenorphine should generally not be initiated until there are objective signs of withdrawal, to avoid precipitating withdrawal. As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, certain studies have described a low-dose initiation approach (sometimes referred to as microdosing) to avoid precipitating withdrawal when initiating buprenorphine, although evidence regarding this approach is limited. Low-dose buprenorphine initiation is a potential option for patients with opioid use disorder who are taking opioid medications for pain. With this dosing strategy, full agonist opioids can be continued while buprenorphine is initiated, and the patient does not need to experience opioid withdrawal symptoms. For standard (not low-dose) buprenorphine initiation, after objective signs of withdrawal are observed, buprenorphine should be initiated and titrated upward under supervision at approximately 2-hour intervals as needed to control withdrawal symptoms. Protocols for initiating buprenorphine by patients at home after an initial encounter with a clinician to establish the diagnosis of opioid use disorder and discuss medication options are in use by more experienced clinicians.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter acceptability and safety study of direct buprenorphine / naloxone induction in heroin-dependent individuals [^7183b28e]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To provide controlled data on direct induction with buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX) versus indirect buprenorphine (BPN)-to-BNX induction.

Design

Phase 4, prospective, randomized, active-drug controlled, parallel-group trial consisting of a 2-day, double-blind, double-dummy induction phase followed by 26 days of open-label treatment with BNX.

Setting

Nineteen sites in 10 European countries from March 2008 to December 2009.

Participants

A total of 187 opioid-dependent men and women ≥ 15 years of age.

Measurements

The primary objective was assessment of patient response to direct and indirect BNX induction [proportion of patients receiving the scheduled 16-mg BNX dose on day 3 (i.e. first day post-induction)]. Secondary assessments included illicit drug use, treatment retention and compliance, withdrawal scale scores, and safety.

Findings

Patient response to direct- versus indirect-BNX induction was similar [direct 91.4% (85/93) versus indirect 90.4% (85/94); 95% confidence interval (CI): -7.3%, 9.2%]. Rapid dose induction (16 mg of BPN equivalent on day 2) was acceptable and 72% of patients completed treatment (day 28). There were no significant differences in secondary measures across groups. An average BNX maintenance dose of 15.3 mg across groups was associated with substantial reductions in illicit opioid use and no self-reported intravenous misuse. Treatment compliance and retention rates were similar (98.5% and 81.3%, respectively). Treatment-emergent adverse event rates were comparable: 75% versus 74% for direct- versus indirect-induction groups, respectively.

Conclusions

Direct buprenorphine/naloxone induction was a safe and effective strategy for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. Response to high-dose direct buprenorphine/naloxone induction appears to be similar to indirect buprenorphine-to-buprenorphine/naloxone induction and was not associated with reports of intravenous buprenorphine/naloxone misuse.

### 48-hour induction of transdermal buprenorphine to extended-release buprenorphine [^98b1c171]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Buprenorphine extended-release (BUP-XR) provides sustained delivery of buprenorphine to control withdrawal and craving symptoms in the form of a monthly injectable and has been shown to improve health outcomes in patients with opioid use disorder. It is recommended that patients are stabilized with a transmucosal buprenorphine product, for at least 7 days per the product monograph; however, clinically, this timeline may be expedited. We report a case of a hospitalized patient with unregulated fentanyl use who underwent a successful transdermal buprenorphine induction for 48 hours to initiate BUP-XR with minimal levels of withdrawal and without precipitating opioid withdrawal. The approach described could provide a practical, patient-centered, accelerated induction strategy that, once independently validated, could considerably facilitate the use of BUP-XR.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Zubsolv) [^dbca43be]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The induction of buprenorphine therapy with ZUBSOLV was evaluated in two blinded randomized, non-inferiority studies. The identical blinded induction phase component of the studies was designed to assess the tolerability of ZUBSOLV versus generic buprenorphine tablets when used as initial treatment, as measured by retention in treatment. The studies included opioid dependent (DSM-IV criteria) male and female patients 18 to 65 years of age. Induction doses for generic buprenorphine tablets were 8 mg for day 1 and 8 mg or 16 mg for day 2. The induction doses for ZUBSOLV were 5.7 mg/1.4 mg for day 1 and 5.7 mg/1.4 mg or 11.4 mg/2.8 mg for day 2. In the first study, 758 patients were randomized. In the second study, 310 patients were randomized.

Both protocols stipulated that first Day 1 dose would be given under supervision, with an initial dose of buprenorphine 2 mg or ZUBSOLV 1.4 mg. Subsequently, investigators were provided an option to give buprenorphine 6 mg or ZUBSOLV 4.2 mg as a single dose 1.5 hours after the second dose, or to divide the second dose of study medication into 3 separate dosing occasions of ZUBSOLV 1.4 mg/0.36 mg or generic buprenorphine 2 mg each, 1 to 2 hours between doses, if there was precipitated withdrawal after the first dose, as assessed by the investigator. The option to divide the second dose was used at the discretion of the investigators only rarely in Study 2 (5%), compared to more frequent use in Study 1 (22%).

Results for Day 3 retention rate from each study are presented in Table 6. The lower rate of retention on Day 3 observed for ZUBSOLV in comparison to generic buprenorphine in Study 2 may be attributable to the infrequent use of divided dosing.

### Unobserved "home" induction onto buprenorphine [^65a1ef55]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Unobserved, or "home" buprenorphine induction is common in some clinical practices. Patients take the initial and subsequent doses of buprenorphine after, rather than during, an office visit. This review summarizes the literature on the feasibility and acceptability, safety, effectiveness, and prevalence of unobserved induction.

Methods

We searched the English language literature for studies describing unobserved buprenorphine induction and associated outcomes. Clinical studies were assessed by strength of design, bias, and internal and external validity. Surveys of provider practices and unobserved induction adoption were reviewed for prevalence data and key findings. We also examined previous review papers and international buprenorphine treatment guidelines.

Results

N = 10 clinical studies describing unobserved induction were identified: 1 randomized controlled trial, 3 prospective cohort studies, and 6 retrospective cohort studies. The evidence supports the feasibility of unobserved induction, particularly in office-based primary care practices. Evidence is weak to moderate in support of no differences in adverse event rates between unobserved and observed inductions. There is insufficient or weak evidence in terms of any or no differences in overall effectiveness (treatment retention, medication adherence, illicit opioid abstinence, other drug use). N = 9 provider surveys assessed unobserved induction: observed induction logistics are seen as barriers to buprenorphine prescribing; unobserved induction appears widespread in specific locations. International guidelines reviewed emphasize clinician or pharmacist observed induction (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia); only one (Denmark) explicitly endorses unobserved induction.

Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence supporting unobserved induction as more, less, or as effective as observed induction. However, the predominantly observational and naturalistic studies of unobserved induction reviewed, all of which have significant sources of bias and limited external validity, document feasibility and low rates of adverse events. Unobserved induction seems to be widely adopted in US and French regional provider surveys. Prescribers, policy makers, and patients should balance the benefits of observed induction such as maximum clinical supervision with the ease-of-use and comparable safety profile of unobserved induction.

### Evaluation of buprenorphine rotation in patients receiving long-term opioids for chronic pain: a systematic review [^648efd0b]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Rotation Protocols

Buprenorphine rotation protocols were diverse. Of the 17 unique protocols that were identified, 9 were adaptations of protocols that were originally intended for buprenorphine induction in individuals with OUD without chronic pain. These 9 protocols required the presence of mild opioid withdrawal symptoms before the first buprenorphine dose and/or low starting doses, reassessment of withdrawal symptoms, and additional dose administration if needed. Eight protocols instructed individuals to stop opioids 8 to 24 hours before the first buprenorphine dose, and 3 protocols required an overnight waiting period. Individuals who were switching from methadone hydrochloride or transdermal fentanyl were instructed to wait longer (about 36–72 hours).,

In 2 protocols, participants were randomized to structured buprenorphine tapering conditions; in 1 study, participants were allowed to switch to the steady-dose group if they could not tolerate the tapering. Another protocol required that patients were unable to taper their previous opioid use before being offered buprenorphine rotation. In 10 of 14 protocols without a structured tapering condition, rotation to buprenorphine was reported as completely voluntary. For the 4 remaining protocols, it was not specified whether rotation was voluntary or a contingency of ongoing treatment.,

Buccal or sublingual buprenorphine was used exclusively in 13 protocols, often in combination with naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate. Transdermal buprenorphine was used exclusively in 2 protocols. Two protocols provided multiple buprenorphine formulations. Buprenorphine sublingual or buccal dosing varied widely, from a first-day total dose of 600 μgto a maximum possible dose of 32 mg. Nine protocols divided administration into 2 to 4 doses per day. Transdermal buprenorphine dosing also varied widely, from 5 μg/hto 140 μg/h. The study by Tang et alapplied a microdose approach to minimize anxiety and withdrawal symptoms, whereby a lower-dose transdermal formulation of buprenorphine served as a bridge to higher sublingual doses. Ten protocols allowed additional medication to ease symptoms of withdrawal, although specific medications varied., eTable 6 in the Supplement describes the buprenorphine rotation protocols.

### Incidence of precipitated withdrawal during a multisite emergency department-initiated buprenorphine clinical trial in the era of fentanyl [^210f3460]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Buprenorphine treatment is associated with decreased mortality and morbidity, yet the treatment gap remains wide. Emergency departments (EDs) offer an effective, low-barrier setting in which to initiate buprenorphine. Retrospective case serieshave raised concerns about increased incidence of precipitated withdrawal (PW) when buprenorphine is initiated in persons using fentanyl, a high-potency μ-opioid agonist with high affinity and slow dissociation from the μ receptor. With long-term use, its high lipophilicity leads to bioaccumulation and prolonged metabolite excretion. As confidence in standard buprenorphine inductions has eroded, alternative strategies, such as low-dose buprenorphine, have emerged, often prompting continued use of illicit opioids. Thus, there is a need for high-quality evidence from prospective studies using uniform surveillance and operational definitions of PW. We report the incidence of PW as part of an ongoing randomized clinical trialcomparing traditional sublingual buprenorphine with CAM2038, a 7-day extended-release injectable form of buprenorphine, conducted in sites with high prevalence of fentanyl.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: a review [^492902fb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Early pharmacology studies of buprenorphine require careful interpretation for several reasons. (1) Most use a single dose or once-daily dosing to measure peak and minimum plasma concentrations and time course of decay (Fig. 2); more frequent dosing may be preferred by some patients because of improved stability of plasma concentration.(2) Protective effects of buprenorphine when heroin was the prevalent illicit opioid must be reevaluated in the context of the current drug supply; fentanyl's potency is ≥ 20 times that of hydromorphone, so many fentanyl-dependent individuals will require a higher buprenorphine dose and MOR occupancy than found in the 2003 study to block withdrawal, craving, and opioid reward. (3) Individual variability is substantial; sublingual buprenorphine's bioavailability varies between individualsby a factor of 3, and individuals vary widely in the doses they require for specific protections against withdrawal, craving, and opioid reward blockade. Dose limits disregard this known variability, jeopardizing an individual patient's care.

Figure 2

Plasma concentration of buprenorphine over a 24-hour blood sampling period after once-daily dosing in 5 heroin-dependent volunteers maintained on 0, 2, 16, and 32 mg/d buprenorphine. The thick line at 3 ng/mL is at the level required to suppress drug "liking" of a high-dose hydromorphone challenge and the red shaded area indicates concentrations where such drug "liking" occurs (Fig. 1).

Improved Safety at Higher Doses

Buprenorphine is extremely safe in comparison to full agonist opioids owing to its ceiling effect on inducing respiratory depression. Buprenorphine also provides protection against overdose toxicity of full agonist opioids such as fentanyl because of its high lipophilicity and high affinity for MOR and consequent functional antagonism. In a 2022 study, opioid-tolerant participants were infused with increasing stepwise buprenorphine doses targeted to steady-state plasma concentrations of 1, 2, and 5 ng/mL. At each step, participants then received infusions of fentanyl at cumulative doses that would produce apnea in the absence of buprenorphine. Apnea was completely suppressed at 5 ng/mL of buprenorphine, but at its lower concentrations at 2 and 1 ng/mL, fentanyl had an appreciable effect on decreasing ventilation. A concentration of 5 ng/mL is slightly higher than the average plasma concentration achieved with 32 mg/d of sublingual buprenorphine (Fig. 2).

### Home buprenorphine / naloxone induction in primary care [^665964cf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Buprenorphine can be used for the treatment of opioid dependence in primary care settings. National guidelines recommend directly observed initial dosing followed by multiple in-clinic visits during the induction week. We offered buprenorphine treatment at a public hospital primary care clinic using a home, unobserved induction protocol.

Methods

Participants were opioid-dependent adults eligible for office-based buprenorphine treatment. The initial physician visit included assessment, education, induction telephone support instructions, an illustrated home induction pamphlet, and a 1-week buprenorphine/naloxone prescription. Patients initiated dosing off-site at a later time. Follow-up with urine toxicology testing occurred at day 7 and thereafter at varying intervals. Primary outcomes were treatment status at week 1 and induction-related events: severe precipitated withdrawal, other buprenorphine-prompted withdrawal symptoms, prolonged unrelieved withdrawal, and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Results

Patients (N = 103) were predominantly heroin users (68%), but also prescription opioid misusers (18%) and methadone maintenance patients (14%). At the end of week 1, 73% were retained, 17% provided induction data but did not return to the clinic, and 11% were lost to follow-up with no induction data available. No cases of severe precipitated withdrawal and no SAEs were observed. Five cases (5%) of mild-to-moderate buprenorphine-prompted withdrawal and eight cases of prolonged unrelieved withdrawal symptoms (8% overall, 21% of methadone-to-buprenorphine inductions) were reported. Buprenorphine-prompted withdrawal and prolonged unrelieved withdrawal symptoms were not associated with treatment status at week 1.

Conclusions

Home buprenorphine induction was feasible and appeared safe. Induction complications occurred at expected rates and were not associated with short-term treatment drop-out.

### Ambulatory microdose induction of buprenorphine-naloxone in two adolescent patients with sickle cell disease [^c4df82d3]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematologic disorder defined by presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells that can occlude blood vessels and cause tissue ischemia and pain. Treating SCD pain adequately and safely is difficult given today's opioid climate. Buprenorphine-naloxone has been described as an alternative option to treat chronic pain in the adult literature; however, it historically required discontinuation of full-agonist opioids before initiation, resulting in opioid withdrawal. Herein we present two adolescents with SCD who successfully weaned off large doses of full-agonist opioids by using microdose induction of buprenorphine-naloxone in clinic, without experiencing significant opioid withdrawal. Ambulatory microdose induction may remove hurdles that otherwise would discourage patients from trying this regimen while still controlling pain safely.

### Outpatient low-dose initiation of buprenorphine for people using fentanyl… [^7cc6397d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Type of LDI protocol selected by individuals: 4-day or 7-day protocol. Main Outcomes and Measures. LDI involves administering frequent doses of buprenorphine, often in low milligram doses, minimizing precipitated withdrawal risk. 17, 21–23 Despite growing interest in and potential advantages of LDI, the existing literature primarily is from inpatient or international settings and is limited to case series. 22–25 Prior case series have discussed the role of LDI in outpatient settings. 25, 26 However, understanding of LDI outcomes in outpatient settings remains minimal and needed, especially as the majority of buprenorphine initiations occur in the outpatient setting. Alternatively, individuals could have opted for traditional initiation, which involves abstaining from fentanyl use for at least 48 to 72 hours and experiencing at least moderate withdrawal before taking 8 mg or higher doses of buprenorphine.

In all cases, clinicians offered adjunctive medications for withdrawal for all initiation strategies, naloxone, and counseling on harm-reduction strategies for safer drug use. Individuals then picked up their buprenorphine prescriptions in a bubble pack and any other medications from CBHS Pharmacy. CBHS Pharmacy also assisted with splitting buprenorphine tablets prior to bubble packaging and offered additional counseling on pickup. The exposure of interest was the type of LDI protocol selected: either the 4-day or 7-day protocol. The primary outcome was successful buprenorphine initiation, defined as self-reported completion of the LDI protocol at a follow-up visit and pickup of a subsequent buprenorphine refill of 8 mg daily dose or higher within 1 month of the initiation date.

We hypothesized that individuals on their second or more LDI attempt would have higher odds of successful initiation due to being more motivated or experienced during repeat attempts, and a 4-day protocol may have higher odds of successful initiation than the 7-day protocol due to individuals being less likely to drop off with a shorter duration for initiation. For example, the mechanism of action of injectable buprenorphine formulations offers a slow onset of medication that may mimic LDI protocols, with similarly lower risk of precipitated withdrawal. 50, 51 Direct initiation using newer, weekly formulations of injectable buprenorphine without requiring moderate initial withdrawal may be more appropriate for people who are unable to tolerate complex LDI instructions. 51 Evidence on this practice, however, is relatively nascent and requires further study. 51–53.

### Hospital-based methadone and buprenorphine initiation practices by addiction consult services [^2fb9c7de]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Survey Development

The survey (eAppendix in Supplement 1) was based on a prior study assessing practice variation in low-dose buprenorphine initiation, literature and recent ASAM Clinical Consensus Statement, and the research team's expert opinion. We examined the face validity of the survey through pilot testing with addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry clinicians. Case-based scenarios were refined using one-on-one cognitive interviews, a structured interview method used for eliciting understanding of the questions and thought process to ensure consistent interpretation. Cognitive interviews were conducted over video conference with a geographically diverse group of 3 addiction medicine and 3 addiction psychiatry specialists; after each interview, the cases were iteratively refined.

The survey included definitions for each methadone and buprenorphine initiation method. We defined standard methadone initiation based on 2021 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration guidanceas 40 mg maximum on day 1 with up-titration of 5 to 10 mg every 3 days. Rapid methadone initiation was defined as any initiation regimen more rapid than the standard initiation (using higher doses or shorter duration between dose escalations).

We defined 3 buprenorphine initiation practices based on ASAM Clinical Considerations.(1) Traditional initiation starts with a first dose of 2 to 4 mg of buprenorphine after reaching moderate withdrawal. (2) High-dose initiation (ie, macrodosing) starts with the first dose (8–16 mg) of buprenorphine after reaching moderate withdrawal. (3) Low-dose initiation (ie, overlapping or microdosing) starts with low doses of buprenorphine (eg, 0.5 mg sublingual), which gradually increases while continuing full opioid agonists. We defined a fourth option, buprenorphine rescue (ie, buprenorphine administration after intentional naloxone-precipitated withdrawal) based on recent case reports.

### A case of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal managed with high-dose buprenorphine [^13b0a069]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Buprenorphine-naloxone has a very high affinity for the mu-receptor and can cause precipitated opioid withdrawal, typically more severe than withdrawal that occurs naturally, when administered while a full mu-opioid receptor agonist remains in a person's system. To avoid precipitated withdrawal, one needs to be in mild to moderate opioid withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine-naloxone induction. Recently, there have been reported cases of precipitated withdrawal occurring in patients taking fentanyl knowingly or unknowingly, despite them being in adequate opioid withdrawal at the time of induction. When this occurs, the current recommendation is to provide 2 mg of buprenorphine-naloxone every 1–2 hours.

Objectives

Describe a case of successful management of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal with escalation of the dose of buprenorphine and highlight implications for future management.

Methods

We present a case of a patient with a history of opioid use disorder who was in moderate opioid withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine-naloxone induction and experienced precipitated withdrawal after buprenorphine-naloxone administration.

Results

High-dose buprenorphine-naloxone was given to the patient and precipitated withdrawal subsided after receiving a total of 20 mg. On the next day, the patient had no symptoms of opioid withdrawal and is currently maintained on 16 mg/day.

Conclusion

With the rising prevalence of fentanyl-laced drugs, increased instances of precipitated withdrawal are likely to be encountered. In cases of precipitated withdrawal, giving a high dose of buprenorphine-naloxone rapidly is safe and will allow rapid reversal of withdrawal symptoms.

### Buprenorphine initiation in the era of high-potency synthetic opioids: a call for community-based participatory research to help learning health systems provide precision medicine for opioid use disorder [^32d5f565]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

High-potency synthetic opioids and adulterants have saturated the US opioid supply, heightening risk to people who use drugs and creating challenges to buprenorphine initiation. As buprenorphine is an essential component of a response to the opioid crisis, a robust evidence base is urgently needed. Rapid research, in partnership with people who use drugs and using community-based participatory research practices to ensure trust, shared goals, and an absence of adverse consequences, should be conducted to help identify the factors associated with successful and failed inductions. Among factors to be considered include detailed assessment of substances used, amount of substances used, time between last use and buprenorphine induction, withdrawal severity at time of buprenorphine induction, dose of buprenorphine, impact of buprenorphine on withdrawal severity, and perhaps even genotypic information. Successful conduct of these efforts in learning health systems can help us move toward precision medicine for opioid use disorder.

### Low dose initiation of buprenorphine: a narrative review and practical approach [^9e1ea836]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Low dose buprenorphine initiation, is an alternative method of initiating buprenorphine in which the starting dose is very low and gradually increased to therapeutic levels over a period of days. This method takes advantage of slow displacement of the full opioid agonist from mu-opioid receptors, avoiding the need for a person with opioid use disorder to experience opioid withdrawal symptoms before initiating buprenorphine, while also minimizing the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal. With this initiation method, full opioid agonists can be continued as buprenorphine is initiated, expanding the population to which buprenorphine can be offered. To date, the literature on low dose initiation is primarily case-based but rapidly growing. While evidence emerges, guidance for the use of low dose initiation is clearly desired and urgently needed in the context of an increasingly risky and contaminated opioid drug supply, particularly with high potency synthetic opioids, driving overdose deaths. Despite limited evidence, several principles to guide low dose initiation have been identified including: (1) choosing the appropriate clinical situation, (2) initiating at a low buprenorphine dose, (3) titrating the buprenorphine dose gradually, (4) continuing the full opioid agonist even if it is nonmedical, (5) communicating clearly with frequent monitoring, (6) pausing or delaying buprenorphine dose changes if opioid withdrawal symptoms occur, and (7) prioritizing care coordination. We review a practical approach to low dose initiation in hospital-based and outpatient settings guided by the current evidence.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^fd4e9528]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In the FAS, a total of 560 received extended-release buprenorphine injection 1 (409 [86.3%] and 151 [59.2%] in the RI and SI treatment arms, respectively), 452 received extended-release buprenorphine injection 2 (314 [66.2%] and 138 [54.1%], respectively), and 407 received injection 3 (278 [58.6%] and 129 [50.6%], respectively) (Figure 1), thereby completing the study. A total of 408 of 474 participants (86.1%) in the RI arm and 219 of 255 (85.9%) in the SI arm had a single transmucosal buprenorphine induction attempt, and 56 of 474 (11.8%) in the RI arm and 31 of 255 (12.2%) in the SI arm had 2 attempts. Among RI participants who received injection 1, 415 of the 474 total patients (87.6%), 317 of 367 fentanyl-positive patients (86.4%), and 98 of 107 fentanyl-negative patients (91.6%) did not require the use of additional transmucosal buprenorphine on day 1; none had a transmucosal buprenorphine dose greater than 8 mg after extended-release buprenorphine. Among the 154 SI participants, all but 3 reported induction periods of 7 days or longer. On the first transmucosal buprenorphine induction day (during the 5 hours on-site), in the SI arm, 111 received a total transmucosal buprenorphine dose of 4 mg or less, 120 received 6 to 12 mg, and 24 received more than 12 mg.

Results

Participants

A total of 391 unique ED patients (median [interquartile range] age, 36 [29–48] years; 267 men [68.3%]) were identified as having been treated with SL-buprenorphine (monoproduct) between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018, during a total of 579 ED visits. Of the patients, 170 (43.5%) were Black, and 57 (14.6%) were Hispanic or Latino. Many patients were homeless (88 patients [22.5%]) and had comorbid non–substance use–related psychiatric disorders (161 patients [41.2%]). More than one-half (209 patients [53.5%]) had never been treated with (or self-prescribed illicitly) buprenorphine (Table 1).

Table 1.
Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients Receiving Sublingual Buprenorphine Induction for Opioid Use Disorder

Outcomes

All 579 ED visits were grouped into escalating categories of SL- buprenorphine dose and analyzed. There were 366 (63.2%) high-dose inductions using more than 12 mg of SL-buprenorphine, including 138 doses (23.8%) greater than or equal to 28 mg (Table 2). Review of vital sign documentation, including measurements of blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, found no significant association with total buprenorphine dose. No patient was administered naloxone at any time after buprenorphine administration. We found no documentation of decreased respiratory rate in the highest dose group of 28 mg or higher (Figure 2). Supplemental oxygen was administered during 17 encounters. Three patients with documented chronic obstructive pulmonary disease accounted for 9 of those encounters, and all oxygen supplements were administered before buprenorphine. The overall median (interquartile range) length of stay in the ED was 2.4 (1.6–3.75) hours. Most patients were triaged as low severity and were treated by an APP. The documented incidence of nausea or vomiting after buprenorphine was low (2%-6% of cases) with rates of 4% for a dose of 8 mg, 6% for doses of 10 to 12 mg, 5% for doses of 16 mg, 2% for doses of 20 to 24 mg, and 2% for doses of 28 mg or higher.

Urine drug testing may be used to detect or confirm suspected opioid and other drug use with informed consent from the mother, realizing that there may be adverse legal and social consequences of her use. State laws differ on reporting substance use during pregnancy. Laws that penalize women for use and for obtaining treatment serve to prevent women from obtaining prenatal care and worsen outcomes.

Pregnant women who are physically dependent on opioids should receive treatment using methadone or buprenorphine monoproduct rather than withdrawal management or abstinence.

Care for pregnant women with opioid use disorder should be comanaged by an obstetrician and an addiction specialist physician. Release of information forms needs to be completed to ensure communication among healthcare providers.

Treatment with methadone or buprenorphine should be initiated as early as possible during pregnancy.

Hospitalization during initiation of methadone or buprenorphine may be advisable due to the potential for adverse events, especially in the third trimester.

In an inpatient setting, methadone should be initiated at a dose range of 20–30 mg, not to exceed 40 mg on day 1. Incremental doses of 5–10 mg are given every 3–6 hours, as needed, to treat withdrawal symptoms.

Initiation or induction of buprenorphine may lead to withdrawal symptoms in patients with physical dependence on opioids. To minimize this risk, induction should be initiated when a woman begins to show objective, observable signs of moderate withdrawal, but before severe withdrawal symptoms are evidenced. This usually occurs 6 hours or more after the last dose of a short-acting opioid, and typically 24–48 hours after the use of long-acting opioids. Hospitalization during initiation of treatment with buprenorphine may be advisable due to the potential for adverse events, especially in the third trimester. Drug dosing is similar to that in women who are not pregnant (see "Part 5: Buprenorphine" for more information).

Safety Outcomes

Safety was analyzed for the FAS. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed throughout the study. AEs related to hepatic disorders or injection site reactions were reported based on customized queries. AEs associated with opioid withdrawal were identified by the investigator (see eMethods in Supplement 1 for evaluation of withdrawal on induction days). Laboratory measures were performed at screening. Blood samples were collected to assess liver function tests prior to each extended-release buprenorphine dose. Vital signs and 12-lead electrocardiographic findings were assessed at screening and before transmucosal buprenorphine induction and extended-release buprenorphine injections. Vital signs were also measured between extended-release buprenorphine injection 2 and 3.

### Successful buprenorphine / naloxone low-dose induction in pregnancy: a case report [^df934b12]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Following buprenorphine/naloxone low-dose induction to 18 mg, she missed 4 days of medication and used nonprescribed opioids at low doses to minimize withdrawal. She then presented to the clinic in withdrawal and did a traditional buprenorphine/naloxone induction, titrating up to 12 mg on day 1 (2 mg every 2 hours). She stabilized and stopped using nonprescribed opioids at a dose of 24 mg. She was able to stabilize on buprenorphine/naloxone and was abstinent from nonprescribed opioids, as was her goal. She later decided to switch to methadone, because of not "liking how she felt" on buprenorphine/naloxone. She continued to be abstinent from nonprescribed opioids and gave birth to her infant at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 40 weeks and 4 days gestational age, with Apgar scores of 5 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes Her newborn's birth weight was appropriate for gestational age at 3600 g.

She roomed in with her infant while they were treated with a short course of oral morphine for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. She continues to be engaged in MOUD and is parenting.

The low-dose-induction protocol that was used in this case is outlined in Table 1, although many other variations of this protocol are being used successfully and can range from 1 to 3 weeks of dose titration, often based on patient preference.

### Extended-release 7-day injectable buprenorphine for patients with minimal to mild opioid withdrawal [^9e95aa3d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

A new 7-day injectable formulation of extended-release buprenorphine, known as CAM2038 (Braeburn), offers a novel method to initiate buprenorphine that does not require stabilization on sublingual buprenorphine and therefore provides an opportunity to surmount many of the barriers associated with the sublingual formulation. A 7-day single injection avoids unnecessary delays to full induction and addresses the often-fragmented and barrier-laden health care system that may thwart rapid access to follow-up care. Our group's clinical experience with this 7-day injectable formulation of extended-release buprenorphine has been previously described. The slower rate of rise in plasma buprenorphine concentration of extended-release buprenorphine, reaching 1.6 ng/mL in 4 hours compared with 5.6 ng/mL in sublingual dosing, potentially permits buprenorphine initiation in patients with minimal to mild withdrawal, as measured by the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS). This could allow more patients to benefit from buprenorphine induction with 7 days of ensured medication delivery and time to obtain outpatient follow-up. Thus, we evaluated the feasibility, including acceptability, tolerability, and safety, of extended-release buprenorphine in patients with untreated OUD exhibiting minimal to mild withdrawal, defined as COWS scores ranging from 0 to 7 (in which higher scores indicate increasing withdrawal), in a multicenter single-arm prospective study conducted under a US Food and Drug Administration investigational new drug application.

### Synergistic effect of ketamine and buprenorphine observed in the treatment of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal in a patient with fentanyl use [^228b6eaa]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal (BPOW) is unclear. Full agonist treatment of BPOW is limited by buprenorphine's high-affinity blockade at mu-opioid receptors (μORs). Buprenorphine's partial agonism (low intrinsic efficacy) at μORs can limit the effectiveness of even massive doses once BPOW has begun. Adjunct medications, such as clonidine, are rarely effective in severe BPOW. Ketamine is an N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with a potentially ideal pharmacologic profile for treatment of BPOW. Ketamine reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms independently of direct μOR binding, synergistically potentiates the effectiveness of buprenorphine μOR signaling, reverses (resensitizes) fentanyl induced μOR receptor desensitization, and inhibits descending pathways of hyperalgesia and central sensitization. Ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects potentially address depressive symptoms and subjective distress that often accompanies BPOW. Ketamine is inexpensive, safe, and available in emergency departments. To date, neither ketamine as treatment for BPOW nor to support uncomplicated buprenorphine induction has been described.

Case Description

We report a case of an illicit fentanyl-using OUD patient who experienced severe BPOW during an outpatient low-dose cross taper buprenorphine induction (ie, "microdose"). The BPOW was successfully treated in the emergency department with a combination of ketamine (0.6 mg/kg intravenous over 1 hour) combined with high-dose buprenorphine (16 mg sublingual single dose); 3 days later he was administered a month-long dose of extended-release subcutaneous buprenorphine which was repeated monthly (300 mg). At 90 days the patient remained in treatment and reported continuous abstinence from fentanyl use.

Conclusions

This single case observation raises important questions about the potential therapeutic role of ketamine as a treatment for BPOW. BPOW is an important clinical problem for which there is currently only limited guidance and no universally accepted approach. Prospective study comparing the effectiveness of differing pharmacologic approaches to treat BPOW is urgently needed.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^9618e6c2]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Part 5: Buprenorphine — initiation, dosing, and setting describes that buprenorphine is a recommended treatment for patients with opioid use disorder who can give informed consent and have no specific contraindication. For patients who are currently opioid dependent, buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal, after which buprenorphine administration should start with a dose of 2–4 mg and dosages may be increased in increments of 2–8 mg. The setting for initiation should be carefully considered, with both office-based and home-based initiation considered safe and effective. Following initiation, the dose should be titrated to alleviate symptoms, with evidence suggesting that 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses, while there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of doses higher than 24 mg per day and higher doses may increase the risk of diversion. The FDA recently approved several new buprenorphine formulations for treatment of opioid use disorder, and as data regarding their effectiveness are currently limited, clinicians should use these products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence, and patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed with offers or referrals to psychosocial treatment in conjunction with buprenorphine, noting that declining or absence of such treatment should not preclude buprenorphine treatment.

### Advanced inpatient management of opioid use disorder in a patient requiring serial surgeries [^682d8f85]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Opioid use disorder has affected many lives across the US. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including buprenorphine, have been shown to decrease mortality in this patient population. Here we present a case of a 32-year-old woman on buprenorphine/naloxone undergoing multiple surgical operations, whose course included buprenorphine discontinuation, methadone initiation, and buprenorphine re-induction using a novel "microdosing" approach. This report includes a presentation of the case and a discussion of the clinical decision making and relevant literature to give hospitalbased providers a perspective on management of peri-operative patients on MOUD.

### Induction of opioid-dependent individuals onto buprenorphine and buprenorphine / naloxone soluble-films [^936fa20f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

A sublingual soluble-film formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opioid dependency. This preparation provides unit-dose, child-resistant packaging amenable to tracking and accountability, offers more rapid dissolution, and has a potentially preferred taste vs. tablets. This study compared the ability of buprenorphine (B) and B/N films to suppress spontaneous withdrawal in opioid-dependent volunteers. Participants were maintained on morphine and underwent challenge sessions to confirm sensitivity to naloxone-induced opioid withdrawal. Subjects were randomized to receive either B (16 mg, n = 18) or B/N (16/4 mg, n = 16) soluble films for 5 days. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score. Thirty-four subjects completed induction onto soluble films. There was a significant decrease in COWS scores but no significant differences between the groups. The results support the use of B and B/N soluble films as safe and effective delivery methods for opioid induction.

### Successful buprenorphine / naloxone low-dose induction in pregnancy: a case report [^43e8c613]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Buprenorphine/naloxone low-dose induction has successfully been used clinically in Vancouver with many patients, and this case report describes the first documented successful use of low-dose induction as an outpatient in our community during pregnancy. Since this first case study, low-dose-induction protocols have been used successfully in our community with other pregnant individuals, without precipitated withdrawal or obstetric complications. When used thoughtfully in appropriately selected circumstances with informed patient consent, this may enhance trauma informed care, by increasing the opportunity for patients to have choice in their treatment options and increase collaboration between health care providers and pregnant women with opioid use disorder.

### Direct induction of buprenorphine extended-release: a case report [^f7f8291d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Buprenorphine has superior safety in opioid use disorder compared with alternatives due to its action as a partial opioid agonist, which limits its ability to cause respiratory depression. There is a risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal after buprenorphine exposure in someone using full opioid agonists. Buprenorphine induction strategies that avoid precipitated withdrawal remain a crucial component for starting buprenorphine in individuals actively using opioids. These strategies start with low doses of buprenorphine increasing over time, which may avoid precipitated withdrawal at the cost of an extended initiation period, potentially discouraging patients and increasing healthcare costs. A 55-year-old male with severe opioid use disorder and unregulated fentanyl use presented after an overdose, was admitted due to a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and anemia (hemoglobin of 4.4 g/dL), and was given 300 mg of buprenorphine injection depot subcutaneously without any prior buprenorphine stabilization. Prior to injection, he was taking 30 mg of methadone and 96 mg of oral hydromorphone equivalents daily. Over the 6 hours after injection, he received another 272 mg oral hydromorphone equivalents and experienced a maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score of 7. Over the next 18 hours, he received no additional hydromorphone, and his Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale was a maximum of 1. This case illustrates a buprenorphine induction method without precipitated withdrawal by relying on the elution of buprenorphine from the subcutaneous depot alongside full agonist opioids that are given as needed. If these results are readily replicable, this approach may have significant implications for the accessibility and acceptability of buprenorphine for patients and providers.

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^1581e643]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methadone Taper

The mean final dose of methadone 5 days before transfer to buprenorphine, ranged from 19 mg to 78 mg, with an overall weighted mean of 46 mg. Methadone was discontinued with no apparent dose reduction in 9 studies. including 2 of the 4 studies that included patients taking relatively high doses of methadone.

Seven studies used a fixed or flexible methadone dose taper. In one of these studies, taper was offered to patients, but it is not reported whether any patients chose that strategy. In another study, one of 3 groups was randomized to taper.

Concomitant Medications

Many studies allowed adjunctive medications to relieve withdrawal symptoms during the transfer. These included lofexidine, clonidine, benzodiazepines, analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and loperamide (Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2).

Presence of Withdrawal Features and Timing of the Initial Dose of Buprenorphine

Most studies required patients to exhibit features of opiate withdrawal before initiating buprenorphine, though many did not objectively describe the severity of withdrawal. Four studies required patients to reach a threshold on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) before induction of buprenorphine treatment. Thresholds were COWS scores > 10, ≥ 10, ≥ 12, and ≥ 13. Buprenorphine was given no sooner than 42 hours after the last methadone dose in 2 studies, and no sooner than 24 hours in a third; the interval duration was not reported in the fourth study.

In 4 studies, patients were provided an initial dose of buprenorphine at a set time since the last methadone dose, potentially regardless of the presence of withdrawal symptoms.,

Buprenorphine Induction

Only 1 study tested different buprenorphine induction protocols. Patients were randomized to a slow, moderate, or rapid transfer after methadone discontinuation (no taper; details in Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2).

Buprenorphine Product

Almost all studies used single-ingredient buprenorphine, but 6, used buprenorphine combined with naloxone. One study used the single-ingredient product in the first part of the study but switched to the combination product when it became available. Various routes of administration were used, but in most of the studies, buprenorphine was administered sublingually (Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2).

Details about each study's dosing strategies are provided in Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2; the general strategies are summarized here.

Transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine — dosing, timing, and withdrawal thresholds specify that lower methadone doses transition more comfortably, initiation should occur in withdrawal, and specific buprenorphine doses are outlined. "Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort; whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may find that transitioning causes significant discomfort". "To minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal, it is recommended that clinicians use careful initial dosing followed by rapid titration up to an appropriate maintenance dose". "Patients should be experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the transition. This would typically occur up to 24–48 hours after the last dose of methadone", and "A COWS score of 11–12 or more is generally sufficient for significant withdrawal to allow a safe and comfortable initiation onto buprenorphine". "An initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine should be given… [and] additional 2–8 mg doses as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms".

### Low-dose induction of buprenorphine in pregnancy: a case series [^2e3d2492]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Because of a risk of precipitated withdrawal occurring from buprenorphine induction in people who use fentanyl, low-dose inductions are becoming increasingly common. However, little evidence exists on the use of this method in pregnant people.

Methods

We conducted a case series of all pregnant people treated for opioid use disorder with low-dose buprenorphine induction at the University of Maryland Medical Center between January 1, 2021, and August 22, 2022. Primary outcome was completion of induction regimen. Secondary outcomes were self-report of withdrawal, continuation of buprenorphine until delivery, and return to or continuation of illicit opioid use.

Results

Six pregnant people were prescribed a total of 10 buprenorphine inductions. Five of the 6 pregnant people (83.3%) completed at least 1 induction, none of whom experienced precipitated withdrawal. Two of 6 (33.3%) continued buprenorphine until the time of delivery, and 1 of 6 (16.7%) abstained from illicit opioid use.

Conclusions

The low-dose buprenorphine induction regimen described was successful in 5 of 6 pregnant individuals. Further research, particularly regarding continuation rates, is needed.

### Successful buprenorphine / naloxone low-dose induction in pregnancy: a case report [^a3ae819f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This represents an off-label use of buprenorphine/naloxone and a novel method of induction in pregnancy that has not previously been documented. Because of the lack of research on this method, it is essential to have a discussion and obtain informed consent from a patient by discussing risks and benefits before offering a buprenorphine/naloxone low-dose induction in pregnancy.

Galati et aldescribe the use of a buprenorphine patch as a bridge to sublingual buprenorphine in pregnancy. Although this is also an alternate low-dose-induction method, in our practice context, buprenorphine patches are not feasible for most individuals because of financial barriers and lack of private insurance coverage.

Risks include lack of previous study of this method of induction, theoretical precipitated withdrawal, and an increased length of time to get to therapeutic dose of buprenorphine/naloxone compared with traditional induction. As low-dose induction takes longer than traditional induction, patients may be at increased risk of overdose for longer because of continued use of nonprescribed opioids. Consideration could be made to prescribe opioids during the low-dose-induction protocol to limit risks from nonprescribed opioids, particularly in the context of a poisoned drug supply.

Benefits of low-dose induction are that patients are not required to go into withdrawal before starting the first dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. This is an option for starting buprenorphine/naloxone in patients who cannot tolerate withdrawal, do not want to experience withdrawal, or are unable to stop using other types of opioids before the buprenorphine/naloxone induction.

Although this transition was done successfully in a closely monitored outpatient setting, with regular follow-up, an inpatient setting could also be considered. In the case of inpatient low-dose induction, prescribed opioids should be available during the titration phase. If the patient presents to medical care in moderate opioid withdrawal, the traditional induction method would still be considered first line.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^2d4832d4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Limitations

The primary limitations of this study are its retrospective design in a single site. We relied on clinical documentation as the source of data for evaluation of our primary and secondary outcomes and did not prospectively compare the high-dose clinical pathway with the traditional induction strategies. Clinicians did not always document a complete COWS score but did document pertinent symptoms, such as large pupils or diaphoresis, or a summative clinical impression of opioid withdrawal. Thus, comparison of initial and subsequent COWS scores was not available for analysis. As an early California Bridge site, ED clinicians received extensive training in assessing and treating patients with OUD.

Risks inherent to retrospective reviews, such as incomplete and/or inconsistent documentation found in the EHR and the reliability of abstracting it accurately, were mitigated by the use of a predetermined robust collection instrument by a well-trained blinded research assistant and excellent interrater reliability determined using a separate cohort of patients before study extraction. Potential adverse events were reviewed by expert clinicians who were independent of the clinical site. The expertise of the clinicians provides assurances related to the quality of the relevant data abstracted from the medical record (ie, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and opioid-related distress), and makes it unlikely that a serious adverse event, such as precipitated withdrawal or excessive sedation, would not be documented. Precipitated withdrawal is not subtle, and its signs and symptoms are readily apparent and would result in medications administered. Documentation by the physician, APP, or nurse would be available.

The results may not be generalizable to other EDs without staff expertise and with the availability of other buprenorphine formulations, because only the monoproduct was used. It is possible that high-dose induction using a combination buprenorphine-naloxone formulation could result in clinically meaningful absorption of naloxone.

### Low dose buprenorphine induction with full agonist overlap in hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^8d2f157d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the outcomes of buprenorphine/naloxone low dose induction with overlap of full opioid agonists among hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) as an alternative to standard induction strategies.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of patients with OUD who were admitted to the hospital over a 1-year period and initiated ono buprenorphine using initial doses of 0.5 mg and gradually increased while the patient remained on full agonists. Descriptive variables included basic demographics, reason for switching to buprenorphine, baseline opioid and morphine equivalent dose. The primary outcome was a successful transition defined by the patient leaving the hospital with a buprenorphine prescription. Bivariate analysis identified factors associated with unsuccessful medication transitions. Secondary outcomes included reported withdrawal symptoms and 30 day follow up to an outpatient buprenorphine program.

Results

Sixty two patients underwent low dose with overlap induction during the study period. Fourteen patients were on methadone for OUD before hospital admission. Fifty one patients (82%) successfully left the hospital with a prescription for buprenorphine. Factors associated with lower likelihood of success included older age, transitioning due to discharge placement needs and presence of withdrawal symptoms during the transition. Overall, 66% (N = 23) of patients referred within the same health care system followed up within 30 days.

Conclusions

Low dose inductions with overlap of full opioid agonists were largely successful in transitioning hospitalized patients from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine. However, there were several factors associated with lower likelihood of success. Future work could focus on treatment of withdrawal symptoms and system-level changes ensuring patient-centered medication decisions.

Legislation has enabled physicians to treat opioid-dependent patients with an office-based maintenance program using buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist. Clinical studies indicate buprenorphine effectively manages opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is more effective than placebo for managing opioid addiction but may not be superior to methadone if high doses are needed. It is comparable to lower doses of methadone, however. Treatment phases include induction, stabilization, and maintenance. Buprenorphine therapy should be initiated at the onset of withdrawal symptoms and adjusted to address withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Advantages of buprenorphine include low abuse potential and high availability for office use. Disadvantages include high cost and possible lack of effectiveness in patients who require high methadone doses. Most family physicians are required to complete eight hours of training before they can prescribe buprenorphine for opioid addiction.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^33d8d679]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal in the ED — cautions and monitoring include administering buprenorphine only to patients in active opioid withdrawal confirmed by history and physical examination, recognizing that its high binding affinity and partial agonist properties may induce significant withdrawal if the patient is currently receiving opioids; particular care is required when transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine because of risk of severe and prolonged precipitated withdrawal, tools such as the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale may assist with assessing severity, and because ED dosing data are evolving, monitoring best practices is prudent with additional information available at the listed resources.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^bb52034d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Buprenorphine indications, initiation, and dosing: Buprenorphine is a recommended treatment for patients with opioid use disorder who are able to give informed consent and have no specific contraindication, and for patients who are currently opioid dependent buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Once objective signs of withdrawal are observed, initiation should start with a dose of 2–4 mg and dosages may be increased in increments of 2–8 mg, with the initiation setting determined by clinical judgement because both office-based and home-based initiation are considered safe and effective when starting buprenorphine treatment. Following initiation, the buprenorphine dose should be titrated to alleviate symptoms to enable patients to discontinue illicit opioid use, evidence suggests that 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of doses higher than 24 mg per day with the use of higher doses potentially increasing the risk of diversion. The FDA recently approved several new buprenorphine formulations for treatment of opioid use disorder and, as effectiveness data are currently limited, clinicians should use these products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence as it becomes available. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs in conjunction with buprenorphine, but a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay buprenorphine treatment with appropriate medication management.

### Evaluating buprenorphine / naloxone microdosing vs [^f83d627b]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview This is a multi-centre, open-label RCT at four Emergency Departments in British Columbia and Alberta. The purpose of the current study is to compare the effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone microdosing and standard dosing take-home induction regimens at enabling patients to successfully complete the induction regimen, and at retaining patients on opioid agonist therapy. We will randomize our enrolled patients to receive take-home microdosing or standard dosing packages of buprenorphine/naloxone. For the microdosing arm, patients immediately start taking low doses that increase to effective levels without requiring them to go into withdrawal. We hypothesize that ED patients provided buprenorphine/naloxone microdosing packages will be more likely to successfully complete the induction period compare to patients provided standard dosing packages.

We furthermore hypothesize that those provided microdosing will be more likely to be retained in opioid agonist therapy, and will experience lower overdose, mortality, and healthcare utilization subsequent to their ED visit. The primary objective of the current study is to compare the effectiveness of ED-initiated buprenorphine/naloxone take-home standard dosing and microdosing interventions for patients with opioid use disorder identified at the four study ED's, with regard to a) successful completion of the induction period and b) retention on opioid agonist therapy at 30, 90, and 365 days following ED visit, or decreasing overdose, mortality and healthcare utilization. The study will offer co-interventions to both the intervention and control groups that will be outlined in study-related pre-printed clinical ordersets.

This will include symptomatic treatment of nausea/vomiting, and pain or myalgias, to use in the first two days of inductions, when the investigators expect withdrawal symptoms to be most challenging, especially for standard dosing. | Participant Group/Arm|The control intervention will be provision of a buprenorphine/naloxone standard dosing package from the ED. This will consist of a five day package with a commonly accepted standard dosing regimen aiming to achieve a therapeutic buprenorphine/naloxone dose within 24 hours of initiation.

### High dose buprenorphine (BUP) induction in the… [^d98ad001]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

The design of Trial 1 and Trial 2 will be described separately. Trial 1 is a prospective test of the safety and tolerability of 32 mg of BUP as an induction dose with the recommended BUP induction dose. Dosing for the 12 mg cohort is planned to be 8 mg at t = 0 and 4 mg at 30–60 min. The dosing for the 32 mg cohort is planned to be 16 mg at t = 0 and 16 mg at 30–60 min. The frequency of unacceptable dose limiting toxicities is set at > 10%. The study will therefore compare two cohorts of 10 participants, with the potential for 5 extra participants per cohort if 1 dose limiting toxicity is observed in the first 10 subjects in a cohort. Patients who sign written informed consent will be enrolled in the study and assigned to a dose cohort. Assignment in Trial 1 is sequential, not randomized.

Participants will receive their full dose over 30–60 minutes and be observed for a total of 4-hours in the ED from the time of their first BUP dose.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone (buprenorphine HCl and naloxone HCl) [^91ce4388]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2 Important Dosage and Administration Information

Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be used in patients who have been initially inducted using Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets.

Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.

2.3 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid
Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Advise patients and caregivers that naloxone may also be administered for a known or suspected overdose with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets itself. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary due to the long duration of action of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and its affinity for the mu opioid receptor [see Overdosage (10)].

Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^2d83fecc]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine chronic pain management — split dosing of buprenorphine with dosing every 6–8 hours may be adequate for chronic pain management in many patients with opioid use disorder and chronic pain. Chronic opioid therapy, especially at high doses, may heighten pain sensitivity, and some evidence suggests that patients experiencing substantial pain on high doses of full agonist opioids experience improved pain management when switched to buprenorphine. Buprenorphine therapy carries a lower risk of adverse effects, especially overdose, compared to full agonist opioids.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^05d20b12]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine and acute pain management — temporarily increasing buprenorphine dosing and/or dividing the dose may be effective for acute pain management; the analgesic effects last for approximately 6–8 hours while withdrawal and craving suppression lasts for approximately 24 hours, and increasing the daily dose by 20–25% and splitting it into 3–4 doses can often adequately address acute pain; when moving to split dosing the clinician should ensure that the patient has not missed their last non-split dose. Patients with acute pain refractory to other treatments may benefit from as-needed buprenorphine, and adding a short-acting full opioid agonist to the patient's regular dose of buprenorphine can be effective; the guideline committee recommends that this may be considered in supervised settings, such as during hospitalization. In situations when a full opioid agonist is used for pain management, discontinuation of buprenorphine is not required; if buprenorphine is discontinued during severe pain to allow more mu opioid receptor availability, patients should be monitored closely because high doses of a full agonist may be required, and as the partial agonist effect dissipates the full agonist effect may lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression.
