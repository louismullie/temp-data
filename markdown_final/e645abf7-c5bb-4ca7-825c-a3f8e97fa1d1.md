## Question

What is the significance of T-wave inversions on an ECG?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of T-wave inversions (TWI) on ECG and how to interpret them step-by-step, including physiologic variants, pathologic red flags, differential diagnoses, special populations, prognostic implications, and a diagnostic workup algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition of TWI and which leads count. Then, I should differentiate physiological from pathological patterns by lead distribution, depth, and ST-T morphology. Next, I will review major etiologies by category, including ischemia, cardiomyopathies, and systemic or neurologic causes. After that, I should consider special populations such as children and athletes, and finally outline a pragmatic diagnostic approach, follow-up, and risk stratification while verifying points with evidence at each step.

> Let me first confirm the definition, because precision here prevents misclassification. TWI is generally defined as a negative T wave of at least 1 mm in depth in two or more contiguous leads, and importantly, we typically exclude aVR, III, and V1 because inversion there can be physiological; wait, I initially included III and aVR when scanning for contiguity, but I should correct that and exclude them to avoid overcalling pathology, and I also need to ensure proper lead placement and technical quality before interpretation [^113pYyj5] [^114vbRCf] [^111aFTso].

> Now, I need to consider physiological or benign patterns so I don't over-test. Juvenile repolarization with anterior TWI in V1–V3 is common in children and tends to resolve with puberty, so persistence beyond about 14–16 years is what should trigger further scrutiny; hold on, I should verify the age trajectory — yes, longitudinal athlete cohorts show anterior TWI largely normalizes by mid-adolescence, with inferolateral TWI remaining rare and more concerning [^115Di6HZ] [^11793T1V]. In athletes, especially Black/Afro-Caribbean athletes, anterior TWI in V1–V4 preceded by J-point elevation and convex ST elevation can be a benign training-related pattern; however, in White athletes, TWI beyond V2 is uncommon and warrants workup, so I need to be ethnicity- and lead-specific in my interpretation [^112k4rRM] [^115JLsem]. Lastly, I should remember cardiac memory: after periods of abnormal ventricular activation (pacing, intermittent bundle branch block, tachyarrhythmia), transient TWI can occur even when ischemia is excluded, and I should check for preceding wide QRS or device pacing before labeling it ischemia [^115a9Eru] [^115Nh8JX].

> Next, I should identify red flags that increase the pretest probability of disease. Let me think about distribution first: lateral or inferolateral TWI (I, aVL, V5–V6, and/or II, aVF) is uncommon in healthy athletes and strongly associated with cardiomyopathy, so this pattern should prompt comprehensive evaluation and follow-up, even if the initial echo is normal [^114eJm3V]. I need to check the depth: shallow ≤ 2 mm inversions are more often benign, whereas deeper inversions, especially around 5 mm or more, correlate with structural disease on imaging and should not be dismissed; I should confirm a lateral predilection as another risk enhancer [^113QPWRi]. I should also examine ST-segment morphology and the J-point: minimal or absent J-point elevation or any ST depression preceding TWI is a marker that pushes me toward pathology rather than a physiological variant, although J-point elevation alone has limited specificity, so I must integrate the entire pattern before concluding [^112T7mGW] [^1166FN3t]. Persistence beyond puberty or failure to normalize with a period of de-training in uncertain athletic cases also argues for further evaluation rather than watchful waiting [^11793T1V].

> I will now examine ischemic etiologies, and I need to avoid a common pitfall. Wellens' pattern involves biphasic or deep symmetric TWI in the anterior leads in pain-free intervals and signifies critical proximal LAD disease requiring urgent evaluation; I first thought Wellens' always presents with ST elevation, but wait, that's not correct — Wellens' is classically a non–ST-elevation presentation with dynamic TWI reflecting myocardial edema and stunning, and missing it risks large anterior MI [^111jqTwo] [^112bRuQb]. In NSTE-ACS broadly, T-wave abnormalities correlate with myocardial edema and adverse events, though I should be careful: isolated TWI may not independently predict mortality after multivariable adjustment, whereas ST depression with concomitant TWI, particularly in V4–V6, portends higher 1-year mortality, so coexisting STD modifies risk substantially [^116QnQW6] [^112F4ohN] [^112pfDYY].

> Post-infarction patterns also matter. Persistent TWI months after a Q-wave MI suggests transmural scar and is associated with worse LV function and adverse remodeling, so when I see chronic-phase TWI over infarcted territories, I should anticipate reduced ejection fraction and wall-motion abnormalities and adjust management accordingly [^1162RT15]. Additionally, I need to keep Takotsubo syndrome in mind: after initial ST changes, progressive diffuse TWI with QT prolongation commonly evolves and then resolves over weeks, which can mimic ischemia but follows a characteristic temporal pattern aligned with myocardial edema and ballooning phenotype on imaging [^114ZC4s3].

> Next, cardiomyopathies are a major bucket, and I need to be precise with criteria. In arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, anterior TWI in V1–V3 or beyond in persons over 14 years old (without complete RBBB) is a major diagnostic criterion; hold on, I should verify the age cutoff and lead criteria — yes, that threshold and lead set are codified in contemporary ARVC/AC criteria and carry strong diagnostic weight in the right clinical context [^114RqNqF]. Left-dominant or biventricular variants often show inferolateral TWI with low limb-lead QRS voltages and RBBB-morphology VT, coupled with subepicardial/mid-myocardial LGE on CMR, so if I see lateral TWI with low voltages, I should actively look for LV LGE and arrhythmic phenotypes [^1134ivPC]. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, TWI is common and correlates with basal anteroseptal hypertrophy and LGE, and importantly, in athletes with deep lateral TWI, CMR frequently unmasks cardiomyopathy when echocardiography is unrevealing, so I should not stop at a normal echo in this setting [^111iY28n] [^114ewdZB].

> But wait, I should broaden the differential beyond ischemia and cardiomyopathy. Pulmonary embolism can produce TWI in V1–V4 and inferior leads as part of RV strain physiology, myocarditis and pericarditis may present with diffuse TWI later in the course, and certain valvular entities such as mitral valve prolapse with inferior TWI can signal a potentially malignant MVP phenotype associated with papillary muscle scarring and ventricular arrhythmias, so I need to correlate with symptoms, imaging, and rhythm data before settling on a cardiac or extracardiac cause [^111qnvW1] [^115HZWWF].

> Next, I should review special populations to refine pretest probability. In athletes, ethnicity and age meaningfully shift interpretation: Black athletes commonly show benign anterior TWI in V1–V4 preceded by J-point/ST elevation, whereas extension beyond V2 in White athletes is unusual and warrants evaluation; I should confirm that the presence of lateral or inferolateral TWI in any athlete substantially raises the likelihood of cardiomyopathy and merits comprehensive workup and longitudinal follow-up even if the initial testing is normal [^112k4rRM] [^115JLsem] [^114eJm3V]. With growth and maturation, anterior TWI largely resolves by mid-adolescence, so persistence after age 14–16 should not be dismissed as a juvenile pattern without further assessment, and short de-training can sometimes help distinguish physiology from pathology when the diagnosis remains equivocal [^11793T1V] [^111qgBmQ].

> I should also consider prognostic data in the general population and in AF. Isolated TWI is associated with higher long-term risks, including a roughly threefold increase in sudden cardiac death or cardiovascular mortality in cohort studies, and this risk gradient tends to scale with the magnitude and persistence of TWI even after accounting for traditional risk factors, so I need to incorporate TWI into global risk assessment rather than viewing it as a benign incidental finding [^112mZSrK] [^117Eu9Rw]. In atrial fibrillation, inverted T waves during AF rhythm independently predict a higher incidence of cardiac death, MI, and heart failure hospitalization, so I should not ignore repolarization abnormalities simply because the rhythm is irregular [^111uTkwC].

> Determining a diagnostic workup algorithm, I need to ensure safety first. If TWI is new or dynamic in a symptomatic patient, I should promptly evaluate for acute ischemia with history, serial high-sensitivity troponins, and early invasive assessment when ACS probability is high, recognizing that TWI plus ST depression in V4–V6 signals worse outcomes in NSTE-ACS whereas isolated TWI may not independently drive short-term mortality after adjustment [^112pfDYY] [^112F4ohN]. For non-acute settings, core evaluation includes a detailed personal/family history (syncope, SCD, cardiomyopathy), examination, and transthoracic echocardiography, followed by cardiac MRI when echo is normal but red-flag TWI patterns persist (notably lateral or inferolateral TWI), because CMR can detect fibrosis and subtle phenotypes missed by echo; extended testing with exercise testing, ambulatory ECG, and, in athletes, thoughtful de-training may help clarify physiology versus pathology [^114ewdZB] [^113FirgF] [^111qgBmQ]. Throughout, I should adhere to ECG standards and ensure correct lead placement and quality to avoid diagnostic errors from technical factors [^115M3BxX].

> Let me reconsider and summarize the practical takeaways to ensure completeness. Anterior TWI in children and some athletes can be physiological, particularly when limited to V1–V2 in White individuals or V1–V4 in Black athletes with J-point/ST elevation, whereas lateral or inferolateral TWI, deeper inversions, absent J-point elevation or ST depression, persistence beyond puberty, and association with symptoms or family history should trigger comprehensive evaluation for cardiomyopathy or ischemia; cardiac memory and extracardiac causes like PE, CNS events, or hypothyroidism remain important differentials when the clinical context fits, and even when no overt disease is found, TWI can carry prognostic weight and may warrant periodic re-evaluation [^115JLsem] [^114eJm3V] [^111qnvW1] [^112mZSrK].

T-wave inversions on EKG suggest myocardial ischemia or infarction — especially when new, deep, or symmetric — and may indicate structural heart disease such as hypertrophic or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^112pfDYY] [^111iY28n] [^1134ivPC]. They may also reflect right ventricular strain from pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension and can be seen with pericarditis, myocarditis, electrolyte disturbances, or as benign variants in athletes and children [^111qnvW1] [^1166FN3t] [^115JLsem] [^115Di6HZ]. Significance and management depend on clinical context, lead location, and associated ECG changes [^1143aXgx].

## Clinical significance of T-wave inversions

T-wave inversions occur in a range of **cardiac and non-cardiac conditions**, including:

- **Myocardial ischemia or infarction**: Commonly seen in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina [^112F4ohN].

- **Structural heart disease**: Associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) [^1134ivPC] [^111iY28n].

- **Right ventricular strain**: Seen in conditions such as pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary hypertension [^111qnvW1].

- **Pericarditis and myocarditis**: Inflammatory conditions of the heart can cause T-wave inversions [^1166FN3t].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia and other electrolyte imbalances can lead to T-wave inversions [^111qnvW1].

- **Benign variants**: T-wave inversions can be normal variants in athletes, children, and certain ethnic groups [^111H2pjg] [^115Di6HZ] [^115JLsem].

---

## Lead-specific interpretation of T-wave inversions

The **clinical significance** of T-wave inversions depends on the ECG leads involved:

| **Lead location** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Anterior leads (V1-V4) | - Commonly associated with myocardial ischemia <br/> - ARVC <br/> - HCM <br/> - Pulmonary embolism <br/> - Right ventricular strain [^1134ivPC] [^114RqNqF] [^116QnQW6] |
| Inferior leads (II, III, aVF) | - Myocardial ischemia <br/> - Inferior myocardial infarction <br/> - Mitral valve prolapse <br/> - Pulmonary embolism [^111qnvW1] [^115HZWWF] |
| Lateral leads (I, aVL, V5, V6) | - Myocardial ischemia <br/> - Lateral myocardial infarction <br/> - HCM <br/> - LVH <br/> - Pericarditis [^114eJm3V] [^111iY28n] |
| Right precordial leads (V1-V3) | - ARVC <br/> - Right ventricular strain <br/> - Pulmonary embolism <br/> - Benign variants in athletes and children [^1134ivPC] [^111H2pjg] [^114RqNqF] |

---

## Clinical context and associated symptoms

Clinical context and associated symptoms are crucial for determining the **significance of T-wave inversions**:

- **Chest pain**: Suggests myocardial ischemia or infarction [^112pfDYY].

- **Shortness of breath**: May indicate pulmonary embolism or right ventricular strain [^111qnvW1].

- **Syncope or palpitations**: Raises suspicion for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy or other structural heart diseases [^1134ivPC].

- **Asymptomatic**: May represent benign variants, especially in athletes or children [^115Di6HZ].

---

## Prognostic implications

T-wave inversions have **important prognostic implications**, including an **increased risk of cardiovascular events**; they are associated with higher risks of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and other adverse outcomes [^112mZSrK] [^111yJiwG] [^117Eu9Rw]. They also serve as an **indicator of underlying cardiac pathology** — such as structural heart disease or myocardial ischemia — and often warrant further evaluation and management [^111iY28n] [^1134ivPC].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation and management

When **T-wave inversions are detected**, consider the following evaluation and management steps:

- **Clinical history and physical examination**: Assess for symptoms, risk factors, and family history of cardiac disease [^1143aXgx].

- **Repeat ECG and cardiac biomarkers**: Evaluate for dynamic changes and myocardial injury.

- **Echocardiography and cardiac MRI**: Assess for structural heart disease, myocardial fibrosis, or edema [^111iY28n].

- **Stress testing or coronary angiography**: Evaluate for myocardial ischemia or coronary artery disease [^112F4ohN].

- **Management**: Depends on underlying cause, ranging from medical therapy (e.g. anti-ischemic medications, anticoagulation) to invasive interventions (e.g. coronary angiography, pacemaker implantation) [^111qnvW1].

---

T-wave inversions on EKG suggest **myocardial ischemia, structural heart disease, right ventricular strain, or benign variants**. Evaluation and management are guided by clinical context, lead location, and associated symptoms [^1166FN3t].

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^114RqNqF]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Anterior T-wave inversion (TWI) in precordial leads exceeding V2 may also be a physiological variant in adolescent athletes aged 14 years or younger, or in black (Afro-Caribbean) athletes — both adolescent and young adults — when preceded by J-point elevation and convex ST-segment elevation. It may also be observed in some Caucasian endurance athletes with a persistent "juvenile pattern".

In the clinical setting, anterior TWI is a recognized hallmark of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) and (more rarely) of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This pattern is observed in 2% to 4% of patients with HCM, but it may be present in as many as 80% of patients with AC experiencing adverse events. Currently, anterior TWI is a major criterion for the diagnosis of AC. Specifically, inverted T waves in right precordial leads (V1, V2, and V3) or beyond, in individuals over 14 years of age (in the absence of complete right bundle-branch block QRS ≥ 120 ms), constitute a major diagnostic criterion for AC, while inverted T waves in leads V1 and V2 in individuals over 14 years of age (in the absence of complete right bundle-branch block) is considered a minor criterion. Conversely, in the presence of complete right bundle-branch block, only anterior TWI beyond V3 could be considered a minor criterion.

### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Evaluation of the current diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis [^1134ivPC]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Left-dominant variants of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy show distinctive ECG features of LV involvement. These features include T-wave inversion in the infero-lateral leads and low QRS voltages (< 0.5 mV) in limb leads, reflecting the loss of myocardium and electrical voltages of the LV wall. Ventricular tachycardia is characteristically monomorphic, with an RBBB morphology, indicating its origin from the LV. The typical LV imaging phenotype is characterized by a ventricular remodeling pattern, consisting of mild LV dysfunction and no or mild LV dilatation, in association with a significant amount of subepicardial/mid-myocardial (non-ischemic) LGE affecting multiple LV segments, mostly the inferolateral wall regions. The degree of systolic LV dysfunction appears related to the global extent of LGE, which in advanced disease affects multiple septal and LV free wall segments.

In biventricular variants of ARVC, clinically demonstrable RV involvement is an important additional criterion for differential diagnosis with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In the absence of clinically detectable RV involvement, demonstration of a pathogenic mutation of ARVC-related genes, such as DSP, FLNC, and PLN genes, may support the diagnosis of ARVC.

- **Key points**: Criteria for diagnosis of left-sided ARVC phenotypes should include: (i) ECG changes such as low QRS voltages in limb leads and inverted T waves in the inferolateral leads; (ii) ventricular arrhythmias with a right bundle-branch block pattern; and (iii) structural and functional abnormalities visible on imaging.

### Global T-wave inversion on electrocardiogram: What is the differential [^111qnvW1]. Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). High credibility.

T wave inversion can be attributed to several potential causes. Among them are:

- **Cardiac conduction abnormalities**: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Brugada syndrome, right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block

- **Structural heart diseases**: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, right ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stable ischemic heart disease, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- **Valvular and vascular conditions**: Pulmonary valve stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism

- **Neurological and systemic issues**: Intracranial hemorrhage, hypothyroidism, acute ischemic stroke

- **Other cardiac and systemic conditions**: Ventricular strain, acute pericarditis, myocardial infarction, constrictive pericarditis, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary embolism

Furthermore, medications such as minoxidil, digoxin, omacetaxine, fenoldopam, and nicardipine can also lead to T wave inversion.

### T-wave inversions related to left ventricular basal hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in non-apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging study [^111iY28n]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

This study investigates the relationship between T-wave inversions and left ventricular (LV) segmental hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with non-apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

- **Methods**: 196 consecutive patients with non-apical HCM underwent late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. The distribution and magnitude of LV segmental hypertrophy and LGE were assessed according to the AHA 17-segment model and analyzed in relation to T-wave inversions.

- **Results**: Of the 196 HCM patients, 144 (73%) exhibited T-wave inversions. Additionally, 144 (73%) patients had evidence of myocardial fibrosis as defined by LGE. The prevalence of LGE was significantly higher in patients with T-wave inversions compared to those without T-wave inversions (78% vs. 59%, P = 0.008). T-wave inversions were related to basal anterior and basal anteroseptal LGE (20% vs. 10%, P = 0.04 and 68% vs. 46%, P = 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, T-wave inversions were associated with greater basal anteroseptal and basal inferior wall thickness (19.5 ± 4.7 mm vs. 16.7 ± 4.5 mm, P < 0.001 and 10.9 ± 3.3 mm vs. 9.6 ± 3.0 mm, P = 0.01, respectively). By logistic regression analysis, basal anteroseptal wall thickness and LGE were independent determinants of T-wave inversions (P = 0.005, P = 0.01, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: T-wave inversions in HCM are associated with LGE and wall thickness of the left ventricular basal segments. Additionally, basal anteroseptal wall thickness and LGE are independent determinants of T-wave inversions.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^113DWx7r]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a powerful and easily available tool for the detection of cardiac disorders in asymptomatic individuals, often preceding symptoms by a considerable time [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Several studies have linked ECG abnormalities with cardiovascular (CV) events and prognosis in asymptomatic adults, predominantly for major ECG aberrations [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

Minor ECG abnormalities are common from middle age and frequently seen in clinical practice in asymptomatic subjects [13, 14]. They are generally regarded as unspecific and not linked to specific myocardial diseases [13, 15, 16, 17, 18]. The prognostic value of minor ECG abnormalities is not fully known, but they have potential for preventive considerations. Here, we present a longitudinal population‐based observational cohort study of 50-year-old men, investigating the correlation between a negative T‐wave in resting ECG and mortality during 48 years of follow-up.

### Myocardial edema underlies dynamic T-wave inversion (Wellens' ECG pattern) in patients with reversible left ventricular dysfunction [^111jqTwo]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Low credibility.

The Wellens' electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern of dynamic T-wave inversion in the anterior leads is observed in clinical conditions characterized by reversible left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (stunned myocardium), either ischemic or nonischemic. The pathophysiologic basis of this ECG pattern remains to be elucidated.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to report the contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CE-CMR) findings in four cases of Wellens' ECG pattern associated with transient LV dysfunction from a variety of clinical conditions such as myocardial bridge, coronary artery dissection, cholecystitis, and Takotsubo syndrome.

- **Methods**: All patients underwent CE-CMR at the time of acute clinical manifestations and after six to eight weeks of follow-up to assess the presence and dynamics of LV myocardial changes.

- **Results**: In all patients, the Wellens' ECG abnormalities were associated with increased signal intensity of the LV myocardium on T2-weighted sequences, suggesting myocardial edema in the absence of late enhancement on post-contrast sequences. Repolarization abnormalities and myocardial edema had a parallel time course with persistence beyond recovery of mechanical abnormalities. T-wave inversion was associated with transient prolongation of the QTc interval in all cases.

- **Conclusion**: The study results suggest that myocardial edema rather than systolic dysfunction underlies the Wellens' ECG pattern, regardless of the causative mechanism.

### Recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part II: Electrocardiography diagnostic statement list: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American College of Cardiology Foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the International Society for Computerized Electrocardiology [^1131VXCZ]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

This statement provides a concise list of diagnostic terms for ECG interpretation that can be shared by students, teachers, and readers of electrocardiography. This effort was motivated by the existence of multiple automated diagnostic code sets containing imprecise and overlapping terms. An intended outcome of this statement list is greater uniformity of ECG diagnosis and a resultant improvement in patient care. The lexicon includes primary diagnostic statements, secondary diagnostic statements, modifiers, and statements for the comparison of ECGs. This diagnostic lexicon should be reviewed and updated periodically.

### New precordial T wave inversions in hospitalized patients [^1143aXgx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The incidence of precordial T changes has been described in athletes and specific populations, while the etiology in a large patient population admitted to the hospital has not previously been reported.

- **Methods**: All electrocardiograms (ECGs) read by the same physician with new (compared to prior ECGs) or presumed new (no prior ECGs) precordial T wave inversions of greater than 1 mm (0.1 mV) in multiple precordial leads were retrospectively reviewed, and various ECG, patient-related, and imaging parameters were assessed. A total of 226 patients and their ECGs were initially selected for analysis; of these, 35 were eliminated, leaving 191 for the final analysis.

- **Results**: Patients and their ECGs were divided into five groups based on diagnosis and incidence, including Wellens syndrome, takotsubo, type 2 myocardial infarction, other (including multiple diagnoses), and unknown. Although subtle differences, including the number of T inversion leads, depth of T waves, QTc intervals, and other variables were present between some groups, diagnosis in individual cases required appropriate clinical, laboratory, or imaging studies. For example, although Wellens syndrome was identified in less than 20% of cases, a presenting history of chest discomfort with precordial T changes either on the admission or next-day ECG was highly sensitive and specific for this diagnosis. In some cases, type 2 myocardial infarction can also have a Wellens-like ECG phenotype without significant left anterior descending disease.

- **Conclusions**: Precordial T wave changes in hospitalized patients have various etiologies, and in individual cases, diagnosis requires appropriate clinical assessment.

### T-wave abnormality as electrocardiographic signature of myocardial edema in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^116QnQW6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Both T-wave abnormalities and myocardial edema in the context of NSTE-ACS carry significant prognostic value for adverse cardiovascular events; however, no studies have explored the possible interrelation between these two phenomena. In the present work, we hypothesized that T-wave abnormalities by standard 12-lead ECG may be associated with the presence of myocardial edema in NSTE-ACS.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: Practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^112pZ3uF]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Prevalence of ECG repolarisation modifications

Data from an unselected population of over 40,000 young (≤ 35 years) adult Italian Caucasian athletes revealed that T-wave inversions (≥ 0.2 mV) are rare in females and identified in less than 0.5% of all Caucasian females. Indeed, we suggest that deep T-wave inversion in Caucasian female athletes is extremely rare and should warrant investigation for an underlying cardiac disorder.

The ethnicity of an athlete also has a major effect on the prevalence of T-wave inversion. Athletes of African/Afro-Caribbean origin exhibit a significantly higher prevalence of T-wave inversion compared with Caucasians (23% vs. 3%).

### Significance of exercise induced U wave inversion as a marker for coronary artery disease [^1178UkLf]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Exercise stress testing for detecting inducible ischaemia was first introduced in the 1950s and remained one of the only methods of stressing the heart for many years. The presence of inducible ischaemia was assessed by ECG changes during exercise, along with other factors such as the duration of exercise, blood pressure and heart rate response, and metabolic equivalents achieved.

With the emergence of other tests to detect inducible ischaemia, such as dobutamine stress echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scanning, and with the decreased threshold for invasive evaluation, unusual and infrequently encountered ECG changes are not observed during exercise stress testing with the same degree of diligence. The authors describe a case of a 49-year-old male whose left anterior descending artery stenosis was diagnosed during an exercise stress test based on a negative U wave.

### Myocardial damage and left ventricular dysfunction in patients with and without persistent negative T waves after Q-wave anterior myocardial infarction [^1162RT15]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Persistent T-wave inversions during the chronic stage of Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) indicate the presence of a transmural infarction with a fibrotic layer pathologically. The aim of the present study was to examine the relation between left ventricular (LV) damage and changes in the polarity of T waves from the acute to chronic phase in patients with Q-wave anterior wall MI.

We studied 140 patients with persistent T-wave inversions in leads with Q waves (negative T-wave group) and 158 patients with positive T waves (positive T-wave group) at 12 months after anterior MI. In the positive T-wave group, the precordial T waves reverted from a negative to a positive morphology in:

- **3 months after MI**: 21 patients (3 M-positive T-wave subgroup).
- **3 to 6 months**: 52 patients (6 M-positive T-wave subgroup).
- **6 to 12 months**: 75 patients (12 M-positive T-wave subgroup).

Ten patients had persistent positive T waves without initial T-wave inversion (persistent positive T-wave group). Wall motion index and LV dimension were higher, and the wall thickness for the infarct area and LV ejection fraction were lower in the negative T-wave group than in the positive T-wave groups, except the persistent positive T-wave group in the chronic stage (p < 0.0001).

Wall motion in the infarcted area improved over the course of 1 year in the 3 M-, 6 M-, and 12 M-positive T-wave subgroups (p < 0.0001), but not in the persistent positive T-wave group. Among the patients with T-wave inversions after admission, those who had persistent negative T waves after 12 months had worse LV function.

### Prevalence and significance of T-wave inversions in predominantly Caucasian adolescent athletes [^116Y57K3]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Athletic activity is associated with electrocardiographic T-wave inversions in some adults, resembling those observed in cardiomyopathy. The prevalence and significance of T-wave inversions in adolescent athletes, who are the group most vulnerable to exercise-related sudden death from cardiomyopathy, is unknown.

- **Methods and results**: This study evaluated 1,710 adolescent athletes and 400 healthy controls. Subjects with T-wave inversions underwent intensive cardiac investigations to identify a potential cause. There was no significant difference in the overall prevalence of T-wave inversions between athletes and controls (4% vs. 3%; P = 0.46).

	- T-wave inversions in leads V1-V3 were largely confined to athletes and controls aged 16 years or older and exhibited T-wave inversions beyond V2. T-wave inversions in the inferior and/or lateral leads and deep T-wave inversions occurred infrequently in athletes (1.5% and 0.8%, respectively) and were associated with a high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy or congenital cardiac anomalies. Despite intensive investigations, no athlete was diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy.

- **Conclusions**: T-wave inversions in V1-V3 are relatively common in athletes aged 16 years or older. T-wave inversions in the inferior/lateral leads and deep T-wave inversions in any lead are unusual, warranting further investigations for underlying cardiomyopathy.

### Recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram. Part I: The electrocardiogram and its technology. A scientific statement from the American Heart Association Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias Committee, Council on Clinical Cardiology; the American College of Cardiology Foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society [^115M3BxX]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

This statement examines the relation of the resting ECG to its technology. Its purpose is to foster understanding of how the modern ECG is derived and displayed and to establish standards that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the ECG in practice. Derivation of representative waveforms and measurements based on global intervals are described. Special emphasis is placed on digital signal acquisition and computer-based signal processing, which provide automated measurements that lead to computer-generated diagnostic statements. Lead placement, recording methods, and waveform presentation are reviewed. Throughout the statement, recommendations for ECG standards are placed in the context of the clinical implications of evolving ECG technology.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^114ewdZB]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram of a 30-year-old male basketball player exhibiting T-wave inversion in the lateral and inferior leads with concomitant Q waves provided a definitive diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Schnell et al. performed a study on 155 asymptomatic athletes who exhibited deep T-wave inversion (TWI) in two or more leads, with 137 (88%) displaying lateral deep TWI. Evidence of cardiomyopathies was found in 41% of subjects with lateral TWI, with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) being the predominant diagnosis. In their study, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) detected 24 cases of disease in athletes whose echocardiogram was normal or inconclusive, with HCM being the most common diagnosis, followed by arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC).

Sheikh et al. investigated asymptomatic black and white athletes with TWI and found that 21% of athletes were diagnosed with cardiac disease. The prevalence was higher in white athletes compared to black athletes (30% vs. 12%, P = 0.027). Almost all athletes with a clinical diagnosis of cardiomyopathy exhibited lateral TWI.

Based on these findings, it is prudent to conclude that all athletes with lateral and/or infero-lateral TWI should undergo further evaluation. Even if echocardiography shows no structural heart disease, CMR should be preferentially performed. CMR provides superior results in the evaluation of HCM, particularly for the left ventricular apex, and offers the unique capability to characterize myocardial tissue, identifying the presence of myocardial fibrosis. Exercise testing and Holter ECG monitoring may also be useful, especially when ventricular arrhythmias with uncommon morphology are present.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^112pv1D1]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The presence of T-wave inversion (TWI) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in competitive athletes is a significant diagnostic challenge for sports physicians and consulting cardiologists. While TWI may be associated with benign conditions and occasionally observed in healthy athletes showing signs of cardiac remodeling, it can also indicate early signs of an underlying, concealed structural heart disease or life-threatening arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, potentially responsible for exercise-related sudden cardiac death (SCD). The interpretation of TWI in athletes is complex, and its implications for clinical practice pose a conundrum for physicians. Consequently, the detection of TWI should serve as a potential red flag on the ECG of young and ostensibly healthy athletes, warranting further investigation. This is crucial because TWI may represent the initial expression of cardiomyopathies that may not become evident until many years later, potentially leading to adverse outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide an updated report on the literature regarding TWI in athletes, with a specific focus on its interpretation and management.

### A novel method for determining the phase of T-wave alternans: Diagnostic and therapeutic implications [^1138bAgQ]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

T-wave alternans (TWA) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. However, to estimate and suppress TWA effectively, the phase of TWA must be accurately determined.

- **Methods and results**: We developed a method that computes the beat-by-beat integral of the T-wave morphology over time points within the T-wave with positive alternans. Then, we estimated the signed derivative of the T-wave integral sequence, which allows the classification of each beat to a binary phase index. In animal studies, we found that this method was able to accurately identify the T-wave phase in artificially induced alternans (P < 0.0001). The coherence of the phase increased consistently after acute ischemia induction in all body-surface and intracardiac leads (P < 0.0001).

	- Also, we developed a phase-resetting detection algorithm that enhances the diagnostic utility of TWA. We further established an algorithm that uses the phase of TWA to deliver appropriate polarity-pacing pulses (all interventions compared with baseline, P < 0.0001 for alternans voltage; P < 0.0001 for K(score)), to suppress TWA. Finally, we demonstrated that using the phase of TWA, we can suppress spontaneous TWA during acute ischemia: 77.6% for alternans voltage (P < 0.0001) and 92.5% for K(score) (P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: We developed a method to quantify the temporal variability of the TWA phase. This method is expected to enhance the utility of TWA in predicting ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death and raises the possibility of using upstream therapies to abort such events.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: Practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^114eCGMA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 2 shows T-wave inversion in leads aVR, V1–V3 in a 12-year-old asymptomatic Middle-Eastern athlete without a family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and T-wave inversion in leads aVR, V1–V4 in a 17-year-old asymptomatic mixed race (Middle-Eastern/Black African) athlete without a family history of SCD. Note that both athletes do not require further cardiological evaluation based on these ECG features.

This study aims to review the cardiology and sports medicine literature regarding the prevalence of T-wave inversion. For the purpose of this review, only T-wave inversions in two or more contiguous anterior, inferior, or lateral leads (but not aVR and III) were considered significant in athletes. An athlete is defined as an individual of young or adult age, either amateur or professional, who is engaged in exercise training on a regular basis and participates in official sports competition. Furthermore, the study examines T-wave inversion and its relationship to structural heart diseases, notably hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), with a view to identifying young athletes at risk of SCD during sport. Finally, based on the group's combined experience, the review proposes clinical management pathways, including genetic testing, for asymptomatic athletes demonstrating marked T-wave inversion but with structurally normal hearts.

### T-wave abnormality as electrocardiographic signature of myocardial edema in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^114vbRCf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Definitions for T-wave abnormality and ST depression were in accordance with the "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram" by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Association consensus statement. An isolated T-wave abnormality was considered present if the T-wave was inverted (at least 0.1 mV), isoelectric, or biphasic in leads V3 to V6, aVL, I, and II. In leads V1, aVR, and III, T-wave abnormalities were not evaluated as those can be found as normal variants.

Isolated ST depression was defined as the presence of at least 0.1 mV depression from the J point in at least two contiguous leads. ST depression and T-wave abnormality were considered to be simultaneously present when the T-wave extended from the J point + 60 ms until complete ventricular repolarization. The presence of ST-segment and/or T-wave abnormality constituted an "ischemic ECG". A "nonischemic ECG" was defined as the absence of any ST-segment and/or T-wave abnormality. ECG profiles were classified either as a dichotomous variable (i.e. ischemic versus normal/nonischemic ECG) or a nominal variable according to individual pattern of presentation: isolated T-wave abnormality, isolated ST depression, ST depression + T-wave abnormality (when simultaneously present), or normal/nonischemic ECG. When a T-wave abnormality was present, the number of leads with abnormal T waves was also recorded. Data on PR, QRS, QTc intervals, and QRS angle were also collected.

- **Exclusion criteria**: ECG exclusion criteria were left bundle branch block and atrial flutter.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: Practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^112k4rRM]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Based on a study of 1,700 highly trained athletes aged between 14 and 18 years, T-wave inversion in the anterior leads (V1–V3) is observed in 2.5% of male and female Caucasian athletes aged 16 years (0.1%) and is an indication for further investigation. In contrast, T-wave inversion in the anterior leads (V1–V4) is common in adult Black athletes. A recent study examining 904 Black athletes and 1,819 White athletes aged 14–35 years participating in 22 different sporting disciplines revealed that T-wave inversions were present in up to 25% of athletes, and half of these individuals exhibit deep (−0.2 mV) T-wave inversions. T-wave inversions in leads V1–V4 were usually asymmetric or biphasic and frequently preceded by convex ST-segment elevation. In Black athletes, T-wave inversion was only preceded by ST-segment elevation or isoelectric ST-segments but never ST-segment depression. Detailed evaluation of these athletes with echocardiography, exercise stress tests, cardiac MRI, and 24-hour Holter failed to demonstrate any of the broad phenotypic features of HCM or ARVC, and following an almost 7-year follow-up episode, there were no adverse events in Black athletes with T-wave inversions in leads V1–V4.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: Practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^112x8oyA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

T-wave inversion in the inferior and lateral leads is identified in 1.5–1.8% of adult Caucasian athletes. However, T-wave inversions in the lateral leads are confined to males and have been identified in only 0.3%. In contrast, T-wave inversions are identified in 10% of Black athletes (6% in inferior leads and 4% in lateral leads), but as with Caucasian athletes, T-wave inversion in the lateral leads is usually absent in Black female athletes.

Although T-wave inversions in the lateral leads are identified in 4% of Black athletes, we have observed two cases of aborted sudden cardiac death in two young Black football players with these repolarization changes in the absence of a structural abnormality of the heart. This indicates the presence of a subtle cardiomyopathy or an ion channel disorder. Comparison of the pattern of T-wave inversions in Black athletes and Black patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) demonstrates that T-wave inversions in Black HCM patients are usually confined to the lateral leads, being present in almost 80% of cases. In contrast, T-wave inversion in leads V1–V4 is only observed in 3–4% of HCM patients compared with 12% of Black athletes. More detailed genotype–phenotype studies are required in Black athletes to elucidate the precise nature of marked repolarization changes in the lateral leads.

### T-wave inversion, QRS duration, and QRS/T angle as electrocardiographic predictors of the risk for sudden cardiac death [^112mZSrK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic utility of isolated T-wave inversion (TWI), QRS duration, and QRS/T angle on electrocardiogram at rest as predictors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and death from all causes. The assessment of electrocardiographic findings was based on a population-based cohort of 1,951 men (age 42 to 61 years) with a follow-up period of 20 years. Isolated TWI, in the absence of ST depression, bundle branch block, or major arrhythmias, prolonged QRS duration from 110 to 119 ms, and a wide QRS/T angle of > 67° were identified from the 12-lead electrocardiograms. SCD was observed in 171 men (8.3%) during the follow-up.

TWI, with a prevalence of 2.4%, was associated with an increased risk of SCD (hazard ratio [HR] 3.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.91 to 5.71, p < 0.001) after adjustment for age and clinical factors. Similarly, prolonged QRS duration and wide QRS/T angle were significantly related to the risk of SCD, with HR 1.50 (95% CI 1.08 to 2.19, p = 0.017) for QRS duration and HR 3.03 (95% CI 2.23 to 4.14, p < 0.001) for QRS/T angle. The integrated discrimination improvement was significant when TWI (0.014, p = 0.036) or QRS/T angle (0.015, p = 0.002) was added to the model with age and clinical factors.

In conclusion, TWI, QRS duration, and QRS/T angle are significantly associated with the risk of SCD and death from all causes beyond conventional cardiovascular risk predictors in the general population.

### Association of inverted T wave during atrial fibrillation rhythm with subsequent cardiac events [^111uTkwC]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of ECG abnormalities during atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm is poorly understood. The aim of the study was to explore the impact of inverted T wave on cardiac prognosis in patients with AF.

The study enrolled 2,709 patients with AF whose baseline ECG was available from a Japanese community-based prospective survey, the Fushimi AF Registry, and examined the impact of inverted T wave in baseline ECG at AF rhythm on the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization due to heart failure.

Intraventricular conduction delay, ST segment depression, and inverted T wave were observed in 15.8%, 24.7%, and 41.4% of baseline ECG with a mean heart rate of 94.7 beats per minute. The median follow-up duration was 5.0 years. The incidence rate of the composite cardiac endpoint was significantly higher in patients with inverted T wave than those without (5.8% vs 3.3% per patient-year, log-rank p < 0.01). The higher risk associated with inverted T wave was consistent even for individual components of the composite cardiac endpoint. By multivariable analysis, inverted T wave was an independent predictor of the composite cardiac endpoint (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.85, p < 0.01). Inverted T wave was detected in 15.7% at anterior leads, 19.8% at inferior leads, and 26.6% at lateral leads. The location of inverted T wave was not associated with the risk of composite cardiac endpoint.

Inverted T wave was commonly observed in patients with AF, and its presence during AF rhythm was associated with subsequent cardiac events.

### Outcomes of investigating T wave inversion with echocardiography in an unselected young male preparticipation cohort [^114yKgdy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The associations between abnormal territories and clinical parameters are presented in **Table 1**. The baseline clinical parameters of all individuals screened are delineated, including those without abnormal T wave inversion (TWI) and those demonstrating abnormal TWI in any or each of the three territories.

- **Table 1: Clinical parameters of study cohort**: Individuals demonstrating abnormal TWI are classified by territories. Individuals with abnormal TWI in any and each of the three territories had a larger proportion of hypertensives compared to those without abnormal TWI. Those with anterior territory abnormal TWI were of a lighter weight and lower body mass index. Conversely, those with inferior and lateral territory abnormal TWIs had a heavier weight and higher body mass index.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^112T7mGW]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Calore et al. compared the ECG pattern in 80 healthy athletes with anterior TWI with 95 patients affected by HCM and 58 patients by AC. In this study, J-point elevation < 1 mm in the anterior leads showing TWI and TWI extending beyond V4 remained independent predictors for the diagnosis of either AC or HCM. On the other hand, in athletes with anterior TWI, the combination of J-point elevation ≥ 1 mm and TWI not extending over V3 excluded a cardiomyopathy, either AC or HCM (100% sensitivity and 55% specificity). Conversely, a depressed ST-segment was considered an electrical marker of cardiac pathology. These results emphasize the importance of assessing the J termination (Jt) and ST-segment preceding TWI as further markers to differentiate between physiological cardiac adaptation and a cardiomyopathy. However, there is still concern regarding the accuracy of J-point elevation as a discriminant of pathology in athletes with anterior TWI. Finocchiaro et al. reported that a J-point < 0.1 mV preceding anterior TWI is not specific for AC because it is present in the majority of healthy individuals, including athletes. Similarly, Brosnan et al. studied the electrocardiographic features differentiating AC from athlete's heart and found that J-point elevation had poor specificity (27%) and accuracy (60%) in identifying healthy athletes, being a poor discriminator of health versus disease condition.

In summary, a minimal or absent J-point elevation (< 1 mm) or a coexistent depressed ST-segment preceding TWI could suggest the presence of an underlying cardiomyopathy.

### Prevalence of cardiomyopathy in Italian asymptomatic children with electrocardiographic T-wave inversion at preparticipation screening [^115Di6HZ]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

T-wave inversion on a 12-lead ECG is usually dismissed in young people as the normal persistence of the juvenile pattern of repolarization. However, T-wave inversion is a common ECG abnormality of cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which are leading causes of sudden cardiac death in athletes. We prospectively assessed the prevalence, age relation, and underlying cardiomyopathy of T-wave inversion in children undergoing preparticipation screening.

- **Methods and results**: The study population included 2,765 consecutive Italian children (1,914 male participants; mean age, 13.9 ± 2.2 years; range 8–18 years) undergoing preparticipation screening, including an ECG. Of 229 children (8%) who underwent further evaluation because of positive findings at initial preparticipation screening, 33 (1.2%) were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. T-wave inversion was recorded in 158 children (5.7%) and was localized in the right precordial leads in 131 (4.7%). The prevalence of right precordial T-wave inversion decreased significantly with increasing age (8.4% in children < 14 years of age versus 1.7% in those ≥ 14 years; P < 0.001), pubertal development (9.5% of children with incomplete versus 1.6% with complete development; P < 0.001), and body mass index below the 10th percentile (P < 0.001). Incomplete pubertal development was the only independent predictor for right precordial T-wave inversion (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–6.8; P < 0.001). Of 158 children with T-wave inversion, 4 (2.5%) had a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy.

### Clinical implications of T-wave inversion in an asymptomatic population undergoing annual medical screening (from the Korean Air Forces Electrocardiogram Screening) [^113QPWRi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine prevalence, differentiate underlying causes, and identify the benign group in subjects with asymptomatic T-wave inversion (TWI). We retrospectively analyzed 12-lead electrocardiograms from 3,929 consecutive asymptomatic men in the Air Force (mean age 39.3 ± 8.7 years) who underwent medical screening at the Aerospace Medical Center, Korea, from September 2010 to August 2012. TWIs, other than in right precordial leads (V1 and V2), were present in 23 men (0.6%). All subjects with persistent TWI for 1 year (n = 18) underwent additional study, except for 1 patient who refused further evaluation. Of the 17 subjects with investigated persistent TWI, 8 (47.1%) had an apically displaced papillary muscle, 5 (29.4%) exhibited idiopathic TWI, 3 (17.6%) had apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 1 (5.9%) had Maron type 2 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction.

The depth of TWI was significantly shallower in the benign group (idiopathic TWI, 1.6 ± 0.5 mm) compared with the potentially nonbenign group (the others; 5.5 ± 3.3 mm, p = 0.021). Lateral lead TWI was significantly correlated with the potentially nonbenign group (46% vs. 0%, p = 0.049). In conclusion, asymptomatic TWI is not rare (0.6%), even in a healthy population such as the Korean Air Force, and at least 29.4% of subjects with TWI are considered to belong to the benign group that does not require aggressive evaluation. Criteria of TWI ≤ 2 mm, other than lateral leads without comorbidity, could help distinguish the benign group from the potentially nonbenign group.

### T-wave inversion: Cardiac memory or myocardial ischemia [^115a9Eru]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This article presents a case report of a 74-year-old man with T-wave inversion (TwI) in atrial fibrillation noted during routine pacemaker interrogation. The patient was seen for routine pacemaker interrogation, at which time he was noted to have underlying atrial fibrillation. A 12-lead electrocardiogram of the atrial fibrillation revealed significant TwIs. He was subsequently worked up for myocardial ischemia and was found to have a moderate-sized, moderate-degree inferior wall myocardial perfusion defect. He was subsequently referred for a cardiac catheterization. The cardiac catheterization revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease. The follow-up electrocardiogram revealed persistent but attenuated TwI. The TwIs were attributed to cardiac memory, a common but infrequently recognized phenomenon of which many clinical practitioners are unaware. Cardiac memory is due to the T wave tracking the preceding abnormal QRS complex and can be induced by right ventricular pacing or arrhythmias.

### Electrocardiographic T-wave inversion: Differential diagnosis in the chest pain patient [^1166FN3t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Inverted T waves produced by myocardial ischemia are classically narrow and symmetric. T-wave inversion (TWI) associated with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is morphologically characterized by an isoelectric ST segment typically bowed upward, i.e. concave, and followed by a sharp symmetric downstroke. The terms "coronary T wave" and "coved T wave" have been used to describe these ischemic TWIs. Prominent, deeply inverted, and widely splayed T waves are more characteristic of non-ACS conditions such as juvenile T-wave patterns, left ventricular hypertrophy, acute myocarditis, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, acute pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, bundle branch block, and later stages of pericarditis.

### Wellens' syndrome: A close call [^112bRuQb]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We describe a case of a middle-aged man who presented to the emergency department with typical anginal chest pains and was found to have new, deeply inverted T-waves on an ECG consistent with Wellens' syndrome. Similar to the description by Wellens et al, a critical 99% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery was confirmed by coronary angiography and successfully treated with a drug-eluting stent. It is very important that physicians recognize this ECG finding as a harbinger of a serious cardiovascular condition and the necessity for early invasive cardiac catheterization.

### Cardiac memory: An under-recognised cause of deep T wave inversion in a patient presenting with chest pain [^1129kWtx]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

T wave inversion (TWI) has many differential diagnoses, with acute myocardial ischaemia being the highest on the list of potential causes. Cardiac T wave memory is a benign, under-recognised, and clinically important phenomenon seen after periods of altered ventricular conduction. After normal ventricular conduction is restored, the T wave 'remembers' and mirrors the direction of the wide QRS complex. Therefore, negative T waves are seen in leads that had negative wide QRS complexes.

We describe the case of a 60-year-old truck driver with chest pain, deep TWI, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. After ruling out significant myocardial ischaemia, it was crucial to determine the cause of his T wave changes to provide reassurance and commercial license medical clearance. While it is currently a diagnosis of exclusion, it remains an important clinical entity for clinicians to recognise. This recognition is vital to provide an explanation for certain T wave changes and to avoid future unnecessary cardiac testing.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: Practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^112fFDYd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

- **Role of genetic testing for athletes displaying T-wave inversion**: When dealing with athletes with T-wave inversion, the clinician must address two important and distinct questions: what is the potential underlying cardiac disease and what is the potential risk of SCD? As discussed, the earliest phase of a cardiac expression may be characterized by ECG abnormalities such as T-wave inversion, preceding the later development of other identifiable structural abnormalities. This early phase of the cardiac expression creates diagnostic challenges while potentially having a significant risk of SCD.

	- However, before genetic testing occurs and in order for the athlete to fully understand the ramifications of a positive or negative genetic result, our group suggests cardiologists should follow the 2010 ESC position statement on genetic counselling and testing in cardiomyopathies. In a patient with an overt cardiomyopathy, the yield of mutation identification is variable according to the disease: 50–70% in HCM and around 40% in ARVC.

	- Failure to identify a recognized mutation does not exclude the diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy or ion channelopathy for three important reasons: not all genetic regions are assessed, technology is not able to detect some forms of mutation (intronic cryptic splice sites, large genomic rearrangements, etc), and a similar phenotype may possibly develop without a specific genetic constitution. In future, technological developments in mutation analysis will increase the number of genes that can be assessed as fast sequencing technology is entering the clinical domain.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^113FirgF]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The presence of T-wave inversion (TWI) is not, per se, a diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy. Therefore, in the presence of TWI, the physician should prompt investigations aimed at excluding or confirming the presence of an underlying pathological condition, as depicted in the flowchart (Figure 4).

- **Implications for sport eligibility**: The eligibility of athletes with TWI must be established according to the presence of a concomitant cardiac condition and the sport participated in, as suggested by the ESC recommendations. It is noteworthy that, in most instances, a markedly abnormal ECG may not reveal any feature of cardiomyopathy. In such cases, the athlete should not be considered as affected by a cardiac disease and therefore, no restrictions should be applied to their lifestyle, including participation in sports.

- **Figure 4: Proposed algorithm for evaluation of athletes with T-wave inversion**. Further investigations include — but are not limited to — echocardiography, stress testing, 12-lead Holter ECG, and cardiac magnetic resonance. The indication for these diagnostic tests is based on clinical decisions and takes into account the personal and family history of the athlete as well as the results of previous examinations. Beyond sports eligibility or disqualification, a periodical follow-up is usually needed in most of these cases, with a timeline based on the clinical characteristics of the athlete. Sports eligibility and disqualification should be guided by the recent position statement of the Sport Cardiology Section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology.

### Electrocardiographic T-wave changes underlying acute cardiac and cerebral events [^117FtmW4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

T-wave inversions produced by myocardial infarction (MI) are classically narrow and symmetric. Electrocardiography T-wave changes, including low-amplitude and abnormally inverted T waves, may result from noncardiac pathophysiology. We present a series of cases with different electrocardiography T-wave changes. The first case involved a 64-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with diffuse splayed T-wave inversions and was found to have an MI in the context of an acute cerebrovascular accident. We contrasted this with the case of a 76-year-old man with hypercholesterolemia who presented with T-wave widening and a prolonged QT interval and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a basilar aneurysm and no MI. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the cardiac and cerebral injury, including microvascular spasm and increased levels of circulating catecholamines. Accurate interpretation of T-wave changes can assist the clinician in achieving a timely therapeutic intervention and accurate diagnosis.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^114eJm3V]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The presence of T-wave inversion (TWI) in leads I and AVL, V5 and/or V6 (only one lead of TWI required in V5 or V6) is defined as lateral TWI. In contrast, the presence of TWI in leads II and aVF, V5-V6, I and AVL is defined as infero-lateral TWI.

The prevalence of lateral TWI in athletes varies between 0.3% and 1.5% and appears to be 10 times higher in black athletes compared to white athletes. The presence of lateral and inferolateral TWI is often associated with cardiomyopathy in a significant number of athletes. Therefore, these patterns of TWI should always raise suspicion of an underlying heart disease and should prompt a comprehensive investigation to exclude a life-threatening cardiac condition.

Even if cardiac pathology is not diagnosed during the initial evaluation, a clinical follow-up, including cardiac imaging testing with serial evaluations during adolescence and young adulthood, is recommended to timely identify the development of a cardiomyopathy. From a database of 12,550 athletes referred for pre-participation screening, Pelliccia et al. identified 81 athletes with diffusely distributed and deeply inverted T waves (≥ 2 mm in at least three leads) who had no apparent cardiac disease at initial evaluation. They were followed up for a period of 9 years, and in some cases, up to 27 years. During this follow-up period, cardiomyopathy developed in five athletes (6%; 1 arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC), 3 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 1 dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)), and other cardiovascular disorders developed in six athletes (7%; including hypertension, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, myocarditis, and supraventricular arrhythmias).

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (Part II): Diagnostic workup, outcome, and management [^114ZC4s3]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is abnormal in most patients with Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), usually demonstrating ischemic ST-segment elevation, T-wave inversion, or both. In the InterTAK Registry, ST-segment elevation was present in 44%, ST-segment depression in 8%, T-wave inversion in 41%, and left bundle branch block in 5%. As in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the ECG in TTS demonstrates temporal evolution, typically with resolution of initial ST-segment elevation (if present), followed by progressive T-wave inversion and QT interval prolongation over several days, with subsequent gradual resolution of T-wave inversion and QT interval prolongation over days to weeks. The initial and subsequent ECG findings are influenced by several variables, including the geographic pattern of left ventricular (LV) ballooning, presence or absence of right ventricular (RV) ballooning, time from symptom onset to presentation, presence of myocardial edema, and recovery rate of myocardial cellular function.

- **ST-segment elevation**: As with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the location and extent of ST-segment elevation in TTS corresponds to the anatomic location of myocardial injury, most often the mid and apical LV segments. Consequently, ST-segment elevation usually involves precordial, lateral, and apical ECG leads, closely resembling that of anterior STEMI due to left anterior descending coronary occlusion. Lead -aVR (inverse of aVR), representing +30° in the frontal plane, is generally aligned with the LV apex, and can be assembled with other leads to create an 'ECG map'.

### Usefulness of ST depression with T-wave inversion in leads V(4) to V(6) for predicting one-year mortality in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (from the Electrocardiographic Analysis of the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries IIB Trial) [^112pfDYY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

ST-segment depression (ST-D) on the admission electrocardiogram of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACSs) is associated with higher mortality. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the location of ST-D and T-wave polarity on the long-term prognosis of patients with NSTEACS. Electrocardiographic (ECG) and clinical data from 6,770 patients with NSTEACS, randomly assigned in the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) IIB trial, were analyzed retrospectively. One-year mortality was correlated with the location of ST-D (leads I and aVL; II, III, and aVF; V1 to V3; or V4 to V6) and T-wave polarity.

ST-D in any of the ECG locations was associated with higher mortality compared with patients without ST-D. Patients with ST-D and T-wave inversion in leads V4 to V6 had the highest 1-year mortality rate of all groups (16.2%), significantly higher compared with patients with ST-D without T-wave inversion in those leads (9.0%, p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that age, hyperlipidemia, Killip class > I, history of myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, history of angina pectoris, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, sum of ST-D (odds ratio 1.061, 95% confidence interval 1.035 to 1.087, p < 0.001), and ST-D with T-wave inversion in leads V4 to V6 (odds ratio 1.374, 95% CI 1.023 to 1.844, p = 0.035) were independent predictors of 1-year mortality. Conversely, ST-D without T-wave inversion in leads V4 to V6 or other ECG presentations were not independent predictors of high 1-year mortality.

### Hyperacute T wave in the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^116nHua6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The diagnostic performance of T-wave amplitudes for the detection of myocardial infarction is largely unknown; this study aimed to address this knowledge gap. T-wave amplitudes were automatically measured in 12-lead ECGs of patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the emergency department within a prospective diagnostic multicenter study. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by two independent cardiologists. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, complete left bundle branch block, or paced ventricular depolarization were excluded. The performance for lead-specific 95th-percentile thresholds was reported as likelihood ratios (LR), specificity, and sensitivity.

Myocardial infarction was the final diagnosis in 445 (18%) of 2457 patients. In most leads, T-wave amplitudes tended to be greater in patients without myocardial infarction than in those with myocardial infarction. T-wave amplitude exceeding the 95th percentile had positive and negative LR close to 1, or with confidence intervals (CIs) crossing 1. The exceptions were leads III, aVR, and V1, which had positive LRs of 3.8 (95% CI, 2.7 to 5.3), 4.3 (95% CI, 3.1 to 6.0), and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.9), respectively. These leads normally have inverted T waves, so T-wave amplitude exceeding the 95th percentile reflects upright rather than increased-amplitude hyperacute T waves.

In conclusion, hyperacute T waves, when defined as increased T-wave amplitude exceeding the 95th percentile, did not provide useful information in diagnosing myocardial infarction in this sample.

### Comparative prognostic value of T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression on the admission electrocardiogram in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112F4ohN]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

ST-segment depression (STD) is predictive of adverse outcomes in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), but there are conflicting data on the incremental prognostic value of T-wave inversions (TWIs) on the admission electrocardiogram.

- **Methods**: Admission electrocardiograms of 7,343 patients with NSTE-ACS from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and ACS I registry were independently analyzed at a core laboratory and stratified by TWI and STD status. We performed multivariable analyses to determine the independent prognostic significance of TWI and tested for interaction between TWI and STD for adverse outcomes.

- **Results**: Patients with TWI and/or STD had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, higher Killip class, and higher GRACE risk scores. Among the 2,708 patients with available angiographic data, rates of 3-vessel or left main disease were similar between patients with TWI and those without TWI/STD. After adjusting for other established prognosticators, TWI did not independently predict in-hospital (adjusted odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.75–1.42, P = 0.85) or 6-month mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.80–1.30, P = 0.88); STD remained a strong independent predictor. There was no interaction between TWI and STD for these outcomes. No contiguous lead groups or cumulative number of leads with TWI provided independent prognostic information.

- **Conclusions**: TWI is associated with other high-risk clinical features but is not an independent predictor of adverse short- and long-term mortality in NSTE-ACS.

### Prognostic importance of isolated T-wave abnormalities [^112DCXBz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Computerized electrocardiograms recorded on 46,950 male veterans were analyzed to demonstrate the prognostic value of T-wave amplitude in a general medical population. There were 3,926 cardiovascular deaths over six years. Multivariate survival analysis allowed the development of a T-wave amplitude graphic that provides clinicians with a simple method of estimating the relative risk for cardiovascular mortality from T-wave amplitude in limb lead I.

### Cardiac memory: A case report and review of the literature [^115Nh8JX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

A variety of clinical syndromes can cause T-wave inversion (TWI), ranging from life-threatening events to benign conditions. One benign cause of TWI is cardiac memory, which is characterized by the transient inversion of T-waves following abnormal activation of the ventricles, commonly due to intermittent left bundle branch block (LBBB), tachydysrhythmias, electrical pacing, or ventricular pre-excitation.

- **Case report**: A 72-year-old man presented to the emergency department with chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Upon arrival, his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed new-onset LBBB with appropriate secondary ST-T wave changes. A subsequent ECG showed disappearance of LBBB and newly inverted T-waves in precordial leads V1-V5, followed by a repeat ECG that again showed LBBB. Serial troponin testing was unremarkable. During hospitalization, echocardiogram and nuclear perfusion stress test were normal. The transient TWIs in this patient were believed to be due to cardiac memory.

We performed a literature review and identified 39 published cases of cardiac memory. The most common etiology for cardiac memory was after cardiac pacemaker placement, followed by intermittent LBBB, as was seen in our patient, and post-tachydysrhythmia. Patient ages ranged from 21 to 88 years, with an equal number of cases reported in men and women.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Cardiac memory is a poorly understood, rarely observed phenomenon that can occur in the setting of intermittent LBBB. Testing for acute cardiac ischemia and underlying coronary artery disease is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^11793T1V]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

A recent longitudinal study on 2227 children, pre-pubertal and younger in comparison with the previously cited studies (mean age 12.3 ± 2.0 years) practicing sport, demonstrates a high prevalence of T-wave inversion (TWI), up to 16%. This longitudinal study confirmed that anterior TWI becomes positive in the vast majority of the children (94%) following a 4-year follow-up, with only 6% still exhibiting anterior TWI, in absence of family history, symptoms, or relevant clinical findings. In this population, anterior TWI becomes positive by the age of 14 years in most children. Conversely, TWI in the infero-lateral leads was rare (only 3% of children), persists after puberty, and was also associated with structural heart disease in one case.

In conclusion, an accurate differentiation between pathological and physiological ECG patterns is crucial in children with TWI, who frequently present dynamic changes in the anterior leads related to age and development. In this age group (such as in adults), TWI in the infero-lateral leads should undergo further investigations to identify potential cardiomyopathies. Conversely, in the absence of symptoms and/or family history for sudden cardiac death (SCD) or cardiomyopathies, anterior TWI up to V3 in children ≤ 14 should not undergo further investigations and a yearly follow-up is suggested until the positivization of anterior TWI. However, when anterior TWI persists after the age of 14 years, further investigations, including but not limited to echocardiography, should be performed to exclude the presence of structural heart disease.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^113pYyj5]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

T-wave inversion (TWI) is defined as a negative T-wave of ≥ 1 mm in depth in two or more contiguous leads, with the exclusion of leads aVR, III, and V1. The presence of TWI on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in competitive athletes poses significant diagnostic challenges for sports physicians and consulting cardiologists.

The interpretation of TWI in athletes is complex. The implications for clinical practice present a conundrum for physicians, as TWI may occasionally be observed in healthy athletes exhibiting signs of cardiac remodeling, such as left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, atrial dilation, and an increase in ventricular cavity size. These signs may overlap with those of life-threatening arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. In some instances, identifying TWI should be considered a red flag on the ECG of young and seemingly healthy athletes, warranting further investigations. This is crucial as it may represent the initial expression of cardiomyopathies that may not be evident until many years later and could ultimately be associated with adverse outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of the literature on TWI in athletes, especially focusing on the interpretation and management, including advice regarding eligibility and/or disqualification from competitions.

For the proper interpretation of TWI patterns in athletes, it is crucial to consider primarily the localization of TWI. This may help identify specific cardiac pathologies in conjunction with the individual's family and personal history and clinical context.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^117Eu9Rw]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The study concluded that a negative T-wave in the electrocardiogram (ECG) registered at 50 years of age in asymptomatic individuals from a randomized observational cohort carried an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death during lifetime follow-up. The enhanced risk persisted even after adjusting for other ECG abnormalities and CV risk factors. Furthermore, a major T-wave inversion was associated with a higher risk than a minor one, and a negative T-wave indicated increased risk also in the absence of other risk factors.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^115HZWWF]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The presence of T-wave inversion (TWI) in leads II and AVF is defined as inferior TWI. The clinical significance of isolated inferior TWI is still uncertain. Inferior TWI has been reported in a certain proportion of normal individuals, including healthy athletes, but it may also be present in subjects affected by cardiomyopathy. In patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC), the prevalence of inferior TWI can reach 31%, while in healthy athletes, the prevalence is lower, about 3%.

Inferior TWI may also be observed in valvular heart disease, particularly in mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Although MVP is relatively common in athletes and usually characterized by a benign course, it may rarely present with ominous ventricular arrhythmias eventually leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD), even in the absence of significant hemodynamic impairment. Specifically, Basso et al. examined 46 cases of SCD with MVP being the only pathological condition linked to SCD. Of these, 10 out of 12 patients (mostly adult females) with available electrocardiograms had inverted T waves in inferior leads. Furthermore, MVP patients at risk of SCD often had bi-leaflet involvement of the mitral valve, a mid-systolic click at auscultation, T-wave abnormalities on inferior leads, right bundle branch block (RBBB)-type or polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias, and evidence of myocardial scarring at cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) localized in the posterior papillary muscle and the infero-basal left ventricular (LV) free wall. This confirms the site of origin of RBBB-type ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, these findings suggest that athletes with clear evidence of MVP and T-wave abnormalities…

### Dynamic T-wave inversions in the setting of left bundle branch block [^112ZjKzy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This paper illustrates the case of a patient with left bundle branch block (LBBB) presenting with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with those described in Wellens' syndrome. The characteristic ECG findings of Wellens' syndrome are known to identify patients at a high risk of experiencing significant coronary events in the near future. However, these findings have traditionally been associated only with cases of normal conduction.

- **Characteristics of Wellens' syndrome**: A review of Wellens' syndrome, including its diagnostic criteria and pathophysiology, is provided.
- **Appearance in LBBB setting**: The proposed manifestation of Wellens' syndrome in the context of LBBB is explored.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: Practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^117NnGGH]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Preparticipation screening programs for underlying cardiac pathologies are now commonplace for many international sporting organizations. However, providing medical clearance for an asymptomatic athlete without a family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is especially challenging when the athlete demonstrates particularly abnormal repolarization patterns that are highly suggestive of an inherited cardiomyopathy or channelopathy. Deep T-wave inversions of ≥ 2 contiguous anterior or lateral leads (but not aVR and III) are of major concern for sports cardiologists who advise referring team physicians, as these ECG alterations are a recognized manifestation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Inverted T-waves may represent the first and only sign of an inherited heart muscle disease, in the absence of any other features and before structural changes in the heart can be detected. However, at the time of writing, there remains little evidence that deep T-wave inversions are always pathognomonic of either a cardiomyopathy or an ion channel disorder in an asymptomatic athlete following long-term follow-up.

This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the prevalence of T-wave inversion in athletes and examine T-wave inversion and its relationship to structural heart disease, notably HCM and ARVC, with a view to identifying young athletes at risk of SCD during sport. Finally, the review proposes clinical management pathways, including genetic testing, for asymptomatic athletes demonstrating significant T-wave inversion.

### Electrocardiographic repolarization-related variables as predictors of coronary heart disease death in the women's health initiative study [^111yJiwG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

A report from the Seven Countries Study in a male cohort with no manifest cardiac diseases at baseline evaluated the risk of CHD death for isolated inverted T waves with no other codable ECG abnormalities. The risk of CHD death for inverted T waves was over 3-fold in a 5-year follow-up, decreasing with the length of follow-up but still significant at a 40-year follow-up.

Laukkanen et al. evaluated the association of isolated T wave inversion and widened QRS|T angle with the risk of SCD in a male cohort from a general Finnish population with a 20-year follow-up. In a multivariable adjusted single ECG variable model, T wave inversion and widened QRS|T angle were both associated with an over 3-fold risk for SCD. QRS duration from 110 to 119 ms was also a significant predictor of SCD compared to men with QRS duration < 110 ms. Anttila et al, in another report from a nationally representative sample of the general Finnish population of adult men and women, documented that a positive T wave in aVR was a strong predictor of CVD death in fully adjusted risk models. TaVR was also reported in an earlier study to be a predictor of CVD death in a large clinical male population.

- **Clinical implications**: Ѳ(T p |T ref) was a strong predictor of CHD death in women with CVD as well as in CVD-free women. From a practical clinical point of view, a potentially more important observation was that ECG variables such as TV1 and TaVR amplitudes (from the alternative Set 2 in Table 4) were practically as strong predictors of CHD death as the computationally more complex angular measures of deviant repolarization.

### Anterior T-wave inversion in young white athletes and nonathletes: Prevalence and significance [^115JLsem]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Anterior T-wave inversion (ATWI) on electrocardiography (ECG) in young white adults raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy, specifically arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Whereas the 2010 European consensus recommendations for ECG interpretation in young athletes state that ATWI beyond lead V1 warrants further investigation, the prevalence and significance of ATWI have never been reported in a large population of asymptomatic whites.

- **Objectives**: This study investigated the prevalence and significance of ATWI in a large cohort of young, white adults, including athletes.

- **Methods**: Individuals aged 16 to 35 years (n = 14,646), including 4,720 females (32%) and 2,958 athletes (20%), were evaluated using a health questionnaire, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG. ATWI was defined as T-wave inversion in ≥ 2 contiguous anterior leads (V1 to V4).

- **Results**: ATWI was detected in 338 individuals (2.3%) and was more common in women than in men (4.3% vs. 1.4%, respectively; p < 0.0001) and more common among athletes than in nonathletes (3.5% vs. 2.0%, respectively; p < 0.0001). T-wave inversion was predominantly confined to leads V1 to V2 (77%). Only 1.2% of women and 0.2% of men exhibited ATWI beyond V2. No individuals with ATWI fulfilled diagnostic criteria for ARVC after further evaluation. During a mean follow-up of 23.1 ± 12.2 months, none of the individuals with ATWI experienced an adverse event.

- **Conclusions**: ATWI confined to leads V1 to V2 is a normal variant or physiological phenomenon in asymptomatic white individuals without a relevant underlying condition.

### T-wave inversions and the role of de-training in the differentiation of athlete's heart from pathology: Is 6 months too long [^111qgBmQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic changes are common in athletes. The differentiation of a physiological substrate from a pathological one is important, as ECG changes may indicate underlying cardiac disease, placing the athlete at increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Deep T-wave inversions are uncommon in Caucasian athletes; however, they appear more prevalent in Black athletes. Irrespective of the ethnic origin of the athlete, deep T-wave inversions require thorough follow-up. At present, six months of de-training is recommended to assist in the differentiation of physiological and pathological changes when a definitive diagnosis is elusive through standard diagnostic techniques. This case study examines findings from a Black and a Caucasian athlete presenting with deep T-wave inversions following a brief (approximately three-week) period of de-training, resulting in the normalization of the T-wave. These cases suggest that a shorter period of time may be sufficient in differentiating physiological from pathological mechanisms for deep T-wave inversions.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: Practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^113ievJR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Examples of T-wave inversion in athletes without proven cardiomyopathy:

- **Cardiac pathologies associated with T-wave inversion**: HCM is characterized by the presence of increased ventricular wall thickness or mass in the absence of loading conditions (such as hypertension or valve disease) sufficient to cause the observed abnormality. There are three important spectral ECG changes commonly observed within HCM. The ECG is abnormal in approximately 90% of patients with HCM. Voltage criteria for LVH are present in around 75% of patients with HCM; isolated Sokolow-Lyon voltage criterion for LVH, commonly observed within athletes without associated ST and T wave changes, occurs in only 2% of HCM patients. Repolarisation changes consisting of ST segment shift and T-wave inversion are present in over 90% of cases.

	- ARVC is a myocardial disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement and ventricular arrhythmias. The fibro-fatty replacement interferes with electrical impulse conduction and is the key cause of T-wave inversion in the right precordial leads, ɛ waves, RBBB, late potentials, and re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias.

	- Brugada syndrome is characterized by a QRS complex resembling incomplete RBBB with J point elevation and ST-segment elevation in V1 through V3, often followed by a negative T-wave and a propensity for SCD, typically occurring with mild activity or during sleep. It remains a diagnostic challenge to exclude Brugada syndrome in young athletes, as features such as mild elevation of the J point associated with mild ST segment elevation are present.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives [^111H2pjg]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The interpretation of T-wave inversion (TWI) on the 12-lead resting ECG in specific populations, such as children, can be challenging. This is due to the peculiar electrical remodeling observed during body growth. From birth to adolescence, dynamic repolarization changes are normally seen in the anterior leads. In children, anterior TWI reflects right ventricular dominance. The switch from right to left electrical predominance results in a gradual reversal of T-wave polarity. After puberty, the T wave presents the same characteristics as in adults, usually being inverted only in lead V1, and upright in leads V2-V6. However, anterior TWI may persist after puberty. Young athletes often exhibit TWI in the right precordial leads as a representation of a normal juvenile ECG pattern, which is similar to the repolarization abnormalities observed in cardiomyopathies.

### Echocardiographic findings in 2261 peri-pubertal athletes with or without inverted T waves at electrocardiogram [^1172dmTw]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the clinical significance of T wave inversion (TWI) in peri-pubertal athletes, as TWI has been associated with cardiomyopathies.

Consecutive male soccer players, aged 8 to 18 years, undergoing preparticipation screening between January 2008 and March 2009, were enrolled. Medical and family histories were collected, and physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, and transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) were performed. TWI was categorized by ECG lead: anterior (V1-V3), extended anterior (V1-V4), inferior (DII-aVF), and infero-lateral (DII-aVF/V4-V6/DI-aVL), and by age.

Overall, 2261 athletes (mean age 12.4 years, 100% Caucasian) were enrolled. TWI in ≥ 2 consecutive ECG leads was found in 136 athletes (6.0%), mostly in anterior leads (126/136, 92.6%). TWI in anterior leads was associated with TTE abnormalities in six athletes (4.8%). TWI in extended anterior (2/136, 1.5%) and inferior (3/136, 2.2%) leads was never associated with abnormal TTE. In contrast, TWI in infero-lateral leads (5/136, 3.7%) was associated with significant TTE abnormalities in three cases (60.0%), including one hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and two left ventricular (LV) hypertrophies. Athletes with normal T waves had TTE abnormalities in 4.4% of cases, including one HCM with deep Q waves in infero-lateral leads.

In conclusion, in this broad population of peri-pubertal male athletes, TWI in anterior leads was associated with mild cardiac disease in 4.8% of cases, while TWI in infero-lateral leads revealed HCM and LV hypertrophy in 60% of cases. The ECG identified all cases of HCM.
