## Question

A patient comes in with the pain on the lateral side of left hip and tenderness on the left thigh and he has pain when sleeping on that side no pain with hip movement what is the diagnosis and what's the treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most likely diagnosis and treatment for lateral left hip pain with left thigh tenderness, pain when sleeping on that side, and no pain with hip movement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the pain location and exam features localize the pathology. Then, I should construct a focused differential for lateral hip pain and test each option against the presented features. Next, I will refine the leading diagnosis (likely GTPS) using definitional criteria, epidemiology, and key exam maneuvers. After that, I should verify appropriate imaging pathways and pitfalls. Finally, I will consider evidence-based management, including when to use injections and when to escalate to imaging or surgical referral, while cross-checking each step with the references provided.

> Let me first confirm the pain pattern and key clinical clues. Lateral hip pain localized over the greater trochanter with focal tenderness and pain when lying on the affected side points to extra-articular structures in the peritrochanteric space — gluteal tendons, trochanteric bursa, and IT band insertions — rather than intra-articular sources, especially when passive hip range of motion is painless, which makes labral pathology and hip osteoarthritis less likely in this scenario [^113bw672] [^1116VEYT]. Hold on, I should verify that side-lying pain is truly characteristic; yes, it is repeatedly described as a hallmark of GTPS in older adults, strengthening the localization to peritrochanteric tissues rather than the joint itself [^1116VEYT].

> Next, I will generate and test a focused differential. The leading consideration is greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), which encompasses gluteus medius/minimus tendinopathy or tear, trochanteric bursitis, and iliotibial band friction over the greater trochanter — classically producing lateral hip tenderness and pain aggravated by side-lying with often normal passive ROM [^113bw672] [^1116VEYT]. I need to check other contenders: gluteus medius/minimus tears typically add weakness (especially resisted abduction), Trendelenburg gait, and persistent limp; absent those features, a full-thickness tear is less likely but not excluded if pain is severe or chronic, so I should keep it in reserve and re-evaluate if weakness emerges [^115Ga36R] [^114NyDuq]. Iliotibial band syndrome usually localizes pain more distally at the lateral knee with activity-related symptoms rather than pain from side-lying over the trochanter, which pushes IT band syndrome down the list here, though proximal contributions can coexist [^116F9mxq] [^117Pohtr]. Lumbar radiculopathy would more often produce back pain, dermatomal radiation, paresthesias, or a positive straight-leg raise; the lack of these signs argues against it in this presentation, but I should remain vigilant for mixed pathology if symptoms evolve [^117Pohtr]. Meralgia paresthetica tends to produce burning paresthesias over the anterolateral thigh without trochanteric point tenderness, which is not the case here [^116DmMVj]. Hip osteoarthritis and other intra-articular sources typically provoke pain with passive ROM and often groin localization; that pattern is not described here, further lowering their likelihood [^114zZkPK] [^113bw672].

> I will now examine the defining features and epidemiology of GTPS more closely to ensure the diagnosis fits. GTPS is defined by pain and tenderness over the greater trochanter, often radiating along the lateral thigh, and commonly worsened by lying on the affected side, with a high prevalence in women and frequent coexistence with low back pain or knee osteoarthritis; incidence is approximately 1.8 per 1000 per year, which aligns with a common extra-articular cause of lateral hip pain in adults [^1116VEYT] [^116pY7t9]. Wait, let me verify what drives symptoms in most patients — historically labeled "bursitis", imaging suggests trochanteric bursitis is present in only a minority, and gluteal tendinopathy is often the dominant process, which reframes expectations for injection-based relief versus rehabilitation as first-line treatment [^1116VEYT] [^117JMBH1].

> Next, I should review the physical examination maneuvers that increase confidence in this diagnosis. Let me consider tests with better diagnostic yield: single-leg stance provoking lateral hip pain within seconds, resisted external derotation, Trendelenburg sign, and the hip lag sign have been highlighted as useful adjuncts to clinical palpation over the trochanter; positive findings on these tests, especially in aggregate, reinforce gluteal tendinopathy/GTPS over isolated bursitis [^112kVU25] [^1168VpS9]. Hold on, I should also think about red flags for tear: objective abductor weakness or a compensated Trendelenburg gait would nudge me toward imaging to evaluate for partial- or full-thickness gluteus medius/minimus tears and to consider timely referral if significant deficits are found [^114NyDuq] [^115Ga36R].

> Now I need to check the role of imaging and avoid common pitfalls. For straightforward GTPS, diagnosis is clinical; plain radiographs can screen for osteoarthritis or other bony pathology if uncertainty persists or if age and risk factors warrant, while ultrasound can confirm bursal inflammation and assess gluteal tendons when the diagnosis is in doubt or for procedural guidance, and MRI is reserved for refractory cases or surgical planning given frequent incidental findings in asymptomatic individuals that can mislead interpretation [^117Pohtr] [^113bw672] [^116xS2EC]. But wait, what if symptoms fail to respond to well-executed conservative care? That is when I should reconsider the differential (radiculopathy, meralgia paresthetica, intra-articular pathology) and escalate to targeted imaging to clarify pathology before invasive steps [^117Pohtr] [^113bw672].

> Next, I should review first-line management and ensure it matches the pathophysiology. I need to ensure we prioritize hip abductor strengthening and load management because gluteus medius weakness and tendon overload are central drivers; NSAIDs can be used if not contraindicated, and most patients improve with conservative measures over the mid-term, whereas relying solely on passive modalities without strengthening risks recurrence once temporary relief fades [^116DmMVj] [^116zi645] [^116Udmoj]. Hmm, wait a minute — should I jump to corticosteroid injections? No; because true bursitis is a minority and steroids provide short-term relief at best, they should be used sparingly, ideally when imaging shows bursal inflammation and paired with a strengthening program to address the underlying biomechanical deficit [^116DmMVj] [^116t3iWG].

> I should double-check procedural evidence if an injection is considered. Randomized data comparing fluoroscopy-guided versus blind trochanteric injections show no clear superiority of image guidance and suggest similar short-term pain reductions regardless of intra-bursal versus extra-bursal spread, indicating that precise bursal targeting may not be critical to short-term outcomes; however, when the aim is to treat demonstrated bursitis, ultrasound guidance by an experienced provider is reasonable to maximize accuracy during the same visit and to help triage alternative pain generators when response is incomplete [^112befHJ] [^114d9eDh] [^1138dTJW] [^116t3iWG]. Let me reconsider adjuncts: dry needling appears noninferior to cortisone injection at six weeks without reported adverse effects in a randomized trial, offering an alternative for patients seeking to avoid steroids while they engage in rehabilitation [^113y5qwj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about refractory pain — when should I image for tears and consider referral? Persistent lateral hip pain with abductor weakness, a Trendelenburg gait, or failure of structured rehabilitation should prompt MRI to evaluate for partial- or full-thickness gluteus medius/minimus tears and other peritrochanteric pathology, with surgical repair considered for significant or recalcitrant tears to restore function; case series and expert reviews emphasize timely recognition to avoid prolonged disability and gait compensation [^114NyDuq] [^115Ga36R] [^11554DR2]. I should also confirm that a lack of response to a well-placed peritrochanteric corticosteroid injection is a signal to reconsider alternate diagnoses (e.g., lumbar radiculopathy, intra-articular hip disease), rather than repeating injections indefinitely [^117Pohtr] [^113bw672].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overall clinical synthesis holds. The pattern of lateral hip pain with trochanteric point tenderness, pain on side-lying, and absence of pain with passive hip motion is most consistent with GTPS, driven predominantly by gluteal tendinopathy rather than isolated bursitis; the differential considerations are less likely given the absence of abductor weakness, distal IT band symptoms, radicular features, or groin-localized intra-articular pain. Management should center on progressive abductor strengthening and load modification, reserving image-guided injection for cases with imaging evidence of bursitis to facilitate rehabilitation, and re-evaluating for gluteal tendon tears or alternative diagnoses if weakness appears or symptoms persist despite appropriate therapy [^1116VEYT] [^113bw672] [^116DmMVj] [^117Pohtr].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**, given lateral hip pain, tenderness over the greater trochanter, pain when lying on the affected side, and no pain with hip movement [^113bw672] [^1176CjXJ]. First-line treatment is **conservative management**, including activity modification, NSAIDs, and a structured physical therapy program focused on hip abductor strengthening and IT band stretching [^116zi645] [^116DmMVj]. If symptoms persist, consider ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection; surgery is **reserved for refractory cases** [^112befHJ] [^114NyDuq].

---

## Clinical diagnosis

GTPS is a **clinical diagnosis** characterized by:

- **Pain location**: Lateral hip pain localized over the greater trochanter [^113bw672].

- **Tenderness**: Point tenderness over the greater trochanter [^1176CjXJ].

- **Night pain**: Pain exacerbated by lying on the affected side [^116pY7t9].

- **ROM**: No pain with passive or active hip range of motion [^113bw672].

- **Trendelenburg**: Positive Trendelenburg sign due to hip abductor weakness [^112kVU25].

This presentation aligns with these features, supporting a **diagnosis of GTPS** [^1116VEYT].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other conditions causing **lateral hip pain** include:

- **Gluteal tendinopathy**: Often coexists with GTPS [^117JMBH1].

- **IT band syndrome**: Typically presents with lateral knee pain [^116F9mxq].

- **Hip osteoarthritis**: Usually causes anterior groin pain and pain with hip movement [^113bw672].

- **Lumbar radiculopathy**: Often associated with back pain and neurological symptoms [^117Pohtr].

The absence of hip joint pain and neurological symptoms, along with localized tenderness, make GTPS the **most likely diagnosis** [^114zZkPK].

---

## Recommended treatment

### Conservative management (first-line)

- **Activity modification**: Avoid prolonged standing, stair climbing, and lying on the affected side [^116zi645].

- **NSAIDs**: Reduce pain and inflammation [^1176CjXJ].

- **Physical therapy**: Focus on hip abductor strengthening and IT band stretching [^116DmMVj].

- **Weight loss**: If overweight, to reduce mechanical stress [^116pY7t9].

---

### Interventional management (if conservative measures fail)

If conservative measures fail, **interventional options** include **corticosteroid injection** — an ultrasound-guided injection into the trochanteric bursa for short-term pain relief [^114d9eDh] — and **dry needling**, an alternative to corticosteroid injection that is non-inferior for pain reduction [^113y5qwj].

---

### Surgical management (rarely indicated)

Surgery is rarely indicated and is **reserved for refractory cases**; options include arthroscopic bursectomy or gluteal tendon repair [^114NyDuq].

---

## Prognosis

Most patients experience **significant improvement** with conservative management [^116zi645]. Persistent symptoms may require corticosteroid injections or, rarely, surgical intervention [^112befHJ] [^114NyDuq].

---

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **GTPS**, and the recommended treatment is **conservative management** with activity modification, NSAIDs, and physical therapy. If conservative measures fail, corticosteroid injection or dry needling may be considered, with surgery **reserved for refractory cases** [^113bw672].

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113bw672]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults.

Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy.

In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

Optimal management of patients presenting with lateral hip and/or thigh pain requires a systematic approach for accurate diagnosis of underlying pathology contributing to symptoms. This section describes evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the most common causes of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults.

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**: GTPS is defined as pain and tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter (GT). Until the early 2000s, this entity was most frequently called "greater trochanteric bursitis"; however, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that approximately 20% of people with tenderness over the GT have imaging-proven bursitis. Non-inflammatory pathology is often seen on imaging, such as gluteal tendonosis, gluteal tendon tears, and/or enthesopathy at the GT. GTPS is often caused by relative weakness of the hip abductor muscles, especially the gluteus medius, which leads to excessive gluteal tendon shearing over the GT and eventual tendonopathy.

GTPS often coexists with other musculoskeletal lumbopelvic and hip conditions. Additionally, it is often a secondary pain generator resulting from suboptimal biomechanics. In fact, in people with low back pain, GTPS has a prevalence of up to 45% and it commonly occurs in people with knee osteoarthritis as well. GTPS is more common in women, possibly because they have a wider pelvis structure. It may be associated with nighttime pain when lying on the affected side, pain with prolonged standing, and pain or paresthesias.

### Beyond the greater trochanter: a pictorial review of the pelvic bursae [^112VJfaV]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Reviewing the MRI appearance of different bursae located throughout the pelvis, including the pertinent osseous and musculotendinous anatomy, is the primary objective. Bursae are potential spaces that reduce friction between opposed moving components, which can become inflamed, clinically mimicking internal derangement.

- **Materials and methods**: This series illustrates the most common, as well as lesser-known, pelvic bursae. Common causes of bursitis, including overuse, trauma, and infection, are presented.

- **Conclusion**: Multiple bursae are located throughout the pelvis. It is important for radiologists to recognize bursitis as a potential etiology of pain and be familiar with their anatomical locations in order to guide appropriate management.

- **Trochanteric bursitis**: Trochanteric bursitis (TB) or inflammation of one or more of the peri-trochanteric bursae has historically been considered a primary source of lateral hip pain, with an approximate prevalence of 4.4% to 29% in patients post-THA. A proposed cause is repetitive friction between the greater trochanter (GT) and the iliotibial band, commonly associated with overuse, trauma, and altered gait patterns. Teng et al. investigated the effect of performing a bursectomy during primary THA. In this study, 550 patients underwent routine bursectomy, while 400 did not. At an 11-year follow-up, the incidence of TB was unaffected by whether a bursectomy was performed. Furthermore, White et al. recently conducted a risk factor analysis for the development of TB, evaluating 1,094 patients, of whom 103 (9.4%) developed TB. The incidence varied slightly by surgical approach: 8.7% for the posterior approach, 10.8% for the direct anterior approach, and 4.2% for the direct lateral approach. However, the surgical approach was not identified as a notable risk factor. Among the variables analyzed, only sex was markedly associated with increased risk; women had a 1.79 times higher risk of developing TB. Notably, changes in acetabular offset, femoral offset, total offset, and leg length between preoperative and postoperative radiographs were not associated with an increased risk of TB in either univariate or multivariate models.

- **Clinical presentation**: Patients usually complain of lateral thigh pain, often aggravated by prolonged sitting or stair climbing, with a tender area on the GT.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^114d9eDh]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

When stratified by the number of injections — one injection (all blind injections plus intra-bursal on first attempt in fluoroscopy group) versus more than one injection (two or more attempts for intra-bursal spread in fluoroscopy group) — the outcomes for single and multiple injection groups were essentially comparable. Although the decrease in mean Oswestry disability index score was significantly greater in the single injection group (P = 0.003), we found a greater improvement in the multiple injection group for the SF-36 general health subscale (P = 0.02).

When examined by location of injection, no significant differences existed between the intra-bursal and extra-bursal groups. However, we noted trends for greater improvement in pain at rest at three months and the SF-36 general health category for intra-bursal injections, and for drug reduction and the SF-36 vitality index for extra-bursal spread of contrast.

At the time of discharge, blinding was assessed by an independent evaluator.

### 'Bald trochanter' spontaneous rupture of the conjoined tendons of the gluteus medius and minimus presenting as a trochanteric bursitis [^115Ga36R]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old white woman presented with progressive complaints of right lateral hip and thigh pain, associated with a disabling limp, without an antecedent history of trauma. Physical examination revealed localized pain over the right greater trochanter upon palpation. A full, pain-free range of motion of the right hip was associated with weakness in the hip abductors. The patient ambulated with a compensated right Trendelenburg gait.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a trochanteric bursitis and an effusion of the hip, and a full-thickness tear of the gluteus medius muscle, with both a disruption and retraction of the tendon of an atretic gluteus minimus muscle. Conjoined tendon pathology of both the gluteus medius and minimus, as revealed by magnetic resonance examination, is probably more frequent than previously recognized. In patients presenting with "intractable" complaints of a trochanteric bursitis and an ambulatory limp due to weakness in the hip abductors, imaging studies highlighting a possible tendon rupture may be diagnostic.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^117Pohtr]. Muscle & nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis is clinical and imaging is rarely required, plain radiographs may be useful to evaluate for other conditions such as hip osteoarthritis (OA). Ultrasound (US) can be used to identify inflammation of the bursae around the greater trochanter if the diagnosis is in doubt. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to confirm the diagnosis if in doubt or to aid with surgical planning in cases refractory to non-surgical management. While physiotherapy is a mainstay of treatment and should focus on individualized rehabilitation of the contributing factors, such as hip abductor weakness, a peri-trochanteric corticosteroid injection can be highly efficacious for treating pain from greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), suggesting that a lack of response should lead the clinician to strongly consider alternative diagnoses.

- **Iliotibial band syndrome**: Iliotibial (IT) band syndrome is characterized by lateral knee pain in individuals who engage in physically strenuous activity, such as running or cycling. A leading pathoanatomic explanation is that the IT band rubs over the lateral femoral condyle during repetitive knee flexion and extension. The IT band is a complex fibrous structure that arises out of the fascia of the tensor fascia lata muscle at the lateral hip, extends down the lateral thigh, and inserts at Gerdy's tubercle on the lateral tibia. Together with the tensor fascia lata muscle, the IT band's primary function is to stabilize the hip and knee in the stance phase and assist in hip extension, abduction, and external rotation. At the knee, the IT band also provides lateral stability and resists torsional movements.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A review of anatomy, diagnosis and treatment [^116pY7t9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a term used to describe chronic pain overlying the lateral aspect of the hip. This regional pain syndrome, once described as trochanteric bursitis, often mimics pain generated from other sources, including, but not limited to, myofascial pain, degenerative joint disease, and spinal pathology. The incidence of greater trochanteric pain is reported to be approximately 1.8 patients per 1000 per year, with the prevalence being higher in women and patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. Symptoms of GTPS consist of persistent pain in the lateral hip radiating along the lateral aspect of the thigh to the knee and occasionally below the knee and/or buttock. Physical examination reveals point tenderness in the posterolateral area of the greater trochanter.

Most cases of GTPS are self-limited, with conservative measures such as physical therapy, weight loss, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and behavior modification providing resolution of symptoms. Other treatment modalities include bursa or lateral hip injections performed with corticosteroid and local anesthetic. More invasive surgical interventions have anecdotally been reported to provide pain relief when conservative treatment modalities fail.

### Successful treatment of gluteal pain from obturator internus tendinitis and bursitis with ultrasound-guided injection [^1138m6qy]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

This case report describes what the authors believe to be the first instance of a patient with obturator internus tendinitis and bursitis successfully treated with a corticosteroid injection using a trans-tendinous lateral to medial approach. The patient presented with right gluteal pain not relieved by physical therapy or right hip and ischial bursa corticosteroid injections. Pelvic and lumbar spine MRIs and EMG/NCS findings were unremarkable. Physical examination demonstrated tenderness to palpation at the right middle lower gluteal region. Ultrasound imaging with sonopalpation identified the maximal local tender point as the right obturator internus muscle and/or its underlying bursa.

A 22-gauge 3.5-inch needle was inserted in-plane to the transducer and longitudinal to the obturator internus from a lateral to medial direction, an approach previously described in cadavers. The obturator internus tendon sheath and bursa were injected with 2.5 mL of 0.5% lidocaine combined with 10 mg of triamcinolone. The patient reported immediate complete relief of pain with continued relief at 2 and 6 months post-injection. This case report demonstrates an injection of the obturator internus tendon sheath and bursa using a trans-tendinous approach, which may be successful for the treatment of patients presenting with persistent gluteal pain from obturator internus tendinitis and bursitis.

### Injections of the hip and knee [^116TEWK7]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for hip osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to intra-articular corticosteroids, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend considering intra-articular injections as an adjunct for short and intermediate pain relief and improved function in patients with hip OA.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^112kVU25]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques and soft tissue endoscopy now allow for precise diagnosis and management of extra-articular hip pathology. The aim of this scoping review is to present an evidence-based update of the relevant literature, focusing on the pathoanatomy, clinical assessment, and diagnosis of pathology in the peritrochanteric space.

A literature search was performed on PubMed to include articles that reported on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome. A total of 542 studies were identified, of which 49 articles were included for full-text analysis for the scoping review.

- **Classification and anatomy**: Peritrochanteric space pathology can be broadly classified into (1) greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), (2) abductor tears, and (3) external snapping hip syndrome. Anatomically, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia lata work in conjunction to abduct and internally rotate the hip. The anterolateral part of the gluteus medius tendon is more prone to tears due to a thin tendinous portion. Increased acetabular anteversion has also been shown to be associated with gluteal and trochanteric bursitis.

- **Clinical examination**: In terms of clinical examination, tests found to be most useful for assisting in the diagnoses of lateral hip pain were the single-leg stance, resisted external derotation of the hip, hip lag sign, and the Trendelenburg's test.

- **Imaging and diagnosis**: Dynamic ultrasound along with guided injections and MRI scans assist in differentiating the pathologies effectively.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^112xiEwE]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

**Conclusion**: THA surgeons in Canada often use physical examination alone to diagnose GTPS after THA. Surgeons treat with oral anti-inflammatories, physiotherapy, or corticosteroid injections, with up to one-third of patients failing initial therapy. Although few surgeons use PRP, there is substantial interest in its potential efficacy for treating GTPS. Additional research is needed to evaluate the use of PRP, along with standardized physiotherapy and steroid injection protocols in the management of GTPS, a common and often debilitating condition.

### Multidetector CT features of mesenteric vein thrombosis [^112PTcVe]. Radiographics (2012). High credibility.

Mesenteric vein thrombosis is a disease that can be associated with various clinical features and conditions. These include bowel wall thickening, portal hypertension, splenectomy, rebound tenderness, and distended bowel loops. Additionally, nephrotic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease, and malignancy are also associated.

Symptoms often include abdominal pain and nausea, and there may be a decrease in bowel sounds. Hormonal contraceptives, peritoneal findings, and portal vein thrombosis can also play a role. Other associated conditions include thrombophilia, antithrombin III deficiency, FVL mutation, and protein C deficiency.

The presence of acute pancreatitis, abdominal tenderness, and prothrombin G20210A mutation are further indicators. Antiphospholipid syndrome, acute mesenteric ischemia, and undergoing bariatric surgery can also be contributing factors. Protein S deficiency and vomiting, alongside a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and abdominal distension, are additional symptoms linked to mesenteric vein thrombosis.

### Greater trochanter pain syndrome: a descriptive MR imaging study [^112s7WJR]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Greater trochanter pain syndrome (GTPS) is a diverse clinical entity caused by a variety of underlying conditions. We sought to explore the impact of (1) hip morphology, namely the center-edge angle (CEa) and femoral neck-shaft (NSa) angle; (2) hip abductor tendon degeneration; (3) the dimensions of peritrochanteric edema; and (4) bursitis, on the presence of GTPS, using MR imaging.

- **Materials and methods**: The presence of pain was prospectively assessed blindly by the senior author. CEa and NSa were blindly measured in 174 hip MR examinations, after completion of the clinical evaluation by another evaluator. The existence and dimensions of T2 hyperintensity of the peritrochanteric soft tissues, the existence and dimensions of bursae, as well as degeneration and tearing of gluteus tendons, were also recorded.

- **Results**: Out of 174 examinations, 91 displayed peritrochanteric edema (Group A) and 34 bursitis, all with peritrochanteric edema (Group B). A number of 78 patients from both A and B groups showed gluteus medius tendon degeneration and one tendon tear. CEa of Groups A and B were 6° higher than those of normals (Group C, P = 0.0038). The mean age of normals was 16.6 years less than in Group A and 19.8 years less than in Group B (P < 0.0001). Bursitis was associated with pain with a negative predictive value of 97% (P = 0.0003).

- **Conclusion**: Acetabular morphology is associated with GTPS, and the absence of bursitis was proven to be clinically relevant. Peritrochanteric edema alone was not associated with local pain.

### Hip pain: Dry needling versus cortisone injections [^115DGMjL]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is characterized by chronic, intermittent pain and tenderness on the outside of the hip. The medical community once thought that a swollen hip bursa was the source of such pain, which led to the use of corticosteroid injections to the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, researchers now believe that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain, and that inflammation is often not involved. A study published in the April 2017 issue of JOSPT explores dry needling as an alternative to cortisone injections to reduce pain and improve function in patients with GTPS.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: A Delphi-based consensus paper from the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) - part IV, hip [^116jpGFz]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Ultrasound- and fluoroscopy-guided iliopsoas peri-tendinous/bursal injections with local anesthetic and corticosteroids are both safe and feasible, providing good pain relief in symptomatic patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy. This procedure may also be used to exclude the iliopsoas tendon as a cause of hip or groin pain in both arthroplasty and non-arthroplasty patients. The level of evidence recorded was 3, with 53 in agreement, 0 disagreeing, and 0 abstaining, resulting in 100% agreement.

Iliopsoas bursa injections under ultrasound and fluoroscopy guidance for treating iliopsoas tendinopathy or bursitis are both feasible and accurate. However, there are no studies comparing different injection techniques or the outcomes of palpation-guided versus image-guided injections. In ultrasound-guided injections, dynamic injection with local anesthetic may be used to ensure needle placement in the bursa. Complications are rare, minor, and transient.

Iliopsoas bursa injection may be useful in determining the origin of pain, particularly in patients with hip arthroplasty. Adler et al. observed that ultrasound-guided iliopsoas injections with local anesthetic and steroids after hip replacement provided relief to most patients (90%) with iliopsoas tendinosis/bursitis. Authors reported a lower success rate in non-arthroplasty patients, which may be related to the several conditions involved in hip pain. However, 64% of these patients responded positively, thereby confirming the diagnosis of iliopsoas tendinosis and highlighting those patients who may benefit from a surgical tendon release.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^1138bH3L]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or trochanteric bursitis, is classically described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. Although diagnosis can be made with a clinical examination alone, an ultrasound or MRI is sometimes used to increase sensitivity. GTPS can include a multitude of pathologies, including gluteus medius/minimus tears, inflammation of the trochanteric bursa, and snapping hip syndrome (coxa saltans).

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common and successful operations in Canada, with over 95% of patients reporting good or excellent outcomes. However, up to 17% of patients can suffer from GTPS postoperatively. GTPS can be associated with altered hip biomechanics from implant malposition or from direct injury to the abductor musculature intraoperatively. Other causes of GTPS include inflammation of the bursa overlying the greater trochanter secondary to the surgical incision; however, histopathologic studies often find little evidence of inflammation. It has been argued that a surgical approach for THA can affect the prevalence of GTPS. Advocates for using a direct anterior approach (DAA) adduce a decrease in postoperative limp and GTPS because neither the iliotibial band nor the abductor musculature is violated. Patients who suffer from GTPS postoperatively are known to have impaired functional status, with reduced walking speed and slower timed up and go tests. Recalcitrant cases of GTPS may necessitate surgical débridement, increasing the risk of complications.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the hip and knee [^117UDdW2]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the hip and knee regions is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedure for the greater trochanteric bursa, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, the iliotibial band, and the prepatellar bursa is reviewed. Indications for greater trochanteric bursa injection include acute and chronic inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, repetitive use, and other traumatic injuries to the area. For the knee joint, aspiration may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of an unexplained effusion and relieve discomfort caused by an effusion. Injection of the knee can be performed for viscosupplementation or corticosteroid therapy. Indications for corticosteroid injection include advanced osteoarthritis and other inflammatory arthritides, such as gout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. Swelling and tenderness of pes anserine or prepatellar bursae can be relieved with aspiration and corticosteroid injection. Persistent pain and disability from iliotibial band syndrome respond to local injection therapy. The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112befHJ]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

In order to determine whether fluoroscopy should be routinely used during trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections, we conducted a multicentre, randomised controlled study comparing fluoroscopically guided and blind procedures. This question is relevant for two reasons.

Firstly, greater trochanteric pain syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, but recent studies have shown that only a small percentage of patients who meet inclusion criteria for greater trochanteric pain syndrome have radiological evidence of bursal inflammation. Extra-bursal hip injections might therefore be as effective as, or even superior to, intra-bursal trochanteric injections.

Secondly, administering any injection under radiographic guidance usually requires pain management services. This adds to the cost of treatment, and the delays inherent in obtaining subspecialty care can impair treatment outcomes.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^114sFpCe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Advances in imaging and interest in sports medicine have improved our understanding of the pathology, presentation, and management of lateral hip pain. A thorough understanding of the abductor musculature's anatomy, along with specific clinical signs and imaging findings, ensures accurate diagnosis and effective management. Additionally, assessing baseline psychological impairment is essential to optimize outcomes for these patients.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: Current concept [^116xS2EC]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

There are no laboratory or radiographic methods for diagnosing the retro-trochanteric pain syndrome. However, standard antero-posterior radiographs of the pelvis and hips, a lateral view of the hips, and either CT or MRI of the lumbar spine are recommended to rule out the possibility that the symptoms experienced by the patients originate from the spine or the hip joint.

When clinical and radiographic examinations raise a suspicion that FAI is present in the hip, an MRI arthrogram is helpful in revealing further intra-articular pathology such as cartilage damage or labral tears. MRI of the pelvis and retro-trochanteric area may also be helpful in recognizing pathological conditions in the short rotators of the hip, but there are no reports in the literature in terms of the sensitivity and specificity of an MRI in evaluations of this condition.

The role of MRI is, however, considered controversial. Blankenbaker et al. studied 256 hips of patients with "trochanteric pain syndrome" using MRI and found that 88% of asymptomatic hips had abnormal findings, with hyperintensity signs in the trochanteric area. They concluded that MRI has high sensitivity to pathology in conjunction with "trochanteric pain syndrome". Bird et al. studied 24 patients with GTPS and a positive Trendelenburg sign and found approximately 46% gluteus medius tears and 63% gluteus medius tendinosis.

Hwang et al. described a "boomerang"-shaped fluid collection between the obturator internus tendon and the posterior grooved surface of the os ischium seen on MRI.

### Trochanteric bursitis after total hip arthroplasty: Incidence and evaluation of response to treatment [^1141UhAe]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2010). Low credibility.

We examined the efficacy of corticosteroid injection as a treatment for postarthroplasty trochanteric bursitis and the risk factors for failure of nonoperative treatment. There were 32 (4.6%) cases of postsurgical trochanteric bursitis in 689 primary total hip arthroplasties. Of the 25 hips with follow-up, 11 (45%) required multiple injections. Symptoms resolved in 20 (80%) but persisted in 5. We found no statistically significant differences between patients who did and did not develop trochanteric bursitis, or between those who did and did not respond to treatment. There was a trend toward younger age and greater limb-length discrepancy in nonresponders.

In conclusion, (1) corticosteroid injections for postoperative trochanteric bursitis are effective; and (2) nonoperative management may be more likely to fail in young patients and those with leg-length discrepancy.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^114tehWW]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

- **Resolution of case**: The patient experienced significant pain relief from the corticosteroid injection for a few weeks. However, five weeks after the injection, her lateral hip pain returned, now with pain radiating into her left lateral thigh, knee, and lateral lower leg. On repeat examination, tenderness was noted over her left ITB, along with mild pain during passive hip range of motion and lumbar extension, and a positive seated slump test on the left. At this time, she was diagnosed with GTPS and ITBS, with superimposed lumbar radicular pain. Ultrasound confirmed the recurrence of bursitis in the GT. Despite being resistant to physical therapy, her pain did not improve one month later, prompting her to request a repeat ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injection.

- **Commentary on clinical course**: This case highlights that corticosteroid injections for GTPS, even when inflammatory bursitis is present, typically provide only temporary relief. More definitive management through hip abductor strengthening must be strongly encouraged. In cases of true bursitis and severe pain, a corticosteroid injection can facilitate active engagement in a rehabilitation program. However, in older adults at risk for co-morbidities such as osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes, and delirium, minimizing corticosteroid usage is advantageous. This case also demonstrates that the evaluation of lateral hip and thigh pain is often complex. In this particular patient, she likely developed secondary lumbar pain, potentially due to compensatory mechanical changes.

### Does surgical approach in total hip arthroplasty affect postoperative corticosteroid injection requirements [^111kfwtz]? The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid injections following total hip arthroplasty (THA) are commonly used to address soft tissue pathology such as bursitis and tendinitis. The surgical approaches for THA differ in the extent of muscle and soft tissue dissection. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of surgical approach on postoperative corticosteroid injection requirements while controlling for multiple covariates. A secondary aim was to identify risk factors associated with the various injection types.

- **Methods**: This was a propensity-matched retrospective study of 10,907 THA patients from June 2016 to December 2022 at a single urban academic health center. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on the following surgical approaches: anterior (n = 4,287) and posterior (n = 6,620). They were then propensity-matched 1:1 with nearest neighbor matching to form two cohorts of 4,287 patients each. Baseline characteristics and corticosteroid injection data for soft-tissue pathology were obtained and analyzed. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the impact of patient and surgical factors on receiving postoperative steroid injections.

- **Results**: A posterior approach conferred an increased risk of postoperative injections (adjusted odds ratio 1.242, P = 0.001) after controlling for multiple covariates. The posterior approach also had higher total rates of greater trochanter bursitis injections postoperatively compared to the anterior group (11.5% versus 7.3%, P < 0.001). Both surgical approaches demonstrated comparable rates of iliopsoas bursitis injections (P = 0).

### Iliotibial band syndrome: a common source of knee pain [^116F9mxq]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band syndrome is a common knee injury. The most common symptom is lateral knee pain caused by inflammation of the distal portion of the iliotibial band. The iliotibial band is a thick band of fascia that crosses the hip joint and extends distally to insert on the patella, tibia, and biceps femoris tendon. In some athletes, repetitive flexion and extension of the knee causes the distal iliotibial band to become irritated and inflamed, resulting in diffuse lateral knee pain. Iliotibial band syndrome can cause significant morbidity and lead to cessation of exercise.

Although iliotibial band syndrome is easily diagnosed clinically, it can be extremely challenging to treat. Treatment requires active patient participation and compliance with activity modification. Most patients respond to conservative treatment involving stretching of the iliotibial band, strengthening of the gluteus medius, and altering training regimens. Corticosteroid injections should be considered if visible swelling or pain with ambulation persists for more than three days after initiating treatment. A small percentage of patients are refractory to conservative treatment and may require surgical release of the iliotibial band.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^115wpFdJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or trochanteric bursitis, is described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. At the time of writing, there remains no consensus on clinical guidelines for either diagnosis or management of GTPS.

- **Methods**: To understand the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes relating to the management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty, a survey was developed and completed by Canadian arthroplasty surgeons. The final survey consisted of 23 questions divided into three sections: 1) screening questions; 2) demographic information; and 3) practice patterns, attitudes, and beliefs.

- **Results**: Most surgeons use physical examination alone for diagnosis. A detailed analysis indicates that surgeons primarily treat GTPS with oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%). Management options are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of either unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or platelet-rich plasma.

- **Discussion**: There remains an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty. Physical examination is most often relied on, regardless of the availability of imaging aids. While common treatments of GTPS were identified, up to one-third of patients fail initial therapy.

### Editorial commentary: Treatment of concomitant intra-articular pathology in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome is indicated by provocative impingement or instability physical examination and ultrasound-guided analgesic injection testing [^116gfRWM]. Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

Endoscopic surgery can be used to address peritrochanteric pathology in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. During the management of these patients, surgeons must decide whether adjunctive hip arthroscopy to treat concomitant intra-articular pathology such as labral tears or chondral lesions is required, because the prevalence of intra-articular findings may be greater than the clinical significance. A thorough history and physical examination can help distinguish whether the symptoms are arising from a peritrochanteric issue (e.g. gluteal tendinopathy, trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans) versus an intra-articular pain generator. Increased symptoms with provocative impingement or instability testing indicate adjunctive hip arthroscopy to address intra-articular abnormalities. In addition, an ultrasound-guided analgesic injection into the hip joint or peritrochanteric region may aid in diagnosis. A patient with partial symptomatic relief from separate injections into both areas is a classic presentation and consistent with a mixed-picture of peritrochanteric and intra-articular pathology, which may be addressed with a combined endoscopic and arthroscopic approach.

### Editorial commentary: It is imperative to fix symptomatic hip gluteus medius tears at time of femoroacetabular impingement: Why ignore this pain in the butt [^111vuBGV]. Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

The hip can present with a multitude of different pathologies leading to various symptoms. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, historically attributed to bursitis, has largely been found to be associated with lesions of the gluteus medius and minimus tendons. The prevalence of gluteus medius pathology in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is as high as one-third of the FAI population. If a patient is found to have significant clinical symptoms of both FAI and a gluteus medius tear, it is imperative to address both pathologies.

The most critical diagnostic predictor in hip arthroscopy is not magnetic resonance imaging but a well-executed history and physical exam. We employ a quadrant approach:

- **Medial quadrant**: Adductor bursitis, adductor tears, pudendal neuralgia, or sports hernias.
- **Posterior quadrant**: Potentially indicative of a hamstring tear, lumbar radiculopathy, ischiofemoral impingement, or, in rare cases, piriformis syndrome.
- **Anterior quadrant**: Accounts for more intra-articular pathologies including FAI, labral tears, osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or iliopsoas bursitis.
- **Lateral quadrant**: Includes greater trochanteric pain syndrome, gluteus medius and minimus tears, external snapping hip syndrome, and iliotibial band syndrome.

Using this systematic approach and magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, we can accurately determine patients' hip pathologies.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^115rVAJa]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Many physicians assume that an older adult with low back pain (LBP) and concomitant lateral hip/thigh pain has lumbar spinal stenosis. However, in reality, there are myriad causes of lateral hip/thigh pain in older adults, and the diagnosis of this pain can be challenging due to pain referral patterns. The hip and nearby lumbopelvic structures share innervation from common nerve roots, so pain referral patterns from the pathology of these structures overlap.

Faulty mechanics of the lumbar spine and/or hip can lead to compensatory movement patterns, eventually resulting in multiple pain generators. These challenges are illustrated in a study by Sembrano and colleagues; in a sample of 200 patients presenting for evaluation by a spine surgeon, only 65% had isolated spine pain, whereas 17.5% had a combination of hip, spine, and/or sacroiliac (SI) joint pain.

Diagnosing the etiology of hip and lumbopelvic pain in older adults is challenging. Many people have structural abnormalities on imaging studies that are asymptomatic. For instance, 93% of asymptomatic people aged 60–80 years have MRI evidence of disc degeneration, 36% have a herniated disc, and 21% have spinal stenosis. Additionally, only 46.5% of women aged 65 years and older who have radiographic evidence of hip osteoarthritis (OA) report hip pain "on most days for at least 1 month".

### Non-surgical treatment as the first step to manage peritrochanteric space disorders [^116zi645]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Greater trochanter pain syndrome (GTPS) or lateral hip pain terms include external snapping hip, trochanteric bursitis, and gluteus medius or minimus pathology. The aim of this review is to update the most recent knowledge about non-surgical management of peritrochanteric disorders.

A literature review was performed, including the most relevant articles from recent years that focused on the non-surgical treatment of peritrochanteric disorders.

Conservative treatment still has a place and includes activity modification, NSAIDs, analgesics, physiotherapy, home training, local corticosteroid injection (CSI), and shock wave therapy (SWT). These non-surgical alternatives have demonstrated good clinical results with a low rate of complications.

Most patients tend to resolve GTPS or lateral hip pain with non-surgical management in the mid-term; however, when all else fails, surgical options should be evaluated. The next frontier will be to determine an individualized treatment plan based on the exact pathology.

### The accuracy of clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection in young febrile children: prospective cohort study of 15 781 febrile illnesses [^116CLzPo]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Definite bacteraemia was defined as a pure growth of a single pathogenic microorganism on blood culture or polymerase chain reaction positive for Meningococcus. Probable bacteraemia was defined as the growth of two or more types of organisms (with at least one not a likely contaminant), growth of Streptococci viridans or other likely contaminants if the final diagnosis was endocarditis, or persistently positive blood cultures (that is, two or more blood cultures positive for the same type of organism). Given the very low frequency of meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis, we decided not to undertake diagnostic modelling for these outcomes because the risk of unreliable and potentially misleading models was unacceptably high. Children with one of these diagnoses were not included in the analysis.

All probable cases of serious bacterial infection were reviewed by a final diagnosis committee composed of two specialist paediatricians (with experience in paediatrics, infectious disease, and respiratory medicine) and, in cases of pneumonia, a radiologist. The presence or absence of bacterial infection was decided blinded to clinical information and based on consensus. Where a reference standard test (urine or blood culture, or chest radiograph) was performed outside the hospital, the report and films were obtained for review. Uncertain results and all abnormal chest radiographs were reviewed by the final diagnosis committee.

Children were classified into three categories: serious bacterial infection, clinically diagnosed infection, and no bacterial infection.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^115PWvv2]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

An examination of the relative strengths and weaknesses of this study is needed to put the results in context. Firstly, this is the only controlled study that has evaluated trochanteric bursa injections. The absence of controlled studies is somewhat surprising, considering that a recent audit found that the number of procedures billed to Medicare, the largest health insurance supplier in the United States, under the procedural terminology code pertaining to "major joint or bursa injection", which includes trochanteric bursa injections, far exceeds that of any other pain management intervention.

Secondly, our outcomes are less positive than several others reported for trochanteric bursa injections. However, all previous studies evaluating trochanteric bursa injections were unblinded and uncontrolled, which tends to accentuate expectation bias. Nevertheless, larger, placebo-controlled studies are needed to better ascertain the efficacy of trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections.

Another concern about this study stems from the fact that only 39 of the 65 participants had outcome data recorded at three months. This was justified on the basis of ethical concerns stemming from pilot data showing that less than 10% of patients with "negative" outcomes at one month would experience a "positive" outcome three months post-injection with no intervening treatment. However, not carrying over one month treatment failures limits the long-term conclusions on efficacy and differences between treatment groups that can be reached from these results.

### Acute otitis media [^114DG2iZ]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2007). High credibility.

Acute otitis media is a condition that can be associated with several factors and symptoms. These include exposure to secondhand smoke, conjunctivitis, and a bulging tympanic membrane. Additional symptoms may involve difficulty sleeping with related conditions such as sinusitis and ear pain. The condition is commonly seen in children and is often tied to atopy and parental suspicion of otitis media. For those with immunocompromising conditions, symptoms like a distinctly red tympanic membrane, irritability, and ear rubbing may be more pronounced. Other symptoms include headache, somnolence, and a cloudy tympanic membrane.

- **Additional symptoms**: Ear fullness, eustachian tube dysfunction, increased white blood cell count, fever, neck pain, and poor feeding are also notable symptoms. Enlarged adenoids and distinctly impaired tympanic membrane mobility may also occur.

- **Possible causes and factors**: Otorrhea, hearing loss, cigarette smoking, increased serum CRP levels, and a retracted tympanic membrane are also associated with acute otitis media.

### Evenity [^1159WQbC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw: Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving Evenity. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to the initiation of Evenity treatment. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ (such as chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, denosumab, angiogenesis inhibitors, and corticosteroids) may increase the risk of developing ONJ. Other risk factors for ONJ include cancer, radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, and coagulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, the clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on a benefit-risk assessment. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Evenity should receive care from a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of Evenity should be considered based on a benefit-risk assessment.

Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures: Atypical low-energy or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving Evenity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft, from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare, and they are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of a complete fracture.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^1168VpS9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques and soft tissue endoscopy now allow for precise diagnosis and management of extra-articular hip pathology. The aim of this scoping review is to present an evidence-based update of the relevant literature focusing on the pathoanatomy, clinical assessment, and diagnosis of pathology in the peritrochanteric space.

A literature search was performed on PubMed to include articles reporting on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome.

A total of 542 studies were identified, of which 49 articles were included for full-text analysis in the scoping review. Peritrochanteric space pathology can be broadly classified into:

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**
- **Abductor tears**
- **External snapping hip syndrome**.

Anatomically, the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia lata work in conjunction to abduct and internally rotate the hip. The anterolateral part of the gluteus medius tendon is more prone to tears due to a thin tendinous portion. Increased acetabular anteversion has been shown to be associated with gluteal and trochanteric bursitis.

In terms of clinical examination, the tests found to be most useful for assisting in the diagnosis of lateral hip pain were the single-leg stance, resisted external derotation of the hip, hip lag sign, and the Trendelenburg's test. Dynamic ultrasound, along with guided injections and MRI scan, assist in differentiating the pathology.

- **Permanent hearing loss**: Independent of OME.

- **Suspected or confirmed speech and language delay or disorder**: Evaluation necessary for these conditions.

- **Autism spectrum disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders**: Children with these conditions should be screened.

- **Syndromes**: Such as Down syndrome or craniofacial disorders, including cognitive, speech, or language delays.

- **Blindness or uncorrectable visual impairment**: These conditions warrant screening.

- **Cleft palate**: With or without an associated syndrome.

- **Developmental delay**: Indicates the need for screening.

### Kenalog-80 [^115ypYFF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **General**: Strict aseptic technique is mandatory. The vial should be shaken before use to ensure a uniform suspension. Prior to withdrawal, inspect the suspension for clumping or a granular appearance, known as agglomeration. Agglomeration occurs when the drug substance separates from the solution and appears as a white precipitate in the vial. An agglomerated product should be discarded and not used. After withdrawal, Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection should be injected without delay to prevent settling in the syringe. Employ careful technique to avoid the possibility of entering a blood vessel or introducing infection.

- **Systemic**: For systemic therapy, injections should be made deeply into the gluteal muscle (see warnings). For adults, a minimum needle length of 1½ inches is recommended. In obese patients, a longer needle may be required. Use alternative sites for subsequent injections.

- **Local**: For the treatment of joints, the usual intra-articular injection technique should be followed. If an excessive amount of synovial fluid is present in the joint, some, but not all, should be aspirated to aid in the relief of pain and prevent undue dilution of the steroid. With intra-articular administration, prior use of a local anesthetic may often be desirable. Care should be taken with this kind of injection, particularly in the deltoid region, to avoid injecting the suspension into the tissues surrounding the site, as this may lead to tissue atrophy.

In treating acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, care should be taken to ensure that the injection…

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: Current concept [^114PM8nb]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Domb et al. have suggested that partial tears of the gluteus medius and minimus tendon insertions to the greater trochanter can be misdiagnosed as trochanteric bursitis, and this may be a source of chronic debilitating lateral hip pain. The authors presented an endoscopic technique that enables the visualization, debridement, and repair of these tears. Furthermore, they suggested that the diagnosis of gluteus tendinopathy or rupture should initially be made clinically. Clinical examination includes palpation for tenderness, Trendelenburg testing, abduction strength testing, and resisted external rotation in the supine position with the hip flexed at 90°.

Theoretically, the pathology in the short rotator muscle tendons could contribute to the symptoms experienced by patients with osteoarthritic hips or degenerative lumbar disease. It is interesting to speculate that, by intervening early in the tendinous disease, it might be possible to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) or even slow the process.

The treatment of tendinosis in patients with mild and moderate OA might therefore be an option to reduce the symptoms. Injections of platelet-rich plasma, physiotherapy, and also radiofrequency microtenotomy of the small rotator muscle tendons in the hip region are treatment options to consider for reducing symptoms in these patients.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^115UrShJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or trochanteric bursitis, is described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. At the time of writing, there is no consensus on clinical guidelines for either diagnosing or managing GTPS.

- **Methods**: To understand the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes related to the management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty, a survey was developed and completed by Canadian arthroplasty surgeons. The final survey consisted of 23 questions divided into three sections: screening questions, demographic information, and practice patterns, attitudes, and beliefs.

- **Results**: Most surgeons use physical examination alone for diagnosis. A detailed analysis indicates that surgeons primarily treat GTPS with oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%). Management options are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of either unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or platelet-rich plasma.

There remains an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty. Physical examination is most often relied on, regardless of the availability of imaging aids. While common treatments of GTPS were identified, up to one-third of patients fail initial therapy.

### Iliopsoas bursa injections can be beneficial for pain after total hip arthroplasty [^116ENpvZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Impingement of the iliopsoas tendon is an uncommon cause of groin pain after total hip arthroplasty (THA). We asked whether selective steroid and anesthetic injections for iliopsoas tendonitis after THA would relieve pain and improve function. We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients with presumed iliopsoas tendinitis treated by fluoroscopically guided injections of the iliopsoas bursa. Pre- and immediately post-injection, questionnaires and telephone follow-up questionnaires were administered to determine patient outcomes.

Four patients were lost to follow-up, and we were unable to obtain information from relatives on an additional four; the questionnaire was administered to the remaining 19 patients, including six who subsequently had surgery at an average of 44.6 months (range, 25–68 months) after their first injection. The average modified Harris hip score in the 19 patients improved from 61 pre-injection to 82 post-injection, and the average pain improved from 6.4 pre-injection to 2.9 post-injection. However, eight patients (30%) required a second injection at an average of 8.2 months after the first injection. Ultimately, six patients (22%) had an additional surgical procedure to address the underlying cause of the iliopsoas irritation.

Iliopsoas tendonitis is uncommon after THA but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients who present with groin pain after THA. Selective steroid and anesthetic injections of the iliopsoas bursa provide adequate pain relief in the majority of patients and should be considered part of the non-operative treatment plan.

### Arthroscopic anatomy and surgical techniques for peritrochanteric space disorders in the hip [^11554DR2]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Disorders of the lateral or peritrochanteric space, often grouped into the greater trochanteric pain syndrome, such as recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, external snapping iliotibial band, and gluteus medius and minimus tears, are now being treated endoscopically. We outline the endoscopic anatomy of the peritrochanteric space of the hip and describe surgical techniques for the treatment of these entities.

Proper portal placement is key in understanding the peritrochanteric space and should be first oriented at the gluteus maximus insertion into the linea aspera, as well as the vastus lateralis. When tears of the gluteus medius and minimus are encountered, suture anchors can be placed into the footprint of the abductor tendons in a standard arthroscopic fashion.

Our initial experience indicates that recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans, and focal, isolated tears of the gluteus medius and minimus tendon may be successfully treated with arthroscopic bursectomy, iliotibial band release, and decompression of the peritrochanteric space and suture anchor tendon repair to the greater trochanter, respectively.

The patient was diagnosed with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) that included an inflammatory component, as evidenced by bursitis seen on ultrasound. She was educated on hip abductor strengthening exercises, but she was not interested in performing the exercises regularly. Instead, she requested a corticosteroid injection, so an ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa injection was performed by the ultrasound-trained physiatrist.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^1176CjXJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who experience lateral hip pain have historically been diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis and treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. Although this strategy is effective for most patients, a substantial number continue to experience pain and functional limitations. Over the past decade, our understanding of disorders occurring in the peritrochanteric space has increased dramatically. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompasses trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans (i.e. snapping hip), and abductor tendinopathy. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, examination findings, and imaging characteristics aids clinicians in treating these patients. Open and endoscopic treatment options are available for use when nonsurgical treatment is unsuccessful.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1138dTJW]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

The study presents scores for each of the SF-36 scales, stratified by injection method. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the mental health scale at the one-month follow-up; patients who received blind injections reported slightly better scores. Other differences generally favored the blind injection group, except for emotional roles at baseline, physical roles and bodily pain at one month, and physical functioning at three months.

For outcomes analyzed by success at three months, the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study participants were similar. Even though there was a lack of statistical significance, an unsuccessful treatment at three months was more common among men, obese individuals, patients with shorter duration of pain, and those with greater disability on the Oswestry Disability Index.

- **Injection method**: Analysis included outcomes by injection method, number of injections, and whether the injection was intra-bursal or extra-bursal. For the primary outcome measure, the numerical rating scale score at one month for hip pain at rest declined from 5.1 to 2.7 (P = 0.0001) in the fluoroscopically guided injection group and from 4.6 to 2.2 (P = 0.0001) in the blind injection group.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^116DmMVj]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Perhaps the most common local cause of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults is greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). Gluteus medius weakness is often a significant contributor to the development of GTPS. As a result, hip abductor strengthening exercises should be the first-line treatment of this syndrome in conjunction with medication. While medications and modalities may provide temporary symptomatic relief, pain will likely recur if the underlying weakness is not addressed. Additionally, since GTPS and other lumbopelvic conditions often coexist, it is important to perform a thorough history and physical examination to evaluate for the possibility of multiple pain generators as well.

- **Key points**:

- **Lateral hip and/or thigh pain in the older adult with CLBP**: This pain can arise from various causes, most commonly GTPS, iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS), hip osteoarthritis, lumbar radiculopathy/radiculitis, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Meralgia paresthetica should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Often, lateral hip and/or thigh pain is multifactorial.

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**: This is a common cause of lateral hip pain and is usually due to weakness of the gluteus medius muscle. Hip abductor strengthening is the first-line treatment for GTPS.

- **True GT bursitis causing GTPS**: This occurs in a minority of cases. Therefore, corticosteroid injections should be used sparingly and ideally only when there is imaging evidence of bursitis. Injection should always be accompanied by a hip abductor strengthening program.

In older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP), iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) should also be considered in the diagnostic process.

### Satisfactory results after endoscopic gluteus medius repair combined with selective gluteus maximus reflected tendon release for the treatment of a full-thickness tear of gluteus medius [^111XMJMA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Recently, greater trochanteric pain syndrome has become a common cause of lateral hip pain. In particular, it is more common amongst women in the 5th and 6th decades of their lives, with a ratio of women to men up to 4:1 and an estimated prevalence of 1.8/1000.

Although trochanteric pain is generally associated with the inflammation of the trochanteric bursa, many studies have suggested that the main cause of lateral hip pain is tearing in gluteal muscles, which is more prevalent in gluteus medius than in gluteus minimus. Abductor tears are characterized more often by the onset of chronic pain generated by attritional forces than by acute traumatic pain. However, partial-thickness undersurface tears may be more common than complete ruptures, and they typically occur at the dual insertion of the anterior and middle muscle fibres of the gluteus medius into the superoposterior and lateral facets of the greater trochanter.

Although findings on plain radiographs are generally normal, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to have a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 91% in detecting hip abductor tears. Conservative treatment is considered the first option, including steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, functional therapies, peritrochanteric corticosteroids, and local anaesthetic injections. The surgical option, using either open or endoscopic techniques, is recommended for patients with recalcitrant lateral hip pain who continue to feel pain after more than at least 6 months of non-operative management.

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^114zZkPK]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Hip pain can arise from a variety of conditions. Among the possible causes are gluteal tendinitis, hip osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and atypical femoral fractures. Other significant conditions include trochanteric bursitis, lumbar radiculopathy, and septic arthritis of the hip. Additionally, conditions such as hip osteomyelitis, hip fractures, and osteochondritis dissecans may be contributing factors. Several other diagnoses need consideration, including multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, acetabular dysplasia, slipped upper femoral epiphysis, and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Moreover, common rheumatological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis, axial spondyloarthritis, and hip labral tears can also cause hip pain. Lesser-known but significant causes include iliopsoas bursitis, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, and snapping hip syndrome. Lastly, conditions like Paget's disease, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, gout, and synovial chondromatosis, as well as more serious concerns like hip dislocation, chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and bone metastasis should also be part of a comprehensive differential diagnosis.

### Gluteal tendinopathy: Integrating pathomechanics and clinical features in its management [^117JMBH1]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Gluteal tendinopathy is now believed to be the primary local source of lateral hip pain, or greater trochanteric pain syndrome, previously referred to as trochanteric bursitis. This condition is prevalent, particularly among postmenopausal women, and has a considerable negative influence on quality of life. Improved prognosis and outcomes in the future for those with gluteal tendinopathy will be underpinned by advances in diagnostic testing, a clearer understanding of risk factors and comorbidities, and evidence-based management programs. High-quality studies that meet these requirements are still lacking. This clinical commentary provides direction to assist the clinician with assessment and management of patients with gluteal tendinopathy based on currently limited available evidence on this condition, the wider tendon literature, and the combined clinical experience of the authors.

### Response to: Rho et al. "Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain" [^113SzDip]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

It is therefore puzzling that the treatment provided in the clinical case presented in this review was an "ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injection". In fact, in this case, as often occurs in clinical practices across the United States, the patient unfortunately underwent two ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections. This treatment would not only appear to be not indicated based upon the literature cited in the review by Rho et al. but also potentially harmful in this 90-year-old patient with a history of several compression fractures. In addition, the known lack of efficacy of these injections results in not only a poor outcome but also increased cost.

The review failed to include other types of injection treatments for this treatment, including simple needle of the tendon, that is, needle tenotomy, ultrasound-guided dextrose injection, or platelet-rich plasma injection (PRP). In a multicenter case series, Mautner et al. noted a significant benefit using PRP on a variety of tendons, including the hip abductor tendons, namely the gluteus minimus and medius tendons, which commonly demonstrated tendinopathic changes in these patients. Although the scientific evidence for the efficacy of PRP injection is limited, it is superior to the level of evidence for many treatments for GTPS and certainly superior to corticosteroid injections. In our clinical experience, we have found that a single PRP injection of a high-concentration, leukocyte-poor PRP is effective in 90% of patients suffering from GTPS who have failed other conservative measures.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^116t3iWG]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A hip-strengthening program is considered to be first-line treatment for patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) since it directly addresses the biomechanical cause of pain. If a patient is resistant to engaging in a strengthening program and/or is severely limited by pain from GTPS, we prefer referral to a musculoskeletal specialist prior to considering treatment with a corticosteroid injection for two reasons.

First, using ultrasound or MRI to identify whether bursitis (i.e. active inflammation) is actually present helps the clinician determine how likely the patient is to benefit from an anti-inflammatory medication such as a corticosteroid. When available and in the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer, ultrasound is superior to MRI because it is faster, cheaper, and provides real-time imaging which can also be used for visualization during injection.

Second, cadaveric studies have demonstrated that there are seven bursae surrounding the greater trochanter (GT). Therefore, in order to maximize a clinical response to a corticosteroid injection, it should be performed under ultrasound guidance by an experienced provider into the appropriate bursa demonstrating inflammation. An experienced specialist can use ultrasound to evaluate for bursitis and accurately administer any indicated injection during a regular office visit, without the need for delay to obtain an MRI to confirm inflammation.

Also, there is often concomitant gluteal tendinopathy in the form of tendon tears or tendinosis. It is possible that decreasing the inflammation of the bursa will result in incomplete pain relief.

### Prevalence of contralateral hip abductor tears and factors associated with symptomatic progression [^115fnLxk]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with gluteus medius tendinopathy present with laterally based hip pain that can be diagnosed under the greater trochanteric pain syndrome diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assist in diagnosing pathology of the symptomatic hip, and when a pelvic MRI includes both hips, the clinician may identify asymptomatic tears in the nonsurgical hip. In patients who undergo unilateral gluteus medius repairs, little is known about the prevalence or subsequent onset of clinical symptoms in the nonsurgical hip.

- **Purpose**: To describe (1) the prevalence of asymptomatic contralateral gluteus medius tears in patients with unilateral symptoms, (2) the presentation and time before symptom onset, and (3) the morphological characteristics on MRI of future symptomatic tears.

- **Study design**: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: A total of 51 consecutive patients who underwent gluteus medius tear surgery were reviewed for contralateral hip pathology; of these, 43 patients were 2 years out from index surgery with reviewable preoperative MRI scans. A musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed the MRI scans for tear size, tendon retraction, and fatty infiltration using the Goutallier-Fuchs grading system. Medical record review identified contralateral hips requiring subsequent treatment.

- **Results**: Of the original 43 patients, 10 (23%) had no contralateral tear, 19 (44%) had low-grade partial tears, 9 (20%) had high-grade partial tears, and 5 (11%) had full-thickness tears. Thirty-seven patients had unilateral symptoms; the other 6 had mild contralateral hip pain.

### Arthroscopic bursectomy with concomitant iliotibial band release for the treatment of recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis [^115A99B4]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Trochanteric bursitis with lateral hip pain is a commonly encountered orthopedic condition. Although most patients respond to corticosteroid injections, rest, physical therapy, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications, those with recalcitrant symptoms may require operative intervention. Studies have explored the use of the arthroscope in the treatment of these patients. However, these reports have not addressed the underlying pathology in this chronic condition. We believe that the iliotibial band must be addressed and is the main cause of pain, inflammation, and trochanteric impingement leading to the development of bursitis. We report a new technique for arthroscopic trochanteric bursectomy with iliotibial band release.

Our technique involves two incisions: one 4 cm proximal to the greater trochanter along the anterior border of the iliotibial band, and the other 4 cm distal and along the posterior border. The 30-degree arthroscope is introduced through the inferior portal, and a cannula is introduced through the superior portal. A 5.5-mm arthroscopic shaver is inserted through the superior cannula to clear off the surface of the iliotibial band, allowing for adequate visualization. A hooked electrocautery probe is then used to longitudinally incise the iliotibial band until it no longer rubs, causing impingement over the greater trochanter.

### Dry needling versus cortisone injection in the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A noninferiority randomized clinical trial [^113y5qwj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

The study design was prospective, randomized, and partially blinded. This research addresses greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), formerly known as greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. Traditionally, a cortisone (corticosteroid) injection into the lateral hip has been the accepted treatment for this condition; however, the effectiveness of steroid injections into the bursa is increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial.

The objective was to investigate whether the administration of dry needling (DN) is noninferior to cortisone injection in reducing lateral hip pain and improving function in patients with GTPS. Forty-three participants (50 hips observed), all with GTPS, were randomly assigned to a group receiving cortisone injection or DN. Treatments were administered over six weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the numeric pain-rating scale (0–10). The secondary outcome measure was the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (0–10). Medication intake for pain was collected as a tertiary outcome.

- **Results**: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. A noninferiority test for a repeated-measures design for pain and averaged function scores at six weeks (with a noninferiority margin of 1.5 for both outcomes) indicated noninferiority of DN versus cortisone injection [both, p < 0.01]. Medication usage [P = .74] was not different between groups at the same time point. No adverse side effects were reported.
