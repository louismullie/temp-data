## Question

how long does it take for mono to resolve

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes for infectious mononucleosis (mono) to resolve, including details about recovery timelines, activity restrictions, and when to expect a full return to normal function. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the typical acute symptomatic window. Then, I should verify the expected total resolution timeline. Next, I will examine the trajectory of splenic enlargement because that drives safety decisions. After that, I need to check for subacute and chronic sequelae, especially fatigue. Then, I should review activity restrictions, particularly for athletes, and the evidence behind them. Finally, I will consider special populations and complications that can alter the course and summarize practical guidance with caveats and shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the acute symptomatic phase. Most patients experience fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue that cluster in the first 2 to 3 weeks, with fever sometimes persisting up to 3 weeks. This is the core acute window I should anchor on before moving to convalescence timelines [^112LwugA].

> Wait, let me verify the total resolution window. I initially thought "about 2 to 3 weeks", but that's too short for full recovery; I should correct that. Complete resolution of symptoms typically occurs within 4 to 8 weeks in immunocompetent patients, which aligns with sports medicine and primary care guidance and better reflects the convalescent period after the acute phase [^115EZyEK].

> Next, I should review splenic dynamics because they drive safety advice. Splenic enlargement begins within days of symptom onset, peaks around 1 to 3 weeks, and then regresses at roughly 1% per day; in most cases, splenomegaly resolves by 4 to 6 weeks, though a minority may take longer, which is why contact-risk decisions hinge on this window [^114rebVS] [^113fu3XR].

> Hold on, I should verify the risk of splenic rupture to calibrate caution. Most ruptures occur in the first 2 days of illness, but the risk remains nontrivial for several weeks; although rare overall (< 0.5%), the timing risk supports restricting contact activity for at least 3 to 4 weeks from symptom onset in athletes and others at risk of abdominal trauma [^115oNMVK] [^115qfjCw] [^111jv7ms].

> I will now examine subacute and chronic sequelae, especially fatigue. About 10% of patients report persistent fatigue at 6 months, and in adolescents, approximately 13% meet criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome at 6 months, declining to about 7% at 12 months and 4% at 24 months. This helps set expectations for a subset with prolonged recovery trajectories [^115stouV] [^113i3fEX].

> Let me consider activity restrictions and return-to-play guidance, since this is where timing often matters most. Current sports medicine guidance recommends avoiding heavy exertion or contact sports for at least 3 to 4 weeks from symptom onset due to splenic risk, while allowing a trial of supervised, nonimpact, low-intensity activity as early as 2 weeks if the patient is afebrile, improving, and has adequate energy; decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making, and serial ultrasound can be considered if early return is contemplated [^111jv7ms] [^11733pWy] [^111RqEZ8].

> But wait, what about nonathletes and general activity? I should confirm general advice. Nonpharmacologic guidance supports refraining from sports or strenuous activity until the patient is afebrile, asymptomatic, and well hydrated, with gradual resumption thereafter; this aligns with primary care recommendations and underscores the principle of symptom-guided pacing rather than a rigid calendar [^115t3Mgg].

> Next, I should review special populations and complications that can prolong recovery. Children may have less pronounced symptoms but are at higher risk of airway obstruction from tonsillar enlargement, and immunocompromised patients are at risk for severe or complicated courses; hematologic complications, myocarditis, and neurologic sequelae are uncommon but can extend recovery and require targeted management [^114sMgCX] [^113A6tQ8].

> I need to ensure I'm not overpromising on treatments that shorten illness. Routine antivirals and corticosteroids do not meaningfully reduce time to recovery in uncomplicated cases. Corticosteroids are reserved for specific complications such as impending airway obstruction, hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, or myocarditis, so expectations should be set on supportive care and time [^115stouV] [^115uuHtF] [^112zU6PL].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline while keeping variability in mind. Acute symptoms commonly last 2 to 3 weeks, total resolution often takes 4 to 8 weeks, splenic enlargement generally resolves by 4 to 6 weeks, and a minority have fatigue persisting to 6 months or longer. Activity restrictions should mirror this biology, with at least 3 to 4 weeks off contact sports and earlier, low-intensity activity only if clinically ready, using shared decision-making and ultrasound if early return is pursued [^112LwugA] [^115EZyEK] [^114rebVS] [^111jv7ms].

> Finally, I should double-check that my counseling aligns with evidence and safety. Emphasize supportive care, hydration, rest, and symptom-limited pacing. Avoid ampicillin or amoxicillin due to rash risk. And tailor return-to-activity to clinical status, recognizing that premature heavy exertion may prolong fatigue and recovery, which is especially relevant for athletes aiming to avoid setbacks [^111SFLGH] [^115WuZXX] [^116ywJ1J].

Most cases of infectious mononucleosis resolve within **2–4 weeks** [^114x2qXT], though fatigue and malaise can persist for **4–8 weeks** [^115EZyEK] or longer in some patients [^115stouV]. Splenomegaly typically resolves by **4–6 weeks** [^114rebVS], and athletes should avoid contact sports for at least 3–4 weeks [^111jv7ms] due to splenic rupture risk [^111jv7ms]. Antivirals and corticosteroids are not recommended for routine use [^114x2qXT]; management is supportive care [^111SFLGH], with return to activity individualized based on symptoms and clinical judgment [^111RqEZ8].

---

## Typical duration of acute symptoms

- **Acute phase**: Fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy typically resolve within 2–4 weeks [^114PT4KA] [^112LwugA].
- **Fatigue**: Often persists 4–8 weeks [^115EZyEK]; about 10% have fatigue lasting ≥ 6 months [^115stouV] [^113i3fEX].
- **Splenomegaly**: Usually resolves by 4–6 weeks [^114rebVS]; peak enlargement occurs around 12 days after symptom onset [^113fu3XR].

---

## Factors influencing recovery time

Several factors can influence **recovery time**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on recovery time** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger patients (adolescents and young adults) may have longer recovery times due to more severe symptoms [^notfound]. |
| Immune status | Immunocompromised patients may experience prolonged and more severe symptoms [^114x2qXT]. |
| Complications | Splenic rupture, airway obstruction, or neurologic complications can significantly prolong recovery [^113A6tQ8]. |
| Activity level | Premature return to strenuous activity may prolong symptoms, particularly fatigue [^116ywJ1J] [^113RCeJF]. |

---

## Prolonged symptoms and complications

A subset of patients experience **prolonged symptoms** or complications:

- **Chronic fatigue**: Approximately 10% of patients experience fatigue lasting ≥ 6 months [^115stouV] [^113i3fEX].
- **Splenic rupture**: Rare (< 0.5%) but serious; most cases occur within the first 2 days of illness [^115qfjCw] [^115oNMVK].
- **Neurologic complications**: Rare, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningitis, and encephalitis [^113A6tQ8].
- **Hematologic complications**: Rare, including hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia [^116JGzpu] [^113A6tQ8].

---

## Medical interventions and their impact on recovery

Medical interventions have **limited impact** on recovery time:

- **Antivirals**: Acyclovir and valacyclovir have minimal impact on symptom duration or recovery time [^115stouV] [^114sMgCX].
- **Corticosteroids**: Not recommended for routine use; may provide short-term symptom relief but do not significantly shorten overall recovery time [^114x2qXT] [^115uuHtF].
- **Supportive care**: Rest, hydration, and analgesics are the mainstay of treatment [^111SFLGH] [^114x2qXT].

---

## Recommended activity restrictions and return-to-play guidelines

Activity restrictions are important to prevent complications, particularly **splenic rupture**:

- **Athletes**: Avoid contact sports for at least 3–4 weeks after symptom onset [^111jv7ms] [^112s5ytk].
- **General population**: Avoid strenuous activities until fully recovered and asymptomatic [^115t3Mgg].
- **Return-to-play**: Individualized decision based on clinical judgment, symptom resolution, and, if necessary, serial ultrasound to assess spleen size [^111jv7ms] [^116Lw49k].

---

## Conclusion

Infectious mononucleosis typically resolves within **2–4 weeks** [^115uuHtF], though fatigue and malaise can persist for 4–8 weeks [^115stouV] or longer. Recovery is influenced by age, immune status, complications, and activity level. Medical interventions have limited impact on recovery, and management is primarily supportive [^111SFLGH]. Activity restrictions, particularly in athletes, are important to prevent complications such as splenic rupture [^111jv7ms].

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^114cfFux]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) epidemiology in infectious mononucleosis (IM) describes humans as the only source, with transmission "primarily through oral secretions", including sharing cups or food or close contact such as sneezing, and notes an incubation period of EBV of 30–50 days. In children " < 16 years old" with clinically diagnosed IM, "85.4% were because of EBV and 14.6% were because of cytomegalovirus (CMV)". In young adults "between 15 and 19 years old", the annual symptomatic IM rate is "between 200 and 800 cases per 100,000". Among freshmen, "30% to 50%" remain susceptible with an "annual incidence of 1% to 5%". A United Kingdom study with "2325 participants" found "96.4% of women and 95.5% of men by age 20 to 25 years were seropositive for EBV", and "each year increase in age corresponded to a 12% increase in the rate of seropositivity". It also states that EBV is "not uncommon" to be unrecognized in children because symptoms are generally less severe than in older adults.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for infectious mononucleosis, more specifically with respect to return to sport, AMSSM 2023 guidelines recommend to consider advising a trial of supervised, nonimpact, low-intensity activity 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms in afebrile athletes with an adequate energy level and improving clinical examination findings. Consider delaying return to sport in the presence of ongoing clinical signs/symptoms, lack of athlete readiness, and/or IM-associated complications.

### Return to work following sickness absence due to infectious mononucleosis [^114zfzBg]. Occupational Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis among adults is notorious because of the prolonged incapacitating fatigue it causes.

Aims

To investigate the duration of sickness absence and return to work following infectious mononucleosis.

Methods

Episodes of sickness absence due to infectious mononucleosis were selected from an occupational health services register. The duration of sickness absence and return to work was assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

Two thousand one hundred and thirty-seven episodes of absence due to infectious mononucleosis had a median duration of 91 days. Young employees (aged 15–24 years) had the highest return to work rates. Women had longer sickness absence than men. Employees working in small companies were absent longer than employees in large companies.

Conclusions

Occupational physicians should advise gradual return to work, starting 4 weeks after the onset of the illness, in order to prevent physical deconditioning and prolonged illness.

### Diagnosis of atypical cases of infectious mononucleosis [^117LBFg8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The variable manifestations of infectious mononucleosis rarely cause clinicians to suspect primary Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infection; consequently, costly diagnostic tests and unnecessary treatments are undertaken. Seventeen cases of clinically atypical and 11 cases of clinically typical infectious mononucleosis were diagnosed through screening for atypical and apoptotic lymphocytes in the peripheral blood samples by means of an automated hematologic analyzer. Atypical and typical cases did not differ significantly with respect to peripheral white blood cell counts; percentages of lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, CD4(+) lymphocytes, human leukocyte antigen — DR positivity in CD3 lymphocytes, or apoptotic cells in blood smear after incubation; or levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Only the percentage of CD8(+) lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with typical infectious mononucleosis than it was in patients with atypical infectious mononucleosis. Because certain atypical cases of infectious mononucleosis display laboratory abnormalities that are characteristic of typical infectious mononucleosis, enhanced awareness can help in the diagnosis.

Summary points

We presented a case of an EBV-related conjunctival mass in a paediatric patient with a recent primary infection and symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. The blood picture was not fully characteristic and the instance emphasised the importance of recognising the early signs of IM and treating accordingly. Ultimately, surgical excision was performed and the child had a successful recovery shortly after.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) — heterophile test performance and repeat testing: Laboratory studies that support IM include lymphocytosis with typically greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes and a positive heterophile test. In patients older than age 16 years, the heterophile antibody latex agglutination test has a sensitivity and specificity of 87% (range 79%–95%) and 91% (range 82%–99%), respectively. False-positive results are rare but can occur in lymphoma, hepatitis, or autoimmune disease. The false-negative rate may be higher during the first week of illness (25%) and decreases with subsequent testing (5%–10% at week 2 and 5% at week 3), underscoring the usefulness of repeating this test if clinically indicated; alternatively, more specific EBV tests can be considered.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^113krZsq]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–specific serology — timing and diagnostic accuracy: VCA IgM appears early in infection and disappears at the 4–6-week mark; antibody to early antigen is usually short-lived, peaking at 3–4 weeks after onset; VCA IgG peaks at 2–4 weeks and persists for life; and EBNA antibody generally appears only after 2–4 months and also persists for life. VCA IgM and IgG antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis (sensitivity 97%, specificity 94%), with a positive likelihood ratio of 16.5 versus 9.7–28 for a positive heterophile test; when VCA IgM and IgG are negative, the negative likelihood ratio is 0.03 versus 0.14 to 0.18 for heterophile antibody tests. Because EBNA appears late and persists for life, its presence in the course of acute illness should lead one to consider diagnoses other than EBV.

### Epstein-Barr virus in the RIVERA case-control study of acute febrile illness: acute mononucleosis nearly absent as an etiology in the Peruvian amazon [^111HtEod]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Although low levels of detectable EBV DNA are known to persist for life in immunocompetent individuals, this is thought to be restricted to the intracellular compartment, where one in every 104–106 circulating memory B lymphocytes harbors one or two copies of the viral genome in the form of episomal DNA. Unlike detection in whole-blood samples, however, extracellular or cell-free EBV DNA in plasma samples has previously been reported to be undetectable among healthy immunocompetent hosts and is highly specific for acute EBV-related illnesses such as primary infection, reactivation, or malignancy. We therefore hypothesized that detection of EBV DNA in whole-blood samples for at least some participants was likely due to latent intracellular infection, with EBV DNA absent from the extracellular compartment.

To distinguish between evidence of active EBV-related processes (which could be implicated in febrile illness) and mere intracellular latency, we repeated EBV DNA testing using plasma samples for a subset of the participants whose whole blood had been positive for EBV DNA. To identify primary infection, which is the EBV-related process most likely to be associated with fever, we also assessed the presence of antibodies against EBV nuclear antigen type-1 (anti-EBNA-1 IgG), a marker of remote prior exposure to latent-phase EBV infection, which only becomes detectable 5 weeks or more after initial infection. The combined findings of the three test results allowed for categorization of participants by active versus latent infection and previously exposed versus unexposed, thereby identifying possible instances of AFI due to primary EBV infection.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)–specific serology — viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM appears early and typically disappears at the 4- to 6-week mark, VCA IgG peaks 2 to 4 weeks after onset and persists for life, and Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies generally appear 2 to 4 months after onset and also persist; IgM and IgG antibodies to EBV VCA have a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 94%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 16 vs 9.7–28 for heterophile tests and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.03 vs 0.14–0.18 for heterophile antibody tests; tests such as EBV DNA amplification in lymphocytes and monitoring viral load via PCR are not routinely used in clinical practice.

### Severe ulcerative oesophagitis caused by primary Epstein-Barr virus infection in an immunocompetent individual [^117TMAf8]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects the vast majority of the human population. The primary infection in immunocompetent individuals is typically asymptomatic or presenting as infectious mononucleosis. Here, an 18-year-old man without medical history was admitted with mild non-specific symptoms of infection presenting primarily with severe dysphagia and epigastric pain. Gastroscopy revealed severe, extensive, ulcerative oesophagitis with suspicion of Crohn's disease. However, a diagnosis of primary EBV infection presenting as severe ulcerative oesophagitis and without systemic symptoms of infectious mononucleosis was made based on dynamic changes in EBV serology (shift from IgM to IgG positivity), EBV-specific immunohistochemical staining, and PCR analysis of biopsy specimens. This rare manifestation of primary EBV in an immunocompetent patient was treated symptomatically and resolved within a few weeks, and should be considered a differential diagnosis at otherwise unexplained ulcerative oesophagitis in younger individuals.

Pityriasis lichenoides is a rare cutaneous eruption of unknown cause that spans a spectrum of clinical severity. Infectious agents have long been suspected as etiologic factors. The present case is the first to demonstrate a known EBV-mediated process evolving and resolving in concert with pityriasis lichenoides. Epstein-Barr virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and HIV are the most frequently reported infectious triggers of pityriasis lichenoides. Pityriasis lichenoides may arise secondary to EBV-mediated acute infectious mononucleosis.

### Teenage kicks: splenic rupture secondary following infectious mononucleosis [^114JWhXH]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 16-year-old man was brought to the emergency department by his father with apparent alcohol intoxication. While in the department, it was noted that the patient had ongoing tachycardia, hypotension and abdominal pain. His recent medical history included a self-resolving illness of fatigue, muscle aches and sore throat. A CT scan of his abdomen revealed an enlarged spleen with a splenic infarct and rupture, likely secondary to infectious mononucleosis. The patient was treated conservatively for 12 days.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115SB7kD]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Study selection

Reviewers (BS, RACS, DP, RBP) independently and in duplicate screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies using a priori selection criteria. Subsequently, the samereviewersindependently assessed eligibility of the full texts of potentially eligible studies. Reviewers resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if needed, by adjudication from a third reviewer.

We included randomised controlled trials that compared corticosteroids with standard of care or placebo and enrolled adults and/or children aged 5 and over in emergency departments and primary care settings with a clinical syndrome of sore throat (painful throat, odynophagia, or pharyngitis).

We excluded studies of participants who were admitted to hospital or immunocompromised and those with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat after any surgery or intubation (postoperative sore throat), gastroesophageal reflux disease, croup, or peritonsillar abscess. We also excluded studies that enrolled children aged under 5 because they would not be able to provide trustworthy outcome measurements, especially for self reported pain.

Our outcomes of interest were complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours; mean time to onset of pain relief; mean time to complete resolution of pain; absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours; duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms (such as problems for eating, drinking, swallowing); recurrence/relapse of symptoms; days missed from school or work; need for antibiotics; and rate of adverse events related to treatment. We included any adverse events reported by the authors.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^114jZknq]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of infectious mononucleosis (IM) in adolescents and young adults — IM is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and eventually infects almost 90% of adults. The peak incidence in developed countries has been reported in adolescents and young adults, and among freshman entering college 30% to 50% remain susceptible with an annual incidence of 1% to 3% for developing mononucleosis, translating to a rate of infection of nearly 15% in previously unexposed individuals. There is no evidence to suggest that IM is more or less prevalent in the student-athlete population than among nonathletes.

### Risk of inflammatory bowel disease following hospitalisation with infectious mononucleosis: nationwide cohort study from Denmark [^113vvXUY]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We also observe an increased risk for IBD development in those diagnosed with severe IM over time (1977–1989 HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03–1.43, 1990–1999 HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10–1.54, 2000–2009 HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.15–1.70, 2010–2021 HR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.45–2.35, P = 0.049) following adjustment for age at IM diagnosis and despite similar baseline numbers of IM hospitalisations in the two periods (1977–1989 = 9,930 vs 2010–2021 = 12,546). However, the total follow-up time for IBD development was considerably shorter for those diagnosed with IM between 2010–2021 (7.79 per 100,000 person-years) compared with 1977–1989 (39.59 per 100,00 person-years). Following restriction of calendar time of follow-up to 10 years after IM diagnosis for all calendar year of diagnosis categories, this calendar time effect is lost (10-year post-diagnosis HR 1977–1989: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.06–2.47, 1990–1999: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.17–2.03, 2000–2009: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.26–2.04, 2010–2021: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.46–2.38, P = 0.97; see Supplementary Table 3).

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^115ii1Ce]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Generation, here, of IM-MS delay distributions has enabled determination, through deconvolution, of the IM, non-IM EBV distribution, OEB full. Like OEB IM, OEB full is late EBV, as both distributions experience > 75% of their infections beyond age 10 years; that is, in a pubescent or postpubescent timeframe. By contrast, less than 45% of a general population (e.g. white non-Hispanic Americans)show infection after age 10 years. This commonality of "late" infection and the large body of similar EBV serologic data for IM and non–IM-MS cases argues that the evidence for IM as causal should logically be extended to all late ([post] pubescent) EBV infections as causal; that is, as necessary.

This article accomplishes 4 things. First, it strengthens the argument for IM (EBV) as causal by qualitatively increasing the demands on confounding explanations for EBV-MS time correlation. Absent evidence for TID: confounding models need only claim earlier EBV infection in all the MS susceptible in noncausal explanations for time correlation seen in immunity studies. With TID, these models must also explain later EBV in late-developing MS and stay in synchronicity with MS development variation at all ages. Second, cited evidence for IM as time random obviates all confounding counterarguments for causality. Third, this article gives specific insight into disease development time, stratified by sex, age at infection, and EBNA1 titer level, from IM infection to MS onset. Finally, this article provides evidence that its conclusions are equally applicable to both IM and non-IM forms of EBV.

Although incidental to our primary objectives, the EIMS EBV − risk ratio data presented here (table e-1.4) serve to reinforce results of the most comprehensive prior "immunity study", while largely explaining recently reported discrepanciesfrom that study.

The perspective of this study uses analytic strategies common to engineering and the physical sciences and stands distinct from treatment of this issue with the tools of epidemiology. While epidemiology generally shuns the notion of causality, the physical and engineering scientists do not shy away from this issue. It is illuminating to contrast these nuances, if not polarities, in analysis of a complex medical issue.

### A prospective clinical study of Epstein-Barr virus and host interactions during acute infectious mononucleosis [^1156K4f5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Characterizing virus-host interactions during self-limited infectious mononucleosis could explain how Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) replication is normally controlled and provide insight into why certain immunocompromised patients fail to contain it.

Methods

University students had an average of 7 clinical and virologic evaluations during acute infectious mononucleosis. EBV was quantified in 697 samples of oral wash fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and plasma by a real-time (TaqMan) polymerase chain reaction (qEBV) assay developed in our laboratory.

Results

Twenty of 25 subjects had serologically confirmed primary EBV infection. EBV was cleared from whole blood by a first-order process with a median half-life of 3 days, and its quantity was associated with severity of illness (r2 = 0.82). Oral shedding persisted at a median of ≥ 1x104 copies/mL for 32 weeks and was unrelated to severity of illness. Subjects with nonprimary EBV infection shed virus intermittently, and median quantities for all samples became undetectable within 4 weeks.

Conclusions

Using a novel qEBV assay, we demonstrated that young adults with primary EBV infection rapidly cleared virus from blood but not from the oropharynx. High oral concentrations of EBV in asymptomatic persons who have resumed normal activities support the concept that infectious mononucleosis is most likely acquired by kissing.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^11649Joy]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the average age of MS onset vs the age at which Epstein-Barr infection has previously occurred and stratify this analysis by sex and the blood level of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibody.

Methods

Using infectious mononucleosis (IM) as a temporal marker in data from the Swedish epidemiologic investigation of MS, 259 adult IM/MS cases were identified and then augmented to account for "missing" childhood data so that the average age of MS onset could be determined for cases binned by age of IM (as stratified by sex and EBNA1 titer level).

Results

Mean age of IM vs mean age of MS reveals a positive time correlation for all IM ages (from ∼5 to ∼30 years), with IM-to-MS delay decreasing with increased age. When bifurcated by sex or EBNA1 blood titer levels, males and high-titer subpopulations show even stronger positive time correlation, while females and low-titer populations show negative time correlation in early childhood (long IM/MS delay). The correlation becomes positive in females beyond puberty.

Conclusions

IM/MS time correlation implies causality if IM is time random. Alternative confounding models seem implausible, in light of constraints imposed by time-invariant delay observed here. Childhood infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in females and/or those genetically prone to low EBNA1 blood titers will develop MS slowly. Males and/or high EBNA1-prone develop MS more rapidly following IM infection at all ages. For all, postpubescent EBV infection is critical for the initiation and rapid development of MS.

### Antiviral agents for infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) [^115stouV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a clinical syndrome, usually caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EPV), characterised by lymphadenopathy, fever and sore throat. Most cases of symptomatic IM occur in older teenagers or young adults. Usually IM is a benign self-limiting illness and requires only symptomatic treatment. However, occasionally the disease course can be complicated or prolonged and lead to decreased productivity in terms of school or work. Antiviral medications have been used to treat IM, but the use of antivirals for IM is controversial. They may be effective by preventing viral replication which helps to keep the virus inactive. However, there are no guidelines for antivirals in IM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral therapy for infectious mononucleosis (IM).

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, March 2016), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to 15 April 2016), Embase (1974 to 15 April 2016), CINAHL (1981 to 15 April 2016), LILACS (1982 to 15 April 2016) and Web of Science (1955 to 15 April 2016). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antivirals versus placebo or no treatment in IM. We included trials of immunocompetent participants of any age or sex with clinical and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of IM, who had symptoms for up to 14 days. Our primary outcomes were time to clinical recovery and adverse events and side effects of medication. Secondary outcomes included duration of abnormal clinical examination, complications, viral shedding, health-related quality of life, days missing from school or work and economic outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the included studies' risk of bias and extracted data using a customised data extraction sheet. We used the GRADE criteria to rate the quality of the evidence. We pooled heterogeneous data where possible, and presented the results narratively where we could not statistically combine data.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 333 participants in our review. Three trials studied hospitalised patients, two trials were conducted in an outpatient setting, while the trial setting was unclear in two studies. Participants' ages ranged from two years to young adults. The type of antiviral, administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials. The antivirals in the included studies were acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir. Follow-up varied from 20 days to six months. The diagnosis of IM was based on clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters. The risk of bias for all included studies was either unclear or high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for all outcomes and so the results should be interpreted with caution. There were statistically significant improvements in the treatment group for two of the 12 outcomes. These improvements may be of limited clinical significance. There was a mean reduction in 'time to clinical recovery as assessed by physician' of five days in the treatment group but with wide confidence intervals (CIs) (95% CI -8.04 to -1.08; two studies, 87 participants). Prospective studies indicate that clinical signs and symptoms may take one month or more to resolve and that fatigue may be persistent in approximately 10% of patients at six-month follow-up, so this may not be a clinically meaningful result. Trial results for the outcome 'adverse events and side effects of medication' were reported narratively in only five studies. In some reports authors were unsure whether an adverse event was related to medication or complication of disease. These results could not be pooled due to the potential for double counting results but overall, the majority of trials reporting this outcome did not find any significant difference between treatment and control groups. There was a mean reduction in 'duration of lymphadenopathy' of nine days (95% CI -11.75 to -6.14, two studies, 61 participants) in favour of the treatment group. In terms of viral shedding, the overall effect from six studies was that viral shedding was suppressed while on antiviral treatment, but this effect was not sustained when treatment stopped. For all other outcomes there was no statistically significant difference between antiviral treatment and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The effectiveness of antiviral agents (acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir) in acute IM is uncertain. The quality of the evidence is very low. The majority of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias and so questions remain about the effectiveness of this intervention. Although two of the 12 outcomes have results that favour treatment over control, the quality of the evidence of these results is very low and may not be clinically meaningful. Alongside the lack of evidence of effectiveness, decision makers need to consider the potential adverse events and possible associated costs, and antiviral resistance. Further research in this area is warranted.

### Infectious mononucleosis: rapid evidence review [^114x2qXT]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age. Primary transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly their saliva. Cost-effective, efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91% but can have a false-negative result in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a negative heterophile antibody test result. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Current guidelines recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis not participate in athletic activity for three weeks from onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the timing of return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been linked to nine types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases.

### Cellular immune controls over Epstein-Barr virus infection: new lessons from the clinic and the laboratory [^1169sTYV]. Trends in Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus with potent B cell growth transforming ability, induces multiple cellular immune responses in the infected host. How these host responses work together to prevent virus pathogenicity, and how immune imbalance predisposes to disease, remain poorly understood. Here, we describe three ongoing lines of enquiry that are shedding new light on these issues. These focus on: (i) patients with infectious mononucleosis or its fatal equivalent, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease; (ii) EBV infection in a range of new, genetically defined, primary immune deficiency states; and (iii) experimental infection in two complementary animal models, the rhesus macaque and the human haemopoietic stem cell reconstituted mouse.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^111FmjCo]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective:

To determine the average age of MS onset vs the age at which Epstein-Barr infection has previously occurred and stratify this analysis by sex and the blood level of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibody.

Methods:

Using infectious mononucleosis (IM) as a temporal marker in data from the Swedish epidemiologic investigation of MS, 259 adult IM/MS cases were identified and then augmented to account for "missing" childhood data so that the average age of MS onset could be determined for cases binned by age of IM (as stratified by sex and EBNA1 titer level).

Results:

Mean age of IM vs mean age of MS reveals a positive time correlation for all IM ages (from ∼5 to ∼30 years), with IM-to-MS delay decreasing with increased age. When bifurcated by sex or EBNA1 blood titer levels, males and high-titer subpopulations show even stronger positive time correlation, while females and low-titer populations show negative time correlation in early childhood (long IM/MS delay). The correlation becomes positive in females beyond puberty.

Conclusions:

IM/MS time correlation implies causality if IM is time random. Alternative confounding models seem implausible, in light of constraints imposed by time-invariant delay observed here. Childhood infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in females and/or those genetically prone to low EBNA1 blood titers will develop MS slowly. Males and/or high EBNA1-prone develop MS more rapidly following IM infection at all ages. For all, postpubescent EBV infection is critical for the initiation and rapid development of MS.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in acute hepatitis and pediatric acute liver failure — prevalence, course, and diagnostics: EBV is the primary cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM) with a lifetime prevalence of 90%; the majority of patients with acute EBV infection have mild hepatitis and the enzyme levels typically rise over a 1- to 2-week period; acute EBV infection can rarely be complicated by severe hepatitis leading to PALF, resulting in death or LT; EBV diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical features, serology, and confirmatory PCR testing, and a liver biopsy may be required in selected cases with in situ hybridizations of EBV-encoded RNA (EBER).

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^111RqEZ8]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) position statement — return to play after infectious mononucleosis (IM): It is reasonable to engage in a trial of supervised, nonimpact, low-intensity activity 2 wk from the onset of symptoms for those athletes who are afebrile, have an adequate energy level, and have an improving clinical examination; conversely, delaying RTS should be considered when there are ongoing clinical signs/symptoms, lack of athletic readiness, and/or IM-associated complications, and treatment must therefore be individualized (SOR C). It appears that premature (earlier than 2 to 3 wk from symptom onset) return to activities may prolong recovery and prolong the duration of symptoms, most notably fatigue, and may be associated with deconditioning and/or a decrease in performance; there are some data, however, to suggest that early return to low-level exercise is beneficial, and given these uncertainties, a shared decision-making (SDM) model for return-to-sport decisions is recommended (SOR C). The time for safe return to contact play is unclear; given the risk for splenic rupture, a time frame of at least 3 to 4 wk from onset of symptoms is recommended, SDM should be used for individualized RTS decisions, and in situations where an athlete with acute IM is considering an early return to activity (before 3 to 4 wk from symptom onset for contact sport) serial ultrasound imaging could be considered to confirm that the spleen size is decreasing or stable in size (SOR C).

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^115fmDqX]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society of Sports Medicine position statement — infectious mononucleosis (IM) in athletes — states that IM is caused primarily by the Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV), presents with fever, pharyngitis, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, and can be confirmed by a positive heterophile antibody ("Monospot"), polymerase chain reaction, or antibodies specific to EBV. Individuals with acute IM may be quite asymptomatic and feel well enough to participate in sports, but splenic enlargement is common and rupture is a relatively rare occurrence typically occurring within a month of symptom onset, complicating sports participation and often prompting activity restriction; management is primarily supportive with no role for antivirals or corticosteroids, and variability in presentation with splenic rupture risk makes return to play/return to sport decisions challenging.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^113hqEY4]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The strength of the EIMS program is in its ability to generate an accurate sampling of the full population. Weakness includes the need to use retrospective questionnaires in gathering data. Two additional issues, as they relate to aspects of this study, include the exclusion of data for minors (younger than 18 years) from the collected data owing to privacy laws and the indirect exclusion of possible IM after MS from the data owing to those cases necessarily being classified as EBV (not IM) negative. Restorations of these data are critical to the accuracy of our present undertaking. We may briefly summarize these restorations here while deferring detail to appendix e-1 at. For pediatric restoration, and based on the literature, we assume that 5% of total MS cases (Sweden) experience diagnosis before age 18 years, thus introducing 13.5 pediatric cases to the EIMS total of 258. These 13.5 added cases are then allocated by sex, age at MS onset, and by implication, age at EBV, according to the onset and sex data reported in recent studies of pediatric MS. Conclusions in this article are insensitive to these allocations. Restoration level for IM-negative cases is shown to be insignificant based on the extremely low incidence of EBV – cases observed by EIMS.

Methodology for treating IM-MS delay.

We introduce here, as detailed in appendix e-2, a simple concept and formalism that enables quantitative definition of the relationships between the distribution of onset of MS (termed OMS), the delay distribution of the time from EBV infection to MS onset (termed DMS), and the distribution of initiating EBV (IM) infection (termed OEB). With this formalism, it is reasonably argued that those distributions are reproducible and meaningful within a large homogeneous population. It can also be argued that over short periods of EBV infection through puberty (≃2–3 years) or longer periods after age 20 (∼5–10) years, DMS (delay) will remain approximately unchanged.

The principal metric that we report here in figures 1 and e-2.1 is the plot of average age of MS onset vs average age of IM, binned by 5-year increments of age at IM. For each such IM bin, we also generate a delay distribution, DMS (delay), such that, for example:

EBV-related risk factors for MS

Understanding the risk factors that link EBV to MS is crucial to unraveling the complex relationship between viral infections and autoimmune diseases. EBV, a ubiquitous human herpesvirus, is strongly associated with MS, yet not all individuals infected with EBV develop the disease. Identifying the risk factors that affect this relationship can help to refine our understanding of MS pathogenesis and inform the development of targeted preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this section, we will focus on primary EBV-related risk factors that contribute to the progression of MS, including infectious mononucleosis, incubation period, genetic factors, sex differences, vitamin D deficiency and CD8 + T cell deficiency.

Infectious mononucleosis

One of the key EBV-related risk factors for MS is infectious mononucleosis, a common consequence of EBV infection. Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy and fatigue. It usually arises during primary EBV infection, typically in adolescents or young adults. Mononucleosis and MS are more likely to occur when primary EBV infection occurs after age 10, a period characterized by a reduction in thymic negative selection of autoreactive T cells and a peak in T helper 1 (Th1) cell-mediated immune responses. The association between infectious mononucleosis and an increased risk of developing MS has been well documented in prospective studies: The risk of developing MS in individuals with EBV infection is 32-fold higher compared with uninfected individuals. This risk is even higher when EBV infection leads to symptomatic-to-severe infectious mononucleosis, particularly for those carrying the HLA-DR15 haplotype. Severe infectious mononucleosis might exacerbate immune dysregulation and contribute to the autoimmune response observed in MS. The mechanisms underlying this increased risk may involve higher and more prolonged viral loads and immune activation during acute EBV infection, leading to a cascade of inflammatory events that predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases. EBV also creates an extralymphatic viral reservoir in the CNS during infectious mononucleosis. During this period, approximately 50% of memory B cells may test positive for EBV. In summary, infectious mononucleosis is a key factor in EBV-induced MS and should be carefully considered in NHP model development. Refining these models will improve our understanding of MS and inform targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Integrating these insights into research and clinical practice will improve MS management and patient outcomes.

### EBV-requisitioning physicians' guess on fatigue state 6 months after acute EBV infection [^114Rpvtt]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

We assessed referring medical practitioner's ability to predict chronic fatigue development in adolescents presenting with acute infectious mononucleosis. Compared with 'not fatigued' being predicted as 'unsurely fatigued' and 'likely fatigued' were both strongly associated with developing fatigue 6 months later (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.16% to 5.47% and 3.2, 95% CI 1.19% to 8.61%, respectively, P = 0.012). The positive and negative predictive values were 66% and 62%, respectively. Disentangling the physician's intuition may be of interest in further investigations of risk factors and prophylactic factors for fatigue development.

### On the dynamics of acute EBV infection and the pathogenesis of infectious mononucleosis [^114meMn6]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Memory B cells latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus (mB(Lats)) in the blood disappear rapidly on presentation with acute symptomatic primary infection (acute infectious mononucleosis [AIM]). They undergo a simple exponential decay (average half-life: 7.5 ± 3.7 days) similar to that of normal memory B cells. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to immediate early (IE) lytic antigens (CTL(IEs)) also decays over this time period, but no such correlation was observed for the CTL response to lytic or latent antigens or to the levels of virions shed into saliva. We have estimated the average half-life of CTL(IEs) to be 73 (± 23) days. We propose that cycles of infection and reactivation occur in the initial stages of infection that produce high levels of mB(Lats) in the circulation. Eventually the immune response arises and minimizes these cycles leaving the high levels of mB(Lats) in the blood to decay through simple memory B-cell homeostasis mechanisms. This triggers the cells to reactivate the virus whereupon most are killed by CTL(IEs) before they can release virus and infect new cells. The release of antigens caused by this large-scale destruction of infected cells may trigger the symptoms of AIM and be a cofactor in other AIM-associated diseases.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^112XXFBi]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The discussion has focused, thus far, on disease development assuming MS is triggered by EBV. We return now to that primary objective and question. The most basic metric for time correlation, "no MS before EBV", that is, "immunity studies"have been the sole means to date for detecting such correlation. The most thorough of these immunity studies is perhaps the 2010 study which used U.S. Army–archived blood samples to provide longitudinal data on serologic history for 305 MS cases. All cases were EBV positive before MS, with 10 seroconverting within the time range accessed by available blood samples. This investigation provided strong evidence supporting the premise that "EBV occurs before MS" while also providing the first data on EBV-MS delay. We have introduced here a distinctly different (from immunity studies) yet complementary methodology, TID detection. Differences between these metrics are quantified in appendix e-4. Both methods are vulnerable to noncausal "confounding" hypotheses (regarding immunity studies, a common confounding phenomenon causes MS and is hypothesized to also cause early EBV susceptibility). We make here and in detail in appendix e-4 2 counter arguments. First, beneficial to either method, EBV is inherently time random. Second, TID detection demands a qualitatively more complex confounding, hypothesized to cause a weak form (both MS and EBV occur later) and strong (MS and EBV occur early). This seems highly unlikely. We, therefore, view TID detection in all males and high EBNA1 titer level cases and in postpubescent females as providing significant evidence for a causal EBV-MS relationship.

If IM is time random (as argued in appendix e-4) and we detect TID, then it follows that random delay in IM to very old age results in no MS; absent IM, no MS occurs. We summarize here our strongest argument for "random" IM and a causal relationship. EBV infection is triggered by saliva transfer in a manner that age of infection is heavily modulated in a statistical (i.e. time random) manner by social norms and ages at various forms of socialization. Data support increased infection at periods of initial schooling or dating. The very strong time correlation between age of IM and age of MS for all males and for all postpubescent females can thus only be simply and easily explained by hypothesizing an IM/MS causal relationship if, as appears to be the case, the initial IM infections are occurring in a time-random fashion.

### Acute kidney injury in symptomatic primary Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis: systematic review [^114fJQSq]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Textbooks and reviews do not mention the association of symptomatic primary Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis with acute kidney injury in subjects without immunodeficiency or autoimmunity.

Study Design

Stimulated by our experience with two cases, we performed a review of the literature.

Results

The literature documents 38 cases (26 male and 12 female individuals ranging in age from 0.3 to 51, median 18 years) of symptomatic primary Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis complicated by acute kidney injury: 27 acute interstitial nephritides, 1 jaundice-associated nephropathy, 7 myositides and 3 hemolytic uremic syndromes. Acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy was observed in 18 (47%) cases. Acute kidney injury did not resolve in one patient with acute interstitial nephritis. Two patients died because of systemic complications. The remaining 35 cases fully recovered.

Conclusions

In individuals with acute symptomatic Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis, a relevant kidney injury is rare but the outcome potentially fatal. It results from interstitial nephritis, myositis-associated acute kidney injury, hemolytic uremic syndrome or jaundice-associated nephropathy.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^1135zUy9]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Figure 1 shows average age of MS onset vs average age of IM, binned in 5-year IM increments, and stratified by sex. The combined-sex plot is shown in figure e-2.1, and a plot of all 258 individual EIMS cases vs age at IM and at MS is given in figure e-2.3. Fractional case numbers for these data result from our approximation that pediatric cases missing from EIMS represent exactly 5% of total cases (258 EIMS + 13.5 pediatric). The male plot of < MS > vs < IM > is matched to linear and almost time invariant over all infection ages. The female data are noteworthy because they reflect a rapid drop in disease development time (< DMS >), starting with extreme (25.4 years) delay for early (5 years) infection, dropping down to only an 8-year delay for adult (∼25 years) infection, and indicating a uniquely severe transition through puberty for females. Statistical uncertainty in delayis shown for the most uncertain stratifications (male, figure 1, and both EBNA1, figure 2).

Figure 2
Age at MS vs average binned age of infectious mononucleosis, stratified by Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 titer level (epidemiologic investigation of MS)

Bracketed numbers indicate case number for datum. IM = infectious mononucleosis.

Figure 2 shows the average age of MS onset vs average age of IM, stratified by the EBNA1 titer level. These data could not be pediatric corrected. EIMS EBNA1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) (total) measurements significantly predated other data reported here. Consequently, a smaller sample of only 99 measurements exists, randomly distributed among our 259 cases. "High" and "low" titers refer to whether the measurement was above or below the median value measured for controls, with a high/low case number ratio of approximately 2.4:1. The "high-titer" data show a similar disease development behavior vs time of infection as seen in males. The "low-titer" disease development is similar to that seen in females. The EBNA1 blood titer level may be, like sex, primarily a genetic marker; that is, titer level variation may reflect genetic-based variation in response to EBV infection, with a high EBNA1 level suggesting a deficient immune response. However, it is also possible that the EBNA1 titer level variance reflects EBV variants.

Head, neck, and skin findings — clinical features of infectious mononucleosis (IM): Lymphadenopathy in IM involves the posterior cervical chain more than the anterior chain, with nodes typically large and moderately tender, peaking early and subsiding over a 2- to 3-week period. Oropharyngeal assessment should consider other causes, including streptococci (coexistent in up to 30% of cases), gonococcus, and human immunodeficiency virus, and exudative pharyngitis is seen in more than 50% of patients with IM with marked tonsillar hyperplasia and exudation that may be white or gray-green or necrotic. Skin findings may include a maculopapular, urticarial, or petechial rash; rash is more common with concomitant ampicillin and has been described with azithromycin, levofloxacin, and cephalexin, and petechial rashes should alert providers to possible hematologic complications such as aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Antiviral benefit is unproven: "A meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials of acyclovir… failed to show a clinical benefit compared to placebo". Corticosteroids "may be clinically indicated" for severe complications, but a Cochrane Review found benefits only "for the first 12 hours", which were "lost at 2–4 days", concluding steroids "should be avoided"; furthermore, due to oncogenic concerns, steroids "should not be used in patients who have uncomplicated IM". For bacterial coinfection, "Antibiotics should be used if there is a concomitant streptococcal pharyngitis", but "ampicillin or amoxicillin should be avoided".

### Rash associated with piperacillin / tazobactam administration in infectious mononucleosis [^116wvN9p]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of piperacillin/tazobactam-induced rash in a patient with infectious mononucleosis.

Case Summary

A 25-year-old white man developed a rash while receiving piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g intravenously every 6 hours and gentamicin for osteomyelitis complicating a left femur fracture secondary to a motorcycle accident. Due to progression of the rash following additional doses of piperacillin/tazobactam during hospitalization, the patient's antimicrobial regimen was changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Subsequently, a mononucleosis spot test was positive, and both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibodies were positive. The rash rapidly resolved with the discontinuation of piperacillin/tazobactam.

Discussion

Although the development of rash following the administration of several different antimicrobials, especially ampicillin, has been previously reported, this is the first report of piperacillin/tazobactam-induced rash in infectious mononucleosis. The rash is generally self-limiting and usually resolves within days of discontinuing the causative antimicrobial agent. An altered drug metabolism or an immune-mediated process has been suggested as the potential mechanism for rash development.

Conclusions

Prior reports of antimicrobial-induced rash in infectious mononucleosis and a positive laboratory diagnosis of EBV in our patient with no history of penicillin allergy support the identification of piperacillin/tazobactam as the inducer of the rash. According to the Naranjo probability scale, the association of piperacillin/tazobactam with the rash was classified as probable.

### Biology of Epstein-Barr virus during infectious mononucleosis [^115kyw55]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is the clinical manifestation of primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We monitored primary infection during convalescence and during the establishment of persistent infection. The profiles of EBV strains in the oral cavity and in peripheral blood were determined by use of a heteroduplex tracking assay specific for the EBV gene encoding latent membrane protein 1. Multiple EBV strains were detected in most patients and persisted in and were possibly transmitted among 3 distinct compartments of infection, including the oral cavity, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the cell-free fraction of the blood plasma. We also tracked transmission of multiple strains from an asymptomatic carrier to a patient diagnosed with primary EBV infection. These data reveal that primary EBV infection is complex, with transmission of multiple strains and clear differences in relative abundance of strains in distinct compartments.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^1146nq6c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) — heterophile antibody kinetics and serologic diagnosis in immunocompetent mononucleosis are outlined as follows: Heterophile antibodies usually become detectable 6–10 days following symptom onset, increase through the second or third week of the illness, and thereafter gradually decline over a year or longer; false negative results occur in approximately 10% and are especially common in children younger than 4 years. When rapid Monospot or heterophile testing is negative, additional laboratory tests may be considered, and EBV-specific antibody testing for IgG- and IgM-class antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) is recommended. VCA IgM (with or without VCA IgG) with absent EBNA IgG suggests recent primary infection, whereas anti-EBNA IgG indicates infection that occurred at least 6–12 weeks prior; EBNA IgG generally develops 2–3 months after primary infection and is detectable for life. Over 90% of adults have IgG-class antibodies to VCA and EBNA, but approximately 5%–10% of infected patients fail to develop antibodies to EBNA. Nucleic acid amplification tests, either qualitative or quantitative, are not recommended for routine diagnosis of EBV-associated disease in the immunocompetent patient.

These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.

The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.

Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving OMECLAMOX-PAK, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.

5.9 Development of Bacterial Superinfections

The possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy with OMECLAMOX-PAK due to the clarithromycin and amoxicillin components. If superinfections occur, OMECLAMOX-PAK should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.10 Mononucleosis and Ampicillin

A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop an erythematosus skin rash. Thus, administration of ampicillin-class antibiotics is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis.

5.11 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing OMECLAMOX-PAK (clarithromycin or amoxicillin component) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Safety (LTE study) a

Seven SAEs were reported among six patients with pJIA and six SAEs were reported among five patients with sJIA (Table 2; Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online). Serious infections were reported in five patients with pJIA (grade 3 furuncle, grade 3 pneumonia, and grade 1 varicella in the < 30 kg SC-TCZ Q3W group; grade 2 appendicitis and grade 3 infectious mononucleosis in the ≥ 30 kg SC-TCZ Q2W group) and one patient with sJIA (grade 2 mycoplasma pneumonia in the < 30 kg SC-TCZ Q10D/Q2W group). Only the event of pneumonia in a patient with pJIA was considered related to study treatment by the investigator. Tocilizumab treatment was interrupted for the events of furuncle, infectious mononucleosis, and varicella in pJIA and the event of mycoplasmal pneumonia in sJIA; however, none of these serious infections resulted in study discontinuation. All serious infections were reported as resolved, with the furuncle event resolved with sequelae.

### Epstein-Barr virus in the RIVERA case-control study of acute febrile illness: acute mononucleosis nearly absent as an etiology in the Peruvian amazon [^116Qw79E]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Critical examination of cases of AFI in the Peruvian Amazon that initially tested positive for EBV DNA by multiplex PCR using whole blood revealed that few, if any, were compatible with an active EBV-related etiology. The presence of intracellular latent viral DNA is the most plausible explanation for the frequent detection of EBV DNA in whole-blood samples among this cohort.

Our findings suggest that most individuals in this population have previously been exposed to EBV and that this exposure most often occurs in early childhood, consistent with prevailing theories regarding an early age of asymptomatic EBV acquisition in low- and middle-income countries. Given the lifelong nature of infection, the detection of EBV DNA in the whole blood of only one-third of participants is therefore likely a function of both the limit of detection of our qPCR assay and the average latent viral "set point" of this population, with whole blood-negative/EBNA-positive individuals actually latently infected, but with a set point that is below the limit of detection. Although the distribution of viral loads in whole blood among healthy controls is left-censored at our limit of detection of 5.49 log 10 (copies/mL) and neither we nor prior authors have taken steps to impute values for non-detects, our mean, median, and upper-bound values are among the highest reported in the literature for healthy control subjects. – Immunosenescence raising the latent set point above the detection threshold likely explains the subtle association we observed between increasing age and increasing odds of latent viral detection.

### Steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis [^115uuHtF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever or the kissing disease, is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. It is a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous herpes virus that is found in all human societies and cultures. Epidemiological studies show that over 95% of adults worldwide have been infected with EBV. Most cases of symptomatic infectious mononucleosis occur between the ages of 15 and 24 years. It is transmitted through close contact with an EBV shedder, contact with infected saliva or, less commonly, through sexual contact, blood transfusions or by sharing utensils; however, transmission actually occurs less than 10% of the time. Precautions are not needed to prevent transmission because of the high percentage of seropositivity for EBV. Infectious mononucleosis is self-limiting and typically lasts for two to three weeks. Nevertheless, symptoms can last for weeks and occasionally months. Symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly and fatigue. Symptom relief and rest are commonly recommended treatments. Steroids have been used for their anti-inflammatory effects, but there are no universal criteria for their use.

Objectives

The objectives of the review were to determine the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy versus placebo, usual care or different drug therapies for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis.

Search Methods

For this 2015 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2015) and EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2015). We also searched trials registries, however we did not identify any new relevant completed or ongoing trials for inclusion. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We adapted the search terms when searching EMBASE.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing the effectiveness of steroids with placebo, usual care, or other interventions for symptom control for people with documented infectious mononucleosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

For this 2015 update, we did not identify any new RCTs for inclusion. The previous version of the review included seven trials with a total of 362 participants. Four trials compared the effectiveness of a steroid to placebo for short-term symptom control in glandular fever, one to aspirin, and two trials explored the effects of steroids in conjunction with an antiviral. Heterogeneity between trials prevented a combined analysis. Trials under-reported methodological design features. Three trials did not adequately describe sequence generation for randomisation. Four trials provided adequate details of allocation concealment. All trials were double-blind but four were not specific as to who was blinded. Loss to follow-up was under-reported in four trials, making it difficult to exclude attrition bias. The risk of selective reporting in the included trials was unclear. Across the trials, no benefit was found in 8/10 assessments of health improvement. Two trials found benefit of steroid therapy over placebo in reducing sore throat at 12 hours (eight-day course odds ratio (OR) 21.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94 to 227.20; one-dose OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 16.32), but the benefit was not maintained. In combination with an antiviral drug, participants in the steroid group had less pharyngeal discomfort between days two to four (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.08) compared to placebo. Across the trials the effects on other common symptoms were less clear. Two trials set out to measure safety; they documented no major adverse effects. In two other trials adverse events were reported, including respiratory distress and acute onset of diabetes. However, the association of the events with the steroid is not definite.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to the efficacy of steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis. There is a lack of research on the side effects and long-term complications.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^111jv7ms]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for infectious mononucleosis, more specifically with respect to return to sport, AMSSM 2023 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding the time for a safe return to contact play. Consider using a time frame of at least 3–4 weeks from the onset of symptoms, given the risk for splenic rupture. Use shared decision-making for individualized return to sport decisions. Consider obtaining serial ultrasound imaging to confirm that the spleen size is decreasing or stable in size in situations where an athlete with acute IM is considering an early return to activity (before 3–4 weeks from symptom onset for contact sport).

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^112f4Nkk]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The IM-to-MS delay distribution (DMS) is shown in figure 3 for select IM age ranges (< 10 years and > 20 years) and for males and females. "Black" cases represent pediatric cases (correction). Notable is detail on the large drop in IM-MS delay from childhood infection to adult infection. This effect is particularly strong in females. Note that F/M ratio for infection under age 10 years is comparable (at ×2.64) to adult values. However, this F/M ratio peaks dramatically at 4.6, IM age 11–15 years (figure e-2.3). This peak may be modulated by social factors affecting male, female ages at infection. Of note, the "low EBNA1" female cases for early IM show extreme delay.

Figure 3
Infectious mononucleosis to MS delay distribution (DMS) for childhood, adulthood, male, and female

Childhood: (A) female and (B) male. Childhood female to male ratio = 35.2/13.3 = 2.64. Adulthood: (C) female and (D) male. ΔP = pediatric correction. EBNA 1 = Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1; IM = infectious mononucleosis; P = pediatric.

Figure 4 summarizes prior data on a single graph that emphasizes a significant biologic transition in response to EBV infection that occurs in early puberty (age 10–15 years). The transition is strongest for females and results in a twofold increase in MS incidence vs that in males (for that peak period) and greater than a twofold drop in IM-to-MS delay time from childhood through adolescence.

### Long-term shedding of infectious Epstein-Barr virus after infectious mononucleosis [^113WUNEE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, and saliva, as well as infectivity of the virus in saliva, were evaluated in 20 patients for 6 months after the onset of infectious mononucleosis (IM). All patients displayed sustained high EBV DNA loads in the saliva, associated with a persistent infectivity of saliva at day 180. EBV DNA load in PBMCs decreased significantly from day 0 to day 180 (in spite of a viral rebound between day 30 and day 90 in 90% of the patients), and EBV DNA rapidly disappeared from plasma. These data show that patients with IM remain highly infectious during convalescence.

### Ampicillin sodium (ampicillin) [^115WuZXX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

The possibility of superinfections with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. In such cases, discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment.

A high percentage (43 to 100 percent) of patients with infectious mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Typically, the rash appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued. In most cases, the rash is maculopapular, pruritic, and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin.

Prescribing ampicillin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, should be made during prolonged therapy.

Transient elevation of serum transaminase has been observed following administration of ampicillin. The significance of this finding is not known.

Drug Interactions

The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of skin rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^114rebVS]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) splenic enlargement — natural history and serial ultrasound findings show that patients diagnosed with IM demonstrate splenic enlargement beginning within a few days after symptom onset, with rapid early enlargement that peaks 1 to 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. In hospitalized IM patients, ultrasound found most (16 of 19 subjects) within the normal range (defined as measuring less than 12 cm in length, 7 cm wide and 4 cm deep) 4 weeks after diagnosis, though 16% (3 of 19 subjects) were not; these 3 patients were reimaged at 8 weeks and were subsequently in the normal range. In collegiate athletes, all IM cases had splenic enlargement with maximum splenic length increasing by a mean of 33.6% from baseline values (range 3.9% to 95.8%), peak enlargement at a mean of 12.3 days (range 6–23 days) after symptom onset, a decrease in spleen size of approximately 1% per day after peak, and resolution of splenomegaly by 4 to 6 weeks in all but 1. SOR Recommendation grade: B: The use of measuring splenic size at a single time point has not been demonstrated because of the wide variability of normal values and lack of clear association between splenic size and associated complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114AD7pq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Presumed infectious lymphadenopathy in adults — empiric antibiotics and follow-up: While some sources acknowledge that resolution of inflammatory lymphadenopathy may take 6 to 12 weeks, most sources recommend observation limited to 2 weeks and do not advise delaying further evaluation beyond the initial 2-week period; it is reasonable to prescribe a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic for a neck mass that appears infectious provided the patient is followed, and a patient treated with antibiotics should be reassessed within 2 weeks; if the mass has not completely resolved, further workup for possible malignancy is recommended and partial resolution requires additional evaluation; if infectious lymphadenopathy resolves, the patient should be reassessed once more in 2 to 4 weeks to monitor for recurrence; in the absence of signs and symptoms suggesting infection, empiric antibiotics should be avoided and the mass should undergo further workup.

### EBV-requisitioning physicians' guess on fatigue state 6 months after acute EBV infection [^111oyKza]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

We assessed referring medical practitioner's ability to predict chronic fatigue development in adolescents presenting with acute infectious mononucleosis. Compared with 'not fatigued' being predicted as 'unsurely fatigued' and 'likely fatigued' were both strongly associated with developing fatigue 6months later (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.16% to 5.47% and 3.2, 95% CI 1.19% to 8.61%, respectively, P = 0.012). The positive and negative predictive values were 66% and 62%, respectively. Disentangling the physician's intuition may be of interest in further investigations of risk factors and prophylactic factors for fatigue development.

### Tacrolimus (Protopic) [^1121fq87]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

While patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin
infections including eczema herpeticum (Kaposi's varicelliform eruption),
treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment may be independently associated with an
increased risk of varicella zoster virus infection (chicken pox or shingles),
herpes simplex virus infection, or eczema herpeticum.

Patients with Lymphadenopathy

In clinical studies, 112/13494 (0.8%) cases of lymphadenopathy
were reported and were usually related to infections (particularly of the skin)
and noted to resolve upon appropriate antibiotic therapy. Of these 112 cases,
the majority had either a clear etiology or were known to resolve. Transplant
patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens (e.g., systemic tacrolimus) are at
increased risk for developing lymphoma; therefore, patients who receive PROTOPIC
Ointment and who develop lymphadenopathy should have the etiology of their
lymphadenopathy investigated. In the absence of a clear etiology for the
lymphadenopathy, or in the presence of acute infectious mononucleosis, PROTOPIC
Ointment should be discontinued. Patients who develop lymphadenopathy should be
monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves.

Sun Exposure

During the course of treatment, patients should minimize or avoid
natural or artificial sunlight exposure, even while PROTOPIC is not on the skin.
It is not known whether PROTOPIC Ointment interferes with skin response to
ultraviolet damage.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Congenital and postnatal toxoplasmosis — clinical manifestations in infants and children indicate that in studies of non-immunocompromised infants with congenital toxoplasmosis, most infants (70%–90%) are asymptomatic at birth, yet most asymptomatic children develop late sequelae with onset ranging from several months to years after birth; manifestations include maculopapular rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, hematologic abnormalities, and central nervous system disease such as hydrocephalus, intracerebral calcification, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, and seizures. Toxoplasmosis acquired after birth most often is initially asymptomatic, and when symptomatic can present with malaise, fever, sore throat, myalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and a mononucleosis-like syndrome with maculopapular rash and hepatosplenomegaly. TE should be considered in all HIV-infected children with new neurologic findings, but especially those with severe immunosuppression.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^112XL9fH]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

These results suggest that MS disease development reflects immune system development in a dynamic way for both IM and non-IM forms of EBV initiation. While males and those with high EBNA1 blood titer levels (measured at diagnosis) show gradual reduction in IM-to-MS delay, from childhood to adult infection, low-titer cases and females show a marked acceleration in disease development, from childhood to adulthood. This is quite consistent with the many who have observed that estrogen and female puberty are particularly strong risk factors for MS. The overall association of infection during puberty with accelerating MS development is made most clear in figure 4 which shows the early teen years (particularly for females) as a period of very rapid change (in this regard, it is interesting that the late teens appear to reflect a period of relaxation of this phenomenon for females as the sex ratio subsides). All these are consistent with our hypothesis here that late EBV is the common environmental risk factor giving rise to enhanced MS risk (e.g. the SIR IM), whether from the IM or non-IM forms of EBV. We have attempted, in figure 5A, to quantify late EBV for both IM and non-IM forms, and by doing so, show their distributive similarity.

### Association of persistent symptoms after Lyme neuroborreliosis and increased levels of interferon-α in blood [^115g77sq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A subset of patients with LNB experience lingering symptoms that persist despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The etiology of such symptoms is unclear, and effective biomarkers and treatment strategies are lacking. The usefulness of this report is that it defines IFN-α as a distinguishing marker and possibly a mediator of post-Lyme sequelae. These findings have potential implications for diagnosis of patients and treatment for this condition.

Prolonged systemic symptoms have been observed after several bacterial and viral infections, including infectious mononucleosis, influenza, Q fever, and COVID-19. Despite the diversity of triggering agents, several common themes have emerged. As a generalization, those sequelae comprise a constellation of nonspecific symptoms that occur more frequently after severe early infection; they also are believed to represent a postinfectious process and are indistinguishable by standard clinical, demographic, or laboratory markers. Those observations are also applicable to patients who have Lyme disease, including LNB, ≈10%–20% of whom report lingering symptoms after antimicrobial drug therapy for Borrelia infection. Combined, those studies suggest that, despite different triggers, the underlying pathophysiology of postinfectious sequelae might be similar.

In the absence of microbiological evidence of persistent infection, other hypotheses have been proposed to explain lingering symptoms after Lyme disease. Those hypotheses include retained spirochetal antigens, metabolic irregularities, and excessive inflammation, all of which could arguably be linked to inappropriate activation of host immune responses. Insights from our study of patients with LNB, along with 2 previous reports of patients with erythema migrans who were followed longitudinally to evaluate their posttreatment status, support the role of maladaptive immune responses in PTLDS. Moreover, those studies suggest that the stage for dysregulated immunity is set early in infection. In all 3 studies, heightened levels of PTLDS-associated inflammatory mediators were observed at first visit, before antimicrobial drug therapy, implying that Borrelia infection serves as the initial trigger for these responses. However, the sustained immune activity in the post‒antibiotic therapy period, which occurs concurrently with post-Lyme sequelae, appears to represent a postinfectious process. Similar observations have been made in patients with postinfectious Lyme arthritis who have persistent synovitis for months to years after receiving antibiotics. Thus, a range of post-Lyme complications have been linked to dysregulated host immunity.

### A rare presentation of Epstein-Barr virus infection [^111fzP2H]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus spread by intimate contact. It is known to cause infectious mononucleosis. Complications, including hematologic pathology and splenic rupture, are uncommon. This report is a case of EBV-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia and biliary stasis.

Case Report

An 18-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. He did not have risk factors for liver injury or hepatitis. His vital signs were notable for a fever. On examination, he was obviously jaundiced, but not in distress. Laboratory evaluation showed hemolytic anemia and biliary stasis. Ultimately, his inpatient workup yielded positive EBV serology and a positive direct agglutinin test with cold agglutinins. He made a full recovery with supportive care. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? EBV is a widely disseminated herpesvirus. Infectious mononucleosis is a common presentation of acute infection, and treatment of EBV-related diseases are largely supportive. Complications, such as splenic rupture and hematologic pathology, are uncommon. Biliary stasis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the form of cold agglutinin disease secondary to EBV is rare, and typically resolves with supportive care and cold avoidance. More advanced treatment methods are available in the setting of severe hemolysis. Elevated transaminases, direct hyperbilirubinemia, or evidence of hemolytic anemia in the setting of a nonspecific viral syndrome should raise suspicion for EBV infection. Rapid recognition can lead to more prompt prevention and treatment of other EBV-related complications.

### Steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis [^1176LuAq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis) is associated with fatigue, fever, sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. The severity of symptoms can vary. In extreme cases, breathing difficulties because of swelling in the throat and other complications can require hospitalization. The duration of symptoms is also variable; in some instances they can last for months. There are few treatments available. There are no universal criteria for using steroids in glandular fever. While their use is generally reserved for severe complications, there are reports of practitioners treating most symptomatic people with steroids. As glandular fever often affects young people at a time in their studies where they need to be continually productive, the potential duration of the condition is perhaps a key factor in prescribing such a potent drug for symptom control.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy for symptom control in glandular fever.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005); MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2005); EMBASE (January 1974 to November 2005); and the UK National Research Register (November 2005).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness for symptom control of a steroid to placebo or to another intervention for people of any age with documented glandular fever were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Authors independently assessed trial inclusion according to predetermined criteria. Results are presented separately for each symptom and, where possible, it was intended to combine results in a meta-analysis.

Main Results

Seven trials were included. The diagnosis, steroid regime, outcomes and methodological quality varied between trials. The sample size ranged from 24 to 94. For sore throat the results of two studies suggest a benefit at 12 hours of steroid therapy over placebo; however this benefit was not maintained. The evidence from one trial suggests a longer benefit when the steroid is combined with an antiviral drug. There was evidence from one trial that steroids may improve resolution of fatigue around four weeks; however it is unclear if this is only in combination with an antiviral. Two trials reported severe complications in participants in the steroid group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence - the trials were few, heterogeneous and some were of poor quality, to recommend steroid treatment for symptom control in glandular fever. There is also a lack of research on the side effects, potential adverse effects or complications, particularly in the long term.

### Peripheral blood lymphocytes express recombination-activating genes 1 and 2 during Epstein-Barr virus-induced infectious mononucleosis [^112d7USK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Implicit in the persistence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in B lymphocytes is the successful circumvention of ongoing cell selection for competence of B cell receptors (BCRs). Because the EBV infection of B cells in vitro induces enzymatic machinery that is responsible for secondary immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, we examined the expression of the recombination-activating genes (RAGs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 26 patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM). RAG1 and/or RAG2 RNA was detected in PBMCs from 42% of patients with IM but not from healthy control subjects. EBV may usurp the cellular mechanism that diversifies the BCR, to guarantee a level of survival signaling sufficient for its own persistence.

The goal was to characterize prospectively the course and outcome of chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents during a 2-year period after infectious mononucleosis.

Methods

A total of 301 adolescents (12–18 years of age) with infectious mononucleosis were identified and screened for nonrecovery 6 months after infectious mononucleosis by using a telephone screening interview. Nonrecovered adolescents underwent a medical evaluation, with follow-up screening 12 and 24 months after infectious mononucleosis. After blind review, final diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome at 6, 12, and 24 months were made by using established pediatric criteria.

Results

Six, 12, and 24 months after infectious mononucleosis, 13%, 7%, and 4% of adolescents, respectively, met the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Most individuals recovered with time; only 2 adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome at 24 months seemed to have recovered or had an explanation for chronic fatigue at 12 months but then were reclassified as having chronic fatigue syndrome at 24 months. All 13 adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome 24 months after infectious mononucleosis were female and, on average, they reported greater fatigue severity at 12 months. Reported use of steroid therapy during the acute phase of infectious mononucleosis did not increase the risk of developing chronic fatigue syndrome.

Conclusions

Infectious mononucleosis may be a risk factor for chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents. Female gender and greater fatigue severity, but not reported steroid use during the acute illness, were associated with the development of chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents. Additional research is needed to determine other predictors of persistent fatigue after infectious mononucleosis.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^113X1rSd]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

An illuminating model positing CD8 + T-cell deficiency stands today as the sole substantive example for what might explain the unique risk of "late EBV infection". This model of "CD8 + deficiency" describes that this "deficiency" becomes worse through the teen years and is exacerbated by higher levels of estrogen. It is also consistent with the observation of high EBNA1 titer levels (implying ineffective CD8 + cells) as an MS risk factor. Finally, it is consistent with similar observations regarding the role of CD8 + in the EBV-causal form of lymphoma.

The low-titer curve (figure 2) provides an important result with IM-MS delay dropping from 28 years to 7.5 years in only 17 years. The data are, however, compromised by very low sample size and an inability to do pediatric correction. Low titer would not be reflective of CD8 + deficiency, as presumably, these individuals have relatively low infected B-cell counts. Yet these cases do get MS: slowly for early infection, rapidly when infected in the late teens. MS is a complex autoimmune disease with first-order differences in development based on the HLA DRB1*15 status, A*02 status, sex status, and the related EBNA1 titer levels. It is feasible that low-titer cases reflect individuals who are susceptible to MS despite an absence of serious CD8 + deficiency. Possible explanations for these low-titer cases include increased reactivity to myelin mimics or a blood-brain barrier that is more susceptible to passage of immune cells (increased vascular cell adhesion molecule on the endothelium). Whatever these added speculative susceptibilities, as the CD8 + count drops through the teen years, these cases succumb, and the rapid MS development may reflect these added vulnerabilities. We make 2 assumptions in the preceding discussion. Titer level at diagnosis correlates with the titer level at initial infection, and second, titer level at infection is likely the strongest indicator that MS will ensue. Support for these hypotheses may be found in 2 recent studies.

Effect of exercise on IM resolution: It is unclear what role exercise has on the natural history of IM disease, and it would appear that premature return to heavy exertion might prolong the duration of symptoms, most notably fatigue, and also be associated with a decrease in performance (SOR C).

### Prolonged illness after infectious mononucleosis is associated with altered immunity but not with increased viral load [^111MYuop]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection causes a spectrum of characteristics that range from asymptomatic seroconversion to severe infectious mononucleosis (IM), sometimes with prolonged symptoms and disability. We examined the relationships between clinical course, number of viral copies, and immunological parameters in a prospective cohort of subjects with recent IM.

Methods

Eight case patients with at least 6 months of disabling symptoms and 31 matched control subjects who had recovered promptly were included. Symptom scores were recorded at regular intervals over the course of 12 months. Cellular EBV load, EBV-specific antibody responses, lymphocyte subsets, and EBV-specific interferon (IFN)- gamma induction were measured.

Results

In case patients with prolonged illness, the severity of acute-phase symptoms was greater, the development of anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1 immunoglobulin G was more rapid, and the time to development of the peak IFN- gamma response to the majority of latent-cycle EBV peptides was generally slower than those in control subjects. However, in both groups, neither viral nor immune parameters correlated with the severity or duration of symptoms.

Conclusions

The resolution of symptomatic IM is not determined by control of viremia, nor is it easily explained by altered host responses to EBV infection. The detailed determinants of delayed recovery remain to be elucidated.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of infectious mononucleosis by Epstein-Barr virus in Mexican children [^116JGzpu]. BMC Research Notes (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious mononucleosis:

- Definition: IM, also known as mono or "kissing disease", is an acute infection characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis.
- Pathophysiology: IM is most frequently caused by the EBV transmitted through infected saliva during kissing.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of IM in the US is estimated at 500 cases per 100,000 population per year, with the peak incidence between ages 15–24 years. However, over 90% of adults globally are EBV seropositive.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for EBV infection include age, specifically adolescents and young adults, intimate oral contact, transfusion of infected blood, solid organ transplantation, and hematopoietic cell transplantation.
- Disease course: Young children are often asymptomatic, and symptoms frequently occur in adolescents and young adults. Clinical manifestations include pharyngitis, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, generalized muscle aches, hepatosplenomegaly, maculopapular rash, jaundice, arthritis, conjunctivitis, and edema. Complications include hematological complications (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, TTP, HUS, and DIC), neurologic complications (Guillain-Barre syndrome, facial paralysis, meningoencephalitis, aseptic meningitis, transversal myelitis, peripheral neuritis, cerebellitis, and optical neuritis), splenic rupture, airway obstruction, pneumonia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (prolonged fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, exanthem, hepatic dysfunction, and cytopenia).
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Most patients achieve complete resolution within weeks, and mortality rates are low (5.3%). EBV remains dormant post-recovery, but symptomatic reactivation is rare. Primary EBV infection may result in chronic multisystem disease, presenting as either recurrent symptoms emerging months to years after the initial illness or as persistent IM syndrome, involving proliferation of B cells, NK cells, and T cells. Chronic active EBV infection is a rare but severe complication characterized by a disease course lasting > 6 months, histologic evidence of major organ involvement (such as interstitial pneumonia, hemophagocytosis, uveitis, lymphadenitis, or persistent hepatitis), and the detection of EBV DNA, RNA, or proteins in affected tissues. Prognosis is poor, with most patients dying within a few years due to complications such as progressive pancytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, or NK/T-cell nasal lymphoma. Chronic active EBV infection is more prevalent in Asia and South America.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^116ywJ1J]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for infectious mononucleosis, more specifically with respect to return to sport, AMSSM 2023 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding the role of exercise on the natural history of IM. Recognize that premature (earlier than 2–3 weeks from symptom onset) return to activities requiring heavy exertion may prolong the duration of symptoms, most notably fatigue, and may be associated with overtraining and/or a decrease in performance. Consider advising an early return to low-level exercise. Use a shared decision-making model for return to sport decisions given these uncertainties.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^112LwugA]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Natural history and clinical manifestations of infectious mononucleosis — Humans are the only source of this infection, and transmission occurs primarily through oral secretions. The incubation period is long (30–50 days). Many have a prodrome of malaise and headache, and fever (rarely > 104°F, > 40°C) can last up to 3 weeks. Typical findings include pharyngitis in ~80%, splenomegaly in 50%-100%, palatal petechiae in ~25%, and a rash on the trunk and upper arms in ~10%-40%. Exudative pharyngitis and tonsillar enlargement can cause airway compromise, while jaundice, central nervous system complications, and myocarditis are rare. Rash is significantly more common if the patient has been treated with ampicillin or amoxicillin, symptoms usually resolve in 4–8 weeks, and occasionally patients present with periorbital edema.

### Ultrasonographic evaluation of splenic enlargement in athletes with acute infectious mononucleosis [^113fu3XR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantitatively assess the degree and rate of splenic enlargement and the time required for regression of splenic enlargement in collegiate athletes diagnosed with acute infectious mononucleosis (IM).

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Academic Medical Center(s) outpatient sports medicine clinic.

Study Participants

Volunteer Division I University athletes.

Interventions

A limited abdominal ultrasound was performed on each participant by a licensed and experienced ultrasonographer. Splenic measurements were taken to assess maximum splenic length. Athletes who were subsequently diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis (clinical illness and a positive monospot) underwent serial splenic ultrasounds and physical exams (weekly) until resolution of clinical symptoms and splenic enlargement (as determined by ultrasound measurements).

Main Outcome Measures

Per cent enlargement of spleen size (length) from baseline. Time (in days) from onset of clinical illness to maximum splenic length. Time (in days) required for resolution of splenic enlargement.

Results

20 subjects were diagnosed with acute IM during a 5 year time period. Maximum splenic length increased a mean of 33.6% (SD 19.9%) from baseline values. Peak splenic enlargement was reached a mean of 12.3 (SD 5.1) days from onset of clinical illness. A linear model demonstrated that spleen size decreases approximately 1% per day after reaching peak splenic enlargement.

Conclusions

The majority of athletes with IM experience a moderate degree of splenomegaly. Peak splenic enlargement occurs within 2 weeks from the time of symptom onset in most cases, but may extend to 3.5 weeks. The rate of splenic enlargement appears to be predictable for an individual who develops IM. Ultrasonographic data further show that splenomegaly associated with acute IM infection resolves within 4–6 weeks of symptom onset in the majority of cases.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^113t6FJT]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

We detail here 3 different methodologies used in this study.

Methodology of the EIMS program and restoration of childhood MS data.

The Swedish EIMS program was established in 2005 with a goal of tracking all identifiable MS cases in Sweden and of gathering specific data on this full population of MS cases. These data include the age at first symptom and the age at diagnosis of IM (if it has occurred) through retrospective questionnaires at the time of diagnosis. Serologic data, including EBNA1 titers, are also taken at diagnosis. Till date, 2,600 cases and 5,200 controls have accrued under this study.

The EIMS program is ongoing, but as of 2013, the study had accumulated 259 IM/MS cases and 1526 total MS cases that we had accessed. The IM/MS subpopulation retrospectively determined MS onset age, and that is always the age reported in this article. The full (IM/non-IM) EIMS population data record diagnostic age only, as it is impractical to determine onset for this larger number. One case in the 259 IM/MS subpopulation showed MS onset before IM, and it was deleted from our study. This deleted case (atypical) was diagnosed for MS and IM at the same age, 44 years, the oldest IM case by 4 years. MS onset, for this case was retrospectively, that is, through recollection at diagnosis (age 44 years) and examination of prior medical records, to have occurred at age 28 years.

### Agranulocytosis occurrence following recent acute infectious mononucleosis [^1128JCxp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis secondary to Epstein-Barr virus typically follows a relatively benign and self-limited course. A small subset of individuals may develop further progression of disease including hematologic, neurologic, and cardiac abnormalities. A mild transient neutropenia occurring during the first weeks of acute infection is a common finding however in rare cases a more profound neutropenia and agranulocytosis may occur up to 6weeks following the onset of initial symptoms. We describe the case of an 18-year-old woman who presented 26days following an acute infectious mononucleosis diagnosis with agranulocytosis and fever. No source of infection was identified and the patient had rapid improvement in her symptoms and resolution of her neutropenia. The presence of fever recurrence and other non-specific symptoms in individuals 2–6weeks following acute infectious mononucleosis symptom onset may warrant further assessment for this uncommon event.

### Cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder complicating infectious mononucleosis in an immunosuppressed patient [^115UHmVs]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is the syndrome produced by primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus during adolescence or early adulthood. In immunosuppressed individuals, depressed T-cell function allows the Epstein-Barr virus-driven B-cell proliferation to continue unabated, potentially leading to a lymphoproliferative disorder. A 15-year-old girl with a history of ulcerative colitis treated with 6-mercaptopurine and mesalamine presented with the acute onset of a rapidly enlarging, ulcerative nodule on her left lower eyelid 4 weeks following recovery from infectious mononucleosis. The biopsy revealed an Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoproliferative disorder. Systemic disease was absent. Following discontinuation of 6-mercaptopurine, the patient was treated with two courses of intravenous cyclophosphamide. The lesion resolved completely and she remains disease free at 14 months following diagnosis. We report a solitary cutaneous lesion of an immunosuppression-related lymphoproliferative disorder (IR-LPD) occurring as a complication of infectious mononucleosis, and review the pathogenesis and reported cases of Epstein-Barr virus-related immunosuppression-related lymphoproliferative disorder arising in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease. It is important for dermatologists and dermatopathologists to be aware of the occurrence of IR-LPD in patients being treated for inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. Given the role of primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus in the development of IR-LPD, consideration may be given to assessing Epstein-Barr virus status prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapy in young patients.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^111npVpZ]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) noncontact activity and shared decision-making — early activity parameters: Previous guidance emphasized refraining from high-intensity activity for the first 3 weeks of illness and absence of splenomegaly, while acknowledging there are no well-designed large clinical trials (SOR Recommendation grade: C). Premature return earlier than 2 to 3 weeks to heavy exertion may prolong symptoms, yet there is support for considering low-level, supervised activity earlier than 3 weeks within an individualized plan. Resumption of light activity assumes avoidance of contact or abdominal trauma, no significant exertion or Valsalva, the athlete is asymptomatic, and progression of noncontact sport-specific activity should then be gradually increased as judged by clinical progress.

### Epstein-Barr virus in the RIVERA case-control study of acute febrile illness: acute mononucleosis nearly absent as an etiology in the Peruvian amazon [^116XhW6s]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The systematic approach to identifying possible primary EBV infections is outlined in Figure 1.

Figure 1.
Systematic approach to clinical interpretations of combined results from qPCR testing for Epstein-Barr viral DNA in whole blood, in plasma, and from anti–EBNA-1 IgG serologies by ELISA. Although traditionally diagnosed by heterophile antibodies, patients with acute symptomatic primary Epstein-Barr virus infection, or infectious mononucleosis (IM), will have not only detectable viral DNA in whole blood (blue) but also detectable cell-free viral DNA in plasma samples (solid fill), as well as no serologic evidence of remote prior infection when testing for immunity to EBNA (yellow), a viral protein only expressed during latency, which takes 5 weeks before an IgG response is consistently present. This allows an iterative approach to excluding IM in febrile patients who initially test positive for EBV DNA in whole blood via PCR (only the solid green category could be consistent with IM), as multiple other clinical scenarios, including the typical lifelong intracellular latency after remote infection, may also result in whole-blood viral detection. EBNA-1 = EBV nuclear antigen type-1; EBV = Epstein-Barr virus; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; qPCR = quantitative PCR.

### Kinetics of Epstein-Barr virus load and virus-specific CD8 + T cells in acute infectious mononucleosis [^114qSsnB]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

During the convalescent phase of acute infectious mononucleosis (AIM), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load shrinks rapidly in association with a rapid decline in the number of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells. The actual contribution of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells in reducing EBV load, however, is not known.

Objectives

To clarify the impact of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells on the contraction of EBV load in AIM, we estimated half-lives of both EBV load and EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells.

Study Design

Blood was serially taken from five pediatric patients with AIM during the convalescent period, including the very early phase, and both EBV load and EBV-specific CD8(+) T cell numbers were assayed.

Results

EBV load declined rapidly (half-life 1.5 d) during the first 2 weeks after onset of symptoms. This half-life was seven-fold shorter than that reported for CD27(+) memory B cells. Subsequently, the EBV load declined much more slowly, with a half-life of 38.7 d. EBV-specific CD8(+) T cell numbers also declined concomitantly with the decrease in EBV load. The half-life of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells during first 2 weeks was 2.9 d. The number of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells and the rate of change of viral load correlated significantly (R(2) ≥ 0.8; p ≤ 0.02).

Conclusions

The short half-life of EBV load, together with the strong correlation between the number of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells and the rate of change of viral load indicates an active role for EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells in elimination of EBV in AIM.

### Systemic type Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative diseases in children and young adults: challenges for pediatric hemato-oncologists and infectious disease specialists [^113hA3YH]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Involvement of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has long been known in the development of various tumor-forming proliferating diseases, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma in adults. However, in children and young adults more attention should be focused on systemic, severe type EBV-related diseases, such as fatal infectious mononucleosis, hemophagocytic syndrome, or chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV). These disorders show the typical clinical features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Although viral infectious diseases are mostly taken care of by infectious disease specialists, pediatric hemato-oncologists need to intervene in the treatment of this kind of disease because of their clonal and neoplastic disease characteristics and of their hematologically problematic, rapid, and life-threatening clinical courses.

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^113uwdWy]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Primary EBV infection in the patient on immunosuppressive therapy — management in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) focuses on holding therapy during acute infectious mononucleosis with close monitoring and serologies. Once acute infectious mononucleosis is diagnosed, one strategy is to hold immunosuppressive therapy and follow for cytopenia and hyperferritinemia at least weekly, and physicians may choose to check antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) to VCA typically disappears within 4 to 6 weeks, IgG to VCA develops in the first few weeks and persists for life, and IgG to EBNA develops within 2 to 4 months and also persists for life; ideally, immunosuppression should be held until IgG VCA/EBNA is positive and the IgM to VCA is undetectable. Patients who develop cytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia should be referred immediately for hospitalization and urgent evaluation for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), with present strategies including plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, etoposide, or calcineurin inhibitors; alternatively, if clinically recovered and IBD symptoms recur, EBV polymerase chain reaction can be checked and, if the copy number is low, it is reasonable to resume IBD therapy.

### Common questions about infectious mononucleosis [^114sMgCX]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr is a ubiquitous virus that infects 95% of the world population at some point in life. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections are often asymptomatic, some patients present with the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis (IM). The syndrome most commonly occurs between 15 and 24 years of age. It should be suspected in patients presenting with sore throat, fever, tonsillar enlargement, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal inflammation, and palatal petechiae. A heterophile antibody test is the best initial test for diagnosis of EBV infection, with 71% to 90% accuracy for diagnosing IM. However, the test has a 25% false-negative rate in the first week of illness. IM is unlikely if the lymphocyte count is less than 4,000 mm3. The presence of EBV-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies confirms infection, but the test is more costly and results take longer than the heterophile antibody test. Symptomatic relief is the mainstay of treatment. Glucocorticoids and antivirals do not reduce the length or severity of illness. Splenic rupture is an uncommon complication of IM. Because physical activity within the first three weeks of illness may increase the risk of splenic rupture, athletic participation is not recommended during this time. Children are at the highest risk of airway obstruction, which is the most common cause of hospitalization from IM. Patients with immunosuppression are more likely to have fulminant EBV infection.

### Severe ulcerative oesophagitis caused by primary Epstein-Barr virus infection in an immunocompetent individual [^117XF3kN]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects > 90% of the human population worldwide and with a variety of manifestations, notably infectious mononucleosis characterised by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatomegaly, and/or splenomegaly. After the primary infection, EBV is present lifelong as latent infection in B lymphocytes, but reactivation is rare — and if so typically due to immune impairment. Reactivation of EBV is a known, but rare, cause of infectious oesophagitis in immunosuppressed patients. In immunocompetent patients, however, primary EBV oesophagitis has only anecdotally been described.
