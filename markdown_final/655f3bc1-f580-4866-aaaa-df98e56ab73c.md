## Question

What are symptoms to look out for

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which symptoms to look out for and how to interpret them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of a symptom and how it differs from a sign. Then, I should categorize symptoms by urgency and risk, including red flags, alarm symptoms, and non-specific symptoms. Next, I will examine symptom clusters and temporal patterns that raise suspicion. After that, I should integrate patient-specific modifiers such as age, sex, smoking, and comorbidities. Finally, I will translate this into practical actions, including when to seek urgent care, what to document, and how to follow up safely, while acknowledging uncertainties and the role of clinical judgment [^722cddcf] [^c274cc8a].

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't conflate terms. A symptom is something the patient experiences and reports, such as pain, fatigue, or nausea, whereas a sign is something observable by a clinician, like jaundice or a mass; this distinction matters because symptoms require self-report and are inherently subjective, which shapes both assessment and triage decisions [^d8fd725b] [^722cddcf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "red flags" without anchoring them to evidence. I should categorize symptoms by risk and urgency: red flags that warrant immediate evaluation (for example, hemoptysis, new focal neurologic deficits, or severe chest pain), alarm symptoms that justify urgent investigation even if the absolute cancer risk is modest (such as unexplained weight loss, persistent change in bowel habits, or iron-deficiency anemia), and non-specific symptoms that still merit attention when persistent or progressive (like fatigue, abdominal pain, or cough without clear etiology) [^c274cc8a] [^900de62e] [^fc1c4faa].

> Wait, let me verify the cancer-specific thresholds so I don't overstate them. In UK practice, a 3% positive predictive value for cancer is commonly used to trigger urgent investigation; importantly, many so-called alarm symptoms have PPVs below 5% in general practice, yet patients may still harbor significant overall cancer risk across sites, which is why non-specific symptom pathways and broader risk stratification are increasingly emphasized [^fc1c4faa] [^c40782c6].

> I need to check which symptom clusters and temporal patterns consistently raise suspicion across diseases. Multiple concurrent symptoms, especially when new or progressive, should heighten concern; for example, weight loss plus fatigue, or abdominal pain with altered bowel habits, carry more weight than isolated complaints, and the evolution of symptoms over weeks to months can be as informative as their presence at a single time point [^722cddcf] [^ec0b392a].

> Let me consider organ-system exemplars to make this concrete. For colorectal cancer, hematochezia, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits are common, yet many patients present with non-specific symptoms; early-onset colorectal cancer often shows rectal bleeding and abdominal pain, and delays of 4–6 months from presentation to diagnosis are not rare, so persistent symptoms without a benign explanation deserve timely evaluation [^a49186de] [^293fe722]. For lung cancer, persistent cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, and weight loss are key, and dyspnea itself is a potent prognostic marker that warrants systematic assessment and cause-directed management when possible [^f1531661]. For pancreatic cancer, jaundice is a classic but relatively late or infrequent initial symptom; upper GI symptoms, back pain, new-onset diabetes, and systemic features like weight loss or fatigue are more common early signals that should prompt low-threshold imaging and concurrent evaluation rather than sequential watchful waiting [^ec0b392a].

> But wait, what if the symptom is non-specific and the patient is young and healthy; should I still investigate? I should double-check patient-specific modifiers because they shift pretest probabilities. Age, sex, and smoking status materially alter cancer risk and should be integrated into decisions; for example, unexplained weight loss or iron-deficiency anemia carries higher risk in older adults and smokers, and early-onset colorectal cancer is a reminder not to dismiss red flags in younger patients either [^fc1c4faa] [^a49186de]. Comorbidities and medications also matter; immunosuppression, anticoagulation, or drugs like mycophenolate can change the likelihood and severity of infections, bleeding, or malignancy, so I need to ask about these explicitly [^97ca9042].

> Next, I should review how to translate this into action. For red flags, seek urgent care within 24–48 hours; for alarm symptoms, arrange evaluation within 2 weeks in systems with urgent referral pathways; for persistent non-specific symptoms, document a timeline, red flags, and risk factors, and arrange follow-up within 2–4 weeks to reassess trajectory rather than defaulting to watchful waiting indefinitely [^fc1c4faa] [^722cddcf]. I need to ensure I capture symptom onset, duration, severity, interference with function, associated features, and prior evaluations, because history and exam alone drive most diagnostic inferences in primary care and guide the need for testing [^722cddcf].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of "gut feeling" and system-level pathways so I don't overpromise on guidelines. Clinician intuition can identify patients at risk who do not meet formal red-flag criteria, and non-specific symptom pathways in the UK and Denmark have shown meaningful diagnostic yields for cancer and serious disease; conversely, adherence to referral guidance remains imperfect, and both under- and over-referral occur, underscoring the need for balanced, risk-stratified approaches and clear safety-netting plans [^085543af] [^326f871c].

> I will now examine special contexts briefly to ensure completeness. In mechanically ventilated patients, symptom assessment requires adapted, observational tools because self-report is limited; routine, structured assessment of pain, dyspnea, anxiety, and sleep disturbance is recommended to close the gap in detection and management [^1e70effd]. In kidney failure, symptom burden is high and multifactorial, so I should anticipate overlapping etiologies and coordinate multidisciplinary symptom management rather than attributing complaints solely to uremia or dialysis [^f27b10a7]. In COVID-19, symptoms are heterogeneous and evolve over time; persistent or severe dyspnea, chest pain, confusion, or bluish discoloration are emergency warning signs that warrant immediate care, and symptom-based screening alone has limited diagnostic accuracy for infection, reinforcing the need for testing and clinical correlation [^74d54c30] [^8172686c].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that most symptoms have a clear disease explanation; I should correct that. A substantial fraction of common symptoms in primary care remain unexplained after initial evaluation, yet serious causes rarely emerge later if red flags are absent and the patient improves; this supports careful follow-up, shared decision-making about testing, and attention to biopsychosocial contributors rather than reflexive over-investigation [^722cddcf].

> Let me reconsider the practical takeaway to ensure it's actionable. Symptoms to look out for are those that are new, persistent, progressive, or interfere with function, especially when they cluster or evolve; prioritize red flags for immediate care, alarm symptoms for urgent evaluation, and non-specific but persistent symptoms for timely reassessment; always interpret in the context of age, sex, smoking, comorbidities, and medications; and communicate a clear follow-up plan with explicit return precautions so that deterioration triggers prompt action rather than delay [^fc1c4faa] [^722cddcf] [^c274cc8a].

Look out for **red flag symptoms** that signal serious disease and require urgent evaluation [^c274cc8a]. These include **unexplained weight loss**, **persistent fever**, **night sweats**, **blood in stool or urine**, **chest pain**, **severe headache**, **sudden visual changes**, **difficulty breathing**, **confusion**, and **new or changing lumps**. Also watch for **persistent or worsening symptoms** such as cough, abdominal pain, or fatigue, especially if they last more than two weeks or interfere with daily activities [^722cddcf]. Seek immediate care for **sudden severe pain**, **loss of consciousness**, **severe allergic reactions**, or **signs of stroke** (FAST: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911). Early recognition and prompt action improve outcomes [^aa9eb31b].

---

## General red flag symptoms

These symptoms are **strongly associated with serious underlying conditions** and warrant immediate medical evaluation:

- **Unexplained weight loss**: Rapid, unintentional weight loss (> 5% of body weight in 6 months) can indicate cancer, chronic infection, or metabolic disease [^c40782c6].

- **Persistent fever**: Fever lasting > 1 week without a clear source may suggest infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease.

- **Night sweats**: Profuse sweating at night, especially with fever or weight loss, can signal lymphoma or other serious illness.

- **Fatigue**: Persistent, unexplained fatigue lasting > 2 weeks may indicate anemia, malignancy, or chronic disease [^722cddcf].

- **Blood in stool or urine**: Hematochezia, melena, or hematuria can indicate gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding and require urgent evaluation [^a49186de].

- **Chest pain**: Sudden, severe, or persistent chest pain may indicate myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or other life-threatening conditions.

- **Severe headache**: Sudden, severe headache ("worst headache of my life") may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis.

- **Sudden visual changes**: Loss of vision, double vision, or visual field defects may indicate stroke, optic neuritis, or acute glaucoma.

- **Difficulty breathing**: Acute dyspnea or worsening chronic shortness of breath may indicate asthma exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, or heart failure [^f1531661].

- **Confusion or altered mental status**: Sudden confusion, disorientation, or loss of consciousness may indicate stroke, hypoglycemia, or sepsis.

- **New or changing lumps**: Any new, rapidly growing, or changing lump should be evaluated for malignancy [^fc1c4faa].

## Organ-specific symptoms

Certain symptoms are **specific to particular organ systems** and should prompt targeted evaluation:

| **Organ system** | **Symptoms to look out for** |
|-|-|
| Cardiovascular | - Chest pain <br/> - Palpitations <br/> - Syncope <br/> - Edema <br/> - Hypertension [^notfound] |
| Respiratory | - Persistent cough <br/> - Hemoptysis <br/> - Wheezing <br/> - Pleuritic pain <br/> - Recurrent infections [^85e628c4] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Dysphagia <br/> - Persistent nausea/vomiting <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Jaundice <br/> - Change in bowel habits <br/> - Rectal bleeding [^a49186de] |
| Genitourinary | - Hematuria <br/> - Dysuria <br/> - Frequency/urgency <br/> - Flank pain <br/> - Testicular swelling <br/> - Vaginal bleeding [^notfound] |
| Neurological | - Seizures <br/> - Weakness <br/> - Numbness <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Speech difficulties <br/> - Memory loss [^notfound] |
| Musculoskeletal | - Persistent joint pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Deformity <br/> - Limited range of motion <br/> - Back pain with neurological symptoms [^notfound] |
| Dermatological | - New or changing moles <br/> - Non-healing ulcers <br/> - Rapidly growing lesions <br/> - Severe pruritus [^9b8137f7] |

## Symptoms requiring immediate emergency care

Certain symptoms **require immediate emergency care**:

- **Severe chest pain**: Suspected myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism.

- **Sudden severe headache**: Suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis.

- **Loss of consciousness**: Suspected stroke, seizure, or syncope.

- **Severe allergic reaction**: Anaphylaxis with airway compromise.

- **Severe trauma**: Head injury, major fractures, or significant bleeding.

- **Signs of stroke**: FAST symptoms (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911).

---

## Symptoms in special populations

Certain populations require **heightened vigilance**:

- **Pediatric patients**: Fever in infants < 3 months, lethargy, poor feeding, respiratory distress, and signs of dehydration.

- **Elderly patients**: Delirium, falls, functional decline, and atypical presentations of common diseases.

- **Pregnant patients**: Severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, decreased fetal movement, and severe hypertension.

---

## Conclusion

Recognizing and acting on **red flag symptoms** is essential for early diagnosis and improved outcomes. Persistent or worsening symptoms — especially when accompanied by systemic features such as weight loss, fever, or fatigue — warrant prompt medical evaluation [^722cddcf]. Immediate emergency care is indicated for severe, sudden-onset, or life-threatening symptoms.

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^20e3ac8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease ? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### Which patients with symptoms should be referred urgently for investigation of suspected cancer? [^fc1c4faa]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Although asymptomatic screening has changed the way in which a few cancers are diagnosed, most patients diagnosed with cancer still present with symptoms. In the UK and many other countries, such as Denmark and Australia, most of these patients present in primary care. This poses a difficult question to the primary care physician who must try to tease out which patients with a particular symptom should be further investigated for serious underlying causes, including cancer. In the UK, there have been attempts to support those making these decisions, not least the introduction of national guidance on who should be referred for urgent investigation for cancer.Although this guidance has been shown to have had an impact on improving cancer outcomes for patients presenting with symptoms in primary care, there is still a long way to go to reach the National Health Service long-term plan goal of diagnosing 75% of cancers at an early stage by 2028.Changes to guidance and referral practices could play an important role in achieving this target.

One of the key limitations of current guidance is the lack of stratification of risk, even by basic measures such as age, sex and smoking status. The article by Barclay et al attempts to address this issue by providing a comprehensive evaluation of two key outcomes in a UK based cohort; cancer (at any site) or non-cancer death of patients presenting with one of 15 key symptoms in primary care.They report these outcomes, stratified by age, sex and smoking status and compare them to the outcomes for a representative sample of patients not selected for symptomatic presentation.

The current threshold for referral for urgent investigation is that a symptom should have a positive predictive value of 3% or more for a diagnosis of cancer at a specific site for referral to take place. One of the main findings in Barclay et al is that while for some symptoms patients do not exceed the current threshold for referral for individual cancer sites, a symptomatic patient’s overall risk of having an undiagnosed cancer at any site exceeds 3% at a much earlier age than might have been expected.This has implications for referral practices, which are generally focused on individual sites rather than overall risk associated with symptoms. In recent years, non-specific symptom pathways have been introduced which have begun to address this issue with some success; however, findings from this paper suggest there may be scope to extend their reach into symptoms such as abdominal pain that have traditionally been siloed into individual cancer site referrals.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: a narrative review [^722cddcf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without "normalizing" the symptom.

### What prompts help-seeking for cancer' alarm' symptoms? A primary care based survey [^2d8032df]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Who was most likely to seek help?

Controlling for symptom type, symptom characteristics and other demographic factors, people not working (OR 1.41, 1.09–1.83), aged 60–69 years vs 50–59 years (OR 1.33, 1.02–1.75) and married/cohabiting (OR 1.38, 1.10–1.74) were more likely to seek help across symptoms. Education (1.03, 0.82–1.30), sex (OR 1.16, 0.92–1.45) and ethnicity (OR 0.81, 0.57–1.15) were not associated with help-seeking in multivariate analysis.

### What prompts help-seeking for cancer' alarm' symptoms? A primary care based survey [^9c24e989]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence from symptom studies in primary care suggests that although demographic differences in help-seeking emerge (e.g. women were more likely to consult than men), the characteristics of the symptom itself (e.g. severity and interference with daily life) have the biggest influence on help-seeking. Nonetheless, generic symptom surveys in primary care may provide only limited information on how people respond to potential cancer symptoms, partly because the timeframe people report about is often short (e.g. 2 weeks).

More recently, a strand of research has started to explore people's real-life experience of cancer ‘alarm' symptoms, without imposing the word ‘cancer'. This strategy involves asking people about their general health with questions on cancer symptoms embedded among others. Using this approach, the prevalence of the 10 classic cancer ‘alarm' symptoms from the CAM is extremely high (53% of people report at least one ‘alarm' symptom in the past 3 months), and just over half of people reporting an ‘alarm' symptom had seen a doctor. In qualitative interviews with a subset of people reporting alarm symptoms (n =48), perceiving the symptom as serious was a main reason for help-seeking. However, to date there has not been a quantitative exploration of factors associated with help-seeking in this context.

### What prompts help-seeking for cancer' alarm' symptoms? A primary care based survey [^a8a1d5d6]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Background:

Encouraging prompt help-seeking for cancer symptoms can help shorten the patient interval and improve timely diagnosis. We explored factors associated with help-seeking in a primary care sample reporting ‘alarm' symptoms.

Methods:

A questionnaire was mailed to 9771 adults (⩾50 years of age and no cancer diagnosis) and 3766 (39%) returned it. Our sample included 1732 adults reporting at least one cancer ‘alarm' symptom; with a total of 2726 symptoms. Respondents completed questions relating to help-seeking, demographic and symptom characteristics (e.g. type, knowledge, concern, interference and attribution).

Results:

Over a third of people who reported a cancer ‘alarm' symptom in the past 3 months had not sought help from a doctor. An unexplained lump (odds ratio (OR) 2.46, 1.42–4.26) and persistent unexplained pain (OR 1.79, 1.19–2.69) were associated with increased likelihood of help-seeking. Symptom concern (OR 3.10, 2.19–4.39) and interference (OR 3.06, 2.15–4.36) were associated with an increased likelihood of seeking help independently of symptom type. People who were not working (OR 1.41, 1.09–1.83), were married/cohabiting rather than single (OR 1.38, 1.10–1.74) and were older (60–69 years) rather than younger (50–59 years; OR 1.33, 1.02–1.75) were more likely to have sought help.

Conclusions:

Our findings highlighted symptom type and symptom characteristics as key drivers of help-seeking. We also found that there may be specific demographic groups where encouraging help-seeking might be warranted.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^9b8137f7]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF skin cancer screening recommendation—adolescents and adults without signs or symptoms: For adolescents and adults who do not have signs or symptoms of skin cancer, the USPSTF found the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer (Grade: I statement). This recommendation applies to adolescents and adults who do not have signs or symptoms of skin cancer, does not apply to persons with a personal or family history of skin cancer, and does not apply to persons with symptoms, such as changes in size, shape, or color of skin growths or irregular moles. Implementation notes state there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for skin cancer in adolescents and adults and that clinicians should use their judgment when deciding whether to screen for skin cancer. This recommendation is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^4159bf7b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society statement—research priorities for dyspnea emphasize therapeutics development, validated outcome measures, and interdisciplinary science: we recommend that research be directed to the development and testing of therapies specifically aimed at underlying mechanisms of dyspnea, with funding for large-scale, multiinstitutional investigations; there are far more instruments for measuring dyspnea than interventions, and there is a pressing need for one or more outcomes measures to be adequately validated as patient-reported outcomes for use as endpoints in clinical trials; when new measures are proposed, investigators should provide a clear justification of what aspect of dyspnea or which patient population is better assessed; further research is needed in neuromodulation, neuroimaging, and central processing of dyspneic sensations and associated unpleasantness and affective distress; there is a need for interdisciplinary approaches to accelerate translation into clinical practice, and we encourage increased communication and collaboration between medical and palliative care specialists and across specialties and disciplines.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^46dc3374]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

When should I investigate for cancer in a patient with VTE?

One in 20 patients who present with VTE is diagnosed with cancer within 12 months.The multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled ‘screening for occult malignancy in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism’ trial found that routine screening with CT scans of patients with a first unprovoked VTE did not result in a significant improvement in time to cancer diagnosis or cancer-related mortality versus limited occult cancer screening.Therefore, the updated 2020 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the management of VTE do not recommend routine screening of cancer in patients with an unprovoked VTE.The decision on whether to investigate for cancer should be based on physical examination and medical history of symptoms, as described in the 2015 NICE guidelines for recognition and referral of suspected cancer.An interactive cancer screening tool is available from NICE.Age-specific and gender-specific testing (eg, mammography, cervical smear and prostate specific antigen testing) should be implemented in accordance with national guidelines and local practice. During follow-up after acute PE, the threshold to suspect cancer should be low in patients with a relatively recent history of cured cancer (eg, within 5 years, as VTE can be a sign of recurrent cancer), early VTE progression/recurrence despite anticoagulant treatment and anticoagulant-related bleeding shortly after start of treatment (particularly gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria).

When should I test for thrombophilia?

Thrombophilia is defined as the increased tendency to form blood clots and there are heritable and acquired forms. Genetic causes of heritable thrombophilia include Factor V Leiden/prothrombin gene mutations, antithrombin deficiency and protein C and S deficiency.Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most common form of acquired thrombophilia.

### Symptom assessment in cancer patients [^b7f29a57]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with cancer suffer from a multitude of symptoms. Effective treatment strategies are available for a number of the common symptoms. A major reason for inadequate symptom relief is lack of effective symptom assessment. Accurate assessment of symptoms is necessary before any treatment can be undertaken. Although there are many complexities involved in the assessment of symptoms, simple, effective tools are available for identification and scoring of symptoms in clinical practice. This review describes recent advances in the study of symptom assessment in cancer patients. Several common symptoms are presented individually, followed by an overview of efforts addressing the assessment of multiple symptoms. Also, new tools in the evaluation of symptoms, including computer-based questionnaires, are discussed.

### Symptom assessment for mechanically ventilated patients: principles and priorities: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1e70effd]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop report—symptom assessment in mechanically ventilated adults emphasizes that mechanically ventilated patients experience many adverse symptoms and outlines the workshop’s evidence and consensus regarding 1) symptoms that should be considered for routine assessment of adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation; 2) key symptom assessment principles; 3) strategies that support symptom assessment in nonvocal patients; and 4) areas for future clinical practice development and research. Systematic patient-centered assessment of multiple symptoms has great potential to minimize patient distress and improve the patient experience, and a culture shift is necessary to promote ongoing holistic symptom assessment with valid and reliable instruments.

Symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) causes substantial physical and psychosocial disability. This article delineates the characteristic symptoms and signs associated with OA and how they can be used to make the clinical diagnosis. The predominant symptom in most patients is pain. The remainder of the article focuses on what is known about the causes of pain in OA and factors that contribute to its severity. Much has been learned during recent years, but much of this puzzle remains unexplored or inadequately understood.

### What prompts help-seeking for cancer' alarm' symptoms? A primary care based survey [^4026be45]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

In the past, there was concern that asking people about ‘alarm' symptoms without following them up would be unethical. However, only asking people about the experience of ‘alarm' symptoms once they are definitively linked with cancer is associated with retrospective bias, and asking about hypothetical symptoms may provide limited information on how people actually behave. The low predictive value of the ‘alarm' symptoms we included (;), in combination with a general recommendation to contact the GP if symptoms persist, meant we have been able to conduct surveys comparable to generic symptom surveys to explore how people respond to ‘alarm' symptoms in the daily context. Although for the majority of people their symptom probably indicates a benign condition, there is a possibility that the symptom is a sign of cancer, and making the decision to seek help earlier is likely to result in more positive patient outcomes (;).

Our study asked about symptoms in the past 3 months and we do not know the exact length of the patient interval, or if the symptom was new or recurrent. On one hand, using a dichotomous variable for help-seeking (yes/no) is advantageous because it did not require people to recall dates, which is known to be difficult, but is a limitation when comparing our findings to previous research. There is also growing evidence that the experience of ‘false alarms' (i.e. going to a GP with a symptom and being given a benign diagnosis) impacts on subsequent help-seeking and it may be important for future research to distinguish between new or recurrent symptoms.

Another weakness of the study is that we do not have data on the symptom experience of non-responders, a problem inherent in epidemiological research. However, our sample was generally representative of people aged 50 years older living in England, according to sex, marital status, employment and ethnicity. As might be expected, there were more people with a degree in our study (39%) than in the general population (23%), a finding that reflects that people from more deprived backgrounds were less likely to return the survey. We also had very low numbers of people from non-white ethnic groups, which means we cannot generalise to people of non-white origin. We may need to find alternative approaches for exploring symptom experiences in hard-to-reach or minority groups.

### Estimating the efficacy of symptom-based screening for COVID-19 [^50be509d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is substantial interest in developing symptom-based screening to prioritize who should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and to establish symptom-based surveillance to provide an early indicator of new COVID-19 cases –. However, the degree to which presenting symptoms are reliable indicators of SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether symptom-based screening to prioritize testing is feasible. To assess the feasibility of using symptom-based screening to assign a probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first quantified the ability to correctly predict results of tests for common respiratory viruses observed to frequently co-infect patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 at Stanford Health Care, using symptoms mentioned in clinical notes at the time of the test order. After establishing a baseline for the performance of machine learning models to correctly classify common respiratory virus infections, we then trained a similar model for SARS-CoV-2 test results.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^bd375eb1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea—definition and assessment: Dyspnea is a perceptual symptom that must be self-reported and differentiated from observable signs. The statement emphasizes that “dyspnea per se can only be perceived by the person experiencing it,” explains that “Perception entails conscious recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli and their meaning,” and concludes, “Therefore, as is the case with pain, adequate assessment of dyspnea depends on self-report.” It further clarifies, “Because dyspnea is a symptom (i.e., perception of an abnormal or distressing internal state), it must generally be distinguished from signs that clinicians typically invoke as evidence of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and intercostal retractions,” and that “Distinctive sensory qualities are important in considering the physiological mechanisms underlying the breathing discomfort, but the definition of dyspnea should be neutral with respect to any particular quality.”

### Presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis: evidence from a cross-sectional, population-based study [^013163cb]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Furthermore, evaluation of the effect of single and multiple symptoms separately indicates that the presence of multiple symptoms is a poor predictor of stage IV disease. The nature of the symptom appears to be more important than the number of reported symptoms. This observation is reassuring, given that public health education campaigns typically do not focus on symptom combinations.

Symptom awareness and appraisal by patients and doctors is an important determinant of timely presentation and investigation,,,but the optimal design of early diagnosis interventions aimed at earlier recognition of possible cancer symptoms by members of the public and health-care professionals remains unclear. Alongside considerations such as cancer site incidence, psychosocial barriers to presentation, and the predictive value of symptoms, evidence about the associations between presenting symptoms and stage at diagnosis can help to guide the design of early diagnosis interventions. Our findings provide support for such interventions, and counter concerns that they simply expedite the detection of advanced-stage disease.

### Estimating the efficacy of symptom-based screening for COVID-19 [^e0299b8c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There is substantial interest in using presenting symptoms to prioritize testing for COVID-19 and establish symptom-based surveillance. However, little is currently known about the specificity of COVID-19 symptoms. To assess the feasibility of symptom-based screening for COVID-19, we used data from tests for common respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in our health system to measure the ability to correctly classify virus test results based on presenting symptoms. Based on these results, symptom-based screening may not be an effective strategy to identify individuals who should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection or to obtain a leading indicator of new COVID-19 cases.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^8172686c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic tests including signs and symptoms to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to present research questions and settings, in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

### Are multiple physical symptoms a poor prognostic factor or just a marker of depression severity? Secondary analysis of the genPod trial [^87683c76]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

6 Conclusions

Multiple baseline physical symptoms appear to predict poor response to antidepressants, but not after adjustment for depression severity. Multiple physical symptoms may represent severe depression rather than a poor prognostic factor. Clinicians should ask about mood symptoms and explore psychosocial issues in patients with multiple physical symptoms. If considering a diagnosis of depression in someone with multiple physical symptoms, clinicians should treat it as a moderate to severe depression. This is essential in order to avoid inappropriate investigation and treatment of physical symptoms, which could lead to iatrogenic harm. Reboxetine does not confer any advantage over citalopram in this group, and it is less well tolerated. Since there is no evidence that physical symptoms are a moderator of treatment in patients with multiple physical symptoms when a clinician chooses an antidepressant they should take account of the side effect profile, rather than depend on physical symptoms.

### The presenting symptom signatures of incident cancer: evidence from the english 2018 national cancer diagnosis audit [^61cbc335]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The study provides a detailed understanding of bidirectional relationships between presenting symptoms and cancer sites among incident cases, enabling research examining associations between symptomatic presentations and diagnostic process measures. Future clinical practice recommendations for specialist referral ought to encompass a broader range of cancer sites per symptom. The design of symptom awareness campaigns can be appropriately guided regarding choice of target symptoms, and diagnostic strategies can be suitably informed.

Gap in symptom assessment tools—current approaches to symptom assessment among mechanically ventilated (MV) patients "are limited to a few symptoms but fail to capture the entire spectrum of symptoms" and "much of symptom assessment research among mechanically ventilated patients has used tools validated in other populations." Because MV patients "are often impaired or unable (e.g., comatose) to report symptoms," alternative observational measures are described as "a necessary yet underdeveloped area of research," with a downstream "gap in the documentation of symptoms and communication among team members." A "feasible yet efficient system that incorporates standard symptom language and broad symptom assessment is needed."

### Improving early diagnosis of symptomatic cancer [^aa9eb31b]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Much time, effort and investment goes into the diagnosis of symptomatic cancer, with the expectation that this approach brings clinical benefits. This investment of resources has been particularly noticeable in the UK, which has, for several years, appeared near the bottom of international league tables for cancer survival in economically developed countries. In this Review, we examine expedited diagnosis of cancer from four perspectives. The first relates to the potential for clinical benefits of expedited diagnosis of symptomatic cancer. Limited evidence from clinical trials is available, but the considerable observational evidence suggests benefits can be obtained from this approach. The second perspective considers how expedited diagnosis can be achieved. We concentrate on data from the UK, where extensive awareness campaigns have been conducted, and initiatives in the primary-care setting, including clinical decision support, have all occurred during a period of considerable national policy change. The third section considers the most appropriate patients for cancer investigations, and the possible community settings for identification of such patients; UK national guidance for selection of patients for investigation is discussed. Finally, the health economics of expedited diagnosis are reviewed, although few studies provide definitive evidence on this topic.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^f1531661]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea—executive summary epidemiology and prognosis reports that dyspnea is common in both inpatient and ambulatory settings, is strongly prognostic, and that addressing the underlying cause is the preferred management approach. Dyspnea “affects up to 50% of patients admitted to acute, tertiary care hospitals and a quarter of patients seeking care in ambulatory settings,” and “The presence of dyspnea is a potent predictor of mortality, often surpassing common physiological measurements in predicting the clinical course of a patient.” The statement adds, “Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of dyspnea is the preferred and most direct approach to ameliorating this symptom, but there are many patients for whom the cause is unclear or for whom dyspnea persists despite optimal treatment.”

### What prompts help-seeking for cancer' alarm' symptoms? A primary care based survey [^4a74c8df]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Another relatively unexplored issue is whether some symptoms are more likely to trigger help-seeking than others. Data from nearly 2000 cancer patients completing the Department of Health's Cancer Patient Experience Survey demonstrated that change in bladder or bowel habits and unexplained weight loss were associated with longer delay in presentation, while a lump was responded to more rapidly. However, evidence from cancer patients only includes those who sought help and were subsequently diagnosed with cancer, and does not give us insight into those currently interpreting ‘alarm' symptoms.

In the present study, we used data pooled from two large primary care based surveys to explore symptom-related correlates of help-seeking for 10 classic ‘alarm' symptoms in the daily context. Following previous research, we hypothesised the following:

Well-known red-flag symptoms such as an ‘unexplained lump' would be associated with higher levels of help-seeking compared with other symptoms such as ‘persistent change in bladder habits'.
Symptoms that were considered concerning, interfering or associated with cancer would be associated with higher levels of help-seeking than those not considered concerning, interfering or associated with cancer.
Certain demographic sub-groups (e.g. people not working) would be more likely to seek help for their symptoms.

Domain 2: Physical Aspects of Care—Guideline 2.3 Treatment—Interdisciplinary care plans to address physical symptoms, maximize functional status, and enhance quality of life are developed in the context of the patient’s goals of care, disease, prognosis, functional limitations, culture, and care setting. An essential component of palliative care is ongoing management of physical symptoms, anticipating changes in health status, and monitoring of potential risk factors associated with the disease and side effects due to treatment regimens. The IDT encourages and facilitates active involvement of patients and caregivers in developing the plan of care and managing physical symptoms, and patients and families are encouraged and given frequent opportunities to ask questions, seek support, and communicate changes in status including worsening symptoms and treatment-associated side effects. Treatment of distressing symptoms and side effects are evidence-based and include the spectrum of pharmacological, interventional, behavioral, and complementary therapies or interventions, and the need for and effectiveness of a bowel regimen is regularly assessed whenever opioids are prescribed.

### Recognition of cancer warning signs and anticipated delay in help-seeking in a population sample of adults in the UK [^30dadfd7]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Anticipated time to help-seeking for target symptoms

Help-seeking items from the ABC assessed anticipated delay for symptoms that could be indicative of each of the three target cancers: (i) persistent cough, (ii) rectal bleeding, and (iii) breast changes. The interview instructions were: ‘I'm going to read you out a list of signs and symptoms; for each one can you tell me how long it would take you to go to the doctor from the time you first noticed the symptom'. Responses were categorised by the interviewer into predefined time intervals (as soon as I noticed, up to 1 week, 1–2 weeks, 2–3 weeks, 3–4 weeks, more than a month, and I would not contact a doctor). Responses indicating help-seeking from another health professional (e.g. nurse and pharmacist) were excluded from the analyses (persistent cough: n =254; rectal bleeding: n =70; breast changes: n =59). The primary analyses used a dichotomous anticipated help-seeking variable (⩽2 weeks vs >2 weeks) as used in previous analyses. Analyses were repeated using >4 weeks as a cutoff in a sensitivity analysis.

Recognition of cancer warning signs

Recognition of the three warning signs most closely related to the target symptoms were used in this analysis: (i) persistent cough or hoarseness, (ii) unexplained bleeding, and (iii) unexplained lump or swelling. The interview instructions were: ‘I'm now going to list some symptoms that may or may not be warning signs for cancer. For each one can you tell me whether you think it could be a warning sign for cancer'. The order was rotated and answers were recorded as yes, no, don't know, and refused. For the present analysis, ‘don't know' responses were combined with ‘no', and ‘refused' was coded as missing.

### The presenting symptom signatures of incident cancer: evidence from the english 2018 national cancer diagnosis audit [^deca2423]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most cancer patients are diagnosed after the onset of symptoms relating to their disease. In the UK, more than 90% of all cancer patients are diagnosed symptomatically ; the similar figure in the US is likely to exceed 80%. Despite ongoing improvements in diagnostic technologies to support asymptomatic cancer detection through screening, most patients are expected to continue to be diagnosed symptomatically in the forthcoming decade. Therefore, among other cancer control strategies, several interventions aimed to advance help-seeking (through raising awareness of possible cancer symptoms among members of the public), and prompt diagnostic investigation or referral of patients presenting with symptoms raising the suspicion of cancer, have been instigated [,–]. However, clinical guidelines supporting referrals currently chiefly relate to specific cancer sites, although many symptoms (particularly vague/non-organ specific ones) relate to a range of different cancers. In England, multi-specialty diagnostic centres have been developed to assess patients with vague/non-organ specific symptoms, but optimal investigation strategies, either pre-referral and within primary care, or post-referral are unclear. Decisions on choice of target symptoms in public awareness campaigns have traditionally been made based on clinical consensus about associations of a given symptom with different cancers. Attaining such evidence can help to improve the design and evaluation strategies for both symptom awareness campaigns, and clinical practice recommendations for use of primary care investigations or referrals. Information from common blood tests can support the diagnostic process in primary care, but such tests are used in fewer than half of all cancer patients, with large variation by presenting symptoms and cancer site. For these reasons, a fuller understanding of the bidirectional relationships between presenting symptoms and cancer sites is needed.

Against this background, we aimed to first examine the relative frequency of presenting symptoms by cancer site (the ‘symptom signature’ of each cancer site), and second to examine the relative frequency of cancer sites by presenting symptom (the ‘cancer site case-mix’ of each symptom), among incident cancer cases.

Initial evaluation scope and core questions in suspected or known lung cancer focuses on patients who present with a relatively high probability of cancer and does not necessarily apply to patients with a very low probability of cancer, such as those identified with a lung nodule during CT screening. On the basis of this framework, the initial evaluation must provide information with regard to three basic questions: (1) What is the extent of disease, and is there evidence of metastases? (2) Are there comorbidities (ie, COPD) present that might limit treatment options? (3) Are there symptoms or paraneoplastic syndromes present that need to be identified and treated early?

### Red flag signs and symptoms for patients with early-onset colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a49186de]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), what are the most common presenting signs and symptoms, what is their association with EOCRC risk, and what is the time from presentation to diagnosis?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis including 81 studies and more than 24.9 million patients, nearly half of individuals with EOCRC presented with hematochezia and abdominal pain and one-quarter presented with altered bowel habits. Delays in diagnosis of 4 to 6 months from time of initial presentation were common.

Meaning

These findings underscore the need to identify signs and symptoms concerning for EOCRC and complete timely diagnostic workup for individuals without an alternative diagnosis or sign or symptom resolution.

### Alarm symptoms and identification of non-cancer diagnoses in primary care: cohort study [^900de62e]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

We believe that these data provide additional information to help clinicians manage patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of serious disease. In general terms they support the notion of alarm symptoms, which, because they possess reasonable predictive value for serious disease, should stimulate urgent intervention, notwithstanding the fact that the diagnoses made most often tend to be the least serious. We have, in conducting the study, extended the concept of “alarm symptoms” to include important non-cancer diagnoses, emphasising that these symptoms are not only red flags for malignancy but also “yellow flags” that should prompt clinicians to conduct investigations or intervene therapeutically in these benign but potentially serious disorders. For many of these patients the test of time should probably be replaced by a “timely test,” although the interpretation of our data, in terms of the need for exhaustive investigation, is likely to vary according to the resources available in different healthcare systems. Further research in the primary care setting, using both large databases and prospective clinical cohorts, is required to better define symptom combinations and other clinical features that represent the most important targets for investigation and treatment to optimise the use of scarce resources and to minimise overinvestigation and unnecessary treatment. Because some of the conditions, such as respiratory and urinary tract infections and haemorrhoids, are common in the general population, further research is required to evaluate the occurrence of these diagnoses in controls with alarm symptoms. This research could then be followed by trials to evaluate the costs and outcomes of different strategies for the investigation of patients with alarm symptoms.

### A differentiated approach to referrals from general practice to support early cancer diagnosis-the Danish three-legged strategy [^326f871c]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

When aiming to provide more expedited cancer diagnosis and treatment of cancer at an earlier stage, it is important to take into account the symptom epidemiology throughout the pathway, from first bodily sensation until the start of cancer treatment. This has implications for how primary-care providers interpret the presentation and decisions around patient management and investigation. Symptom epidemiology has consequences for how the health-care system might best be organised. This paper argues for and describes the organisation of the Danish three-legged strategy in diagnosing cancer, which includes urgent referral pathways for symptoms suspicious of a specific cancer, urgent referral to diagnostic centres when we need quick and profound evaluation of patients with nonspecific, serious symptoms and finally easy and fast access to 'No-Yes-Clinics' for cancer investigations for those patients with common symptoms in whom the diagnosis of cancer should not be missed. The organisation of the health-care system must reflect the reality of symptoms presented in primary care. The organisational change is evaluated and monitored with a comprehensive research agenda, data infrastructure and education.

### Evaluation of a national lung cancer symptom awareness campaign in wales [^a591d4c2]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Participants and procedures

Survey data

Pre-campaign (June 2016) and post-campaign (September 2016) population samples were surveyed by Beaufort Research, a market research company. Survey questions were informed by the Cancer Awareness Measureand previous campaign evaluation tracking in England, and were included as part of an omnibus survey carried out with a representative sample of the Welsh population (aged 16+) using face-to-face interviews.

Survey questions included gender, age, social group, number of children in the household and area of residence (Cardiff and South East Wales, Mid/West Wales, North Wales, Valleys and West/South Wales). Each respondent was allocated to ‘ABC1’ or ‘C2DE’ based on their responses to a range of profiling questions for social group, with ABC1 reflecting less deprived, and C2DE reflecting more deprived groups. Lung symptom awareness was measured using recall (“ There are many warning signs and symptoms of lung cancer. Please name as many as you are aware of”) and prompted recognition questions (“ I’m now going to list some symptoms that may or may not be warning signs for lung cancer. For each one, can you tell me the extent to which you think it is a warning sign for lung cancer?”). For the recognition question, the symptoms listed were: a cough for three weeks or more that does not go away, breathlessness, coughing up blood, a persistent pain in your chest or shoulder, losing weight for no obvious reason and a cough that got worse or changes. Response options were: definitely a warning sign, probably a warning sign, probably not a warning sign, definitely not a warning sign and don’t know. Responses were dichotomised as definitely a warning sign/probably a warning sign versus definitely not a warning sign/probably not a warning sign. ‘Don’t know’ responses were not included in the regression analysis. To align with the focus of the campaign, data are reported for recognition/recall of cough symptom.

Worry about wasting the doctor’s time was measured using the question “I’m going to read you a statement that is sometimes made about lung cancer. Can you please tell me how much you agree or disagree with it – that is whether you strongly agree, agree, disagree or strongly disagree. If I had a cough, I would be worried about wasting the GP/doctor’s time”. Response options were dichotomised as strongly agree/agree versus strongly disagree/disagree.

Introduction

Post-COVID conditions, or long COVID, comprise a range of symptoms that persist or develop ≥4 weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, and which are associated with substantial morbidity and reduced quality of life. Estimates of prevalence vary across settings, periods, and patient populations; and many studies lack comparison groups. Symptom trajectory over time using serial measurements has received little attention. Symptoms might either persist or emerge, and previous prevalence estimates typically include both persisting and emerging symptoms, without distinguishing between them.

### Zika symptoms and complications | Zika virus-CDC (...) [^ea64f8d0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Many people infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms.
- Symptoms usually last for several days to a week.
- Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and is associated with other pregnancy problems.
- Rarely, Zika infection can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome or severe disease affecting the brain. Symptoms Many people infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms. The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are:
- Fever
- Rash
- Headache
- Joint pain
- Conjunctivitis
- Muscle pain Zika causes symptoms similar to other viral diseases spread through mosquito bites, like dengue and chikungunya. Zika symptoms usually last for several days to a week. People usually do not get sick enough to go to the hospital. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected. People very rarely die of Zika. Complications Zika is generally mild.

Hospitalization and death from Zika are uncommon. Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and is associated with other pregnancy problems, including fetal loss, stillbirth and preterm birth. Rarely, Zika infection may cause Guillain-Barré syndrome. GBS is a sickness in which a person’s own immune system damages their nerve cells causing muscle weakness and sometimes, paralysis. These symptoms can last a few weeks or several months. Most people fully recover from GBS, though some people have permanent damage. Very few people die from GBS caused by Zika infection. In rare cases, Zika may cause severe disease affecting the brain, causing swelling of the brain, tissues around the brain or spinal cord. Zika may also cause a blood disorder which can result in bleeding, bruising, or slow blood clotting.

Due to the high incidence of pain, it can be used as a symptom identified in the course of COVID-19, reminding people with pain to be vigilant and help doctors diagnose as soon as possible. In addition, it also presents important challenge to clinicians’ diagnosis when treating patients with COVID-19 having mild symptoms. Considering the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the pain symptoms of COVID-19 should be systematically summarized. At present, no reviews of pain symptoms for these patients with COVID-19 have been done. This review aimed to elaborate the pain symptoms of patients with COVID-19 based on published data.

### Development of a measurement tool to assess public awareness of cancer [^8a39c3f4]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Generation of items

Following a review of the literature, existing awareness questionnaires were examined and relevant items extracted. This was supplemented with a review of the ‘grey’ literature (i.e. unpublished surveys carried out by cancer charities and other organisations) to include items not published in academic journals. Following this review, an item pool consisting of 137 items was created. These covered a range of topics including awareness of warning signs and risk factors, cancer incidence and awareness of national screening programmes. Items were then excluded if they were poorly worded, used terminology not frequently used in the United Kingdom (e.g. Pap test) or were attitudinal in nature (e.g. ‘I believe there are no early symptoms of cancer’). Items relating to awareness of the purpose of screening, the benefits of early detection and cancer survival rates were also omitted from the measure because the primary focus was symptom recognition. In addition, the research team generated several items specifically for the instrument that had not been used in previous questionnaires.

### Cancer incidence and competing mortality risk following 15 presenting symptoms in primary care: a population-based cohort study using electronic healthcare records [^3e40c5d1]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The risk of cancer diagnosis and non-cancer mortality after symptomatic presentation can be comparable and both should be considered in referral and investigation decisions—alongside age, sex and smoking status. A holistic and stratified assessment of the risk in symptomatic patients, which considers the risk of a cancer diagnosis, the risk of a diagnosis of individual types of cancer and the risk of non-cancer mortality, is needed particularly for patients presenting with which are vague or non-specific symptoms associated with multiple cancer types and appreciable non-cancer mortality risk. Our results can support the updating of referral and management guidelines for symptomatic patients presenting in primary care.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^69127a11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Progress and priorities in reducing the time to cancer diagnosis [^085543af]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Nearly half of symptomatic patients who will go on to be diagnosed with cancer do not present with red-flag symptoms included in guidelines. Guidelines may be surpassed if clinicians assess patients to be at-risk of undiagnosed cancer despite not meeting formal criteria for specialist investigation or assessment. Research into GP “gut-feeling” emphasised the importance of subtle cues and clinical observations not easily incorporated into guideline recommendations or decision-support tools. Offering an expedited referral route for these patients is appropriate but it remains a challenge for clinicians to communicate what led to their higher index of suspicion when making referrals. Conversely, non-adherence to referral recommendations for “red-flag” symptoms also occurs. A recent study reported that the risk of cancer among patients with red-flag symptoms not promptly referred was a third of that observed for referred patients with the same symptoms. Whilst this study indicates that guideline non-adherence may be driven by risk-based patient selection, this assessment seems imperfect as the residual cancer risk remains high. Therefore, there is a need for both widening referral criteria and improving adherence to them, supported by new evidence to guide patient selection.

Given the high proportion of cancer patients without typical symptoms, attention is being paid to presentations not obviously associated with a body organ or system (e.g. loss of weight, fatigue, abdominal pain), and to creating care pathways and services that can help to achieve rapid diagnostic resolution in these patients. Research on the positive predictive value of symptoms has determined appropriate risk periods following presentation to avoid inflating risk estimates when using inappropriately long follow-up periods that incorporate background incidence unrelated to presenting symptoms. Dedicated non-specific symptoms pathways have been introduced in the UK emulating similar services in Denmark to support investigations for suspected cancer across different body organs or systems. Early evaluations demonstrate diagnostic yields for cancer that are higher than pathways for specific symptoms, supporting the sustainability of this route to the diagnosis of less common cancers or serious non-malignant disease in a third of referred patients. As this broad investigative approach can also detect findings of uncertain clinical significance that require further monitoring, health economic analyses, longer-term follow-up of patient reported outcomes, and further diagnostic test development are needed to help guide future development of these policies.

### Flutamide [^691a62c4]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Are there important risks I should know about flutamide therapy?

Some men taking the flutamide product had liver injury and needed to be hospitalized. In rare cases, men died because of liver failure while they were taking flutamide. In about half of these cases, the liver failure occurred in the first 3 months that they were taking flutamide.

Because the flutamide product may cause liver failure, it is very important that you have all blood tests recommended by your doctor . These tests help identify whether you are having liver problems. A recommended schedule for these blood tests is:

before starting flutamide treatment
every month for the first 4 months of therapy
periodically after the first 4 months

In addition, you should call your doctor right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms:

loss of appetite
nausea and vomiting
stomach or abdominal pain
fatigue (feeling extremely tired)
flu-like symptoms (muscle aches, soreness)
brown urine
jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes)

drink plenty of fluids
reduce your intake of dairy products (for example, milk, cheese, yogurt)
increase your intake of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables
stop laxative use
take non-prescription anti-diarrheal medicines

If your diarrhea continues or it becomes severe, contact your doctor right away.

Are there any other lab tests my doctor will be performing?

Your doctor may perform other regular tests (such as the PSA blood test) to ensure that your body is responding to treatment. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how your flutamide therapy is being monitored.

Where can I get further support?

Please ask your doctor about any questions concerning prostate cancer or flutamide therapy, or you can also ask for a more detailed leaflet that is written for healthcare professionals.

### The CAPER studies: five case-control studies aimed at identifying and quantifying the risk of cancer in symptomatic primary care patients [^11d4476e]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The five studies largely confirmed that the symptoms of cancer listed in medical textbooks were relevant in primary care, and were often reported months before diagnosis. The new information was the relative importance of the symptoms, and the risk of cancer posed by each one. Current UK referral guidance suggests particular symptoms for urgent referral, without any explicit rationale given for the choice. Now there are risk estimates for the symptoms of some common cancers, the choice of symptoms can be placed on a stronger footing.

Some important points emerged for individual cancers. For colorectal cancer, it was clear that a policy of concentrating on rectal bleeding will only yield a small return, in that only 42% of cases experience this symptom, and referrals are made quickly. Furthermore, the threshold haemoglobin values recommended for referral of iron deficiency anaemia equated to very high risks – at least when compared with the risks inherent in the other symptoms deemed worthy of referral. Perhaps the most important concept to arise from the colorectal studies was the ‘low-risk-but-not-no-risk’ symptom. Most patients with colorectal cancer never have a high-risk symptom such as rectal bleeding or severe anaemia. Thus, most do not qualify for urgent referral, explaining in part why so few colorectal cancers are diagnosed through the 2-week wait clinics (;). Not surprisingly, mortality is highest in patients whose first symptom is abdominal pain, and lowest in those with rectal bleeding. Thus, a scoring system – the CAPER score – has been derived to try and identify those most at risk of cancer, when they only have a low-risk symptom (;). It encourages GPs to identify other symptoms when a patient attends with a low-risk symptom such as diarrhoea, and a score is derived from the symptom list, plus the haemoglobin level. Initial modelling in a second data set seems very promising, suggesting that there may be a way of identifying cancer in those who are currently not prioritised for investigation.

### Symptoms of scarlet fever | Group A strep (...) [^d5369654]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Skin rash and sore throat are common symptoms of scarlet fever.
- Physical signs of scarlet fever can appear on the tongue or skin and in the throat or neck.
- Complications aren't common after scarlet fever.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about scarlet fever. Signs and symptoms General symptoms Some symptoms of scarlet fever are common to other infections, too. These may include:
- Fever or chills
- Headache or body aches
- Nausea or vomiting
- Sore throat and pain when swallowing
- Stomach pain. Physical signs Some physical signs are typical of scarlet fever. They show in the following areas:
- Skin
- Tongue, throat, and neck Skin Signs of scarlet fever on the skin include:
- A red rash that feels rough like sandpaper
- Brighter red skin in the creases of the underarm, elbow, and groin
- Pale area around the mouth
- Skin peeling as the rash fades.

Tongue, throat, and neck Signs in these areas include: Early in illness: Whitish coating on the tongue Later in illness: "Strawberry" tongue
- Red and swollen tonsils
- Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck
- Tiny, red spots on the roof of the mouth, called petechiae
- Very red throat
- White patches or streaks of pus on the tonsils. Complications Complications can occur after having scarlet fever but aren't common. This can happen if the bacteria spread to other parts of the body. Complications can include:
- Abscesses around the tonsils
- Arthritis
- Ear, sinus, and skin infections
- Pneumonia
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
- Rheumatic fever
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Treatment with antibiotics can prevent most of these health problems.

### Red flag screening for low back pain: nothing to see here, move along: a narrative review [^95fb5bfa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Screening for red flags in individuals with low back pain (LBP) has been a historical hallmark of musculoskeletal management. Red flag screening is endorsed by most LBP clinical practice guidelines, despite a lack of support for their diagnostic capacity. We share four major reasons why red flag screening is not consistent with best practice in LBP management: (1) clinicians do not actually screen for red flags, they manage the findings; (2) red flag symptomology negates the utility of clinical findings; (3) the tests lack the negative likelihood ratio to serve as a screen; and (4) clinical practice guidelines do not include specific processes that aid decision-making. Based on these findings, we propose that clinicians consider: (1) the importance of watchful waiting; (2) the value-based care does not support clinical examination driven by red flag symptoms; and (3) the recognition that red flag symptoms may have a stronger relationship with prognosis than diagnosis.

### A differentiated approach to referrals from general practice to support early cancer diagnosis-the Danish three-legged strategy [^9b4e1f7f]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The three-legged diagnostic strategy

A wish for expedited cancer diagnosis and cancer diagnosis at an earlier stage necessitates that we broaden the focus on alarm symptoms to include the full symptom continuum. A system that focusses on cancer diagnosis based on alarm symptoms alone might also be a health-care system that favours ‘the sick-quick' and lets down the majority with vague symptoms. A Danish study illustrated this by showing that, if the GP regards the symptom as vague, 50% of cancer patients will wait at least one month more and 25% at least 2.5 months longer until diagnosis, compared with those with alarm symptoms. Thus, urgent referral for the obvious alarm symptoms must be accompanied by two more referral routes; the urgent referral for nonspecific, serious symptoms and the no-yes-clinics (NYC).

This led to the development of the three-legged cancer diagnosis strategy in Denmark (Figure 3). It acknowledges that we need diagnostic routes for what the GPs recognise as alarm symptoms (the obvious cancer suspicion), the nonspecific symptoms (the difficult diagnosis) and the vague symptoms (the common symptom).

### Progress and priorities in reducing the time to cancer diagnosis [^f28ac5a3]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The systematic review by Neal et al. “Is increased time to diagnosis and treatment associated with poorer outcomes” published in the 2015 early diagnosis BJC supplement has become one of the most highly cited papers in the field with 470 Web of Science citations by September 2022. While Neal et al. dissect methodological shortcomings in the evidence they have reviewed, they posit that shortening the time to cancer diagnosis and treatment does convey prognostic benefits, particularly for certain cancers and patient groups. Building on this conclusion, we overview key developments in policy and evidence for early diagnosis that have ensued since the publication of this seminal paper.

The publication of the NICE guidelines ‘Suspected cancer: Recognition and referral” in the same year as the Neal et al. review (2015) represents an important milestone in efforts to improve diagnosis of as-yet-undiagnosed cancer in symptomatic patients. A unique feature of these guidelines is the endorsement of an explicit 3% cancer risk threshold at which patients ought to be investigated. Like all social value judgements, this threshold represents the assessment of benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic technologies available at that time. We now know that it may be possible to lower referral thresholds for some patients without being overly demanding of resources, whilst effectively increasing them when positive triage tests identify higher-risk symptomatic patients. There has been a continuous and inexorable rise in urgent referrals for suspected cancer since 2009-10. Using the latest reported data (12-month period to July 2022), there are more than 2.7 m referrals for suspected cancer each year in England. The increasing proportion of cancer patients detected via this route has been credited for welcome reductions in diagnoses through emergency presentation, associated with worse prognosis. However, these positive developments come at a cost as only around one in 15 patients referred is found to have cancer. For cancers with few, variable, or low-risk symptoms and no primary care tests, there are still limited options to improve early diagnosis.

### Colorectal cancer pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with anatomic cancer site [^e7b7a33d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Different pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with rectal and colon cancer and some associations are stronger among early-onset CRC patients, specifically blood in stool. With the rise of early-onset CRC and with the recognition of suboptimal screening adherence in the general population, it is crucial for providers to consider CRC in the differential. This evaluation of red flag symptoms by anatomic site can be used to inform subsequent diagnostic evaluation, which may decrease the latency of CRC diagnosis in affected individuals and/or rule out cancer in unaffected individuals with similar symptoms.

### Cancer incidence and competing mortality risk following 15 presenting symptoms in primary care: a population-based cohort study using electronic healthcare records [^c40782c6]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Most patients with cancer are diagnosed after symptomatic presentation,and, given the paucity of effective tests to enable population-based cancer screening, this is likely to be the case for the coming decade. Appropriately suspecting the diagnosis of cancer in symptomatic patients is difficult, as symptoms may be caused by many other diseases. Even so-termed ‘alarm’ or ‘red-flag’ symptoms typically have positive predictive values for cancer that do not exceed 5% in women of any age or in men younger than 70.In the UK, many patients with cancer experience diagnostic delays in the form of multiple pre-referral consultations and prolonged intervals to diagnosis, despite practice guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Social Care Excellence (NICE) that aimed to enable prompt diagnosis of cancer in primary care.Such delays are associated with adverse patient experience and worse clinical outcomes.

Currently, the majority of research publications supporting practice guidelines come from case-control studies, examining symptom-related risk of specific cancer sites. This study design ignores that presenting symptoms are often shared between different cancers and diseases other than cancer; there has been no comprehensive examination of the risk of the full spectrum of possible cancer types for the most relevant presenting symptoms. Further, guideline recommendations handle major cancer risk factors sub-optimally, as smoking status is typically ignored as a risk stratifier, and age is typically not considered as a continuous variable, leading to information loss. Competing risk of death is also ignored, meaning that management decisions centred on cancer risk ignore risks related to other diseases.

This study is motivated by the need for evidence to support the updating of clinical practice guidelines for the primary care management of patients who present with symptoms of possible underlying cancer. Such evidence is needed both in terms of quantifying the absolute risk of different cancer types and also the probability of patients dying without a cancer diagnosis. We also aim to aid the development of and complement the use of risk prediction tools by describing in detail the associations between symptoms and cancer risk. We therefore assess age-, sex- and smoking-specific risk of cancer diagnosis and non-cancer mortality following primary care consultation for one of 15 new-onset symptoms.

### Applying symptom appraisal models to understand sociodemographic differences in responses to possible cancer symptoms: a research agenda [^5a01e80c]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Knowledge

Overview. Across models the concept of ‘knowledge' is described as ‘exemplars', 'schemes', ‘schemas', ‘mental representations', ‘prototypes' and ‘awareness', but in all cases is conceived of a cognitive factor that guides the interpretation process. When bodily changes are detected, people use their existing knowledge to aid interpretation.

Sociodemographics differences. Population-based surveys in the United Kingdom using the cancer awareness measure (CAM;) show that knowledge about cancer ‘warning signs' is lower in lower SES groups, men and older people (;;). Modules of the CAM for specific cancer sites also show that knowledge of warning signs for lung, colorectal and cervical cancer is lower in lower SES groups (;;). Men were also less likely to know the warning signs for colorectal cancer. If sociodemographic characteristics are associated with being less likely to hold schemata for relevant ‘warning signs', this would influence the symptom interpretation process and in turn make help-seeking less likely. Consistent with this, lower awareness of cancer ‘alarm' symptoms is associated with a longer ‘anticipated' help-seeking interval (;).

Older age, lower education, lower income and being male are also associated with lower health literacy, defined as ‘the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic medical information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions'. Lower health literacy may make it more difficult to understand and thus benefit from public health messages aimed at increasing knowledge, because concepts such as ‘early detection' are not well understood. However, whether health literacy is the primary explanation of sociodemographic differences in awareness of warning signs has not been investigated.

These results indicate that one avenue by which to reduce inequalities in earlier diagnosis is the targeting of particular demographic groups in which awareness and health literacy are known to be lower. In the United Kingdom, there are some campaigns targeting specific groups (e.g. breast cancer awareness campaign for women over 70 years;). If successful, these could be followed by campaigns targeting other symptoms or groups.

### Palliative care for patients with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^c4e8a4bd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Research question 4—palliative care referral timing and triggers: Initiating timely palliative care is integral to comprehensive cancer management. The 2016 guideline recommended referral to specialist palliative care within 8 weeks of diagnosis of advanced cancer, and, based on the same evidence and workforce issues, the Expert Panel recommended changing the wording to early in the treatment process. In available interventional studies, early has been defined as within 8–12 weeks from diagnosis, but there is no standard time following diagnosis of an advanced cancer in which to refer. In current practice, the Expert Panel recommends that individuals interpret early as not waiting until cessation of antineoplastic-directed therapy but rather focusing on the presence of palliative needs, and early also indicates palliative care engagement in the outpatient setting. In the absence of such assessments, oncology clinicians with patients who experience persistent and distressing symptoms (eg, pain, nausea, or dyspnea, with a pattern of recurrent hospitalizations or emergency department visits because of cancer-related complications and/or who experience a decline in functional status) should refer them to specialty palliative care.

- Fever or chills
- Cough
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
- Sore throat
- Congestion or runny nose
- New loss of taste or smell
- Fatigue
- Muscle or body aches
- Headache
- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Feeling Sick. Stay home and away from others if you have symptoms that aren't better explained by another cause.

Seek health care promptly for testing and/or treatment if you have risk factors for severe illness; treatment may help lower your risk of severe illness. When to seek emergency help Look for emergency warning signs for COVID 19:
- Trouble breathing
- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
- New confusion
- Inability to wake or stay awake
- Depending on skin tone, lips, nail beds and skin may appear pale, gray, or blue. If someone is showing any of these signs, call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. This list does not include all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. . Difference between flu and COVID-19 Influenza and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses.

COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, and flu is caused by infection with one of the influenza viruses. You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same.

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^1c30d85c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

### The relative length of the patient and the primary care interval in patients with 28 common and rarer cancers [^10a4912a]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Most patients with cancer present with symptoms, and of those most first present to a general practitioner (;). For these patients, timeliness of diagnosis is a function of both the length of time from symptom onset to first consultation (the patient interval), and the time from first consultation to specialist referral (the primary care interval;). Interventions aiming at shortening either interval have been developed, with either a predominantly community focus (e.g. public health interventions to help individuals recognise, and act on, ‘alarm symptoms') or a health-care system focus (e.g. decision-support interventions or specialist referral guidelines;;;).

The relative contribution of each of the two intervals (i.e. the patient or the primary care interval) to the length of the overall pre-referral interval from symptom onset to referral is nonetheless inadequately described for most cancers. The majority of the evidence relates to methodologically heterogeneous studies examining either the patient or the primary care interval on their own, often focussing on a single or a few cancer sites. However, some recent studies have encompassed multiple cancer sites, identifying large differences between cancers in the length of various diagnostic intervals (;;;;;). In addition, current evidence suggests that primary care intervals tend to be very short for cancers in which most patients present with palpable or visible symptoms and signs, such as for breast cancer, melanoma and endometrial cancer (;), which also tend to be associated with socioeconomic inequalities in stage at diagnosis (;). These observations indicate that patient intervals may dominate the length of overall pre-referral intervals for at least some cancers. In contrast, the relative contribution of the primary care interval may be greater for other cancers, particularly those in which substantial proportions of patients present with symptoms of low specificity and which are considered ‘harder to suspect' after presentation. In order to better target interventions aiming to shorten the pre-referral interval, the relative contribution of pre- and post-presentation intervals for different cancers needs to be better described.

We therefore set out to comprehensively examine differences in the length of patient and primary care intervals for a range of common and rarer cancers. In doing so, we systematically address variation by cancer in the length of the two intervals to help inform decision-making about the development, implementation and evaluation of either community- or primary care-based interventions.

Future research

Presentation to a doctor is just one aspect of the time taken to diagnose a haematological malignancy. The doctor must then recognise that the presenting symptoms could indicate a haematological malignancy and make timely and appropriate referrals into secondary care. Further research is needed, alongside primary care practitioners, to identify mechanisms by which patients can be identified as early as possible, and routes to haematology and diagnosis can be as seamless as possible.

Nevertheless, around 50% of patients with cancer present with nonspecific or vague symptoms that are associated with much lower PPVs for cancer.In Denmark, patients with nonspecific symptoms (eg, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and abdominal pain) are referred to multidisciplinary clinics where a battery of investigations (blood and urine tests and diagnostic imaging) can be conducted rapidly.Similarly designed clinics have been introduced in the United Kingdom to accommodate individuals who present with nonalarm symptoms. -

Evidence regarding pre-existing levels of symptom awareness and symptom-specific measures of diagnostic timeliness could guide the selection of symptoms in early diagnosis programs. Validated measures including the Cancer Awareness Measure,, the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer measure,and region-specific adaptations such as the African Women Awareness of CANcer tool designed for breast and cervical cancercould support such prioritization by identifying symptoms correlated with low awareness. Symptoms associated with the longest patient intervals (time from symptom onset to presentation) may also be particularly worthy of targeting.

### Symptoms and patient factors associated with diagnostic intervals for pancreatic cancer (SYMPTOM pancreatic study): a prospective cohort study [^ec0b392a]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Our findings show that there are subtle differences in the effect of symptoms and patient factors on patient and health system intervals, with some clear implications for policy makers and clinicians. That no initial symptoms were predictive of pancreatic cancer emphasises the challenges of triaging referrals for suspected pancreatic cancer. Although the alarm symptom jaundice was more frequently reported by patients in the all cancer group than by those with no cancer, it was reported as the first symptom in less than 12% of cases, and reported much more frequently as a subsequent symptom (43% of cases). We did not identify any other strong individual symptom signals of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that awareness campaigns should include messages that emphasise the importance of multiple, often intermittent, upper gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, decreased appetite and indigestion) and systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue and weight loss), and the evolution of symptoms over time.Revised NICE guidelinesfor early detection of pancreatic cancer support this premise, and have also lowered the threshold for referral.

Our study also shows that only people presenting with jaundice and decreased appetite as an initial symptom receive a diagnosis more promptly than do those presenting with other symptoms. Primary care professionals could consider concurrent rather than sequential investigation, with CT and gastroscopy, of older people who present with indigestion that is atypical or associated with systemic symptoms.Primary care professionals could also have an increased awareness of the risk of pancreatic cancer in people diagnosed with diabetes, particularly those with normal weight without the typical features predisposing to insulin resistance. All health-care professionals should remain alert to possible pancreatic cancer in people with back pain, and beware of misattributing potential symptoms of pancreatic cancer in those with self-reported anxiety and depression, or both. The increasingly widespread use of clinical decision support in primary care can also be informed by our findings,,but further research is needed, alongside GPs and specialists, to identify mechanisms by which patients can be identified, referred, and diagnosed in the most timely and appropriate way. The absence of strong symptom signals means that other strategies for early diagnosis, including the development of diagnostic biomarkers and improved access to imaging, are important. Nevertheless, these data provide support for more targeted investigation of suspicious symptoms to identify pancreatic cancer at an earlier and more amenable stage.

Biomarker categories, definitions, and clinical applications—clinical validation delineates three categories with study definitions and use cases. Risk prediction is defined as “Cancer is not present, based on current standards; biomarker assesses the probability of cancer developing and being diagnosed over time,” studied for “The diagnosis of lung cancer after a defined period of time” in “Individuals without symptoms, signs, or current imaging evidence of the presence of lung cancer,” using “Biopsy-confirmed lung cancer after a defined period of time,” with applications in “Risk mitigation” and “Screening.” Cancer detection is defined as “Cancer is present but has not been detected. The patient may or may not have symptoms; biomarker identifies the potential presence of cancer,” studied for “Undetected lung cancer” in “Individuals with or without symptoms or signs of the presence of lung cancer,” with “Biopsy-confirmed lung cancer,” and applications in “Screening” and “Symptom evaluation.” Diagnosis is defined as “A nodule, mass, or other imaging finding is known to be present, but its etiology has not been determined; biomarker helps to determine the probability that the finding is malignant,” studied for “Indeterminate lung nodule, mass, or other imaging finding” in “Individuals with imaging showing an indeterminate lung nodule, mass, or other imaging finding,” with “Biopsy confirmation or surveillance imaging without growth for a period of time, in keeping with current guidelines,” and application in “Evaluation of a lung nodule, mass, or other imaging finding.”

Systematic review (SR) scope and eligibility—population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and size: Evidence was identified via PubMed (1990–November 2021) and Cochrane Library (1990–November 2021) searches, with an updated PubMed search from November 2021 to January 2023. Eligible studies enrolled adults with cancer experiencing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression during any stage of their cancer trajectory, evaluated integrative interventions for anxiety and depression management, used comparators including no intervention, waitlist, usual or standard care, guideline-based care, active or attention control, placebo, or sham, and reported changes in anxiety and depression symptoms measured by valid tools as a primary or secondary outcome; the minimum total sample size was 50. Articles were excluded if they were meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals, editorials/commentaries/letters/news articles/case reports/narrative reviews, or published in a non-English language, and the Expert Panel used effect sizes computed in the SRs to inform recommendations, evaluating primary studies individually when SRs did not pool outcomes of interest.

Visual symptoms—background and urgent referral: Vision symptoms, including sensitivity to light, eye fatigue, difficulty focusing, and blurry vision occur acutely in some individuals who sustain mTBI, and most vision symptoms resolve within minutes or hours; however, for those with persistent difficulties, targeted assessments to guide symptom management during the first few weeks after mTBI are most effective. PCPs need to be aware of reasons for an urgent referral to an eye care provider, including vision loss or decline, diplopia, abnormal pupils, abnormal external eye exam, abnormal visual behavior, abnormal eye movements, or acute ocular symptoms; if visual symptoms persist and impact daily function, providers should refer patients to optometry, ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, neurology, and/or vision rehabilitation team. Higher-order cognitive symptoms may be mistaken for ocular or vision issues, and occupational therapy vision assessment or behavioral neurology assessment may be very helpful in ruling out these symptoms.

### Cancer detection in primary care: insights from general practitioners [^1de326e9]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosing cancer when it is at an early stage is important, as the stage of disease at diagnosis is related to survival for many cancers. Because of this, there has been increasing interest in how patients and professionals recognise cancer symptoms, which has resulted in an increased interest in all stages of the pathway to diagnosis. This pathway is complex; timely diagnosis is dependent on patients identifying a new symptom or something different, interpreting that change as something about which they should see their doctor, negotiating the system to obtain an appointment and then the general practitioner (GP) recognising the symptoms as a presentation of potential cancer. This pathway is not as linear as initial models of the pathway to diagnosis suggested. More recent models of the pathway, based on literature review, have suggested that the process of patient appraisal and self-management continues after the decision to consult a health-care professional takes place and interacts with the health-care professional in turn appraising, investigating and referring the patient for further investigation. Central to this process, however, are two parties: the patient and the health-care professional, who in a UK context is most commonly a GP.

In addition, complexity is added in the United Kingdom (and similar health-care systems) owing to the role of the GP in ‘gate-keeping' access to referral to specialist care. The interaction between the GP and the patient can therefore be seen as the front line for contact between public/patient and the National Health Service (NHS) with respect to the understanding of symptoms, presentation and GP response, whichstate form the ‘key determinants of outcomes in cancer'. Primary care is therefore the focus of considerable research and policy activity in the area of cancer symptom recognition and referral. However, although work to date has included a GP perspective in cancer-specific studies and has focussed on cancer detection in primary care, including, for example, the development of algorithms to assist with risk stratification of symptom presentation (;;;), there is limited work that investigates GPs' understanding of patients' awareness of cancer symptoms or on GPs' views of their own role in early detection.

### Optimizing symptom management in people with kidney failure [^f27b10a7]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

People with kidney failure experience high symptom burden, which is associated with an increased risk of mortality, morbidity, and impaired quality of life. Symptoms are often severe and persistent, affecting many organs and causing considerable physical, psychological and emotional distress. The causes of symptoms are often multifactorial, and the underlying pathophysiology is often poorly understood. Managing symptoms is challenging because of uncertainty regarding the use of validated patient-reported outcome measures in clinical practice and limited evidence for interventions to relieve symptoms. Addressing these challenges requires developing and validating symptom-targeted interventions and integrating symptom management strategies within a multi-disciplinary framework, including nephrologists, palliative care physicians, allied health and mental health professionals. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology, and adverse impacts of symptoms in people with kidney failure. We will also provide practical guidance on selecting the appropriate symptom measures and evidence-based interventions for symptom assessment and management in kidney failure care.

### Red flag signs and symptoms for patients with early-onset colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^293fe722]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Nevertheless, it is prudent to address potential physician and patient barriers to timely workup. Younger patients may experience ongoing signs and symptoms and delay seeking medical attention.Potential reasons for these delays include a patient believing they are too young to worry about cancer or a lack of access to primary care or health insurance. Clarifying how these signs and symptoms are associated with EOCRC could give patients greater urgency to report these symptoms sooner, leading to quicker diagnostic workup and resolution. For clinicians, particularly those in primary care, recognition of clues and appropriate diagnostic workup for concerning signs and symptoms is paramount to early EOCRC detection. However, prior studies found that clinicians often dismiss these signs and symptoms or misattribute them to more benign conditions, such as attributing rectal bleeding to hemorrhoids, without conducting further diagnostic evaluation. This can leave a potentially concerning sign or symptom unresolved for an extended period of time, and for some patients, delay EOCRC diagnosis. To avoid missing an EOCRC diagnosis, clinicians should work with patients to ensure concerning signs and symptoms undergo diagnostic evaluation to identify and resolve the underlying cause.

Our study has several strengths. Our approach distilled a tremendous amount of global data over several decades into clear and practical information that is immediately useful to clinicians. We applied strict study selection criteria to capture only individuals younger than 50 years with nonhereditary CRC to represent an individual with average risk diagnosed with EOCRC beginning in 1996, when EOCRC rates started to increase. The meta-analysis adjusted for or stratified by potential contributors to study heterogeneity, including study quality, age of study population, country of study origin, percentage of male study participants, and year of publication.

### Cancer detection in primary care: insights from general practitioners [^02020600]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Findings from our study show how the potential diagnosis of cancer was a concern for our participants that absorbed much of their time. It is the case, however, that inherent uncertainties underscore cancer symptom recognition and referral decisions in primary care; the skill required in the management of risk and uncertainty has been noted by others (;;). Our participants were aware that the majority of patients who present with potential cancer symptoms will have a diagnosis other than cancer (;;). Clearly, the detection of cancer in primary care is complex, and it can involve several appointments and investigations. Although all participants welcomed the 2WW criteria, references to ‘gut instinct' were evident across the sample and had a role in GPs' ability, in the absence of red flag symptoms, to identify patients in need of further investigation (to either rule in or rule out cancer).) have commented on the notion of uncertainty in general practice when GPs are faced with ‘complicated, vague problems'. The GPs in our study stressed that patients with vague symptoms, which over time turned out to be those of cancer, were more likely to receive a later diagnosis because their symptoms did not meet urgent referral criteria. GPs also applied a ‘watch and wait' safety-net approach to some patients because they were aware that, as) attest, in primary care ‘diagnosis often emerges over time'. To ease this situation, GPs called for a generic referral route for suspected cancer symptoms, alongside increased opportunity for communication with secondary care colleagues.) comment that fragmentation within primary care has occurred because of increased numbers of part-time and salaried GPs and the use of locum cover. They identified this as a root cause of the demise of continuity of care because of the ‘difficulty in seeing a consistent doctor'. The GPs in our study were a mix of full- and part-time partners and salaried GPs, and data indicate that they valued and made efforts to provide continuity of care for their patients. Their concern in this regard was, however, that walk-in centres and ports of call other than GP surgeries have the potential to erode continuity of care.conclude that ‘early diagnosis is the result of the best interaction between patients and their GP' our participants' views echo this assertion, albeit from a different standpoint. Some of the challenges that participants felt they faced also related to recent organisational changes – for example, an increased responsibility for resource management was felt to be at odds with the GP's role as patient advocate.

### Diagnosis of colorectal cancer in primary care: the evidence base for guidelines [^475b046e]. Family Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer is common, causing approximately 11% of cancer deaths in the UK. However, a GP would only expect to see one new presentation each year. Referral guidelines outlining clinical scenarios of high risk have been published. These aim to help GPs select patients for rapid investigation.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to review the presenting features of colorectal cancer in primary care, using the basic structure of the UK Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer.

Methods

A structured literature review was carried out.

Results

Two symptoms have a high predictive value for cancer: rectal bleeding and change in bowel habit towards increased looseness or increased stool frequency. Other symptoms, such as abdominal pain, are so prevalent in the community that they have little predictive value. There is little published evidence on abdominal or rectal masses and iron deficiency anaemia as presenting features for colorectal cancer. However, these are so likely to have an important cause, investigation is mandated. Two areas in the Referral Guidelines are questioned: the need to defer investigation of change in bowel habit towards increased looseness or increased stool frequency for 6 weeks, and the low risk nature of constipation.

Conclusion

The Referral Guidelines have a reasonable evidence base.

### Alarm symptoms and identification of non-cancer diagnoses in primary care: cohort study [^c274cc8a]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Most major and minor illnesses in the United Kingdom are managed by general practitioners and, in other countries, by generalist primary care physicians.The number of new cases of serious illness seen each year by an individual general practitioner, however, is relatively small. For example, each of the 42 000 general practitioners in the UK will see about seven new cancers, three to four strokes, and five to six myocardial infarctions each year, assuming a notional list size of 1800-2000.Many years ago, however, Thomas noted that up to 40% of patients presenting in primary care and observed over a two week period recover without specific treatment and often without a specific diagnosis being made.

Operating in conditions of diagnostic uncertainty, general practitioners have the often difficult task of separating the minority of patients whose symptoms could indicate serious disease and who require urgent diagnostic attention from the majority with less serious, self limiting illness,in whom time can often be used both as a “diagnostic and therapeutic tool.”To make these difficult judgments general practitioners use various personal “heuristics”—commonsense rules often involving the use of questions thought to have high negative or positive predictive values to rule out serious disease and often without a firm evidence base to support them.This has led to continuing uncertainty about the optimum use and timing of invasive or costly investigations (such as endoscopy and imaging) and controversy about the content of clinical practice guidelines. For example, our limited knowledge of the epidemiology of common cancers has formed the basis of referral guidelines, including the two week rule in the UK, which provides rapid access to specialists for patients presenting in primary care with symptoms that might indicate cancer. There is uncertainty, however, about whether this approach has resulted in more rapid identification of cancers at a more treatable stage.Another example of the need for more diagnostic research concerns the investigation of upper gastrointestinal symptoms and the relative roles of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, Helicobacter pylori testing, and empirical acid suppression, which have been debated for many years without a firm conclusion being reached.

### Making a confident diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^3ae23584]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is among the most common diagnoses made by medical providers and its symptoms are common causes for health care consultation. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain associated with abnormal stool consistency and/or frequency and is widely considered a diagnosis of exclusion, despite abundant evidence contradicting such an approach. A positive diagnosis is achieved through application of symptom-based clinical criteria, careful history and physical examination, evaluation for alarm sign/symptoms, and judicious use of diagnostic testing. This article reviews the symptom-based criteria for IBS and utility of diagnostic tests commonly included in the evaluation of IBS symptoms.

### Comparison of cancer diagnostic intervals before and after implementation of NICE guidelines: analysis of data from the UK general practice research database [^8d011fb4]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

We have found that diagnostic intervals for cancer in England reduced between 2001–2002 and 2007–2008. We propose that the implementation of cancer referral guidelines may have had some influence. Within each cohort, the contrast between the diagnostic intervals for patients with and without non-NICE-qualifying symptoms is stark. The findings do not tell us, however, that NICE-qualifying symptoms are necessarily the right symptoms to prioritise. For example, we know that mild anaemia as a first symptom of colorectal cancer has a higher mortality than severe anaemia, the implication being that ‘softer' symptoms may go undetected for longer. Indeed a fast-track system may disadvantage patients who do not fulfil the criteria (;). There is still a considerable challenge for policy and practice to further expedite diagnosis. The median diagnostic intervals vary considerably between cancers, and some remain very long. The 90th centile of the distribution remains very long in some cancers. These findings, when compared with data from studies of other measures of time intervals in the diagnostic process (;), show that delays in diagnosis happen at different stages in different cancers, hence interventions to expedite diagnosis need to be carefully tailored. Expediting diagnoses for ‘red flag' symptoms may be relatively straightforward; expediting it for all symptoms remains a challenge. At present, a range of initiatives is being implemented in general practice in order to achieve this. We have described a method of measuring the diagnostic interval and have provided a baseline against which these initiatives can be assessed.
