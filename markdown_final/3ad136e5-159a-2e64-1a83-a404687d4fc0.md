A. k x+y+k = 0
B. k x-y-1 = 0

D. k x+y-2 = 0

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which line among the given options cannot produce a chord of the same length as the line y = kx + 1 when intersected with the ellipse x²/8 + y²/4 = 1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the general formula for the length of a chord of an ellipse given a line. Then, I should verify how the chord length depends on the line's slope and y-intercept. Next, I will compare each option with the reference line y = kx + 1 to see which one cannot match its chord length for any real k. Finally, I will double-check the algebra and geometric reasoning to confirm the answer.

> Let me first confirm the ellipse and the reference line. The ellipse is x²/8 + y²/4 = 1, which is a standard ellipse with semi-major axis a = 2√2 along x and semi-minor axis b = 2 along y. The reference line is l: y = kx + 1, which has slope k and y-intercept 1.

> Now, I need to derive the chord length formula. For a line y = mx + c intersecting the ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, the length of the chord is given by L = 2ab√[(a²m² + b² − c²)/(a²m² + b²)]. Wait, let me verify that formula; I initially thought it was 2ab√[(a²m² + b² − c²)/(a²m² + b²)], but hold on, I should double-check the denominator. The correct denominator is (a²m² + b²), so the chord length is indeed L = 2ab√[(a²m² + b² − c²)/(a²m² + b²)].

> Applying this to the reference line y = kx + 1, I substitute m = k and c = 1, with a² = 8 and b² = 4. The chord length for l is Lₗ = 2 × 2√2 × 2√[(8k² + 4 − 1)/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2√[(8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4)]. I should confirm the arithmetic: 2ab = 2 × 2√2 × 2 = 8√2, and the numerator inside the square root is 8k² + 4 − 1 = 8k² + 3, so yes, that's correct.

> Next, I will examine Option A: kx + y + k = 0, which is y = −kx − k. Here, m = −k and c = −k. Plugging into the chord formula, Lₐ = 8√2√[(8(−k)² + 4 − (−k)²)/(8(−k)² + 4)] = 8√2√[(8k² + 4 − k²)/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2√[(7k² + 4)/(8k² + 4)]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wrote 8k² + 3 in the numerator by mistake; I should correct that to 7k² + 4. So Lₐ = 8√2√[(7k² + 4)/(8k² + 4)], which is not identically equal to Lₗ = 8√2√[(8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4)], but I need to check whether there exists a k that makes them equal. Setting Lₐ = Lₗ leads to (7k² + 4)/(8k² + 4) = (8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4), which simplifies to 7k² + 4 = 8k² + 3, so k² = 1, meaning k = ± 1. Thus, for k = ± 1, Option A can match the reference chord length, so A is not the answer.

> I will now examine Option B: kx − y − 1 = 0, which is y = kx − 1. Here, m = k and c = −1. Plugging in, L_B = 8√2√[(8k² + 4 − (−1)²)/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2√[(8k² + 4 − 1)/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2√[(8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4)]. Hold on, I should verify: this is exactly the same expression as Lₗ, so for any real k, Option B produces the same chord length as the reference line. Therefore, B is not the answer.

> Next, I should review Option C: kx + y − k = 0, which is y = −kx + k. Here, m = −k and c = k. Plugging in, L_C = 8√2√[(8(−k)² + 4 − k²)/(8(−k)² + 4)] = 8√2√[(8k² + 4 − k²)/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2√[(7k² + 4)/(8k² + 4)]. Again, I need to check whether this can equal L_l. Setting L_C = Lₗ gives (7k² + 4)/(8k² + 4) = (8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4), which again simplifies to 7k² + 4 = 8k² + 3, so k² = 1, meaning k = ± 1. Thus, for k = ± 1, Option C can match the reference chord length, so C is not the answer.

> Finally, I will examine Option D: kx + y − 2 = 0, which is y = −kx + 2. Here, m = −k and c = 2. Plugging in, Lᴅ = 8√2√[(8(−k)² + 4 − 2²)/(8(−k)² + 4)] = 8√2√[(8k² + 4 − 4)/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2√[8k²/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2√[2k²/(2k² + 1)]. I should double-check the simplification: 8k²/(8k² + 4) = 2k²/(2k² + 1), yes, that's correct. Now, can this equal Lₗ = 8√2√[(8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4)] for any real k? Setting them equal gives 2k²/(2k² + 1) = (8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4). Cross-multiplying yields 2k²(8k² + 4) = (8k² + 3)(2k² + 1), which expands to 16k⁴ + 8k² = 16k⁴ + 8k² + 6k² + 3, simplifying to 0 = 6k² + 3, or 6k² = −3, so k² = −[1/2]. But wait, k² cannot be negative for real k, so there is no real solution. Therefore, Option D can never produce the same chord length as the reference line for any real k.

> Conclusion: The line that cannot intercept a chord of the same length as y = kx + 1 for any real k is Option D, kx + y − 2 = 0. The key insight is that the chord length depends on both the slope and the y-intercept, and only Option D leads to an equation with no real solution when equated to the reference chord length, whereas Options A and C can match for k = ± 1, and Option B matches for all k.

---

The correct answer is **D. kx + y - 2 = 0**. The chord length depends on the distance from the center to the line; for the ellipse ([x²/8] + [y²/4] = 1), the reference line (y = kx + 1) has a fixed y-intercept of 1, while option D has a y-intercept of 2. Because the chord length decreases as the distance from the center increases, option D will always produce a shorter chord than the reference line for any real (k), so it can never match the reference chord length.

## Chord length formula for an ellipse

For an ellipse ([x²/a²] + [y²/b²] = 1) and a line (y = mx + c), the chord length (L) is:

L = 2ab √[(a²m² + b² − c²)/(a²m² + b²)]

For the given ellipse, (a² = 8) and (b² = 4), so:

L = 2 × 2√2 × 2 √[(8m² + 4 − c²)/(8m² + 4)] = 8√2 √[(8m² + 4 − c²)/(8m² + 4)]

---

## Analysis of the reference line

The reference line is (y = kx + 1), so (m = k) and (c = 1). Its chord length is:

L_ref = 8√2 √[(8k² + 4 − 1)/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2 √[(8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4)]

---

## Analysis of option D

Option D is (kx + y - 2 = 0), or (y = -kx + 2), so (m = -k) and (c = 2). Its chord length is:

Lᴅ = 8√2 √[(8(−k)² + 4 − 2²)/(8(−k)² + 4)] = 8√2 √[(8k² + 4 − 4)/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2 √[8k²/(8k² + 4)] = 8√2 √[2k²/(2k² + 1)]

---

## Comparison of chord lengths

We need to check whether (Lᴅ = L_ref) for any real (k):

8√2 √[2k²/(2k² + 1)] = 8√2 √[(8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4)]

Squaring both sides:

[2k²/(2k² + 1)] = [(8k² + 3)/(8k² + 4)]

Cross-multiplying:

2k²(8k² + 4) = (8k² + 3)(2k² + 1)

Expanding:

16k⁴ + 8k² = 16k⁴ + 8k² + 6k² + 3

Simplifying:

0 = 6k² + 3 ⇒ k² = −[1/2]

This has **no real solution**, so (Lᴅ) can never equal (L_ref) for any real (k).

---

## Geometric interpretation

The chord length decreases as the distance from the center increases. Option D's y-intercept of 2 is farther from the center than the reference line's y-intercept of 1, so its chord is always shorter and can never match the reference length.

---

## Conclusion

Option D is the line whose chord length **cannot equal** that of the reference line (y = kx + 1) for any real (k).

Optimization of number of chords to sample to accurately estimate MLI actual

Application of the method yielded a data set of 118,716 chords measured across the computer-generated images of uniform-radius circles. A repeated random subsampling algorithm was implemented on this dataset to estimate MLI measured using N randomly sampled chords from the pool of all chords measured per image (numbering N max); N was an integer on the interval [2, N max] and for each N, 5 random subsamples were used. The number of chords sampled per image was then analyzed via ROC curve to determine the ability of N chords to accurately estimate MLI actual as p ≥ 0.05 by one-sample t-test, Fig. 3 a. AUC ROC is a nearly monotonic function of r stratum, Fig. 3 b. This non-monotonicity is likely due to higher relative noise when measuring smaller radii circles. We then used Youden's Index to estimate the optimal number of chords to sample to accurately measure MLI actual, Table 1. The optimal number of chords per r stratum was used to calculate MLI measured, Fig. 4. Finally, a reliability analysis was performed on MLI measured, stratified by r, using a two-way mixed effects model to determine the reliability of the measurements. We demonstrated excellent reliability, with ICC = 0.9998 and p < 0.0001, Fig. 4.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Exact, time-dependent analytical equations for spiral trajectories and matching gradient and density-correction waveforms [^e97e4fee]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2026). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The use of spiral k‐space trajectories for data acquisition in MRI, is well established, with the benefits of high SNR and temporal efficiency, short minimum TEs, as well as reduced and incoherent artifacts from some types of motion. These trajectories traditionally follow an Archimedean spiral under some constraints for gradients (e.g. maximum gradient amplitude or slew rate). Two approaches to deriving optimal gradient waveforms that sample along this Archimedean spiral include approximately optimal analytical solutions, and numerical methods. These references reflect only a small portion of the methods published to date; however, to the authors' knowledge, there have been no exact analytical solutions, particularly none that allow gradient frequency limitations or include analytical solutions for both gradient waveforms and k‐space trajectories.

A variant of the spiral trajectory, which follows the involute of a circle, was previously introduced with the acronym WHIRL (Winding Hybrid Interleaved Radial Lines). This trajectory is similar to an Archimedean spiral, with two exceptions: (1) it forces the sampling normal to the trajectory (e.g. arm‐to‐arm spacing) to stay exactly uniform; and (2) it is not defined within a prescribed central circle. The first property makes it slightly more optimal than an Archimedean spiral purely in terms of path length. In contrast, the second property requires that one finds a bridging trajectory between the center of the measurement plane (k‐space origin) and the edge of the circle where the trajectory becomes defined. Notably, the slight difference in the math describing this trajectory allows it to be analytically defined under various gradient optimization constraints such as frequency, slew, and gradient magnitude. The inclusion of frequency is particularly relevant because the fidelity of gradient waveforms is known to depend on their frequency content. The proposed trajectory is completed by adding a quarter‐circle arc at the beginning of the trajectory to span the inner circle to the k‐space origin and a quarter‐circle arc at the end to bend the trajectory into a completely angular direction. The first arc is necessary, and the second arc makes the trajectory highly modular, as will be shown.

Outline of the body in relationship to the imaging volume and regions where gradient currents are permitted to flow, designated by the capital letters A, B, and C. The lowercase letters of a, b, c, d, e, and f designate points connecting line segments that define surfaces where currents can flow and are used for some example solutions. The body outline shown is for 50th percentile male

The curl and divergence of B are both zero external to the build envelope; therefore, each Cartesian component of B satisfies Laplace's equation outside the build region. The equivalence principle in electromagnetics means that magnetic fields external to a region produced by an arbitrary distribution of currents internal to that region can be represented equivalently and uniquely by currents on its surface. 27 As a result, in practice, our optimization proceeds by allowing arbitrary currents to flow only on the surfaces of described volumetric regions, further simplifying the analysis without loss of generality.

Our methods produce minimum magnetic energy solutions for a given constraint on maximum E‐field (E max) on the body model surface. This procedure is repeated over a range of E max constraints, starting with no constraint, and progressively reducing the constraint amplitude. The resulting family of curves represents the fundamental relationship between minimum achievable E max and magnetic energy.

### Choice of artificial chordae length according to echocardiographic criteria [^d02fa106]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

A simple way to identify artificial chordae length is reported. The distance A between the edge of the prolapsing anterior leaflet and the plane of the mitral annulus is measured during perioperative transesophageal echocardiography. When the mitral valve is exposed, the elongated chorda, corresponding to the scallop previously evaluated, is measured with a ruler and A is subtracted. This is the length of the new chorda that is measured with a ruler and tied at that level after being properly positioned.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views", with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line", and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour". Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

### Estimation in medical imaging without a gold standard [^82dda7fe]. Academic Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In medical imaging, physicians often estimate a parameter of interest (eg, cardiac ejection fraction) for a patient to assist in establishing a diagnosis. Many different estimation methods may exist, but rarely can one be considered a gold standard. Therefore, evaluation and comparison of different estimation methods are difficult. The purpose of this study was to examine a method of evaluating different estimation methods without use of a gold standard.

Materials and Methods

This method is equivalent to fitting regression lines without the x axis. To use this method, multiple estimates of the clinical parameter of interest for each patient of a given population were needed. The authors assumed the statistical distribution for the true values of the clinical parameter of interest was a member of a given family of parameterized distributions. Furthermore, they assumed a statistical model relating the clinical parameter to the estimates of its value. Using these assumptions and observed data, they estimated the model parameters and the parameters characterizing the distribution of the clinical parameter.

Results

The authors applied the method to simulated cardiac ejection fraction data with varying numbers of patients, numbers of modalities, and levels of noise. They also tested the method on both linear and nonlinear models and characterized the performance of this method compared to that of conventional regression analysis by using x-axis information. Results indicate that the method follows trends similar to that of conventional regression analysis as patients and noise vary, although conventional regression analysis outperforms the method presented because it uses the gold standard which the authors assume is unavailable.

Conclusion

The method accurately estimates model parameters. These estimates can be used to rank the systems for a given estimation task.

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (2D based formulas, truncated ellipsoid) indicates partial correction for shape distortions and less dependence on geometrical assumptions than linear measurements; however, this approach requires good image quality and properly oriented parasternal short‑axis views without oblique planes and good epicardial definition, uses a cumbersome methodology with higher measurement variability, and is limited by few published normative data and limited prognostic data.

Complexification of ordinary differential equations

The complexified version(z = x + iy) leads to the two-dimensional dynamical system:

The real axis is an invariant subspace, retrieving our real results; yet complexification endows the dynamics with an intriguing capability: as Fig. 4a, b illustrates through the (x, y) phase plane, collapse is avoided in the presence of a minuscule imaginary part. Large elliptical-looking trajectories are traced on the phase plane, eventually returning to the neighborhood of the sole fixed point of (0, 0) — which in the real case one would characterize as semi-stable. The system of Eq. (19) can be tackled in closed form since the ODEyields 1/ z = − t + 1/ z (0). For z = x + iy (z (0) = x 0 + iy 0) we obtain the explicit orbit formulaEliminating time by dividing the two ODEs within Eq. (19) directly yields an ODE for y = y (x) (rather than the parametric forms of Eqs. (20), (21)). From this ODE, one can obtain that the quantityis an invariant of the phase plane dynamics, and thus the latter can be written as x² + (y − R)² = R², where. That is, the trajectory evolves along circles of radius R in the upper (resp. lower) half plane if y 0 > 0 (resp. y 0 < 0.) Approaching the axis with y 0 → 0, the curvature of these circles tends to 0 and their radius to ∞ (retrieving the real dynamics as a special case). Figure 4 through its planar projections illustrates not only the radial projection of the dynamics in the x − y plane, but the x − t and y − t dependencies.

### Preoperative determination of artificial chordae length [^c3e59d19]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

We present a practical and accurate way to measure artificial chordae length in mitral valve repair. During preoperative transesophageal echocardiography, the distance between the head of the posterior papillary muscle and the mitral annulus plane at the coaptation of the leaflets is measured; this is the length of the new chorda. Every millimeter of braided 4–0 Gore-Tex (W.L. Gore & Assoc, Flagstaff, AZ) contains two tight reverse knots; therefore, the number of the knots determines the accurate length of the artificial chorda.

### Simple, safe and easy technique to ensure the correct length of artificial chordae in mitral valve repair [^e9a47532]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Replacement of diseased chordae with Gore-Tex sutures (W. L. Gore & Assoc, Flagstaff, AZ) in patients with degenerative mitral valve insufficiency has become a standard technique used by surgeons in mitral valve repair with good long-term results. Nevertheless, determining the correct length of the artificial chordae has remained problematic. Although various procedures have been previously published, in this article we describe our approach used to achieve an accurate chordal height adjustment.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^075005b9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regions A and B are geometrically symmetric about the z = 0 plane, with minimum energy solutions (assuming no E‐field constraint) yielding z‐symmetric field solutions and zero B 0 concomitant fields. Hence, the open diamond starting point (representing the minimum energy solution with no E‐field constraints) for the solid and dashed curves (in both black and green cases) coincide. The symmetry is broken by the addition of a patient model with an E‐field constraint.

The knee in the curves marks the point where magnetic energy, current density, and winding complexity increase rapidly as E max is driven to lower values. These complexities render unrealizable or impractical any gradient designs on the vertical portions of the curves to the left of the knee. Examination of winding patterns indicates that solutions that exhibit energy increases > 25% (or even less depending on coil type) above the global minimum energy become unrealizable (eg, demonstrating two or more "eyes" per half coil [four or more total eyes for an x or y coil] in the fingerprint wire patterns).

The red and purple dotted curves in Figure 2 represent two practical cases in which the primary coil currents are restricted to a single inner surface near the patient and the shield coil currents to an outer cylinder, while at the same time adding torque and eddy current constraints. Line segments acd of Figure 1 represent a primary winding surface consisting of a cone and a cylinder, whereas line segment ab represents its cylindrical shield winding; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 8, 22 and results in the red dotted curves in Figure 2. A second case is defined by restricting primary currents to the cylinder represented by line segment cd and shield currents to the cylinder ab; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 28 and produces the purple dotted curves in Figure 2. For both configurations, the eddy current surface is a 1‐m‐long, 620‐mm‐diameter cylinder, centered about the gradient isocenter and placed outside the shield winding of the gradient coil. The time = 0 eddy current error is constrained to a peak deviation less than 0.1% of the ideal gradient field on the surface of a 20‐cm‐diameter volume, corresponding to 100 µT for a 1 T/m step change in gradient strength. The torque constraint is set to zero for a uniform z‐directed B 0 main magnetic field. There is no net force for a perfectly uniform main B 0 field in all calculations.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^379d260f]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparing the E max results in Figure 2 for the real ESP gradient coil with the theoretical best (vertical asymptotes) for region BC, we predict that E max ‐constrained solutions could yield E‐field reductions as much as about 34% for the X coil and about 22% for the Y coil. To reduce the E‐field, the curves in Figure 2 indicate that placing windings on the conical section in addition to the cylindrical primary section (acd) should be beneficial; this finding is consistent with previous literature. 8, 22 There may be practical challenges; for example, allowing windings on the conical surface may lead to additional manufacturing complexity. Nonetheless, the methods described here can be used to help make rational tradeoff determinations for any real designs.

Perhaps the most dramatic result of our work is the realization that the minimum E‐field is relatively insensitive to the gradient coil inner diameter; this means that major gains in PNS performance can be achieved even for body‐sized gradient coils optimized for imaging the head. As shown by the A‐region blue curves of Figure 2, the vertical asymptote is virtually identical to the head‐only BC‐region asymptote, and Figure 3 shows remarkable E max reductions of 1.8‐fold for the X coil and 2.8‐fold for the Y coil. This shows the potential to achieve head gradient levels of PNS performance without having to sacrifice extremely valuable patient bore space, although at the cost of increased magnetic energy and increased gradient amplifier power requirements compared with head gradients. The methods presented here will allow these optimal designs to be identified and rendered to practice with trade‐offs evaluated rationally and with reference to theoretical limits.

We note that a possible implementation option, similar to that proposed in previous literature, 20 is the design of symmetric or asymmetric gradient windings with a separate winding intended to add or remove the concomitant field during head or body imaging; this independent control of main gradient and concomitant fields may permit more flexible control of E‐fields over a range of body positions. It would be straightforward to make these coils electrically orthogonal and torque‐balanced.

Applying the E max ‐constrained gradient design concepts to body size coils, Figure 6 shows that even with a 40‐cm imaging region diameter, significant improvements in PNS performance (1.5‐fold to 3‐fold) are achievable for head imaging, although these major gains may reverse when imaging other body regions. Such large gains in PNS performance for head imaging may easily justify the trade‐offs for body imaging.

Parasternal long-axis (PLAX) view — left ventricle linear measurements specify that LV wall thickness and chamber dimension are measured at end-diastole, defined as the first video frame immediately after mitral leaflet closure, and if mitral motion is not visible, end-diastole may be identified as the peak of the R wave on the electrocardiogram; papillary muscles should not be visible in the PLAX view, the electronic caliper is positioned at the interface of the compacted myocardium of the interventricular septum and a line drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the left ventricle to the inner border of the compacted myocardium of the posterior wall, the measurement should be obtained at a level just below the MV leaflet tips, the interventricular septum and LV posterior wall should be measured at the same time and level as the LV end-diastolic dimension, only the compacted tissue of the septum should be included taking care to avoid including RV trabeculation, the insertion of the moderator band, or the TV apparatus, care must be taken to avoid including the MV apparatus, the echo loop should be advanced frame by frame to aid in differentiating posterior wall from leaflets and chordae tendineae, the LV end-systolic dimension should be obtained at the smallest cavity dimension usually the frame preceding the initial early diastolic opening of the MV just distal to the MV leaflet tips, and in the presence of isolated thickening of the basal septum the measurement location is LV apex to just beyond the septal bulge making all linear measurements at this level and these measurements should remain perpendicular to the long axis of the ventricle.

Measurement of localization exponent γ

We now focus on the localized regime, far away from E c, marked by the black rectangle in Fig. 4 a. Given the presence of strong interactions, it is reasonable to assume that transport in this localized part of the energy spectrum proceeds through Efros–Shklovskii (ES) type hopping mechanism. The localization exponent γ determines the T dependence of longitudinal conductance G x x, :withThe pre-factor G 0 ∝ 1/ T and δ ν = (ν − ν c). Figure 4 b shows plots of log(T G x x) versus T −1/2 at different values of δ ν; the dotted lines are linear fits to the data. The linearity of the data at low- T is consistent with transport by the ES hopping mechanism in the FQH regime (Eq. (4)). At high- T (in the region marked in Fig. 4 b by a dotted ellipse), the values of G x x become relatively large, and the plots deviate from a straight line. In passing, we note that as we move progressively closer to the center of the plateau in R x y, where the value of G x x ≈ 0 at low- T, the linearity of the plots persists to higher temperatures. Fitting T 0 (estimated from Eqn (4)) and ∣ δ ν C F ∣ to Eq. (5), we find the estimated γ to lie in the range 2.3−2.6 (Fig. 4 c) for FQH plateau-to-plateau transitions, very close to the predicted range of γ = 2.3−2.5. The fact that the exponent controlling the divergence of the localization length at criticality is almost identical for both FQH and IQH states points to an effective model of localization that is universal across the different statistics of the quasiparticles in these QH phases. Furthermore, from κ = 1/ z γ ≈ 0.41 ± 0.03 and γ ≈ 2.3, we get z ≈ 1, as expected for a strongly interacting system.

3 RESULTS

Figure 2 shows the general form of the E max versus magnetic energy curves for all configurations studied, and for each of the X, Y, and Z coils. These L‐shaped curves demonstrate that the maximum E‐field on the body can, in some cases, be reduced substantially without dramatic increase in magnetic energy. However, below a certain constrained E‐field value, characterized by the knee of the curve, the magnetic energy begins to rise rapidly. There is a well‐defined minimum achievable E‐field shown by the vertical asymptote of each curve.

### Excitation and geometrically matched local encoding of curved slices [^f333f677]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In this work, the concept of excitation and geometrically matched local in-plane encoding of curved slices (ExLoc) is introduced. ExLoc is based on a set of locally near-orthogonal spatial encoding magnetic fields, thus maintaining a local rectangular shape of the individual voxels and avoiding potential problems arising due to highly irregular voxel shapes. Unlike existing methods for exciting curved slices based on multidimensional radiofrequency-pulses, excitation and geometrically matched local encoding of curved slices does not require long duration or computationally expensive radiofrequency-pulses. As each encoding field consists of a superposition of potentially arbitrary (spatially linear or nonlinear) magnetic field components, the resulting field shape can be adapted with high flexibility to the specific region of interest. For extended nonplanar structures, this results in improved relevant volume coverage for fewer excited slices and thus increased efficiency. In addition to the mathematical description for the generation of dedicated encoding fields and data reconstruction, a verification of the ExLoc concept in phantom experiments and examples for in vivo curved single and multislice imaging are presented.

Trajectory analyses

The mean-square displacement (MSD) and diffusion coefficients were analyzed following a method developed earlier. Trajectories with length > 8 frames were selected for MSD and diffusion coefficient analyses. For each track, the MSD (t) was calculated from the following formula:

where n = t /∆ t, L is the length of the trajectory (number of frames), and r (s) is the two-dimensional position of the particle in frame s (s = 0 corresponds to the start of the trajectory). The diffusion coefficient for a spot was determined by fitting a line to MSD (n ∆ t) with n ranging from 1 to the largest integer ≤ L /4.

The natural logarithm of diffusion coefficients for all tracks (> 8 frames) in each condition were pooled to obtain the log(D) density histogram with the number of bins of 800. The data were then fitted into one-component and two-component Gaussian mixture (univariate, unequal variance) models by using the R package mclust with default settings. The package provides the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess how well the model explains the data. For all density distributions of TMK1, flotillin1 and ROP6 particles that were obtained and analyzed in this study, the two-component model yielded significantly higher BIC values than the one-component model, indicating the better fit. Each fit to the two-component model outputs a set of parameters: the mean (µ 1, µ 2), standard deviation (σ 1, σ 2) and proportional weights (α 1, α 2) for each component in the model. The mean (m 1, m 2) and variance (v 1, v 2) of the lognormal distribution for each component is calculated based on the following equations:

The overall average of diffusion coefficient (m overall) and variance (v overall) is calculated based on the following equations:

The calculated m 1, m 2, and m overall correspond to D 0, D 1, and D overall in Supplementary Table 1. Violin plots in the main and Supplementary Figs. (Figs. 3 f, 4 f, 5 c, 5 f, 5h, 6 c, 6f; Supplementary Fig. 9B, D, F, I) show the distribution of the original diffusion coefficients without the log transformation. Distributions of log-transformed datasets are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. The overall diffusion coefficients were used to determine statistical significance of treatment effects.

Aortic annulus measurement orientation and pitfalls: Correct measurement uses a centrally positioned diameter and central closure of leaflets with the long axis of the ascending aorta providing orthogonal orientation of the annular diameter; incorrect approaches include eccentric annular measurement with hinge points slightly displaced upward and not corresponding to the nadir of cusp attachments, and oblique annular measurement; the annulus is "virtual" and only defined by the hinge-points of the three aortic valve leaflets, with its plane approximately perpendicular to the long-axis of the aorta; attempting to measure 2 hinge-points typically measures within the sinuses of Valsalva and overestimates the annulus.

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (linear method, M‑mode tracing) emphasizes acquisition and use characteristics: linear internal measurements should be obtained from the parasternal approach, perpendicular to the LV long axis at the level of the mitral valve leaflet tips; M‑mode measurements should be from a targeted short‑axis (SAX) or parasternal long‑axis (LAX) view, and all measurements should be at end‑diastole. Advantages are that the method is fast and widely used, has demonstrated prognostic value, is fairly accurate in normally shaped ventricles (e.g., systemic hypertension, aortic stenosis), and is simple for screening large populations. Limitations include frequent off‑axis beam orientation, the cubed nature of linear measurements increasing error impact, overestimation of LV mass, and inaccuracy with asymmetric hypertrophy, dilated ventricles, and diseases with regional wall‑thickness variation.

Common Volume Geometric Methods Used in the Clinic

Composite midpoint integration method

The commonly used composite midpoint integration method applies to parallel stacks of short‐axis image planes that, ideally, encompass the entire extent of the LV from the mitral valve annulus to the apex (Figure 1). The LVV is estimated by multiplying the observed cavity area on each slice, A, times the slice thickness, h, to get the volume contribution of each slice, and summing these over all slices (Eqn. 1 in Figure 1). This "stack of disks" approach is also commonly referred to as the Simpson's Rule; however, in mathematics the Simpson's Rule refers specifically to integration using quadric polynomials. 22 In this article, the in‐plane cavity area was computed numerically from the user‐selected LV endocardial contour, but in the clinic is often approximated from 1 or 2 user‐defined diameter measurements and a circular or elliptical model for the in‐plane area. A common variant implemented by Wyatt et al 17 models the most apical aspect of the LV as a hemisphere that emanates from the bottom half of the most apical slice (Eqn. 2 in Figure 1).

### Optimal technique for measurement of linear left ventricular dimensions [^1507a1ff]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Echocardiographic assessment of the left ventricle (LV) begins with the measurement of linear dimensions that approximate its ellipsoid diameter. These linear dimensions have historically been measured at the basal level of the LV, which is not representative of its true diameter. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal level to measure LV cavity dimensions to more accurately estimate its size and mass.

Methods

The derivation study included 75 patients who had a clinically indicated cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) exam for ischemic heart disease (n = 15), nonischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 25), or normal studies (n = 35). The three-chamber bright blood cine sequence was analyzed using a custom MATLAB program to measure the LV cavity diameter and wall thickness at 15 equidistant levels from base to apex. The linear measurements from each of these levels were compared against the CMR volumetric reference standard. The validation study included 100 patients who had a clinically indicated echocardiogram and CMR within 3 days for ischemic heart disease (n = 20), nonischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 44), and normal or near-normal studies (n = 36). The parasternal long-axis cine sequence was analyzed to measure the LV cavity diameter and wall thickness at the traditional basal level and the midventricular level, which were compared against the CMR volumetric reference standard.

Results

In both the derivation and validation studies, the midventricular linear dimensions, defined as those located at the true (maximal) diameter of the LV ellipsoid cavity, were found to be more closely correlated with the volumetric reference standard for LV mass, LV end-diastolic size, and LV ejection fraction.

Conclusions

Measurement of linear dimensions at the midventricular level better reflects the ellipsoid geometry of the LV cavity and provides a more accurate estimate of LV mass, size, and systolic function as compared with the traditionally recommended basal level.

### Design of a logarithmic k-space spiral trajectory [^3d2eeeb3]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Spiral acquisitions are used in fast cardiac imaging because they traverse k-space efficiently and minimize flow artifacts. A variable pitch logarithmic spiral trajectory is designed to critically sample the low-frequency region in k-space and gradually undersample the high-frequency region. An approximate analytical expression for the trajectory provides a fast means to calculate the gradient waveforms and the sampled data points. A numerical method is introduced based on the trajectory curvature and the rate of change in the gradient magnitude with time for the composite Archimedean-logarithmic trajectory. The pulse sequence is implemented and images are acquired on phantoms and human hearts. The images show improved image resolution and some improvement in image quality as a result of increased extent in k-space and reduction in aliasing artifacts, respectively.

### Numerical simulation of double-wave vector experiments investigating diffusion in randomly oriented ellipsoidal pores [^3b8419dd]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Double-wave vector diffusion weighting is expected to represent a possibility to acquire information on cell size and shape. In numerical simulations, a theoretical description of the double wave vector-weighted signal is tested in a situation where the approximating assumptions (infinitely short gradient pulses, infinitely long diffusion time, infinitely long or zero delay between diffusion weightings, small gradient moment) are not strictly met. It is shown how the dependence of the signal on the angle between the diffusion gradient directions changes upon varying the delay between the second and the third gradient pulse, and how the measures of pore geometry derived from signal differences between two angles depend on the duration, temporal separation, and amplitude of the gradient pulses. The results indicate that a violation of the approximation conditions due to finite gradient pulse duration and separation generally leads to an underestimation of pore size and pore eccentricity. It is also concluded from the simulations that for pore sizes on the order of 10 microm the investigated effects are in a range that is observable even with whole-body gradient systems.

FIGURE 4
A, A region contours of constant Bz for Y gradient coil, with (red) and without (black) E max optimization, showing that gradient distortion is virtually identical despite the peak E‐field being reduced by a factor of 2.8 for the Y coil. B, Difference in the B y components of the gradient field with versus without E‐field optimization. Values are normalized to the gradient strength yielding units of length (mm) and show a highly uniform concomitant y‐directed field added to the optimized (asymmetric) solution. C, Wire pattern representing the difference between optimized (asymmetric) and nonoptimized (symmetric) solutions with same current scaling as Figure 3. Similar results are obtained for the X gradient coil

The key difference between the E‐field minimized and nonminimized solutions is the addition of a uniform concomitant B 0 field component in the x or y direction. Figure 4B shows a difference plot of the concomitant B y field, normalized to gradient strength (units of millimeters), which is responsible for the reduction in E‐field. Figure 4C shows the winding that would need to be added to the Y symmetric coil (Figure 3B) to obtain the winding pattern of the Y asymmetric coil (Figure 3D), and shows the fundamental difference between the two solutions. The winding in Figure 4C produces a uniform field transverse to the main B 0 field, resulting in a concomitant component with additional magnetic stored energy. Conceptually, this can be thought of as a second coil, which if activated, converts the symmetric coil into an asymmetric coil with reduced E‐field but otherwise identical distortion. The added concomitant field in Figure 4B is highly uniform with a 0.85% variation over the 26‐cm imaging region, resulting in minimal distortion of the desired gradient field; this concomitant field can be compensated with a phase/frequency offset correction by the scanner. Figure 4B shows that the average concomitant field of 88.5 mm within the imaging region can be directly compared with the z 0x defined by Meier et al, 29 in which a value of 127 mm was reported for an asymmetric head gradient. The z 0x for both the ESP and HG2 gradients are approximately 120 mm 30; these are both fully asymmetric designs (single eye per half coil with all return currents flowing above the head), similar to the original concept defined by Roemer. 12 The X coil of Figure 3 requires a smaller concomitant field (z 0y = 57.8 mm) than the Y coil, reflecting a decreased need to pull E‐field off the torso region due to the smaller extent of the body in the anterior–posterior direction.

Modified midpoint method (Eqn. 2)

The results using the Wyatt modified midpoint method for the same slice variants are shown in Figure 7 B and Table 2. In general, the error in LVV and LVEF was larger than those for the standard composite midpoint integration method, especially for the 6‐slice and 4‐slice variants. The LVEF error when using 6 slices ranged from −3.5% to 7.7%. One 4‐slice variant and 1 6‐slice variant underestimated LVV at the lower volumes while overestimating it at high volumes. Presumably this occurred when the heart apex moved downward into the most apical short‐axis slice, which originally did not contribute to LVV, causing a spike in the estimate.

The variability of length and area measurements from the 12 available long‐axis views, measured at end‐systole and end‐diastole, are given in Table 3. The extent of the LV cavity in the long‐axis view was constrained by the mitral value Teflon ring at the base, and the observed lowest extent of the LV cavity toward the apex for each slice.

Bi‐plane ellipse (Eqn. 3) and bullet (Eqn. 4) methods

The bi‐plane ellipse and bullet methods differ only by a scaling factor (2/3 versus 5/6). Shown in Figure 7 C are the volume versus time plots for these methods. Table 4 provides the accuracy of the volume estimates over the physiologic filling range for these and 3 additional long‐axis‐based methods. The LVEF values and errors are the same for both methods because they differ only by a scaling factor. The LVEF error for the 4‐chamber view was 9.1% (an overestimation). The SD in LVEF error using both methods was 8.4%, with range −12.1% to 16.5%. Using 2 times the LVEF SD as a measure of uncertainty, the measurement uncertainty is 17% when using this approach.

FIGURE 1
Comparison of OGSE gradient waveforms, their zeroth moments (q‐space trajectories), and q‐space cumulative integrals (left) and gradient moment power spectra (right). Each quantity is plotted for: (A) a standard OGSE waveform with a half‐period gap and a correction to the external lobes to null the cumulative gradient area, (B) an original gap‐filled OGSE shape with gap duration T gap, and (C) a further modified gap‐filled shape providing flow compensation. Like quantities are plotted to the same scale with units arbitrary. All OGSE gradient shapes have the same oscillation period T (corresponding to oscillation frequency ω 0 = 2π/ T) and amplitude. The second gradient pulse for each shape is a time‐reversed and inverted version of the first gradient pulse, as gradient plots show effective shapes by accounting for the inversion of the first gradient pulse by the refocusing RF pulse. The outer lobes of gradient shapes (A) and (B) are specified as having durations of T /4 and T /2 for simplicity, but the timing corrections (which cannot be discerned on this scale) slightly alter their true durations. These shapes are plotted for 30 Hz waveforms with gradient amplitude 80 mT/m, slew rate 200 mT/m/ms, and gap duration 4.4 ms. Relative differences between the power spectra have only minor dependencies on these parameters and principally depend on the relative durations of a period, a ramp, and the gap

General results

This approach first shows unambiguously that the mean FPT is finite. Indeed, we show in SI (Section B) that the solution to Eq. (8) satisfies at long timeswhich can be checked directly in numerical simulations, see figure 4b. This scaling, together with Eq. (6), shows that the mean FPT is finite. This contradicts the results obtained with the generalized Fokker–Planck equationor with the Wilemski-Fixman approximation. The latter amounts to assuming that the process is at all times in an equilibrium state, and would thus yield m π (t) ≃ L ϕ (t), leading to an infinite mean FPT when α < 1 (as noted earlier in a similar, but out of equilibrium, situation). Beyond this proof of finiteness, our approach yields a quantitative determination of 〈 T 〉 by solving numerically the integral equation (8) for m π (t) and next using Eq. (6); this shows quantitative agreement with numerical simulations in Fig. 3.

### Centering the projection reconstruction trajectory: reducing gradient delay errors [^4b3d64dc]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The projection reconstruction (PR) trajectory was investigated for the effect of gradient timing delays between the actual and requested start time of each physical gradient. Radial trajectories constructed with delayed gradients miss the center of k-space in an angularly dependent manner, causing effective echo times to vary with projection angle. The gradient timing delays were measured in phantoms, revealing delays on the x, y, and z gradients which differed by as much as 5 micro sec. Using this one-time calibration measurement, the trajectories were corrected for gradient delays by addition of compensatory gradient areas to the prephasers of the logical x and y readout gradients. Effective projection-to-projection echo time variability was reduced to less than 1 micro sec for all imaging orientations. Using corrected trajectories, artifacts were reduced in phantom images and in volunteer studies. This correction should potentiate greater clinical use of the PR trajectory.

### Geometric characteristics of bicuspid aortic valves [^0d823006]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

The following geometric parameters were measured:
A. The length of the raphe (Figure 1, A and B).
B. The absolute sinus surfaces (Figure 1, C and D) to evaluate the morphological trend of sinuses within the bicuspid asymmetry. This enabled us to determine the contribution of each sinus to the total aortic sinus surface and to assess their correlation with other parameters.
C. Relative sinus surface, which is the corresponding surface compared with a reference circle with a fixed radius and center E (Figure 1, E and F) and was given as a percentage of each sinus exceeding the reference circle. Three fixed points were placed at the level of maximum sinus dimensions (points J, G, and H). Then another series of three fixed points were placed on the created circle on the corresponding lines toward J, G, and H, respectively named I, K, and L. The distance |GK|, |HL|, and |IJ| were measured. The other 3 lines were drawn between I, K, and L and the center of the circle E (segments |IE|, |KE|, and |LE|), and the sections were measured. The left relative sinus was obtained as | HL|/HE. Similarly, the relative surfaces of the other sinuses were calculated as | GK|/GE and |IJ|/IE, for the right and noncoronary sinsues (NCS), respectively.
D. The coaptation angle α,: The angle between 2 lines drawn from nonfused commissures to the coaptation midpoint (Figure 2, A and B).
E. The angle β: The angle between 2 lines drawn from 1 nonfused commissure and the center point of the perfect circle created (Figure 2, C and D).
F. The angle γ: The angle between the raphe, and a line drawn between the commissures and the perfect midpoint (Figure 2, E and F). Angles γ 1 and γ 2 were comprised between each of the nonfused commissures and the raphe toward the coaptation midpoint.
G. Angles ε 1 and ε 2 (Figure 2, G and H): The angles between lines drawn from nonfused commissures on 1 hand and fused commissure on the other hand toward the perfect midpoint. Together with β, they were used to determine position consistency between commissures. To confirm the hypothesis of the fixed position of the commissures between the right and the left cusp, and the left and the noncoronary cusp, ε 2 should be a constant.

The aortic annulus was determined following the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography guidelines. Figure E2 shows the method used in the case of the BAV with only 2 sinuses.

### Calibration of gradient propagation delays for accurate two-dimensional radiofrequency pulses [^0fbd3ef6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hardware-related delays between the requested and actual start times of the gradient waveforms on each physical axis are of particular importance for multidimensional selective excitation in which the synchronization of gradient and radiofrequency (RF) waveforms is critical. A method is proposed for the accurate calibration of gradient propagation delays to optimize the spatial accuracy of 2D RF pulses, although the results may also be used to reduce artifacts in other MR techniques. The sensitivity of 2D RF pulses to uncorrected time shifts between the gradient and RF waveforms was exploited to calibrate accurately the propagation delays on each physical gradient axis. This was achieved using a technique that relates the effect of gradient delays in the component waveforms of a constant-angular rate spiral k-space trajectory 2D RF pulse to the spatial location of the subsequent excitation profile. Comparison was also made with a procedure based on a previously described k-space plotting method, showing broad agreement, but with some discrepancies that illustrate the value of a self-referenced correction method for multidimensional RF pulses.

### Accuracy of left ventricular cavity volume and ejection fraction for conventional estimation methods and 3D surface fitting [^293c6e79]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conformal 3D surface fitting

A conformal 3D surface model can be used to combine information from multiple views while interpolating through regions where surface information is sparse. Several methods have been proposed for surface modelling, including finite elements, 26, 27 3D active contours, 28 and surface B‐splines. 18 In this article, the endocardial LV surfaces were represented as an analytical equation for the radial distance, λ, as a function of the longitudinal and circumferential angles, φ and θ, expressed in a prolate‐spheroidal coordinate system, as described previously. 29 The series expansion is given by:where a = [a 0, a 1, a 2, a 3,…] are the coefficients to be fitted, P l |m| (x) are the Associated Legendre Polynomials, and the vector transpose of E, E T are the terms in the series: [1, sin(φ) sin(θ), cos(θ), cos(φ) sin(θ),…]. The 0th‐order term represents the prolate‐spheroidal shell (an ellipsoid) that best fits the contour data. The higher order terms introduce surface modulations onto this elliptical shell. The advantage of using a prolate‐spheroidal coordinate system over Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems is that it achieves a close representation of the heart geometry with relatively few terms, thereby giving a higher statistical confidence in the fit. For each sampled surface point, p, and its corresponding set of coordinates, (λ p, θ p, φ p), each term in the vector E is evaluated. From all sampled surface points, a series of simultaneous equations is created and the unknown coefficients, a, are solved using singular value decomposition. 30 The best‐fit location of the centroid and apical focal point of the coordinate system are determined by using a 0th‐order fit and adjusting their locations to achieve the least‐squares minimum miss between the ellipsoid and the sampled surface points. Once the coefficients were determined, a grid of 40 circumferential by 40 longitudinal surface mesh points were defined, with the top of the mesh being open and coinciding with the mitral valve ring. This grid density (1600 points in total) was determined to introduce negligible error to the volume estimation (data not shown).

Tug-of-war model reproduces the positioning transition

An analytical expression of the tug-of-war model (Eq.

Numerical simulations considering the cluster motion coupled with periodic actomyosin waves and stochastic network percolation were also performed, which reproduce the size-dependent transition as well (Fig. 7, markers, Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Fig. 14, Supplementary Movies 18 and 19).

(Bottom) Thereafter, the edge probability was determined from the DC-ratio, where a DC-ratio > 0.8 and < 0.2 was classified as the "edge" and the "center", respectively. a F-actin length L was changed with the fixed crosslinker concentration (C 0 = 1 μM). Purple circles, blue triangles, and orange squares represent numerical simulations with L = 4 μm, L = 8 μm, and L = 12 μm, respectively. Solid curves are the corresponding analytical solutions. b Crosslinker concentration C 0 was changed with the fixed F-actin length (L = 8 μm). Purple circles, blue triangles, and orange squares represent numerical simulations with C 0 = 0.1 μM, C 0 = 1 μM, and C 0 = 10 μM, respectively. Solid curves are the corresponding analytical solutions. We defined different DC-ratio thresholds for the edge region from the experiments, because numerical simulations were performed for clusters without their finite volume, in which the centroid of the clusters is possible to reach the droplet boundary.

The top row shows results with no E‐field constraint, which exhibits a naturally symmetric solution corresponding to the open diamond on the blue curve of Figure 2. The X‐gradient and Y‐gradient windings are identical; however, the Y coil induces larger E‐fields due to the greater cross‐sectional diameter of the body in the left–right direction. The bottom row shows the minimum‐E max designs; the winding patterns for X and Y coils are not identical to each other, but in both cases result in significantly reduced E‐field magnitudes compared with the unconstrained E‐field designs in the top row.

Mitral Annulus Assessment Using a 3D Workstation

Native Valve

Accurately measuring annular size in a native mitral valve is crucial in valve sizing for TMVR planning. The prosthetic valve must provide an adequate seal to prevent further valve dysfunction. For example, paravalvular regurgitation may occur if the prosthesis is too small relative to the size of the mitral annulus. Providing these measurements can, however, be challenging. Unlike the aortic valve annulus, the mitral valve annulus is a nonplanar structure and has a saddle shape. 27 The anterior peak of this saddle is continuous with the aortic annulus, the posterior peak is the insertion of the posterior mitral valve leaflet, and the nadirs of the saddle are at the level of the medial and lateral fibrous trigones (Figure 1). Because the mitral annulus is nonplanar, accurate measurement for device sizing is challenging. Blanke et al have proposed that the anterior horn of the saddle‐shaped annulus be excluded for TMVR assessment, creating a "D‐shaped" annulus suitable for planar measurements, with the anterior border a virtual line connecting the fibrous trigones. 25, 28 One disadvantage of using the D‐shape annulus approach, however, is that it does not always correspond with the shape of the device, which can be circular, depending on the degree of capture at the level of the trigones. Importantly, the entire geometric shape of the device needs to be taken into account in assessing for neo‐LVOT obstruction.

Figure 1
Performing mitral annular measurements and defining the annular plane on cardiac computerized tomography. A, Short‐axis view of the mitral annular region demonstrates the medial (black arrow) and lateral (white arrow) fibrous trigones, the anterior mitral valve leaflet (arrowhead), with delineation of the annular perimeter (red oval). The green and red lines in (B) demonstrate the orientation of the commissural view in (C) and long‐axis view in (D), with delineation of the mitral annular plane.

The annular plane can be defined by using a combination of short and long axis reformats of the left ventricle, which can identify the insertion points of the mitral valve leaflets (Figure 1). Once the annular plane has been defined, the maximum and minimum annular diameters, annulus area, and perimeter can be measured (Figure 2). By performing these measurements at the maximal annular size, information on prosthesis sizing can be provided, reducing the risk of significant post device implantation paravalvular regurgitation.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^c81e9c9f]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To develop new concepts for minimum electric-field (E-field) gradient design, and to define the extents to which E-field can be reduced in gradient design while maintaining a desired imaging performance.

Methods

Efficient calculation of induced electric field in simplified patient models was integrated into gradient design software, allowing constraints to be placed on the peak E-field. Gradient coils confined to various build envelopes were designed with minimum E-fields subject to standard magnetic field constraints. We examined the characteristics of E-field-constrained gradients designed for imaging the head and body and the importance of asymmetry and concomitant fields in achieving these solutions.

Results

For transverse gradients, symmetric solutions create high levels of E-fields in the shoulder region, while fully asymmetric solutions create high E-fields on the top of the head. Partially asymmetric solutions result in the lowest E-fields, balanced between shoulders and head and resulting in factors of 1.8 to 2.8 reduction in E-field for x-gradient and y-gradient coils, respectively, when compared with the symmetric designs of identical gradient distortion.

Conclusions

We introduce a generalized method for minimum E-field gradient design and define the theoretical limits of magnetic energy and peak E-field for gradient coils of arbitrary cylindrical geometry.

Calculation of sequence complexity

Sequence complexity is calculated based on Shannon's entropy. For a DNA sequence S of length L (L > 3) with alphabet {A, T, C, G}, the number of each k -mer (k = 1, 2, 3) is stored as an arraywhere m i (i = 0, 1, …, n) is the number of a certain k-mer, and n = 4 k. For example, if S = ACGCAGCGAGCAG, then c 1 = [4, 4, 5] since there are 4 'A's, 4 'C's and 5 'G's. Then, where e k is the dot product of the two vectors. The complexity of S is the smallest of e 1, e 2 and e 3.

Optimization of PDRs

PDRs are regions where primer candidates are generated, and primer candidates are subsequences of a PDR. A PDR is defined by its start coordinate p and stop coordinate p + l − 1 (closed interval), where l is the length of the PDR (40 by default). All PDRs have the same length. The risk of the PDR is then defined as sum(r [p: p + l − 1]), where r is the risk array.

Generation of one PDR

Each PDR is randomly selected within a certain region C (Supplementary Fig. 12, also see green boxes in Fig. 2 a), the length of C is greater than or equal to l. The risk of all possible PDRs within C is calculated, and PDRs with risk below X th percentile are considered candidate PDRs. Here percentile is defined as a PDR risk threshold below which percentage X of PDRs fall. In short, not all possible PDRs within region C is included for random selection, and the worst PDRs are excluded to accelerate the optimization process. Therefore, a lower X means a more stringent selection on PDR candidates. X is set to 30 by default to balance optimization efficiency and effectiveness (Fig. 2). This is also discussed in "Optimization of PDRs" in Results.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic examination in adults: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^fcbaed23]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Mitral valve (MV) inflow, Valsalva maneuver, and mitral regurgitation (MR) — In the A4C view, a 1- to 3-mm sample volume should be positioned at the tips of the open MV leaflets for PW Doppler recording and placed toward the lateral wall. The peak E and A velocities and MV early diastolic deceleration time should be recorded and measured, and the deceleration time is measured by placing a caliper on the peak E velocity and following the slope of the E wave to the baseline. If the MV appears abnormal, is a prosthetic valve, has been repaired, or shows increased or turbulent velocities, CW Doppler should be used to measure the mean gradient and pressure half-time. For Valsalva, the MV inflow signal should be recorded for 10 to 12 sec before release, and the E velocity should decrease by 20 cm/sec or ≥ 10% for an adequate strain; in normal patients there is typically a relatively equal reduction in E and A velocities, whereas in patients with elevated LA pressure and a pseudonormal filling pattern the E velocity decreases more than the A velocity, reducing the E/A ratio. If MR is present, CW Doppler should be used to record the regurgitant flow in the A4C, A2C, and long axis views, and the flow signal should be traced to calculate a VTI, peak velocity, and peak gradient. In tachycardia and some forms of heart block, significant fusion is present if the beginning of the A wave starts on the E deceleration slope line at an E velocity of > 20 cm/sec; in this setting the deceleration time should not be measured, the E/A ratio is decreased, and the A-wave velocity increased.

### Testing for Hardy-Weinberg proportions: have we lost the plot? [^61bccd14]. The Journal of Heredity (2014). Low credibility.

Testing for Hardy-Weinberg proportions (HWP) is routine in almost all genetic studies of natural populations, but many researchers do not demonstrate a full understanding of the purposes of these tests or how to interpret the results. Common problems include a lack of understanding of statistical power and the difference between statistical significance and biological significance, how to interpret results of multiple tests, and how to distinguish between various factors that can cause statistically significant departures. In this perspective, which focuses on analysis of genetic data for nonmodel species, I 1) review factors that can cause departures from HWP at individual loci and linkage disequilibrium (LD) at pairs of loci; 2) discuss commonly used tests for HWP and LD, with an emphasis on multiple-testing issues; 3) show how to distinguish among possible causes of departures from HWP; and 4) outline some simple steps to follow when significant test results are found. Finally, I 5) identify some issues that merit particular attention as we move into an era in which analysis of genomics-scale datasets for nonmodel species is commonplace.

### Inferring time derivatives including cell growth rates using gaussian processes [^d99eaf3f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Inferring the first and second time derivatives

To determine the time derivative of the data, we use that the derivative of a Gaussian process is another Gaussian process. We can therefore adapt standard techniques for Gaussian process to allow time derivatives to be sampled too.

Building on the work of Boyle, we let g (x) and h (x) be the first and second derivatives with respect to x of the latent function f (x). If f (x) is a Gaussian process then so are both g (x) and h (x). Writing ∂ 1 and ∂ 2 for the partial derivatives with respect to the first and second arguments of a bivariate function, we have

and that

as well as

following ref.

Consequently, the joint probability distribution for y and f *, g * and h * evaluated at points X * is again Gaussian (cf. equation (7)):

where we write K = K (X, X) and K ✱ = K (X *, X *) for clarity.

The covariance function is by definition symmetric: k (x i, x j) = k (x j, x i) from equation (1). Therefore, and so

for all positive integers k and. Consequently, the covariance matrix in equation (13) is also symmetric.

Conditioning on y now gives that the distribution P (f *, g *, h *| X, y, θ, X *) is Gaussian with mean

and covariance matrix

Equation (16) includes equation (9) and shows that

which gives the error in the estimate of the first derivative. Similarly,

is the error in estimating the second derivative.

Using an empirically estimated measurement noise

Although our derivation is given for a Gaussian process where the measurement errors in the data are independent and identically distributed with a Gaussian distribution of mean zero, the derivations are unchanged if the measurement noise has a different s.d. for each time point.

When the magnitude of the measurement noise appears to change with time, we first empirically estimate the relative magnitude of the measurement noise by the variance across all replicates at each time point. We then smooth this estimate over time (with a Gaussian filter with a width of 10% of the total time of the experiment, but the exact choice is not important) and replace the identity matrix, I, in equations (6), (15) and (16) by a diagonal matrix with the relative measurement noise on the diagonal in order to make predictions.

### Evaluation after a first seizure in adults [^32e3209b]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on first seizure in adults:

- **Definition**: A first seizure in adults refers to a single, spontaneous episode of abnormal neuronal activity resulting in transient neurologic dysfunction. It may be classified as either provoked (acute symptomatic) or unprovoked, depending on the presence of an identifiable acute cause.
- **Pathophysiology**: Seizures arise from abnormal, synchronous electrical discharges within the cerebral cortex, reflecting an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. Mechanistically, seizures involve recurrent excitatory synaptic activity and loss of coordinated signaling between neuronal populations. This cortical disorganization leads to transient neurologic dysfunction. In prolonged seizures, normal homeostatic mechanisms may become impaired, exacerbating metabolic stress, altering cerebral perfusion, and increasing the risk of neuronal injury. The pathophysiology varies depending on whether the seizure is provoked (due to acute metabolic, infectious, or structural insults) or unprovoked, which may involve chronic or idiopathic mechanisms including genetic predisposition or remote cerebral injury.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of a first seizure in adults ranges from 23 to 61 cases per 100,000 person-years, with the risk increasing significantly after age 55 and peaking in individuals older than 75. The lifetime risk of experiencing a seizure is up to 10%, while only about 3% of adults are ultimately diagnosed with epilepsy. The rate of first seizures is higher in low- and middle-income countries, which account for around 80% of the global epilepsy burden.
- **Risk factors**: Approximately 40% of first seizures in adults are provoked by identifiable acute factors. Common causes include metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hepatic or renal failure), infections (meningitis, encephalitis), structural brain abnormalities (stroke, traumatic brain injury, tumors), and toxic exposures (alcohol withdrawal, drug intoxication). Inflammatory conditions such as SLE and autoimmune encephalitis may also contribute. Other reversible factors include prescribed medications, sleep deprivation, and substance misuse. Identifying a provoking factor is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, as provoked seizures have a lower risk of recurrence once the underlying cause is resolved. Unprovoked seizures occur without an acute precipitating factor and are more common in younger adults. They are classified as either idiopathic, with no identifiable cause, or secondary to preexisting or remote CNS injury. Known risk factors include prior traumatic brain injury, congenital neurological conditions such as cerebral palsy, and a history of CNS infections. These underlying abnormalities contribute to a higher risk of seizure recurrence and the potential diagnosis of epilepsy.
- **Disease course**: The clinical presentation of a first seizure depends on the site of onset and the pattern of spread. Generalized seizures often begin without warning, while focal seizures may be preceded by an aura, such as a rising epigastric sensation, déjà vu, or unusual tastes or smells. The absence of an aura does not exclude focal onset, especially in seizures originating from the frontal lobe. Convulsive seizures typically begin with a tonic phase of limb stiffening, followed by a clonic phase of rhythmic jerking. These events last approximately 1–3 minutes and may involve open eyes, apnea, and cyanosis. Postictal recovery is often marked by confusion, fatigue, and signs such as lateral tongue biting. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, also known as pseudoseizures, are seizure-like symptoms that are not associated with abnormal brain electrical activity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Adults experiencing a first unprovoked seizure have a 21% to 45% risk of recurrence within the first 2 years, with approximately one-third experiencing a second seizure within the first year. The risk is highest in the initial months following the first event. Factors associated with increased recurrence include a prior brain insult (such as stroke or trauma), epileptiform abnormalities on EEG, structural brain abnormalities on imaging, and a seizure occurring during sleep. Initiating antiseizure medication immediately after the first seizure reduces the risk of recurrence by approximately 35% over the first 2 years. However, early treatment does not improve long-term remission rates beyond 3 years compared to delayed treatment.

### Expanded quantum vortex liquid regimes in the electron nematic superconductors feSeSand FeSeTe [^40a1ceaf]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The strength of thermal fluctuations is usually quantified by the Ginzburg number G i = (1/8 π μ 0) × ((k B T c Γ)/ — itself, a measure of the relative size of the thermal and condensation energies within a coherence volume. Here, k B is the Boltzmann constant, Γ = ξ ∥ (0)/ ξ ⊥ (0) is the anisotropy of H c 2, and ξ ∥ (0) and ξ ⊥ (0) are the in- and out-of-plane coherence lengths at 0 K, respectively. From existing thermodynamic data, G i in FeSe is estimated to be 5 × 10 −4, which is lower than in the cuprates where thermal fluctuations are very strong (10 −3 < G i < 10 −1), but around four orders of magnitude larger than in classical superconductors. Indeed, evidence of strong thermal SC fluctuations has been found in several normal state properties for pure FeSe, as well as for FeSe 1− x S x beyond x c, in line with the broad VL regime found here (see Fig. 3).

As T → 0, the effect of thermal fluctuations inevitably diminishes, leaving only quantum fluctuations of the SC order parameter to influence the vortex dynamics. The persistence of a broad QVL regime in Fig. 3 thus supports the notion that the vortex lattice in FeSe 1− x S x is destabilized at very low temperatures by strong quantum fluctuations inherent in the system. According to the Lindemann criterion, quantum melting occurs when the zero-point amplitude of the vortices becomes an appreciable fraction (typically 0.1–0.2) of the vortex spacing. At that point, there are strong fluctuations in the positions of the vortex lines, i.e. fluctuations in the phase field of the SC order parameter, which leads to the formation of a QVL. (The corresponding amplitude fluctuations can be ignored since they are usually confined to a narrow region around T c and H c 2.)

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^9ac3f0db]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Exploring less common approaches to reducing sample size

We now consider some less standard approaches to bringing the sample size requirements closer to the numbers it is feasible to recruit in a reasonable time frame.

Step 3: Relaxing α by a small amount, beyond traditional values

The much-criticised 5% significance level is used widely in much applied scientific research, but is an arbitrary figure. It is extremely rare for clinical trials to use any other level. It may be argued that this convention has been adopted as a compromise between erroneously concluding a new treatment is more efficacious and undertaking a trial of an achievable size and length. Settings where traditionally sized trials are not possible may be just the area where researchers start to break this convention, for good reason.

In considering the type I error, it is critical to consider the question: 'What are the consequences of erroneously deciding to use a new treatment routinely if it is truly not better?'

Taking the societal perspective as before, we might consider the probability of making a type I error, thus erroneously burdening patients with treatments that do not improve outcomes, or even worsen them, while potentially imposing unnecessary toxicity.

First, for conditions where there are only enough patients available to run one modestly sized randomised trial in a reasonable time frame, research progress will be relatively slow, and making a type I error may be less of a concern than a type II error. In contrast, making several type I errors in a common disease could lead in practice to patients taking several ineffective treatments; for a disease area where only one trial can run at any given time, the overall burden on patients is potentially taking one ineffective treatment that does not work.

Thus, if we take the societal perspective with the trials in Table 1 then, if each trial was analysed with α = 0.05 and we see (hypothetically) 40% positive results, then the expected number of false positive trials is given in the final column. We also assumed 10% and 70% positive results, with qualitatively similar conclusions.

### American Thyroid Association guide to investigating thyroid hormone economy and action in rodent and cell models [^dde23543]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Mouse thyroid high-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS) — technical parameters, anesthesia, and quantification — uses a Vevo 770 system with a single element probe of center frequency of 40 MHz; the transducer has an active face of 3 mm with lateral resolution 68.2 μm and axial resolution 38.5 μm, focal length 6 mm, mechanical index 0.14, and dynamic range 52 dB, with an alternative 30 MHz probe (focal depth 12.7 mm; lateral 115 μm; axial 55 μm). HFUS is performed under general anesthesia using 1.5%-2% isoflurane, real-time imaging can be performed at a frame rate of 20 Hz (temporal resolution 50 milliseconds), and studies can be completed in about 20 minutes. Thyroid lobe volume is calculated by the oval formula (width x depth x length x π/6); adult C57BL/6 thyroid volume ranges between 2.81 and 4.9 μL, increases to volumes that range between 4.1 and 8.8 μL with diffuse goiter, and the smallest detectable nodule diameter is 0.46 mm; features suggestive of malignancy include hypoechogenicity, poorly defined margins, internal microcalcification, irregular shapes, and extraglandular extension.

### Determination of the optimal region for interaliasing distance measurement for flow regurgitant rate calculation: a fluid simulation study [^0deb0885]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Color Doppler imaging of the convergent region is promising for quantifying valvular regurgitation. Nevertheless, proximal isovelocity surface area method has limitations. We sought to determine the optimal localization to measure the most precise flow rate using a new approach: the interaliasing distance.

Methods

A finite volume-based program was used to perform simulations in unsteady flow conditions. Different instantaneous flow rates, leaflet angles, and orifice sizes were tested reproducing physiologic conditions. Relative difference between actual and interaliasing distance flow rate was calculated for each configuration.

Results

The relationship between the relative error and the aliasing velocity location was described by a third-order polynomial equation. The magnitude of relative error is a function of the flow rate, orifice size, and leaflet angle.

Conclusion

The optimal distance from the orifice to measure the interaliasing distance was when the closer aliasing was between 4 and 8 mm from the orifice.

### Charting the landscape of priority problems in psychiatry, part 1: classification and diagnosis [^033871c3]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Contemporary psychiatry faces major challenges. Its syndrome-based disease classification is not based on mechanisms and does not guide treatment, which largely depends on trial and error. The development of therapies is hindered by ignorance of potential beneficiary patient subgroups. Neuroscientific and genetics research have yet to affect disease definitions or contribute to clinical decision making. In this challenging setting, what should psychiatric research focus on? In two companion papers, we present a list of problems nominated by clinicians and researchers from different disciplines as candidates for future scientific investigation of mental disorders. These problems are loosely grouped into challenges concerning nosology and diagnosis (this Personal View) and problems related to pathogenesis and aetiology (in the companion Personal View). Motivated by successful examples in other disciplines, particularly the list of Hilbert's problems in mathematics, this subjective and eclectic list of priority problems is intended for psychiatric researchers, helping to re-focus existing research and providing perspectives for future psychiatric science.

### Comparison of efficiency of PFA catheter designs by computer modeling [^727498d6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3 Clinical versus model waveforms, relationship to efficiency

The above is not to say that waveform is unimportant: it is an additional factor, ‐ combined with catheter design and efficiency‐, that will impact final clinical lesion dimensions, and risk for complications. But how do these clinical waveforms and lesions relate to those of this modeling study? We hypothesized that manufacturers have compensated waveforms when inherent inefficiencies may be found by our study. (Compensations can include adding applications, widening pulse widths, or increasing energy delivery per application). We therefore examined the consistency between our study's efficiency metrics and published energy durations in clinical studies: inefficient catheters are likely to have longer energy durations, we hypothesized.

Our study is not replicating actual lesions after manufacturer compensations and their true waveforms. Rather, we are comparing inherent catheter efficiencies that hypothetically depend on the different mechanical, geometrical, and vectoring approaches taken by manufacturers. We do so with an assumption of an equal waveform used across all catheters, a waveform that produces an electroporation lesion with 600 V/cm (see Section 2.6).

2.4 Catheter and vectoring assumptions

The dimensions and vectoring (electrodes and polarity used to deliver energy) of the circular catheter, flexible splines, and balloon catheters were described in detail in our previous publication. Catheter design, geometry, and electrode spacing were modeled as accurately as possible based on available patents and publications. To reiterate briefly, the circular catheter was a decapolar one with 3 mm long, 1.6 mm diameter ring electrodes, spaced at 3.7 mm. It was energized in an interlaced bipolar manner, with adjacent, alternating positive and negative electrodes. The flexible spline and balloon catheters used 3.6 x 3.6 mm electrodes, spaced every 6 mm, with the splines being 4 mm wide. In this report, we energized them using the best performing wide‐interlaced method we described in our previous publication. That is, two sequential energy deliveries, each with positive and negative alternating electrodes, with inactive electrodes between them. The reader is referred to our earlier publicationfor vectoring diagrams and more details.

Table 4 presents the results for the changes in weight observed in Studies 1, 2, and 3. After 56 weeks, treatment with SAXENDA resulted in a statistically significant reduction in weight compared with placebo. Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients treated with SAXENDA achieved 5% and 10% weight loss than those treated with placebo. In Study 3, statistically significantly more patients randomized to SAXENDA than placebo had not gained more than 0.5% of body weight from randomization to week 56.

SD = Standard Deviation; CI = Confidence Interval

✱ p < 0.0001 compared to placebo. Type 1 error was controlled across the three endpoints.

Includes all randomized subjects who had a baseline body weight measurement. All available body weight data during the 56 week treatment period are included in the analysis. In Studies 1 and 2 missing values for week 56 were handled using multiple imputations analysis. In Study 3 missing values for week 56 were handled using weighted regression analysis.

The cumulative frequency distributions of change in body weight from baseline to week 56 are shown in Figure 2 for Studies 1 and 2. One way to interpret this figure is to select a change in body weight of interest on the horizontal axis and note the corresponding proportions of patients (vertical axis) in each treatment group who achieved at least that degree of weight loss. For example, note that the vertical line arising from ‑10% in Study 1 intersects the SAXENDA and placebo curves at approximately 34% and 15%, respectively, which correspond to the values shown in Table 4.
