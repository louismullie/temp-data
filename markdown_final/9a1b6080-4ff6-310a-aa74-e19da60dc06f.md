## Question

What is the age cut off to do carotid stent vs carotid endartectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the age cutoff for choosing carotid artery stenting (CAS) versus carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence that identified age as a treatment-effect modifier. Then, I should verify how major guidelines translated that evidence into recommendations. Next, I will examine the magnitude of age-related risk differences and whether there is a sharp threshold or a gradient. After that, I should consider symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients and any exceptions where CAS is still reasonable in older adults. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal evidence. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that age modifies the relative safety of CAS versus CEA, with CAS carrying higher periprocedural stroke risk as age increases, whereas CEA's periprocedural risk remains relatively stable across ages. The most authoritative pooled analysis of individual patient data from four RCTs (Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration) found that in patients aged 70–74 years, CAS had a 2.09-fold higher risk of stroke or death within 120 days compared with CEA, and the excess risk was driven by periprocedural events rather than late stroke, with no similar age effect seen after CEA [^111yqvYm]. CREST likewise detected a significant age-by-treatment interaction, with outcomes approximately equal around age 70 and worse CAS outcomes in older patients, again due to higher periprocedural stroke risk with CAS [^111L2ry3] [^112H4Zeh].

> Wait, let me verify the threshold concept. I initially thought of a hard cutoff at 70, but I should confirm whether this is a strict threshold or a risk gradient with a pragmatic clinical pivot. The pooled European RCT analysis used 70 years as the median and showed a doubling of risk with CAS in those ≥ 70, while CREST's interaction suggested approximate equivalence near age 70 with divergence beyond that, supporting a pragmatic " ≥ 70" pivot rather than a binary rule [^112KVk7Q] [^111L2ry3]. Observational and meta-analytic summaries also describe a step-up in CAS risk after 70–75, reinforcing that the signal is strongest from 70 onward rather than a single-year cliff [^115kj5Rx].

> Next, I should review how guidelines translated this. The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 recommends CEA over CAS for symptomatic patients aged ≥ 70 years with 50–99% stenosis, and conversely suggests considering CAS as an alternative in patients < 70 years with symptomatic stenosis, provided the 30-day stroke/death risk is < 6% [^111Xg2AC] [^114oqGQ5]. The European Stroke Organisation (ESO) 2021 similarly recommends considering CAS as an alternative to CEA in symptomatic patients < 70 years requiring revascularization [^115RVLMb]. The American Heart Association/ASA 2021 guideline advises that in patients > 70 years old with stroke or TIA who are candidates for revascularization, it is reasonable to select CEA over CAS to reduce periprocedural stroke risk, aligning with the same age pivot [^113i8DvV] [^111rsYka].

> Hold on, I should verify whether this applies to asymptomatic patients as well. The age effect is most robust in symptomatic cohorts, and contemporary guidance for asymptomatic patients emphasizes careful selection and low procedural risk thresholds rather than a blanket age cutoff. ESVS allows considering CAS in selected high-risk asymptomatic patients with favorable anatomy and a documented 30-day stroke/death risk < 3%, without specifying a numeric age cutoff, though many centers still apply the ≥ 70 caution given the periprocedural stroke signal seen in older adults undergoing CAS [^112tA3wy] [^112zasuH]. The ESC 2024 guidance for symptomatic disease retains the < 70 consideration for CAS when procedural risk is acceptable, again reflecting the age-related risk gradient rather than a rigid rule [^113mfcfF].

> I need to ensure I capture the magnitude correctly. In the pooled RCT analysis, the periprocedural hazard ratio for stroke or death with CAS versus CEA was about 2.09 in patients aged 70–74, and the absolute risk difference was roughly 6% (about 12% vs 6% at 120 days), which is clinically meaningful and explains the guideline preference for CEA beyond 70 [^111yqvYm]. CREST showed a 1.77-fold increase in the primary endpoint per 10-year age increment with CAS, with no corresponding increase after CEA, reinforcing the age-driven excess in CAS complications [^111L2ry3].

> But wait, what if the patient is high surgical risk or has hostile neck anatomy? I should double-check exceptions. Guidelines still allow CAS in older adults when anatomic or medical risk makes CEA particularly hazardous, provided the CAS team can document acceptably low 30-day stroke/death rates and the patient understands the higher periprocedural stroke risk inherent to CAS in this age group; examples include prior neck radiation, restenosis after CEA, or severe cardiac comorbidity where CAS may reduce MI risk at the expense of more minor strokes [^117GHBHk] [^113rUhYA] [^115uCcH8]. Shared decision-making is essential in these scenarios, and operator/center experience materially influences outcomes [^1168rgFX].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. For most patients, the clinical pivot is around age 70: in symptomatic patients < 70 years, CAS can be considered as a reasonable alternative to CEA when performed by experienced teams with documented low complication rates, whereas in patients ≥ 70 years, CEA is generally preferred to minimize periprocedural stroke risk. In asymptomatic patients, the age effect is less definitive, but many centers still weigh age heavily and favor CEA in older adults unless there are compelling anatomic or comorbid reasons for CAS and stringent safety thresholds can be met [^111Xg2AC] [^114oqGQ5] [^113i8DvV] [^112tA3wy].

> I should confirm the bottom line. The most consistent, evidence-based age threshold used in guidelines is 70 years, with CEA favored at or above this age and CAS more reasonable below this age in appropriately selected patients and centers. This is a pragmatic, risk-stratified approach rather than an absolute rule, and it should be integrated with symptom status, anatomy, comorbidity, and operator expertise [^111yqvYm] [^111Xg2AC] [^113i8DvV].

---

The age cutoff for choosing carotid stenting (CAS) versus carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is **≥ 70 years** for symptomatic patients, based on randomized trials and guidelines showing higher periprocedural stroke risk with CAS in older adults [^111yqvYm] [^111Xg2AC]. For patients < 70 years, CAS is reasonable when anatomy or comorbidities favor a minimally invasive approach, provided the procedural stroke/death risk is < 6% [^114oqGQ5] [^113mfcfF]. In asymptomatic patients, CEA is generally preferred; CAS may be considered only in high surgical risk scenarios with favorable anatomy and a documented 30-day stroke/death risk < 3% [^112V6ZUd] [^112zasuH]. Individualize decisions using shared decision-making and operator experience [^1168rgFX].

## Evidence from randomized controlled trials

Several **randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** and meta-analyses have evaluated the impact of age on outcomes after CAS and CEA:

- **CREST trial**: Age significantly modified the treatment effect, with CAS associated with higher periprocedural stroke risk in older patients. The risk of stroke or death increased by 1.77-fold per 10-year increment in age for CAS, whereas no such increase was observed for CEA [^111L2ry3].

- **Meta-analysis by the Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration (CSTC)**: In symptomatic patients, CAS was associated with higher periprocedural stroke or death risk compared to CEA, particularly in patients aged ≥ 70 years. The hazard ratio for stroke or death within 120 days was 2.09 (95% CI 1.32–3.32) for patients aged 70–74 years [^111yqvYm].

- **Pooled analysis of EVA-3S, SPACE, and ICSS trials**: Age was the only significant modifier of treatment effect, with CAS associated with higher risk of stroke or death in patients aged ≥ 70 years compared to CEA [^112KVk7Q].

## Current guideline recommendations

Guidelines from major vascular and stroke societies provide **clear recommendations** based on age:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding age** |
|-|-|
| European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 | - Recommends CEA over CAS in symptomatic patients aged ≥ 70 years with 50–99% stenosis [^111Xg2AC] <br/> - Recommends CAS as an alternative in patients < 70 years with symptomatic stenosis, provided the 30-day stroke/death risk is < 6% [^114oqGQ5] |
| European Stroke Organisation (ESO) 2021 | - Recommends CAS as an alternative to CEA in symptomatic patients < 70 years requiring revascularization [^115RVLMb] |
| American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) 2021 | - Recommends CEA over CAS in patients ≥ 70 years old to reduce periprocedural stroke risk [^113i8DvV] [^111rsYka] |

---

## Clinical rationale for age-based selection

The **higher periprocedural stroke risk** with CAS in older adults is attributed to several factors:

- **Anatomical factors**: Older patients often have more complex aortic arch anatomy, increased arterial tortuosity, and calcified plaques, which increase the risk of embolic complications during CAS [^117Upu35].

- **Physiological factors**: Age-related changes in cerebral autoregulation and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury may contribute to higher stroke risk in older patients undergoing CAS [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Older patients frequently have multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which further increase procedural risk [^notfound].

---

## Exceptions and individualized decision-making

While age is a critical factor, **individualized decision-making** is essential:

- **Anatomical considerations**: CAS may be preferred in patients with unfavorable neck anatomy, prior neck surgery, or radiation therapy, regardless of age [^111AoKbE].

- **Comorbidities**: Patients with significant cardiac comorbidities may benefit from CAS due to lower risk of myocardial infarction compared to CEA [^115uCcH8].

- **Operator experience**: The outcomes of both CAS and CEA are highly dependent on operator and center experience, which should be considered in the decision-making process [^1121P867].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Age group** | **Recommended procedure** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| < 70 years | CAS or CEA | - Lower periprocedural stroke risk with CAS <br/> - Individualized decision based on anatomy and comorbidities [^114oqGQ5] [^113mfcfF] |
| ≥ 70 years | CEA preferred | - Lower periprocedural stroke risk with CEA <br/> - Higher stroke risk with CAS in older adults [^111yqvYm] [^111Xg2AC] |

---

The age cutoff for choosing CAS versus CEA is **≥ 70 years** for symptomatic patients, with CEA preferred in older adults due to lower periprocedural stroke risk. For patients < 70 years, CAS is a reasonable alternative when anatomy or comorbidities favor a minimally invasive approach, provided procedural risks are acceptable. Individualized decision-making and operator experience remain crucial considerations.

### Patient selection for carotid stenting versus endarterectomy: a systematic review [^111AoKbE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenting has emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of severe extracranial carotid stenosis in patients with anatomic or clinical factors that increase their risk of complications with surgery, yet there remains a substantial amount of variability and uncertainty in clinical practice in the referral of patients for stenting vs endarterectomy. By undertaking a thorough review of the literature, we sought to better define which subsets of patients with "high-risk" features would be likely to preferentially benefit from carotid stenting or carotid endarterectomy. Although only a single randomized trial comparing the outcomes of carotid stenting with distal protection and endarterectomy has been completed, a wealth of observational data was reviewed. Relative to endarterectomy, the results of carotid stenting seem favorable in the setting of several anatomic conditions that render surgery technically difficult, such as restenosis after prior endarterectomy, prior radical neck surgery, and previous radiation therapy involving the neck. The results of stenting are also favorable among patients with severe concomitant cardiac disease. Carotid endarterectomy, alternatively, seems to represent the procedure of choice among patients 80 years of age or older in the absence of other high-risk features. Overall, existing data support the concept that carotid stenting and endarterectomy represent complementary rather than competing modes of therapy. Pending the availability of randomized trial data to help guide procedural selection, which is likely many years away, an objective understanding of existing data is valuable to help select the optimal mode of revascularization therapy for patients with severe carotid artery disease who are at heightened surgical risk.

### Age and outcomes after carotid stenting and endarterectomy: the carotid revascularization endarterectomy versus stenting trial [^111L2ry3]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

High stroke event rates among carotid artery stenting (CAS)-treated patients in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial (CREST) lead-in registry generated an a priori hypothesis that age may modify the relative efficacy of CAS versus carotid endarterectomy (CEA). In the primary CREST report, we previously noted significant effect modification by age. Here we extend this investigation by examining the relative efficacy of the components of the primary end point, the treatment-specific impact of age, and contributors to the increasing risk in CAS-treated patients at older ages.

Methods

Among 2502 CREST patients with high-grade carotid stenosis, proportional hazards models were used to examine the impact of age on the CAS-to-CEA relative efficacy, and the impact of age on risk within CAS-treated and CEA-treated patients.

Results

Age acted as a treatment effect modifier for the primary end point (P interaction = 0.02), with the efficacy of CAS and CEA approximately equal at age 70 years. For CAS, risk for the primary end point increased with age (P < 0.0001) by 1.77-times (95% confidence interval, 1.38–2.28) per 10-year increment; however, there was no evidence of increased risk for CEA-treated patients (P = 0.27). Stroke events were the primary contributor to the overall effect modification (P interaction = 0.033), with equal risk at ≈64 years. The treatment-by-age interaction for CAS and CEA was not altered by symptomatic status (P = 0.96) or by sex (P = 0.45).

Conclusions

Outcomes after CAS versus CEA were related to patient age, attributable to increasing risk for stroke after CAS at older ages. Patient age should be an important consideration when choosing between the 2 procedures for treating carotid stenosis.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^1127ojqQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for extracranial carotid disease — treatment selection and thresholds are as follows: The committee recommends carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the first-line treatment for most symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 60% to 99%. The periprocedural risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons, and CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as the first-line therapy. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

### Carotid artery stenting versus endarterectomy for treatment of carotid artery stenosis [^115uCcH8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Carotid artery stenting is an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis. This review updates a previous version first published in 1997 and subsequently updated in 2004, 2007, and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of stenting compared with endarterectomy in people with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched August 2018) and the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index to August 2018. We also searched ongoing trials registers (August 2018) and reference lists, and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing stenting with endarterectomy for symptomatic or asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. In addition, we included RCTs comparing carotid artery stenting with medical therapy alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. A second review author independently validated trial selection and a third review author independently validated data extraction. We calculated treatment effects as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with endarterectomy as the reference group. We quantified heterogeneity using the I² statistic and used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 22 trials involving 9753 participants. In participants with symptomatic carotid stenosis, compared with endarterectomy stenting was associated with a higher risk of periprocedural death or stroke (the primary safety outcome; OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.19; P < 0.0001, I² = 5%; 10 trials, 5396 participants; high-certainty evidence); and periprocedural death, stroke, or myocardial infarction (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.80; P = 0.002, I² = 0%; 6 trials, 4861 participants; high-certainty evidence). The OR for the primary safety outcome was 1.11 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.64) in participants under 70 years old and 2.23 (95% CI 1.61 to 3.08) in participants 70 years old or more (interaction P = 0.007). There was a non-significant increase in periprocedural death or major or disabling stroke with stenting (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.91; P = 0.08, I² = 0%; 7 trials, 4983 participants; high-certainty evidence). Compared with endarterectomy, stenting was associated with lower risks of myocardial infarction (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.94; P = 0.03, I² = 0%), cranial nerve palsy (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; P < 0.00001, I² = 0%), and access site haematoma (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.68; P = 0.003, I² = 27%). The combination of periprocedural death or stroke or ipsilateral stroke during follow-up (the primary combined safety and efficacy outcome) favoured endarterectomy (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.85; P < 0.0001, I² = 0%; 8 trials, 5080 participants; high-certainty evidence). The rate of ipsilateral stroke after the periprocedural period did not differ between treatments (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.47; P = 0.77, I² = 0%). In participants with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, there was a non-significant increase in periprocedural death or stroke with stenting compared with endarterectomy (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.97; P = 0.05, I² = 0%; 7 trials, 3378 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The risk of periprocedural death or stroke or ipsilateral stroke during follow-up did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.84; P = 0.22, I² = 0%; 6 trials, 3315 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Moderate or higher carotid artery restenosis (50% or greater) or occlusion during follow-up was more common after stenting (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.60; P = 0.02, I² = 44%), but the difference in risk of severe restenosis was not significant (70% or greater; OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.00; P = 0.33, I² = 58%; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Stenting for symptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with a higher risk of periprocedural stroke or death than endarterectomy. This extra risk is mostly attributed to an increase in minor, non-disabling strokes occurring in people older than 70 years. Beyond the periprocedural period, carotid stenting is as effective in preventing recurrent stroke as endarterectomy. However, combining procedural safety and long-term efficacy in preventing recurrent stroke still favours endarterectomy. In people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, there may be a small increase in the risk of periprocedural stroke or death with stenting compared with endarterectomy. However, CIs of treatment effects were wide and further data from randomised trials in people with asymptomatic stenosis are needed.

### Association between age and risk of stroke or death from carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting: a meta-analysis of pooled patient data from four randomised trials [^111yqvYm]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Age was reported to be an effect-modifier in four randomised controlled trials comparing carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA), with better CEA outcomes than CAS outcomes noted in the more elderly patients. We aimed to describe the association of age with treatment differences in symptomatic patients and provide age-specific estimates of the risk of stroke and death within narrow (5 year) age groups.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, we analysed individual patient-level data from four randomised controlled trials within the Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration (CSTC) involving patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. We included only trials that randomly assigned patients to CAS or CEA and only patients with symptomatic stenosis. We assessed rates of stroke or death in 5-year age groups in the periprocedural period (between randomisation and 120 days) and ipsilateral stroke during long-term follow-up for patients assigned to CAS or CEA. We also assessed differences between CAS and CEA. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis.

Findings

Collectively, 4754 patients were randomly assigned to either CEA or CAS treatment in the four studies. 433 events occurred over a median follow-up of 2.7 years. For patients assigned to CAS, the periprocedural hazard ratio (HR) for stroke and death in patients aged 65–69 years compared with patients younger than 60 years was 2.16 (95% CI 1.13–4.13), with HRs of roughly 4.0 for patients aged 70 years or older. We noted no evidence of an increased periprocedural risk by age group in the CEA group (p = 0.34). These changes underpinned a CAS-versus CEA periprocedural HR of 1.61 (95% CI 0.90–2.88) for patients aged 65–69 years and an HR of 2.09 (1.32–3.32) for patients aged 70–74 years. Age was not associated with the postprocedural stroke risk either within treatment group (p ≥ 0.09 for CAS and 0.83 for CEA), or between treatment groups (p = 0.84).

Interpretation

In these RCTs, CEA was clearly superior to CAS in patients aged 70–74 years and older. The difference in older patients was almost wholly attributable to increasing periprocedural stroke risk in patients treated with CAS. Age had little effect on CEA periprocedural risk or on postprocedural risk after either procedure.

### Are octogenarians at high risk for carotid endarterectomy? [^11543d2Z]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Several prospective randomized trials have proved carotid endarterectomy to be safe and effective for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients younger than 80 years of age. Recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been approved for use in selected high-risk patients. It has been proposed that being an octogenarian places patients in this high-risk category.

Study Design

All patients between the ages of 80 to 89 years undergoing carotid endarterectomy during a 12-year period were included in the study. Information included indications for carotid endarterectomy, associated risk factors, length of stay, and hospital course. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, including neurologic events and myocardial infarction, were recorded.

Results

A total of 103 carotid endarterectomies were performed in 95 octogenarians. Procedures were performed on 59 men and 36 women. Indications for operation included symptomatic carotid stenosis in 44 patients (43%) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis in 59 (57%). Associated risk factors included diabetes mellitus (17%), hypertension (76%), coronary artery disease (28%), hyperlipidemia (39%), and history of smoking (42%). There were 4 perioperative neurologic complications, which included 1 transient ischemic attack (0.97%), 2 minor strokes (1.94%), and 1 major stroke (0.97%). There were no deaths.

Conclusions

Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.

### The European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for carotid intervention: an updated independent assessment and literature review [^115GTy6J]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Many medical societies now recommend carotid stenting as an alternative to endarterectomy which raises the question of whether the ESVS guidelines are still valid. This review addresses the validity of the ESVS guidelines that refer to carotid stenting based on the evidence available today.

Methods

We conducted a review and meta-analysis based on the original ESVS guidelines paper and articles published over the past 2 years.

Results

For symptomatic patients, surgery remains the best option, since stenting is associated with a 61% relative risk increase of periprocedural stroke or death compared to endarterectomy. However, centres of excellence in carotid stenting may achieve comparable results. In asymptomatic patients, there is still no good evidence for any intervention because the stroke risk from an asymptomatic stenosis is very low, especially with the best modern medical treatment. CREST and CAVATAS have verified that mid-term stroke prevention after successful stenting is similar to endarterectomy. EVA-3S, SPACE, ICSS and CREST have provided additional evidence regarding the role of age in choosing therapeutic modality. The role of the cerebral protection devices is challenged by the imaging findings of small randomised trials but supported by large systematic reviews.

Conclusions

The ESVS guidelines that refer to carotid stenting not only remain valid but also have been further strengthened by the latest available clinical data. An update of these guidelines including all of the recent evidence is needed to provide an objective and up-to-date interpretation of the data.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^113W74iE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery carotid artery disease — weak recommendation with low quality evidence includes: We suggest carotid stenting as a potential alternative treatment to carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with ≥ 50% stenosis and high operative risk. We suggest that carotid artery stenting is inappropriate for asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis. Possible exceptions may include patients with acceptable medical risk who present with severe carotid artery stenoses (≥ 80%) and high anatomic risk for carotid endarterectomy (as defined above) but with compelling anatomy for stenting.

### Standards of practice and reporting standards for carotid artery angioplasty and stenting [^114JxQUk]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting — symptomatic disease 50–69%: For patients with symptomatic carotid disease and 50–69% stenosis, CEA is recommended. Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is considered an alternative to CEA for patients at average or low risk for CAS or for those who are at high risk (> 6% morbidity and mortality) for CEA. (AHA/ASA Class I; Level of Evidence B, CEBM Level 1b; Grade B) While age > 80 years was considered high risk for CEA in the SAPPHIRE trial, the CREST trial showed a benefit for age < 70 years with CAS, perhaps due to anatomic factors such as more favorable aortic arch anatomy in the younger cohort. We suggest that age alone should not be considered in determining CEA versus CAS and that other patient-specific factors should be considered.

### Safety of carotid revascularization in patients with a history of coronary heart disease [^113pGxa7]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

About 10% to 15% of ischemic strokes are caused by atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) both reduce the long-term risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis, but the 30-day stroke or death risk is higher after CAS than after CEA.

To improve the balance between risk and benefit of treatment, it is important to identify patient characteristics that are associated with higher periprocedural risks of CAS or CEA. The risk of CAS depends strongly on age, with increasing periprocedural risk at older ages for patients assigned to CAS and the absence of an effect of age on risk for patients assigned to CEA. Furthermore, clinicians may prefer CAS instead of CEA in patients with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) because the periprocedural risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is lower after CAS compared with CEA in randomized trials. A recent meta-analysis showed that history of CHD increased 30-day risk of MI in patients who underwent CEA, but not in those who underwent CAS. Another study showed a trend toward increased periprocedural stroke or death risk of CAS compared with CEA in patients without history of CHD, but more similar risks in the 2 treatment groups in patients with history of CHD.

The influence of age on procedural risks in patients with history of CHD is unknown. Therefore, we studied the association between age and procedural risk stratified by history of CHD. We hypothesized that if CAS is as safe as CEA in patients with history of CHD, the previously reported age cutoff of ≥ 70 years at which CEA is clearly superior to CASmight shift to a higher age in patients with history of CHD.

A summary of the panel's position follows: For patients with a surgical risk of less than 3 percent and a life expectancy of at least five years: proven indications — ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy for stenosis of 60 percent or more, with or without ulceration and antiplatelet therapy. regardless of the status of the contralateral carotid artery; acceptable indications — unilateral carotid endarterectomy at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery in the presence of carotid artery lesions of 60 percent or more narrowing; uncertain indications — unilateral carotid endarterectomy for stenosis of more than 50 percent in the presence of a grade B or C ulcer, regardless of the contralateral internal carotid artery status.

The guidelines state that uncertain indications exist in the setting of ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy for stenosis of 75 percent or more, with or without ulceration, regardless of the contralateral artery status and in the setting of coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with bilateral asymptomatic stenosis of more than 70 percent or unilateral carotid stenosis of more than 70 percent. For this surgical risk category, the recommendations also describe two proven inappropriate indications — ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy for stenosis of 75 percent or more or for stenosis of 50 percent or less, with or without ulceration and regardless of the contralateral internal carotid artery status. Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis According to the guidelines, three clinical trials of carotid endarterectomy demonstrate that the procedure improves the outcome in symptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis.

The European Carotid Surgery Trial revealed that the risk of ipsilateral stroke and perioperative death was 10. 3 percent in patients who underwent surgery and
16. 8 percent in patients who did not undergo surgery. The risk of death due to carotid endarterectomy or stroke during three years of follow-up was 12. 3 percent for surgically treated patients and
21. 9 percent for medically treated patients. Data from a subgroup of 1, 590 patients with moderate stenosis indicate that no benefit is derived from carotid endarterectomy during a four- to five-year postoperative period.

### Carotid endarterectomy as the criterion standard in high-risk elderly patients… [^115y8BJz]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Carotid angioplasty and stenting is now a viable alternative to carotid endartectomy in patients considered to be high-risk candidates for surgery, despite recent reports of increased adverse periprocedural outcomes in elderly patients. We sought to evaluate our single-institution experience and the 30-day perioperative outcomes of CEA in patients 75 years or older, who are traditionally considered high-risk surgical candidates and are recommended for CAS. Results from 2 landmark prospective randomized clinical trials have established carotid endarterectomy as the criterion-standard treatment for both high-grade symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. 1, 2 The relatively strict inclusion and exclusion criteria for these influential surgical trials resulted in exclusion of many patients considered high-risk candidates for surgery.

The incidence of stroke is known to increase dramatically with advancing age, as does stroke-related morbidity and mortality; by 85 years of age, stroke is the second leading cause of death, and these patients stand to gain the most from stroke prophylaxis via CEA. 3 Secondary analysis of the NASCET data has demonstrated that patients 75 years or older derive a better outcome after CEA, especially those with severe stenosis. 3 In patients with 70% to 99% stenosis, the absolute risk reduction of ipsilateral stroke at 2 years is 28. 9%. Prospective randomized trials have clearly established CEA as the criterion standard in the management of symptomatic and high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis in good-risk patients, yielding perioperative stroke and death rates of 5. 8% 1 and
2. 3%.

2 These studies excluded patients who were 80 years or older and those with certain comorbidities who were thought to have a higher risk of stroke and perioperative complications; therefore, generalizability of the results to excluded patient populations remains limited. Carotid angioplasty and stenting has been advocated for this specific elderly population who are considered high-risk surgical candidates; however, several studies have demonstrated advanced age as a risk factor for adverse outcomes in CAS. 5–8 For CEA to be an acceptable treatment, the American Heart Association21 guidelines have established periprocedural stroke and death risks of 6% and 3% in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively, and CAS should at minimum be subjected to these same standards to confer clinical effectiveness.

### Carotid endarterectomy vs initial medical therapy in asymptomatic carotid stenosis… [^117JXWoa]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this comparative effectiveness study of 5221 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the absolute reduction in the risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes associated with early carotid endarterectomy treatment was less than half the reduction observed in trials initiated more than 2 decades ago. The decrease was not statistically significant when the competing risk of nonstroke deaths was accounted for in the analysis. Meaning Results of this study suggest that, given the up-front perioperative risks associated with carotid endarterectomy and the reduced benefit derived from revascularization, initial medical therapy may be an acceptable treatment strategy for the management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Importance Carotid endarterectomy among asymptomatic patients involves a trade-off between a higher short-term perioperative risk in exchange for a lower long-term risk of stroke.

The clinical benefit observed in randomized clinical trials may not extend to real-world practice. Of the total 5221 patients, 2712 received CEA and 2509 received initial medical therapy within 1 year after the index carotid imaging. Of the total 5221 patients, 2712 received CEA and 2509 received initial medical therapy within 1 year after the index carotid imaging. A 5-year risk difference of 2. 3% corresponded to an annualized stroke risk difference of
0. 46% and a number needed to treat of 43 over 5 years. The observed 5-year risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke among patients with carotid stenosis in the RCT-like sample was 6. 7% in the CEA cohort and was
6. 2% in the initial medical therapy cohort.

### Impact of clinical trial results on the temporal trends of carotid endarterectomy and stenting from 2002 to 2014 [^113SetYG]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, a part of the decline in endarterectomy is likely attributable to the rise in carotid-artery stenting as an alternative revascularization strategy. We found that carotid-artery stenting uptake increased significantly immediately after publication of the stenting-favorable SAPPHIRE trial in 2004, although this trial was criticized for slow recruitment, early termination, narrow inclusion criteria, enrolling < 30% patients with symptomatic carotid-artery stenosis, and controversial inclusion of non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions in the primary outcome. Since 2006, stenting has remained stable in Ontario and currently accounts for ≈15% of all carotid revascularization procedures per year, which is similar to the data in United States. Several factors may account for the stagnant rate of stenting observed over the last decade, including variable referral patterns (patients with significant carotid-artery stenosis are most commonly referred to vascular surgeons in Ontario, who almost exclusively perform endarterectomy); reimbursement policies (Medicare only reimburses providers for carotid-artery stenting performed in high-risk patients in the United States); and because a higher risk of periprocedural stroke or death associated with stenting in recent trials such as ICSS (8.0% versus 4.2% for endarterectomy)and CREST (4.4% versus 2.3% for endarterectomy)raised caution among clinicians, thus, preventing its widespread use in clinical practice. Furthermore, carotid-artery stenting has yet to be compared with medical management in a large randomized trial — the ongoing CREST-2 trial will provide much needed data in this regard.

We also found that temporal trends in carotid revascularization varied by age. Rates of endarterectomy decreased among all age groups, except for those ≥ 80 years old. Accumulating high-quality evidence for the superiority of carotid endarterectomy over stenting in older patientsmay account for the stable rate of endarterectomy observed in this group. It is, however, concerning to see that carotid-artery stenting increased among the 2 oldest subgroups of patients, and 41% of patients ≥ 75 years old treated with stenting had asymptomatic stenosis, despite a paucity of evidence for its relative safety compared with endarterectomy in the elderly population. Unfavorable anatomic and pathological factors (increased vessel tortuosity, greater burden of atherosclerosis, and decreased plaque stability) may account for the increased stroke and death events observed with stenting in the elderly; therefore, clinicians need to exercise caution before offering this therapy to older patients.

Figure 3
Key factors important in determining the choice of carotid artery stenting or CEA for treatment of severe carotid artery stenosis. CAD indicates coronary artery disease; CEA, carotid endarterectomy; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

CAS has evolved partly as an alternative to CEA for patients with prohibitively high risk for operative complications. CAS is less invasive compared to CEA with reduced risk for cranial nerve damage and has the ability to treat distal lesions that cannot be treated using CEA. Unlike CEA, CAS is the modality of choice among patients with "hostile neck" or those with radiotherapy or prior surgical interventions in this area. The French Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in Patients With Severe Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis (EVA‐3S) trial demonstrated a higher rate of death or stroke at 1‐ and 6‐month follow‐up with CAS as compared to CEA, among patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. 40 The German counterpart Stent‐Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial failed to demonstrate noninferiority of CAS in comparison to CEA during short‐term follow‐up. 41 However, the caveats to a fair comparison of the 2 strategies in the literature include a lower than optimal utilization of emboli protection devices as well as relatively inexperienced operators included as a part of these earlier trials. 42 The pivotal Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting (CREST) trial randomly assigned patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis to undergo CEA or CAS and compared the occurrence of primary composite end point of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death from any cause during the periprocedural period or any ipsilateral stroke within 4 years after randomization. 43 Although the primary outcome was similar between the 2 groups, there was an increased rate of stroke with CAS that was offset by a reduced rate of MI as compared to CEA. 43 The question of equivalence of MI and stroke outcomes following carotid revascularization has been the crux of the debate following CREST. In addition, CREST also demonstrated a significant interaction between age and efficacy of therapy. CAS tended to be more efficacious at younger ages, and CEA was more efficacious in older subjects. Updated Cochrane collaboration review of long‐term outcome comparisons between CAS and CEA demonstrated that CAS was associated with an increased risk of periprocedural stroke or death compared with CEA. 44 However, this excess risk appeared to be limited to older patients. It must be noted that although CAS is considered to be more difficult among older patients, rigorous patient selection criteria were not routinely employed in several of these trials. In the longer term, the data demonstrated that the difference was caused by an excess in nondisabling procedural strokes associated with CAS and did not appear to translate into lower functional capacity, as compared to CEA. 44 Despite this suggestion, the long‐term efficacy of CAS and the risk of restenosis are unclear and require further follow‐up of existing trials.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) versus carotid artery stenting (CAS) in symptomatic patients — periprocedural outcomes show higher stroke and combined stroke/death with CAS and lower myocardial infarction (MI) with CAS, with age-stratified meta-analytic hazard ratios (HRs) favoring CEA. Increased periprocedural stroke risk was seen with CAS (7.7%) compared with CEA (4.1%), and stroke or death within 30 days was higher with CAS (7.7% vs 3.4%), while the composite of stroke, death, and MI favored CEA (5.2%) vs CAS (8.5%). In CREST, periprocedural stroke and death were significantly greater after TF-CAS than after CEA for symptomatic patients (6.0% ± 0.9% vs 3.2% ± 0.7%; HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.11–3.2; P < .02), whereas MI was lower after CAS (1.0% ± 0.4% vs 2.3% ± 0.6%; HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.18–1.11; P < .08), although the differences were not significant. A meta-analysis by the Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration (4754 patients) reported a periprocedural HR of 1.61 (95% CI 0.90–2.88) in favor of CEA for ages 65 to 69 years and 2.09 (95% CI 1.32–3.32) for ages 70 to 74 years, and excluding octogenarians yielded lower 30-day stroke and death with CEA (2.6% ± 0.7% for CEA and 5.6% ± 1.0% for CAS; P = 0.006).

Extracranial carotid stenosis — For patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), the guideline provides the following directives: In patients with a TIA or nondisabling ischemic stroke within the past 6 months and ipsilateral severe (70%–99%) carotid artery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is recommended to reduce the risk of future stroke, provided that perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is estimated to be < 6%; in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis who are scheduled for carotid artery stenting (CAS) or CEA, procedures should be performed by operators with established periprocedural stroke and mortality rates of < 6% to reduce the risk of surgical adverse events; in patients with carotid artery stenosis and a TIA or stroke, intensive medical therapy with antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, and treatment of hypertension, is recommended to reduce risk; in patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral moderate (50%–69%) carotid stenosis as documented by catheter-based imaging or noninvasive imaging, CEA is recommended to reduce the risk of future stroke, depending on patient-specific factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities, if the perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is estimated to be < 6%; in patients > 70 years of age with stroke or TIA in whom carotid revascularization is being considered, it is reasonable to select CEA over CAS to reduce the periprocedural stroke rate; and in patients in whom revascularization is planned within 1 week of the index stroke, it is reasonable to choose CEA over CAS to reduce the periprocedural stroke rate.

### Carotid endarterectomy: who is the high-risk patient? [^112Sd1vG]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The role of carotid endarterectomy in the prevention of stroke was validated by two randomized clinical trials, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy (NASCET) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS). However, these trials excluded patients at high risk for perioperative stroke and other morbidity, raising concerns for the applicability of the trial results to the general population. Some have also suggested these "high-risk" patients are better suited for carotid artery stenting with the belief that stenting has lower morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review many of the commonly accepted high-risk factors for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and examine their outcomes. High-risk patients are more common than generally believed and their outcomes may be the same with carotid endarterectomy as it is with carotid stenting. Truly "high-risk" patients with shortened life expectancy are best served with no intervention.

### Effect of white-matter lesions on the risk of periprocedural stroke after carotid artery stenting versus endarterectomy in the international carotid stenting study (ICSS): a prespecified analysis of data from a randomised trial [^112v1sGR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

We tested two hypotheses. The first was that, compared with less extensive white-matter lesions, more extensive white-matter lesions are associated with an increased risk of procedural stroke after treatment of carotid artery disease by either carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy. The second was that the increase in procedural risk would differ in patients treated by carotid artery stenting compared with carotid endarterectomy. The plan to analyse imaging findings in relation to procedural risk was prespecified in the trial protocol. The details of the methods and statistical analyses described here were decided before any results were analysed.

The analyses were done for the following outcome measures: any stroke, non-disabling stroke, and disabling or fatal stroke. Data were analysed per protocol — ie, the analysis included only patients who received the allocated treatment as their first ipsilateral revascularisation procedure. Patients who received the alternative revascularisation procedure as their first treatment (cross-overs), or who received no revascularisation treatment, were excluded from this analysis. All outcome events occurring within 30 days after initiation of the first allocated treatment were included.

Patients were dichotomised into two groups at the median value for the age-related white-matter changes score. The median was chosen as the cut-point for the analysis before doing any analyses to ensure equal-sized groups of patients for the comparisons and to avoid the risk of the bias introduced by selecting an optimum cut point after initial analysis of the data. The baseline characteristics in the two treatment groups were then compared according to whether their ARWMC score was lower than 7 versus 7 or greater using Pearson's χ² test or analysis of variance. We compared the 30-day risk of the various outcome events between the two treatment groups using a Cox proportional hazards model. We estimated the cumulative incidences of the different outcome measures using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared them using log-rank tests stratified by treatment with ARWMC score dichotomised at the median. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. We used SPSS (version 21) for all statistical analyses.

Update on carotid surgery and stenting

Given the recent improvements in medical therapy, should we continue to base our treatment decisions on data from 'old' symptomatic carotid trials?

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and a high risk of recurrent stroke (e.g. > 70% carotid stenosis, ischaemic event < 2 weeks previously) should be offered timely intervention with carotid intervention (Grade A).

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and lower-risk of recurrent stroke (e.g. moderate carotid stenosis, retinal symptoms only, event > 2 weeks previously) may be randomised to trials comparing carotid intervention plus medical therapy vs. medical therapy alone (ECST-2/CREST-2) if clinician and patient substantially uncertain about the benefits of intervention (Grade B).
Is it ever appropriate to intervene on a < 50% symptomatic stenosis?

Almost all patients with < 50% symptomatic carotid stenosis should not be treated with intervention. However, intervention in certain patients may be considered if the stenosis causes recurrent symptoms despite optimal medical therapy (Grade C).
Does gender matter – Do women really derive less benefit from carotid intervention than men?

Decisions on whether or not to intervene on patients with carotid stenosis should not be based on gender (Grade A).
With more experience, better case selection and technological advances, can CAS compete with carotid endarterectomy?

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an effective alternative intervention in selected cases (e.g. not recently symptomatic, age < 70 years, no prior ischaemic brain damage) when done by experienced interventionists. Technological advances in cerebral protection, access and stent design should be considered in patients treated with CAS (Grade A).

In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (more than 50%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 50%) and high perioperative risk, we suggest carotid artery stenting as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy (GRADE 2 recommendation, low quality evidence). In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as the perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). We recommend against carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe (≥ 60%) carotid artery stenosis (GRADE 1 recommendation, low quality evidence), with a possible exception for patients with ≥ 80% carotid artery stenosis and high anatomic risk for carotid endarterectomy. Strength-of-recommendation and evidence-quality categories follow the GRADE scheme (GRADE 1 for strong recommendations; GRADE 2 for weak recommendations; high, moderate, low, and very low quality).

### Carotid stenting: should it replace endarterectomy in higher-risk patients? [^1141hmsj]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as a useful and potentially less-invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treatment of extracranial carotid stenoses. It has been suggested that specific patient subgroups, including those with significant medical comorbidities, recurrent stenosis, anatomically inaccessible lesions, and a hostile neck, might benefit from CAS. The purpose of this report is to evaluate whether or not CAS should replace CEA in the treatment of the high-risk patient. Results from a recently published randomized clinical trial and several individual center and multicenter case analyses will be used in this review.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114oYehv]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) revascularization evidence — ACST-1 underscored the merits of carotid revascularization (CEA or transfemoral stenting) for net 5-year stroke risk reduction benefit for patients undergoing immediate compared with deferred surgery, but < 40% of patients received statins. A 10-year analysis showed 4.5% absolute risk reduction for CEA compared with medical therapy alone. The SPACE-2 trial did not show clear superiority of carotid revascularization over medical therapy alone in patients with > 70% to 99% asymptomatic carotid stenosis. CREST 1 was the first large prospective randomized trial comparing stenting and endarterectomy; when revascularization was considered, CEA and carotid stenting had similar rates of perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), death, and subsequent ipsilateral stroke, with an age interaction favoring stenting for patients < 70 years and CEA for patients > 70 years. Transcarotid artery revascularization is a newer technique that could be considered on an individual basis. Without a large clinical trial directly comparing revascularization with contemporary medical management, a definitive conclusion on whether there is benefit from carotid revascularization in asymptomatic patients remains elusive; results from the anticipated CREST 2 could provide much-needed clarity.

### National patterns of carotid revascularization before and after the carotid revascularization endarterectomy vs stenting trial (CREST) [^114KjtLN]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST) showed greater safety of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients younger than 70 years and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in those older than 70 years. It is unknown how the result of CREST has influenced carotid revascularization choices in the United States.

Objective

To evaluate national patterns in CAS performance in patients older than 70 years in the post-CREST (2011–2014) compared with the pre-CREST (2007–2010) era.

Design, Setting, and Participants

All adults older than 70 years undergoing carotid revascularization in the United States from 2007 to 2014 were retrospectively identified from the 2007–2014 National Inpatient Sample using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision procedural codes. From 61 324 882 unweighted hospitalizations contained in the 2007–2014 National Inpatient Sample, 494 733 weighted carotid revascularization admissions in adults older than 70 years were identified using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision procedural codes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportion of CAS performed in all age groups over time was estimated and multivariable-adjusted models were used to compare the odds of receiving CAS in the pre-CREST with those in the post-CREST era in adults older than 70 years.

Results

A total of 41.8% of all patients were women, and mean (SE) age at presentation was 78.1 (0.03) years. A total of 16.3% of CAS and 10.1% of CEA procedures were performed in patients with symptomatic stenosis. The proportion of patients older than 70 years receiving CAS increased from 11.9% in the pre-CREST to 13.8% in the post-CREST era (P = 0.005). In multivariable models, the odds of receiving CAS increased by 13% in all patients older than 70 years in the post-CREST compared with the pre-CREST period (odds ratio [OR], 1.13, 95% CI, 1.00–1.28, P = 0.04), including symptomatic women (OR, 1.31, 1.05–1.65, P = 0.02). Symptomatic stenosis (OR 1.39; 95% CI, 1.27–1.52; P < .001), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.35–1.63; P < .001), and peripheral vascular disease (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.27–1.43; P < .001) were associated with higher odds of CAS; comorbid hypertension (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.66–0.74; P < .001), smoking (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78–0.91; P < .001), and weekend admission (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68–0.88; P < .001) were negatively associated with the odds of CAS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite concerns for higher periprocedural complications with CAS in elderly patients, the odds of CAS increased in the post-CREST compared with pre-CREST era in patients older than 70 years, including symptomatic women.

### Carotid artery stenting trials: conduct, results, critique, and current recommendations [^113gBcyo]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The carotid stenting trialists have demonstrated persistence and determination in comparing an evolving technique, carotid artery stenting (CAS), against a mature and exacting standard for carotid revascularisation, carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This review focuses on their endeavours. A total of 12 1-on-1 randomised trials comparing CAS and CEA have been reported; 6 of these can be considered major, and 5 of these reflect (in part) current CAS standards of practice and form the basis of this review. At least 18 meta-analyses seeking to compare CAS and CEA exist. These are limited by the quality and heterogeneity of the data informing them (e.g., five trials were stopped prematurely such that they collectively failed to reach recruitment target by > 4000 patients). The Carotid Stenting Trialists' Collaboration Publication represents a prespecified meta-analysis of European trials that were sufficiently similar to allow valid conclusions to be drawn; these trials and conclusions will be explored. When the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) is rigorously assessed, CAS and CEA are equivalent for the composite end point of stroke/death and MI, with more minor strokes for CAS and more MIs for CEA. These outcomes have a discrepant impact on quality of life and subsequent mortality. The all-stroke death outcomes for patients < 70 years old are equivalent, with more minor strokes occurring in the elderly during CAS than CEA. There are significantly more severe haematomas and cranial nerve injuries after CEA. The influence of experience on outcome cannot be underestimated.

Abstract

Background

Carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting are common procedures for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to identify factors that modify the effect between type of treatment and outcome, and could thus be used to refine the selection of treatment procedure.

Methods

All patients who underwent either carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting between 2012 and 2018 in German hospitals were included. The analysis of effect modification was focused on baseline patient characteristics. The outcome was a composite of any stroke or death until discharge from hospital. For multivariable analyses, a generalized linear mixed regression model was used.

Results

Some 221 282 patients were included, of whom 68% were male. In patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting, the risk of any stroke or death was 2.3% and 3.7% respectively. Patient age was statistically significantly associated with a higher risk of a composite outcome of any stroke or death (main effect of age: adjusted OR 1.21 (95% c.i. 1.17 to 1.26), P < 0.001). The age effect was stronger in patients treated with carotid artery stenting (interaction effect: adjusted OR 1.29 (95% c.i. 1.20 to 1.38), P < 0.001). Statistically significant interaction effects were identified for side of treatment, ASA grade, contralateral degree of stenosis, and the time interval between the index event and treatment.

Conclusion

This analysis shows that carotid artery stenting may be particularly disadvantageous in older patients, in patients with right-sided stenosis, and in symptomatic patients treated within the first 2 days after the index event. In patients with contralateral occlusion, carotid artery stenting appears equivalent to carotid endarterectomy.

### The carotid revascularization endarterectomy versus stenting trial (CREST): stenting versus carotid endarterectomy for carotid disease [^112H4Zeh]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Carotid artery stenosis causes up to 10% of all ischemic strokes. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was introduced as a treatment to prevent stroke in the early 1950s. Carotid stenting (CAS) was introduced as a treatment to prevent stroke in 1994.

Methods

The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) is a randomized trial with blinded end point adjudication. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were randomized to CAS or CEA. The primary end point was the composite of any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during the periprocedural period and ipsilateral stroke thereafter, up to 4 years.

Results

There was no significant difference in the rates of the primary end point between CAS and CEA (7.2% versus 6.8%; hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.51; P = 0.51). Symptomatic status and sex did not modify the treatment effect, but an interaction with age and treatment was detected (P = 0.02). Outcomes were slightly better after CAS for patients aged < 70 years and better after CEA for patients aged > 70 years. The periprocedural end point did not differ for CAS and CEA, but there were differences in the components, CAS versus CEA (stroke 4.1% versus 2.3%, P = 0.012; and myocardial infarction 1.1% versus 2.3%, P = 0.032).

Conclusions

In CREST, CAS and CEA had similar short- and longer-term outcomes. During the periprocedural period, there was higher risk of stroke with CAS and higher risk of myocardial infarction with CEA. Clinical Trial Registration-www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00004732.

### Epidemiology of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease [^112KkG5a]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease is a significant cause of stroke in the United States and globally. Its prevalence increases with age and it is more prevalent in men and White and Native-American populations. However, the outcomes related to carotid disease are worse in women and Black patients. Research suggests the disparities exist due to a multitude of factors, including disease pathophysiology, access to care, provider bias, and socioeconomic status. The prevalence of carotid stenosis in the general population is low (3%), and routine screening for carotid stenosis is not recommended in adults. Randomized clinical trials have shown benefits of stroke risk reduction with surgery (carotid endarterectomy or stenting) for symptomatic patients. Management is controversial in asymptomatic patients, as modern medical management has results equivalent to those of surgery and ongoing randomized clinical trials will address this important question. Carotid surgery is not appropriate in asymptomatic patients with limited life expectancy. Future work should explore comprehensive care models for care of patients with carotid disease and assessment of patient-reported outcomes to measure quality of care.

### Age modifies the relative risk of stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis – a pooled analysis of EVA-3S, SPACE and ICSS [^117T4THU]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent randomised controlled trials comparing carotid artery stenting (CAS) with endarterectomy (CEA) for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis were not powered to investigate differences in risks in specific patient subgroups. We therefore performed a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis trial (EVA-3S), the Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy trial (SPACE), and the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS).

Methods

Individual data from all 3433 patients randomised and analysed in these trials were pooled and analysed with fixed-effect binomial regression models adjusted for source trial. The primary outcome event was any stroke or death.

Results

In the first 120 days after randomisation (ITT analysis), the primary outcome event occurred in 153/1725 patients in the CAS group (8.9%) compared with 99/1708 patients in the CEA group (5.8%, risk ratio [RR] 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–1.95, p = 0.0006; absolute risk difference 3.2, 95% CI 1.4–4.9). Age was the only subgroup variable which significantly modified the treatment effect: in patients < 70 years old (the median age), the 120-day stroke or death risk was 5.8% in CAS and 5.7% in CEA (RR 1.00, 0.68–1.47); in patients 70 years or older, there was an estimated two-fold increase in risk with CAS over CEA (12.0% vs. 5.9%, RR 2.04, 1.48–2.82, interaction p = 0.0053).

Interpretation

Endarterectomy was safer in the short-term than stenting, because of an increased risk of stroke associated with stenting in patients over the age of 70 years. Stenting should be avoided in older patients, but may be as safe as endarterectomy in younger patients. Determination of the efficacy and ultimate balance between the two procedures requires further data on long-term stroke recurrence.

### Safety of stenting and endarterectomy by symptomatic status in the carotid revascularization endarterectomy versus stenting trial (CREST) [^113J86k6]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The safety of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has varied by symptomatic status in previous trials. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial (CREST) data were analyzed to determine safety in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

Methods

CREST is a randomized trial comparing safety and efficacy of CAS versus CEA in patients with high-grade carotid stenoses. Patients were defined as symptomatic if they had relevant symptoms within 180 days of randomization. The primary end point was stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years.

Results

For 1321 symptomatic and 1181 asymptomatic patients, the periprocedural aggregate of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death did not differ between CAS and CEA (5.2% versus 4.5%; hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.68; P = 0.38). The stroke and death rate was higher for CAS versus CEA (4.4% versus 2.3%; hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.98; P = 0.005). For symptomatic patients, the periprocedural stroke and death rates were 6.0% ± 0.9% for CAS and 3.2% ± 0.7% for CEA (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.11 to 3.21; P = 0.02). For asymptomatic patients, the stroke and death rates were 2.5% ± 0.6% for CAS and 1.4% ± 0.5% for CEA (hazard ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 4.42; P = 0.15). Rates were lower for those aged < 80 years.

Conclusions

There were no significant differences between CAS versus CEA by symptomatic status for the primary CREST end point. Periprocedural stroke and death rates were significantly lower for CEA in symptomatic patients. However, for both CAS and CEA, stroke and death rates were below or comparable to those of previous randomized trials and were within the complication thresholds suggested in current guidelines for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

### Predictors of stroke, myocardial infarction or death within 30 days of carotid artery stenting: results from the international carotid stenting study [^1127aGBF]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Summary

The risk of stroke, MI, or death within 30 days of CAS in ICSS was significantly higher in older patients, those undergoing a left-sided procedure, in non-smokers, in patients not taking the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, and in those with a more severe index event. An analysis of patients in whom a stent was deployed demonstrated a doubling of the risk of the composite event in those receiving an open cell design stent compared with a closed cell design.

Research in context

The study adds to emerging evidence that CAS is less safe in older patients. Individual patient data meta-analysis of the three large European trials of CAS versus CEA (ICSS, the Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in patients with Symptomatic Severe carotid Stenosis (EVA-3S) trialand the Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy (SPACE) trialfound that although risks of stroke or death within 120 days were similar in patients allocated to CAS or CEA in patients under the age of 70 years, the risk of CAS was twice that of CEA in patients over 70 with no reduction in the severity of events experienced by this age group.CREST showed a similar effect of age. It has now been shown that this effect is related to an increasing risk of stenting with increasing age. Age should therefore be taken into account when selecting patients for the procedure.

In most patients with carotid stenosis who are candidates for intervention, CEA is preferred to CAS for reduction of all-cause stroke and periprocedural death (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B), though data from CREST suggest patients aged < 70 years may be better treated by CAS but need further confirmation. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with ≥ 60% diameter stenosis should be considered for CEA to reduce long-term stroke risk, provided a 3- to 5-year life expectancy and periprocedural stroke/death rates ≤ 3% (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A).

Secondary Analyses

The overall rate of carotid revascularization decreased from 6.0 procedures per 100 000 in April 2002 to 4.3 procedures per 100 000 in the first quarter of 2014 (29% decrease; P < 0.001; Figure 1). The rate of endarterectomy decreased by 36% from 5.6 to 3.6 procedures per 100 000 (P < 0.001), whereas the rate of stenting increased by 72% from 0.39 to 0.67 procedures per 100 000 (P = 0.006). Similar to the overall carotid revascularization rates, we observed marked decreases in endarterectomy among men (38% decrease; P < 0.001) and women (31% decrease; P < 0.001), whereas the rates of carotid-artery stenting increased among men (74% increase; P < 0.001) and women (66% increase: P = 0.001; Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Sex-specific trends in the rates of carotid endarterectomy and stenting. These rates (per 100 000 adults ≥ 40 years old) are reported for 3-month periods from April 1, 2002, to March 31, 2014.

With respect to revascularization rates by age, time-series analysis found that the rates of carotid endarterectomy decreased significantly (P ≤ 0.001) among all age groups, except for those aged ≥ 80 years, who received endarterectomy at a relatively stable rate during the study period (from 0.78 to 0.71 procedures per 100 000; P = 0.99). Among the youngest (≤ 64 years old) group of patients, the rate of carotid-artery stenting increased by 57% (from 0.13 to 0.20 per 100 000; P < 0.001). Carotid-artery stenting rates also increased among the 2 oldest groups (75–79 and ≥ 80 years old) of patients (P = 0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively); however, these increases largely occurred between 2005 and 2010, and the rates of stenting among these older groups have since stabilized. See Figure I in thefor rates of carotid revascularization stratified by age.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^1147bTj2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Extracranial cerebrovascular disease — evidence and rationale for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in asymptomatic carotid stenosis are summarized as follows: randomized trials reported aggregate risk reduction, 53%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 22%-72%. ACAS thresholds included patients aged < 80 years and required that the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for the individual surgeon was not > 3%. CEA showed an advantage in limiting stroke and death at 5 years compared with maximal medical therapy (4.1% vs 10.0%; 95% CI, 4.0%-7.8%), and among patients aged < 75 years the 10-year stroke rates were 13.3% vs 17.9%. Systematic reviews and a population-based cohort analysis evaluated contemporary medical therapy, with 5-year stroke risk for 70% to 99% carotid stenosis at 14.6% (6 of 53) compared with 0% for 50% to < 70% stenosis (P < .0001), and for 80% to 99% stenosis ipsilateral stroke was 5 of 34 (18.3%) vs 1 of 173 (1%); P < .0001. Investigators concluded that the benefit of CEA might have been underestimated for patients with severe stenosis (> 70%), whereas the 5-year stroke risk was relatively low for those with < 70% stenosis receiving contemporary best medical therapy. Perioperative safety data from large National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, state, and Medicare datasets of 4000 to 35,000 patients demonstrated stroke and death rates as low as 2.2%, with a maximum of 6.9% (symptomatic patients only). For stenting alternatives, the role of TF-CAS or transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is even less clear because no completed studies have compared these treatments against best medical therapy.

### Restenosis and risk of stroke after stenting or endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis in the international carotid stenting study (ICSS): secondary analysis of a randomised trial [^114y2bVT]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Some investigators have recommended using higher cutoffs for peak systolic velocity on duplex ultrasound for a given degree of stenosis in stented carotid arteries compared with native arteries because of possible alterations in arterial wall elasticity after stenting. However, in ICSS, a comparison was done of duplex ultrasound velocities and degree of restenosis determined by CTA in a subset of 103 patients treated with stents. The optimum cutoff for peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery was greater than 1.25 m/s, which is similar to that used in our study for identifying moderate or higher (≥ 50%) restenosis. Hence, we used the same standardised velocity criteria in both treatment groups in this current analysis. The threshold for peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery we used was also similar to one recommended in a consensus paper (> 1.25 m/s).

We identified older age, female sex, current or past smoking, non-insulin dependent diabetes, history of angina, greater degree of stenosis in the contralateral carotid artery at randomisation, higher systolic or diastolic blood pressure at randomisation, and higher total serum cholesterol at randomisation as independent predictors of restenosis. In CREST, women, patients with diabetes, and those with dyslipidaemia were also at greater risk of restenosis after either treatment, as were smokers after endarterectomy. Researchers on the CAVATAS trial also identified smoking as an independent risk factor for restenosis. Although it is intuitive that vascular risk factors increase the risk for restenosis, the reason why female sex was associated with increased risk of restenosis is uncertain. However, this association might relate to the fact that the diameter of carotid arteries is smaller in women compared with men; thus, a given width of intimal hyperplasia might lead to a greater degree of stenosis in women than in men.

### Carotid stenting or carotid surgery in average surgical-risk patients: interpreting the conflicting clinical trial data [^117P8F6X]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

There are generic as well as carotid-specific trial design considerations that have the potential to materially affect the outcomes and interpretation of comparative studies between carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy. Recently, a series of trials in patients who are at average risk for carotid surgery have been reported. The European trials have all suffered from allowing an imbalance in operator experience between stenting and surgery and have consistently allowed stenting procedures without embolic protection. The combination of inexperienced operators and lack of embolic protection may be responsible for their negative stenting results. The Carotid Revascularization with Endarterectomy vs. Stenting Trial avoided both of these problems, having a threshold of experience for operators as well as mandating embolic protection be used. The Carotid Revascularization with Endarterectomy vs. Stenting Trial demonstrated noninferiority for stenting compared with surgery in average-risk symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, leading to Food and Drug Administration approval of a stent and protection for this indication. This has been recently followed by guidelines supporting the role of stenting compared with surgery from a broad range of professional societies.

### Second asymptomatic carotid surgery trial (ACST-2): a randomised comparison of carotid artery stenting versus carotid endarterectomy [^115PKLhV]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Severely stenosed carotid arteries predispose to stroke, and either carotid artery stenting (CAS) or carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can restore patency and reduce the long-term risk of stroke. Open carotid artery surgery completely removes the atheromatous material, but stenting is less invasive. In North America, some 100 000 surgery or stenting procedures are done each year to treat carotid artery narrowing, and numbers are similar for Europe. About half are to prevent recurrent stroke in symptomatic patients and half are for primary stroke prevention in asymptomatic patients (ie, those whose stenosis has not caused any recent ipsilateral symptoms), but this proportion varies from one country to another. Among asymptomatic patients with severe (eg, 70–99%) stenosis, successful CEA approximately halves the long-term stroke risk.

Both CAS and CEA, however, carry a short-term risk of stroke, which is about twice as great for symptomatic as for asymptomatic patients. When carotid procedures first became common, these risks were substantial, but nowadays they are much lower, particularly among asymptomatic patients. In Germany, for example, where all carotid procedures must, by law, be registered, during 2014–19, the in-hospital risk of disabling stroke or death among asymptomatic patients undergoing CAS (n = 18 000) or CEA (n = 86 000) was 0.7% for each procedure (appendix p 9); the additional in-hospital risk of non-disabling stroke was 1.1% for CAS and 0.7% for CEA. These rates are below the conventional 3% safety threshold, although only about two thirds of procedural strokes occur before hospital discharge. In this large German registry, the in-hospital risk of stroke after a carotid procedure was reliably shown to be unrelated to age or sex. In-hospital mortality from other causes was similar in both sexes but increased with age to nearly 1% after age 80 years.

### Carotid artery stenting according to the "tailored CAS" algorithm performed in the very elderly patients: the thirty day outcome [^115B8pvy]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess safety and efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) according to "tailored-CAS" algorithm in the elderly (≥ 75 years) in relation to younger patients.

Background

Although CAS has grown as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy the data on safety of CAS in the very elderly are inconsistent.

Material and Methods

1,139 patients with significant carotid stenosis underwent 1,252 CAS procedures in one high-volume center between years 2001–2011. CAS procedures were performed with lesion and patient dependent selection of neuroprotection type ("tailored-CAS"). There were 193 subjects ≥ 75-years-old (17%) and 946 < 75-years-old. No major differences in atherosclerosis risk factors and comorbidities between groups were noted. In both groups the majority of patients were male (70.4% vs. 68.6%, P = NS) and half of the patients were symptomatic (50.2% vs. 55.2%, P = NS). Bilateral carotid stenosis was present in 25% of patients from CAS ≥ 75 group and 22% from CAS < 75 group, P = NS. Proximal neuroprotection devices use for high risk or symptomatic lesions accounted for 31% in CAS ≥ 75 group and 32% in CAS < 75 group, P = NS.

Results

In symptomatic patients aged ≥ 75 years 30-day stroke and death rate was 7% versus 1.9% in symptomatic patients aged < 75; P = 0.01 and vs. 1.8% in asymptomatic elderly, P = 0.09. No myocardial infarcts were noted.

Conclusions

Symptomatic elderly is a group of highest CAS risk and the use of "tailored CAS" algorithm does not equalize CAS risk in this patients' group. "Tailored CAS" remains a safe procedure for asymptomatic elderly as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic young patients.

### Update in the treatment of extracranial atherosclerotic disease for stroke prevention [^115kj5Rx]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Individual factors

Age

Subgroup analysis of Carotid Revascularisation Endarterectomy vs Stent Trial (CREST) showed increased periprocedural stroke/MI/death by 1.77 times in patients older than 70 years treated with CAS, whereas no evidence of increased risk in CEA-treated patients. A meta-analysis of 4 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) also demonstrated significantly increased risk of stroke or death within 30 days after CAS in patients older than 70 and 80 years of age compared with those under 60 years of age (OR, 4.01 and 4.15, respectively). This association, however, was not found in patients undergoing CEA. Notably, even though CEA may be generally preferable to CAS in patients over 70 years old due to lower periprocedural rate of stroke or death, CAS is a reasonable choice in elderly patients with unfavourable anatomy for CEA, radiation-induced stenosis or restenosis after CEA.

Gender

Pooled data from ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trial) and NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) found greater benefit from surgery in men with the number needed to treat to prevent ipsilateral stroke in 5 years being 9 for men vs 36 for women in patients with 50% or higher stenosis. In addition, the 30-day perioperative risk of death was significantly higher in women than in men (2.3% vs 0.8%, p = 0.002). Combined analysis of NASCET and the ASA and Carotid Endarterectomy (ACE) trial found no benefit from CEA in women (ARR = 3.0%, p = 0.94), contrary to men (ARR = 10.0%, p = 0.02) in 50%–69% carotid stenosis. In contrast, with 70% to 99% stenosis, CEA was beneficially in both men and women with similar 5-year ARR in stroke (17.3% vs 15.1%). Therefore, CEA is effective for stroke prevention in symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (≥ 70%) regardless of genders, while may be only beneficial in men and selected women (eg, high risk of stroke) with moderate stenosis (50%–69%).

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1157zA9R]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — AHA/ASA key points 6–10 state that atrial fibrillation remains a common and high-risk condition for second ischemic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended if the patient has no contraindications; heart rhythm monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation is usually recommended if no other cause of stroke is discovered. Extracranial carotid artery disease is an important and treatable cause of stroke, and patients with severe stenosis ipsilateral to a nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attack who are candidates for intervention should have the stenosis fixed, likely relatively early after their ischemic stroke; the choice between carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting should be driven by specific patient comorbidities and features of their vascular anatomy. Patients with severe intracranial stenosis in the vascular territory of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack should not receive angioplasty and stenting as a first-line therapy for preventing recurrence, and aggressive medical management of risk factors and short-term dual antiplatelet therapy are preferred. For selected patients with patent foramen ovale, it is now considered reasonable to percutaneously close patent foramen ovale in patients who meet each of the following criteria: age 18–60 years, nonlacunar stroke, no other identified cause, and high risk patent foramen ovale features. Patients with embolic stroke of uncertain source should not be treated empirically with anticoagulants or ticagrelor because it was found to be of no benefit.

Extracranial carotid stenosis — supportive evidence and adjunctive medical therapy: A combined analysis of the original carotid endarterectomy (CEA) trials found robust benefit for CEA in severe (70%–99%) ICA stenosis with a 16.0% absolute benefit over 5 years. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, and antihypertensive therapy and statins are recommended; a trial of 2 lipid targets showed that an LDL target of < 70 mg/dL reduced vascular events compared with a target of 90 to 110 mg/dL and included patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional analyses found benefit in 50% to 69% ICA stenosis quantified as 4.6% over 5 years, with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 stroke higher in women than men (36 versus 9). In pooled carotid artery stenting (CAS) versus CEA analyses of 4754 patients from 4 clinical trials, within 120 days of study entry the hazard ratio for those aged 65 to 69 years was 1.61 (95% CI, 0.90–2.88).

### Safety of carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis by age: meta-analysis with individual patient data [^1141pc8h]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Cumulative incidence of stroke and death post-CEA were calculated from longitudinal studies. Six studies provided Kaplan-Meier curves of stroke rates and survival. This enabled extraction of patient-level data for survival analysis. Stroke and death incidence classified by 5-year age groups (< 65 years, 65–69 years, 70–74 years, 75–79 years, and ≥ 80 years) was calculated from studies reporting age-stratified stroke and death incidence and the IPD. Linear regression was used to estimate the additional perioperative risks per 5-year increase in age. Studies that provided older versus younger age group-specific incidence are included in the meta-analysis. Group differences in continuous parametric variables (such as age) were examined with Student t test or 1-way ANOVA, as appropriate. Group differences in categorical variables were examined with Fisher exact test or χ² test, as appropriate. P < 0.05 were considered significant.

In the event of heterogeneity between studies in the association of age with stroke risks, further sensitivity analyses were based on year of study (by decade), study type, and grading of study quality based on STROBE criteria and key criteria required for meta-analysis, which includes the following: study objectives stated clearly; patient selection criteria stated clearly; patients enrolled consecutively without predetermined selection; interventions adequately described; outcome definitions provided; rate of dropout or crossover to endarterectomy or stenting of < 20%; and outcome ascertainment by a neurologist. We graded each study as low, medium, or high based on these criteria. Potential publication bias in relation to the association of stenosis with stroke risk was assessed with an Egger funnel plot. Analysis was performed using R version 4.1.1 and Review Manager (RevMan, computer program, version 5.4, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020).

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^112KYR2i]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Extracranial carotid disease — age and nerve injury considerations for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) versus carotid artery stenting (CAS): CEA is associated with a lower stroke risk than CAS in patients aged > 80 years, and a combined death, stroke, and MI rate of 10% has been seen in octogenarians treated with CAS. In the CREST study, CAS was associated with an increased stroke risk in patients aged > 70 years and appeared to have a benefit compared with CEA in patients aged < 70 years. Because there is a demonstrable incidence of cranial nerve injury after CEA that is absent after CAS, patients with a history of a contralateral vocal cord paralysis are at increased risk with CEA vs CAS; thus, CAS would be preferred in these patients.

### Combined risk modelling approach to identify the optimal carotid revascularisation approach [^113Ky3hz]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Two primary revascularisation strategies exist for patients with carotid artery stenosis — carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS). Most patients with CAS could be treated with either procedure and, thus, numerous trials have compared these techniques, generally slightly favouring CEA. The largest single trial, which also used the most rigorous proceduralist credentialing strategy, was The Carotid Revascularisation Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST). It found that CAS was non-inferior to CEA on a composite endpoint including stroke and periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) and that younger patients may benefit more from CAS than CEA. Reflecting this evidence, guidelines have generally suggested that while there is more evidence for CEA than CAS, that both procedures can be considered as treatment options for individual patients.

Yet, the question of how to select the best approach for an individual patient is unclear. In part, based on the results of the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectom (SAPPHIRE) trial, CAS is generally recommended for high risk patients, although the precise definition of high risk is uncertain. Similarly, the subgroup effect in CREST towards greater benefit with CAS in younger patients could be used to inform individual decisions. In addition to these strategies, the observation that CAS is generally associated with a higher perioperative risk of stroke while CEA is generally associated with a higher risk of periprocedural MIsuggests a possible approach to selecting the optimal treatment for individual patients. To the extent that risk for stroke and MI risk can be accurately predicted and these risks can be separated, treating patients at relatively high stroke risk with CEA and patients with relatively high MI risk with CAS may be a feasible strategy. This strategy is particularly promising because prior work suggests that the risk of stroke in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis can be effectively stratified with straight-forward clinical models.

In this study, we describe the development and external validation of a combined modelling approach to predict the optimal revascularisation technique in individuals undergoing carotid revascularisation using data from the CREST trial. The goal of this modelling approach is to inform individual-level risk with CEA and CAS by accounting for all known factors that predict outcomes with either treatment.

### Carotid artery stenting [^113A2cqp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has achieved clinical equipoise with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), as evidenced by 2 large U.S. randomized clinical trials, multiple pivotal registry trials, and 2 multispecialty guideline documents endorsed by 14 professional societies. The largest randomized trial conducted in patients at average surgical risk of CEA, CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial) found no difference between CAS and CEA for the combined endpoint of stroke, death, and myocardial infarction (MI) after 4 years of follow-up. The largest randomized trial comparing CAS and CEA in patients at increased surgical risk, SAPPHIRE (Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy), looked at 1-year stroke, death, and MI incidence and found no difference in symptomatic patients, but a significantly better outcome in asymptomatic patients for CAS (9.9% vs. 21.5%; p = 0.02). Given that > 70% of carotid revascularization procedures are performed in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention of stroke, it is incumbent upon clinicians to demonstrate that revascularization has an incremental benefit over highly effective modern medical therapy alone.

### Safety of carotid revascularization in symptomatic patients with less than 70 years [^115a5P59]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Age is a main risk factor for stroke and perioperative risk. This study aims to analyze the effect of age by symptomatic status in young patients receiving carotid revascularization.

Methods

Consecutive carotid revascularization procedures performed during the period 2001–2009 were reviewed. Patients were analyzed by age using the 70-year threshold as suggested by trials. Primary end point was perioperative stroke or death rate. Secondary end points included survival and late stroke incidence at 6 years.

Results

A total of 2,196 procedures (1,080 by carotid artery stenting [CAS] and 1,116 by carotid endarterectomy [CEA]) were analyzed. Symptomatic patients (n = 684) showed higher perioperative stroke or death risks (24 of 684 [3.5%] versus 29 of 1,512 [1.9%], odds ratio [OR] 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–3.22; P = 0.034) and lower 6-year survival (74% vs. 82%, P < 0.0001) or freedom from late stroke (93% vs. 97%, P = 0.001) when compared with asymptomatic patients with similar differences detected within CEA or CAS procedure. Overall 949 procedures were in patients with 70 years or less at the time of intervention (500 CEA and 449 CAS); 282 were in patients symptomatic for minor stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months before revascularization. For young symptomatic patients, primary end point rates were < 2.5% after both CEA and CAS procedure. Perioperative stroke or death rates were 2.4% in symptomatic versus 1.5% in asymptomatic (4 of 170 vs. 5 of 330; OR 1.57; 95% CI 0.42–5.91; P = 0.50) within the CEA group and 1.8% in symptomatic versus 1.2% in asymptomatic (2 of 112 vs. 4 of 337; OR 1.51; 95% CI 0.27–8.38; P = 0.64) within the CAS group. At 6 years, symptomatic young patients showed survival (89.5% vs. 89%, P = 0.76) and freedom from late stroke (97% vs. 98%, P = 0.56) rates comparable to those found in asymptomatic patients, with similar incidences after CAS or CEA procedure.

Conclusions

Outcomes after carotid revascularization are related to patients' age. At younger ages (< 70 years), after carotid revascularization, symptomatic patients show low perioperative risks of stroke or death, comparable with those in asymptomatic patients. The same, 2.5% or lower, threshold for perioperative stroke or death risk related to asymptomatic carotid procedures must be applied today to symptomatic patients when younger than age of 70 years.

### Carotid artery stenting: rationale, technique, and current concepts [^115AhJr7]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Carotid stenosis is a major risk factor for stroke. With the aging of the general population and the availability of non-invasive vascular imaging studies, the diagnosis of a carotid plaque is commonly made in medical practice. Asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenoses need to be considered separately because their natural history is different. Two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in preventing ipsilateral ischemic events in patients with symptomatic severe stenosis. The benefit of surgery is much less for moderate stenosis and harmful in patients with stenosis less than 50%. Surgery has a marginal benefit in patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Improvements in medical treatment must be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of these previous trials which compared surgery against medical treatment available at the time the trials were conducted. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) might avoid the risks associated with surgery, including cranial nerve palsy, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism. Therefore and additionally to well-established indications of CAS, this endovascular approach might be a valid alternative particularly in patients at high surgical risk. However, trials of endovascular treatment of carotid stenosis have failed to provide enough evidence to justify routine CAS as an alternative to CEA in patients suitable for surgery. More data from ongoing randomized trials of CEA versus CAS will be soon available. These results will help determining the role of CAS in the management of patients with carotid artery stenosis.

Results

Cohort Characteristics

A total of 16 772 individuals who underwent carotid revascularization were included, of which 14 394 (86%) underwent endarterectomy and 2378 (14%) underwent stenting (Table). Mean age (SD) of the total cohort was 69.8 (9.4) years, and 34% were female. Most patients resided in urban areas (81%), were treated at nonacademic institutions (53%), and had asymptomatic carotid-artery stenosis (58%). Of note, among patients ≥ 75 years old, 59% were symptomatic in the stenting group and 46% were symptomatic in the endarterectomy group. With respect to operator specialty, vascular surgeons (55%), followed by neurosurgeons (21%), general surgeons (16%), and cardiac surgeons (8%), most commonly performed carotid endarterectomy. Radiologists (79%) and neurosurgeons (16%), on the contrary, almost exclusively performed carotid-artery stenting.

### Meta-analysis of the procedural risks of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting over time [^116L4hMg]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in the developed world 1, 2 and carotid artery stenosis is one of the main causes of ischaemic stroke. RCTs have shown that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has early (procedural) hazards, but is an effective long‐term stroke prevention treatment, in both symptomatic (patients who have recently had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)) 3, 4 and asymptomatic 5 patients. More recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been introduced. RCTs 6, 7, 8 comparing these procedures have shown that CAS has higher procedural stroke/death risks than CEA in symptomatic patients, whereas there was no significant difference in procedural stroke/death risks of the two procedures in asymptomatic patients 7, 9.

Clinical guidelines and cost‐effectiveness analyses of CEA and CAS are based on data from RCTs, although the patients in these trials were mostly recruited some years ago, before 2005. International guidelines 10, 11 recommend CEA for suitable symptomatic patients with a tight carotid stenosis (more than 50–70 per cent narrowed, by diameter) provided that the surgical procedural stroke/death risk is less than 6 per cent. For asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis over 60 per cent, guidelines suggest that CEA may be considered if the procedural stroke/death risk is less than 3 per cent. For CAS, less specific complication rates are specified, as CAS may sometimes be reserved for patients who are high risk for CEA because of severe co‐morbidities or unusual vascular anatomical characteristics 12. Although these recommendations are usually based on level I evidence from RCTs, procedural risk may have changed since these trials were conducted.

Control of vascular risk factors has intensified with the widespread use of statins after 2005, and this is also likely to have contributed to reductions in procedural risks 5, 13. Patient selection for CEA and CAS has also improved 14, with patients considered unfavourable for CEA owing to hostile anatomy or co‐morbidities being referred to CAS. Emerging evidence suggests that in‐hospital stroke/death risks of CEA and CAS, and stroke/death rates within 30 days of the procedure in asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA may have decreased 15, 16.

### Identification of patient characteristics that may improve procedure selection for the treatment of carotid stenosis [^117Upu35]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The association between age and the risk of OE was stronger in CAS compared with CEA (Fig. 2a). The different slopes for CEA and CAS can be used to identify the effect modification. This indicates that, the older the patients, the lower the relative risk of CEA compared with CAS under otherwise identical conditions. These results are congruent with earlier publications from Germany, an individual patient meta-analysis of the Carotid Stenting Trialists' Collaboration (CSTC; data from the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stent Trial (CREST), the Endarterectomy versus Angioplasty in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis (EVA-3S) trial, and the Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial), and a systematic review of international observational studies. The aforementioned CSTC meta-analysis identified age as a statistically significant effect modifier, but all other subgroups analysed demonstrated no evidence of effect modification. These divergent results may be due to several variations between the CSTC data and the mandatory nationwide German carotid database. In particular, the CSTC included considerably fewer patients (3433 versus 221 282), only symptomatic patients, only patients who were eligible for both procedures, only patients in participating centres, only patients who consented to study participation, and only patients who met all inclusion criteria, and participating centres and physicians had to meet all minimum requirements for participation. Conversely, the CSTC included patients who were randomized (but only for the CEA–CAS head-to-head comparison), patients who were from different countries, and, most importantly, patients who were prospectively documented, resulting in very low information bias. Notably, the external validity of RCTs is heterogeneous and may vary from clinical practice, for example concerning age, co-morbidities and medication, as analysed in detail by Kallmayer et al. A higher risk in older patients could be caused by increasing vascular calcification with age, especially in patients with calcification of the access routes to the carotid artery. A retrospective analysis of the Vascular Quality Initiative database that included 11 342 patients who underwent transfemoral CAS or transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) supported this notion; this study revealed that marked carotid artery calcification was associated with worse outcomes in patients who underwent transfemoral CAS, whereas this was not the case with TCAR. Additionally, the formation of unfavourable aortic arch anatomy during ageing may cause a higher risk in old patients who undergo CAS. Further, the negative effects of an unfavourable or longer access route could cause a higher risk of right-sided stenosis in CAS than in CEA, as the present study reveals. A higher risk of right-sided CAS was also found in the systematic review by Touzé et al. which included greater than 30 000 patients from 12 studies.

### Immediate and late clinical outcomes of carotid artery stenting in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: a 5-year prospective analysis [^1123jX7g]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Carotid stenting is a less invasive percutaneous procedure than carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of carotid stenosis. Reports suggest that it can be performed with periprocedural complication rates similar to those of carotid endarterectomy. The purpose of this study was to determine short- and long-term outcomes in the largest prospective cohort of carotid stenting patients.

Methods and Results

This study followed 528 consecutive patients (604 hemispheres/arteries) undergoing carotid stenting. There was a 0.6% (n = 3) fatal stroke rate and 1% (n = 5) nonstroke death rate at 30 days. The major stroke rate was 1% (n = 6), and the minor stroke rate was 4.8% (n = 29). The overall 30-day stroke and death rate was 7.4% (n = 43). Over the 5-year study period, the 30-day minor stroke rate improved from 7.1% (n = 7) for the first year to 3.1% (n = 5) for the fifth year (P: < 0.05 for trend). The best predictor of 30-day stroke and death was age ≥ 80 years. After the 30-day period, the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke was 3.2% (n = 31). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 3-year freedom from ipsilateral or fatal stroke was 92 ± 1%.

Conclusions

Experience from a single group of operators demonstrates that carotid stenting can be performed with an acceptable 30-day complication rate. Late follow-up also demonstrates a low rate of fatal and nonfatal stroke. These results suggest that carotid stenting may be comparable to carotid endarterectomy, and it underscores the clinical equipoise and premise for the National Institute of Health-supported, randomized Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stent Trial comparing carotid stenting with carotid endarterectomy.

### Secondary stroke prevention: patent foramen ovale, aortic plaque, and carotid stenosis [^1121P867]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis included 11 randomized trials (but not CREST) and reported outcomes in 4796 patients. The periprocedural risk of stroke or death was lower for carotid surgery (OR 0.67, P = 0.025) than for carotid stenting. The risk of myocardial infarction (OR 2.69, P = 0.036) and cranial nerve injury (OR 10.2, P < 0.001) was higher in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.

Taken together, the results of the so far published studies show a lower and in some cases a similar complication rate for endarterectomy compared with carotid stenting. The reported medium-time outcomes in a 2–4-year follow-up were comparable but the restenosis rate was higher after carotid stenting. It is likely that the success of carotid stenting (and for that matter also of carotid endarterectomy) depends heavily on the experience of a given centre.

There remain many unanswered research questions despite the 12 studies published so far. Most of the studies were underpowered to show non-inferiority or equivalence of carotid stenting compared with endarterectomy. In addition, the trials had different primary and secondary endpoints and different definitions for complications. Some studies included only patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, whereas others had a mixture of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. There seems to be an age effect on outcomes. Patients aged over 70–75 years had a higher early complication rate with carotid stenting while the rate in carotid endarterectomy was not age-dependent. None of the trials considered plaque morphology. One would expect that carotid stenosis with a heavy calcification load would benefit more from endarterectomy than from stenting.

Current state of the subject

Symptomatic patients with significant stenosis of the ICA should preferably undergo carotid endarterectomy. In experienced centres, carotid stenting can be equivalent in terms of benefit and complications. The benefit of surgery is no longer present when the complication rate exceeds 6%. Most of the randomized studies, however, achieved complication rates below that. Therefore, patient selection is of major importance. In addition, one has to consider the countries in which the trials were performed. For patients enrolled in the USA (CREST) or Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (SPACE), carotid surgery and carotid stenting seem to be similar. Therefore, experience and complication rate of a particular vascular surgeon, interventionalist, or team may decide which method is preferred.

### Does stenting produce better results than endarterectomy?… [^114QLdGN]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Background: Angioplasty is the recommended treatment for patients who have substantial stenosis of a carotid artery and high risk of stroke. Recently, carotid artery stenting has been advocated as an alternative treatment to endarterectomy. A Cochrane systematic review concluded that the 30-day safety outcomes of the two treatments did not differ significantly, but that large, well-designed clinical trials were needed. The SPACE trial was designed to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting for severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The Study: The international study enrolled 1, 200 patients at 35 centers. The two groups were comparable in important variables. The average age was 68 years; 28 percent were women; and the distributions of stenosis severity, qualifying events, and comorbidities were similar between the two groups.

The two criteria for inclusion in the study were serious neurologic or ocular symptoms within the previous 180 days, and at least 70 percent stenosis in the ipsilateral carotid artery on duplex ultrasonography. Results: Of the 605 patients assigned to stenting, 567 received the treatment. In the endarterectomy group, 565 of 595 patients underwent the procedure. Within 30 days of stenting, the rate of stroke or death was 6. 84 percent compared with
6. 34 percent following endarterectomy. For both procedures, results were worse for patients older than 75 years and for women. Endarterectomy had slightly better results in older patients and women, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The authors conclude that the two procedures are similar in all measured outcomes.

Although larger trials with longer follow-up are needed, the study failed to demonstrate any outcomes or trends indicating that stenting is safer or that it provides any significant advantage over endarterectomy. editor's note: A study conducted in U. S. veterans also reported no significant differences between conventional endarterectomy and stenting. 1 The study compared 46 stent and 48 endarterectomy patients for outcomes including progression to critical restenosis, repeat surgeries, subsequent symptoms or stroke, and mortality. The researchers also reported equivalent changes in carotid artery velocity for up to 24 months of follow-up. — A. D. W.

### Risk prediction for adverse events after carotid artery stenting in higher surgical risk patients [^1159f2YY]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The goal of carotid artery stenting is to decrease the risk of stroke or other adverse events from carotid artery disease. Choosing a treatment strategy requires patient-specific information regarding periprocedural risk of adverse neurologic events. The aim of this study was to predict individual patient risk after carotid artery stenting in patients at higher risk for carotid endarterectomy.

Methods

Subjects enrolled in the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High-Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) worldwide study underwent carotid artery stenting with distal protection. Only patients with at least 1 anatomic or comorbid factor associated with elevated surgical risk were included. Preprocedural factors were used to develop a model and integer-based risk score predicting stroke or death within 30 days. The model was calibrated and internally validated using bootstrap resampling.

Results

Ten thousand one hundred eighty-six patients were included in the analysis. The overall rate of stroke or death was 3.6% at 30 days after carotid artery stenting. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes were increased age (P = 0.006), history of stroke (P < 0.001), history of transient ischemic attack presentation (P = 0.001), recent (< 4 weeks) myocardial infarction (P = 0.006), dialysis treatment (P = 0.007), need for cardiac surgery in addition to carotid revascularization (P = 0.005), a right-sided carotid stenosis (P = 0.006), a longer carotid plaque (P = 0.012), the presence of a Type II or III aortic arch (P = 0.035), and a tortuous carotid arterial system (P = 0.004). The optimism-adjusted C-statistic was 0.691.

Conclusions

Commonly collected clinical and anatomic variables can identify patients at high and low risk for stroke or death after carotid artery stenting.

### Management of carotid stenosis in women: consensus document [^115RJ9ah]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Specific guidelines for management of cerebrovascular risk in women are currently lacking. This study aims to provide a consensus expert opinion to help make clinical decisions in women with carotid stenosis.

Methods

Proposals for the use of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid stenting (CAS), and medical therapy for stroke prevention in women with carotid stenosis were provided by a group of 9 international experts with consensus method.

Results

Symptomatic women with severe carotid stenosis can be managed by CEA provided that the perioperative risk of the operators is low (< 4%). Periprocedural stroke risks may be increased in symptomatic women if revascularization is performed by CAS; however, the choice of CAS vs CEA can be tailored in subgroups best fit for each procedure (e.g., women with restenosis or severe coronary disease, best suited for CAS; women with tortuous vessels or old age, best suited for CEA). There is currently limited evidence to consider medical therapy alone as the best choice for women with neurologically severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis, who should be best managed within randomized trials including a medical arm. Medical management and cardiovascular risk factor control must be implemented in all women with carotid stenosis in periprocedural period and lifelong regardless of whether or not intervention is planned.

Conclusions

The suggestions provided in this article may constitute a decision-making basis for planning treatment of carotid stenosis in women. Most recommendations are of limited strength; however, it is unlikely that new robust data will emerge soon to induce relevant changes.

Society for Vascular Surgery carotid artery disease — areas without consensus note that we could not completely agree on the role of carotid stenting in asymptomatic patients and that data supporting stenting in this setting were of poor quality because of the absence of a medically managed control group; a minority felt that patients with acceptable medical risk, high anatomic risk, and compelling carotid pathology should be considered candidates for stenting, whereas a minority felt that in the absence of trials comparing medical therapy with stenting in this cohort, such a recommendation, even as GRADE 2 was ill advised. We also failed to reach consensus over many details in the technical performance of endarterectomy and stenting, and supporting data were inconsistent and generally of low quality and that all recommendations were GRADE 2 (at best), including whether protamine reversal of heparin after carotid clamping should be recommended or not recommended and optimal cerebral monitoring and protection during endarterectomy or the preferred patch for use in carotid closure.

### Short-term outcome after stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis: a preplanned meta-analysis of individual patient data [^112KVk7Q]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Results from randomised controlled trials have shown a higher short-term risk of stroke associated with carotid stenting than with carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis. However, these trials were underpowered for investigation of whether carotid artery stenting might be a safe alternative to endarterectomy in specific patient subgroups. We therefore did a preplanned meta-analysis of individual patient data from three randomised controlled trials.

Methods

Data from all 3433 patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis who were randomly assigned and analysed in the Endarterectomy versus Angioplasty in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis (EVA-3S) trial, the Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial, and the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS) were pooled and analysed with fixed-effect binomial regression models adjusted for source trial. The primary outcome event was any stroke or death. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included all patients and outcome events occurring between randomisation and 120 days thereafter. The per-protocol (PP) analysis was restricted to patients receiving the allocated treatment and events occurring within 30 days after treatment.

Findings

In the first 120 days after randomisation (ITT analysis), any stroke or death occurred significantly more often in the carotid stenting group (153 [8.9%] of 1725) than in the carotid endarterectomy group (99 [5.8%] of 1708, risk ratio [RR] 1.53, [95% CI 1.20–1.95], p = 0.0006; absolute risk difference 3.2 [1.4–4.9]). Of all subgroup variables assessed, only age significantly modified the treatment effect: in patients younger than 70 years (median age), the estimated 120-day risk of stroke or death was 50 (5.8%) of 869 patients in the carotid stenting group and 48 (5.7%) of 843 in the carotid endarterectomy group (RR 1.00 [0.68–1.47]); in patients 70 years or older, the estimated risk with carotid stenting was twice that with carotid endarterectomy (103 [12.0%] of 856 vs 51 [5.9%] of 865, 2.04 [1.48–2.82], interaction p = 0.0053, p = 0.0014 for trend). In the PP analysis, risk estimates of stroke or death within 30 days of treatment among patients younger than 70 years were 43 (5.1%) of 851 patients in the stenting group and 37 (4.5%) of 821 in the endarterectomy group (1.11 [0.73–1.71]); in patients 70 years or older, the estimates were 87 (10.5%) of 828 patients and 36 (4.4%) of 824, respectively (2.41 [1.65–3.51]; categorical interaction p = 0.0078, trend interaction p = 0.0013].

Interpretation

Stenting for symptomatic carotid stenosis should be avoided in older patients (age ≥ 70 years), but might be as safe as endarterectomy in younger patients.

### Carotid endarterectomy in SAPPHIRE-eligible high-risk patients: implications for selecting patients for carotid angioplasty and stenting [^113HJrSU]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients excluded from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and in those considered at high risk for CEA. In light of recently released CAS data in patients at high risk, we reviewed our experience with CEA.

Methods

The records for consecutive patients who underwent CEA between 1998 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed, and risk was stratified according to inclusion and exclusion criteria from a "high-risk" or CAS-CEA trial, The Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial.

Results

Of 776 CEAs performed, 323 (42%) were considered high risk, on the basis of criteria including positive stress test (n = 109, 14%), age older than 80 years (n = 85, 11%), contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 66, 9%), pulmonary dysfunction (n = 56, 7%), high cervical lesion (n = 36, 5%), and repeat carotid operation (n = 27, 3%). Other high-risk criteria included recent myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac surgery, or class III or IV cardiac status; left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%; contralateral laryngeal palsy; and previous neck irradiation (each < 1.5%). Clinical presentation was similar in the high-risk and low-risk groups: asymptomatic (73% versus 73%), transient ischemic attack (23% vs 22%), and previous stroke (4% vs 5%). The overall postoperative stroke rate was 1.4% (symptomatic, 2.9%; asymptomatic, 0.9%). Comparison of high-risk and low-risk CEAs demonstrated no statistical difference in the stroke rate. Factors associated with significantly increased stroke risk included cervical radiation therapy, class III or IV angina, symptomatic presentation, and age 60 years or younger. Overall mortality was 0.3% (symptomatic, 0.5%; asymptomatic, 0.2%), not significantly different between the high-risk (0.6%) and low-risk groups (0.0%). Non-Q-wave MI was more frequent in the high-risk group (3.1 vs 0.9%; P < .05). A composite cluster of adverse clinical events (death, stroke, MI) was more frequent in the symptomatic high-risk group (9.3% vs 1.6%; P < .005), but not in the asymptomatic cohort. There was a trend for more major cranial nerve injuries in patients with local risk factors, such as high carotid bifurcation, repeat operation, and cervical radiation therapy (4.6% vs 1.7%; P < .13). In 121 patients excluded on the basis of synchronous or immediate subsequent operations, who also would have been excluded from SAPPHIRE, the overall rates for stroke (1.65%; P = 0.69), death (1.65%; P = 0.09), and MI (0.83%; P = 0.71) were not significantly different from those in the study population.

Conclusions

CEA can be performed in patients at high risk, with stroke and death rates well within accepted standards. These data question the use of CAS as an alternative to CEA, even in patients at high risk.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^117VJ25w]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy — evidence limitations and NASCET exclusions: Carotid endarterectomy for nonhemispheric symptoms, vertebrobasilar symptoms, acute stroke, or for stroke or TIA with internal carotid occlusion is not supported by high quality evidence but rather by very low quality evidence (case series and unsystematic observations), and in these settings surgeon's complication rate and patient's values and preferences play a major role in decision making. NASCET withheld endarterectomy from patients with life expectancy of less than 5 years and significant comorbid conditions and also excluded patients over the age of 79, those with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy, and those without adequate angiographic visualization; accordingly, the net benefit in these populations is unclear, requiring judicious and selective application, and case by case decision-making with attention to patient values, surgeon experience, and surgical center outcomes.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^111TsPtw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis in stroke prevention has been the subject of extensive investigations, including multiple randomized controlled trials. The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS), were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas: (1) is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of > 50%; (3) the timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke; (4) screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) the optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease. A separate implementation document will address other important clinical issues in extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (grades of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation) approach, as was used for other Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines. The committee recommends CEA as the first-line treatment for symptomatic low-risk surgical patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 70% to 99%. The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. In patients with recent stable stroke (modified Rankin scale score, 0–2), carotid revascularization is considered appropriate for symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis and should be performed as soon as the patient is neurologically stable after 48 hours but definitely < 14 days after symptom onset. In the general population, screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors for carotid artery disease is not recommended. In selected asymptomatic patients with an increased risk of carotid stenosis, we suggest screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis as long as the patients would potentially be fit for and willing to consider carotid intervention if significant stenosis is discovered. For patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% to 99%, who require both CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting, we suggest CEA before, or concomitant with, coronary artery bypass grafting to potentially reduce the risk of stroke and stroke/death. The sequencing of the intervention depends on the clinical presentation and institutional experience.

### Carotid artery stenting in older patients: is age a risk factor for poor outcome? [^116YHVoC]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the impact of age on technical success and complications of carotid stenting in a prospective single-center cohort study.

Methods

One hundred eleven consecutive patients (74 men; median age 70 years) with ≥ 70% symptomatic (n = 33) or ≥ 90% asymptomatic (n = 78) internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis underwent carotid artery stent implantation. Primary technical success and periprocedural complications were compared in patients aged > 75 years (n = 28) to patients < 75 years (n = 83).

Results

Patient groups below and above 75 years compared well with respect to baseline demographic and clinical data. Successful stenting was achieved in 108 (97%) patients. The combined neurological complication rate was 7% (n = 8), with 1 (1%) major stroke, 1 (1%) minor stroke, and no 30-day mortality. Technical angiographic complications occurred in 8 (7%) patients. No significant differences between patients > 75 years and those < 75 years were observed for primary success rates (100% [28/28] versus 96% [80/83]; p = 0.8), overall complications (14% [4/28] versus 16% [13/83]; p = 1.0), neurological complications (7% [2/28] versus 7% [6/83]; p = 1.0), or technical complications (7% [2/28] versus 4% [3/83]; p = 0.6).

Conclusions

Elective carotid stenting can be performed safely in older patients with several comorbidities. Patient age does not seem to be an independent risk factor for poor outcome after endovascular treatment of internal carotid artery stenosis.

### Does carotid stenting measure up to endarterectomy? [^112ofNaM]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Results Mean ± SD age was 68. 8 ±

1. 2 years, and overall mean ± SD rate of stenosis was 79% ± 10%. Preprocedural neurologic symptoms were present in 42% of the group. Indications for treatment included prior neck surgery with irradiation, recurrent stenosis, and severe comorbidities. The clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. Mean ± SD age was
68. 8 ± 1. 2 years, and overall mean ± SD rate of stenosis was 79% ± 10%. Preprocedural neurologic symptoms were present in 22 of the group. Among the 3 patients not adjunctively treated with a stent, 2 had recurrent in-stent stenosis and the other patient, who had fibromuscular dysplasia, had a satisfactory result with angioplasty alone. Mechanical cerebral protection devices were used in 44 of the procedures. The mean ± SD occlusion time was 12. 3 ±
0. 93 minutes.

Percutaneous closure devices were used in 4 patients. This consisted of a death due to an indeterminate yet nonneurologic cause at 9 months, a fatal myocardial infarction at 31 days, a fatal MI at 1 year, and the aforementioned fatal hemorrhagic stroke. Both recurrences were treated only with repeated balloon angioplasty and have remained patent at least 6 months later. A third patient developed a recurrent stenosis at 6 months within a segment of a prior CEA not originally stented. This was treated with repeated angioplasty and proximal extension of the stented segment. The stroke and death rate between the 2 groups within 30 days of treatment was no different:

10. 0% in the endovascular group vs
9. 9% in the CEA group. At the 3-year follow-up visit, the rate of death or stroke was 14. 3% in the endovascular group and
14. 2% in the surgery group.

### Thirty-day outcomes for carotid artery stenting in 6320 patients from 2 prospective, multicenter, high-surgical-risk registries [^115b5stm]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The American Heart Association has established guidelines for acceptable 30-day death and stroke rates for patients with severe carotid disease undergoing standard-risk carotid endarterectomy: < 3% for asymptomatic lesions and < 6% for symptomatic lesions. To date, carotid artery stenting has not demonstrated these outcomes in multicenter, prospective assessments of high-surgical-risk patients.

Methods and Results

Data from 2 prospective, multicenter (280 US sites, 672 operators), postmarket surveillance studies in high-surgical-risk patients were analyzed: 2145 patients from the Emboshield and Xact Post Approval Carotid Stent Trial (EX) and 4175 patients from the Carotid ACCULINK/ACCUNET Post Approval Trial to Uncover Rare Events (C2). Both studies had pre- and postprocedure neurological evaluation and independent adjudication of neurological events. The overall 30-day death and stroke rate was 4.1% (95% CI, 3.3% to 5.0%) for EX and 3.4% (95% CI, 2.9% to 4.0%) for C2. In the population comparable with American Heart Association guidelines (< 80 years), the combined 30-day death and stroke rate was 5.3% (95% CI, 3.6% to 7.4%) for symptomatic patients and 2.9% (95% CI, 2.4% to 3.4%) for asymptomatic patients, independent of unfavorable risk factors (anatomic or physiologic); in patients ≥ 80 years, this rate was 10.5% (95% CI, 6.3% to 16.0%) and 4.4% (95% CI, 3.3% to 5.7%), respectively. In subjects with anatomic features unfavorable for surgery, the 30-day death and stroke rates were 1.7% (95% CI, 0.0% to 8.9%) and 2.7% (95% CI, 1.3% to 4.9%) for symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts, respectively, independent of age.

Conclusions

Outcomes for carotid artery stenting in nonoctogenarian high-surgical-risk patients have improved since the pivotal Food and Drug Administration approval trials, and have achieved American Heart Association standards in both symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions.

### Meta-analysis of the procedural risks of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting over time [^117R5JzX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In due course, the pooled results from several completed and ongoing large randomized trials directly comparing CEA with CAS (CREST‐1, ACT‐1, SPACE‐2 and ACST‐2 46) and CEA/CAS versus medical therapy (ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trial) 2 47 and CREST‐2 48) will provide reliable contemporary randomized evidence. Until newer RCTs are complete, results from older RCTs remain the standard for comparative analysis between treatment methods. Although observational data cannot provide reliable direct evidence for comparative procedural risks, it can inform absolute risks of particular interventions in categories of patients.

Clinical guidelines and health policy are also informed by the cost‐effectiveness of interventions. However, most cost‐effectiveness studies of CEA and CAS 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 have used RCTs or observational cohort studies with patients recruited mostly before 2005. Without recent randomized data, contemporary observational data together with relative risks from randomized trials could inform current clinical practice. In this review, the focus was on procedural risk, but observational data could also inform long‐term stroke risk in patients with carotid stenosis. Recently, calls have been made for the recommendation of medical therapy alone in patients with asymptomatic carotid disease; the proponents claim that, owing to improvements in medical therapy, all asymptomatic patients should be offered medical therapy only and no prophylactic intervention should be considered 55. However, in guiding such decisions, the stroke/death rates achieved with medical therapy in recent studies should be considered, in view of the decreasing procedural risks of CEA in recent years, rather than the risks in landmark RCTs performed many years ago.

### Critique of the carotid revascularization endarterectomy versus stenting trial (CREST): flaws in CREST and its interpretation [^113KXaZ3]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) has been used to support the equivalence of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the treatment of carotid stenosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This inclusion of two different forms of the disease decreased the power and significance of the CREST results and weakened the trial. Other flaws in CREST were the equal weighting of mostly minor myocardial infarctions (MIs) with strokes and death in the peri-procedural, composite 'end' point, but not in the 4-year, long-term 'end' point. Although CAS was associated with 50% fewer peri-procedural MIs compared with CEA, there were > 2.5-fold more MIs after CAS than CEA at 4 years. The 4-year MI rate, however, was not a component of the primary 'end' point. Additionally, although the initial CREST report indicated that there was no difference in the outcomes of CAS and CEA according to symptomatic status or sex, subsequent subgroup analyses showed that CAS was associated with significantly higher stroke and death rates than CEA in symptomatic patients, in females and in individuals ≥ 65 years of age. The present article will examine these and other flaws and the details of CREST's results derived from the trial's preplanned subanalyses to show why the claims that CREST demonstrates equivalence of the two therapeutic procedures are unjustified.

### Prediction models for clinical outcome after a carotid revascularisation procedure: a systematic review [^1138sboQ]. European Stroke Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis of ≥ 50% or occlusion caused 12% of strokes in patients who were admitted to the hospital because of first-ever or recurrent ischaemic stroke. Both carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduce the risk of new ipsilateral stroke in patients with symptomatic ICA stenosis, but carry a periprocedural complication risk. The risk of stroke or death within 30 days after treatment is higher after CAS than after CEA, which is partly explained by the effect of age, but the postprocedural rate of ipsilateral stroke does not differ between both treatments. For patients with asymptomatic ICA stenosis, preferred treatment (carotid revascularisation or best medical treatment) remains unclear.

Prediction of clinical outcome after CAS or CEA could aid physicians to estimate periprocedural and postprocedural risks and to choose the appropriate treatment in individual patients. Our aim was to identify existing prediction models or risk scores for short- or long-term outcome after CAS or CEA in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic ICA stenosis from the literature, and to summarise their most important predictors and predictive performance. We focused on prediction models that included patient characteristics that are known before a procedure is initiated rather than procedural characteristics, because such models may aid in choosing the appropriate treatment (CAS, CEA, or optimal medical treatment alone).

### Age-dependent effects of carotid endarterectomy or stenting on cognitive performance [^116LgTpW]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is currently the accepted standard of treatment for patients with symptomatic and some selected patients with severe asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis. In recent years, however, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has emerged as an alternative endovascular treatment strategy for these disorders. While CAS has the main attractions of avoiding general anesthesia and surgical incisions reducing the incidence of wound problems or cranial nerve palsies, higher embolization rates during CAS compared to surgery have been reported using either transcranial Doppler sonography to monitor embolic events or diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to detect new embolic lesions after the intervention. In good agreement with these findings, several large randomized trials indicate that CAS is associated with a higher incidence of stroke at 30 days compared to CEA. In contrast to the increased embolic complications rates after CAS compared to CEA, evidence is accumulating that both revascularization procedures lead to subtle cognitive impairment of similar magnitude.

In fact, we recently demonstrated that, although there is a higher burden of new ischemic brain lesions as detected with DWI after CAS, CAS was not associated with a greater, persistent cognitive decline compared to CEA. Similar results were obtained in a subgroup study of the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), which prospectively compared the effect of CEA or CAS on cognition in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Similar to our results, new ischemic lesions were found twice as often after CAS than after CEA in that study, but the cognitive changes between CAS and CEA were comparable. Another small study has also corroborated these findings.

On the other hand, it is noteworthy that a measurable cognitive deterioration occurs in approximately 25% of the patients irrespective of the treatment modality. Therefore, it is important to identify risk factors for these neurocognitive changes, all the more considering that many patients and especially those with an asymptomatic carotid stenosis, might only have a borderline indication for a revascularization. Previously, advanced age has been identified as a potential risk factor for neurocognitive decline after CEA, whereas the impact of age on cognition after CAS has not been specifically studied to date. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of age on cognitive performance after either CEA or CAS using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery with parallel test forms and a control group to exclude a learning effect.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^112q3Ans]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis is a cornerstone of stroke prevention and has been the subject of extensive clinical investigation, including multiple controlled randomized trials. The appropriate treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to the community of vascular surgeons. In 2008, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, only one randomized trial, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS), had been published. Since that publication, four major randomized trials comparing CEA and CAS have been published, and the role of medical management has been re-emphasized. The current publication updates and expands the 2008 guidelines with specific emphasis on six areas: imaging in identification and characterization of carotid stenosis, medical therapy (as stand-alone management and also in conjunction with intervention in patients with carotid bifurcation stenosis), risk stratification to select patients for appropriate interventional management (CEA or CAS), technical standards for performing CEA and CAS, the relative roles of CEA and CAS, and management of unusual conditions associated with extracranial carotid pathology. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, as has been done with other Society for Vascular Surgery guideline documents The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. CAS should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons. CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as the first-line therapy.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111zrCZR]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and future research — management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis: The efficacy of best medical management alone compared with carotid revascularization to reduce risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis > 70% should be assessed. The role of carotid revascularization in patients considered high-risk surgical candidates should be defined, and enhanced imaging modalities could provide detailed insights into plaque morphology, stability, and risk of rupture to aid risk stratification and decision-making. Sex-specific studies in women with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis are needed. Early evidence suggests that transcarotid artery revascularization might have a role in patients with ACS, but no RCT data exist comparing its outcomes with either transfemoral carotid stenting or CEA. Ultimately, shared decision-making is paramount in determining the best treatment approach for ACS, and there are no validated tools to precisely determine the optimal frequency of carotid duplex surveillance for patients with more severe stenosis, rapid progression, or high-risk plaque characteristics.

### Timing of carotid intervention [^114asK69]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In most patients the indication for carotid intervention has been based on neurological symptoms in combination with the degree of stenosis in the ipsilateral carotid artery. Recently, the role of timing of revascularization in the prevention of recurrent stroke in symptomatic patients has gained interest. The evidence to underpin early surgery is principally based on a post hoc subgroup analysis performed by the Carotid Endarterectomy Trialists Collaboration (CETC) on pooled data from two RCTs 1. The results of these RCTs were published almost three decades ago, and patient adherence to antiplatelet therapy and statin was low to moderate. The number of patients needed to operate to prevent one ipsilateral stroke in 5 years' time was five for patients randomized within 2 weeks following their last ischaemic event compared with 125 when randomized after more than 12 weeks 1. However, this was not a preplanned analysis and is therefore subject to potential confounding. The 2‐week threshold was selected for methodological convenience rather than having any clinical relevance. Some subgroups, such as men with non‐ocular events, may benefit fully 14 days or more after the initial event, whereas the benefit for subgroups at low risk of recurrent stroke (such as women with ocular symptoms) remains uncertain and is being investigated in ECST‐2 (European Carotid Surgery Trials 2). Nevertheless, based on the CETC analysis, most international guidelines on the treatment of carotid artery disease now recommend that carotid revascularization is undertaken within 14 days of the index event 2.

Unfortunately, there are few data on the outcomes of surgery in patients undergoing early carotid revascularization. Of the 12 RCTs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 that have compared carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with significant carotid stenosis, only five 3, 9, 10, 12, 14 provided information on the time from the index event to revascularization. CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial) 10 reported the shortest median interval; this was still 22 days for CEA and 18 days for CAS. In all except two RCTs, the mean delay from the index event to revascularization was greater than 1 month 9, 12, 14. Even in studies that mostly revascularized sooner after the index event, the mean delay was above the 2‐week threshold 3, 10.

### Rationale and status of randomized controlled clinical trials in carotid artery stenting [^114DQ6Ac]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Efficacy for carotid artery stenting (CAS) has not been confirmed by randomized clinical trial methodology. Although carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is considered the preferred method for carotid revascularization in the management of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic extracranial carotid occlusive disease, comparisons between CAS and CEA are now underway. In North America, the CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stent Trial) protocol is now completing credentialing cases as randomization of cases is initiated. In Europe, the CAVATAS (Carotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Study) and SPACE (Stent Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy) trials are recruiting symptomatic patients for randomization between CEA and CAS. It is anticipated that these trials will publish definitive results within the next 1–3 years and help guide the referral of patients for CAS and CEA in the future.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^115SosfN]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery disease

Approximately 10%–20% of thromboembolic stroke is thought to be from significant extracranial carotid artery disease. Generally, significant stenosis refers to a > 50% stenosis estimated using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method. In clinical trials, patients are often stratified to 50%–69% stenosis and 70%–99% stenosis. Revascularisation is not indicated for a near-occluded or occluded carotid artery. A carotid stenosis is defined as 'symptomatic' if there is ischaemic symptoms within preceding 6 months. Abnormalities on brain imaging studies without symptoms are generally not considered 'symptomatic'.

Early revascularisation is well-established as the standard of care for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (figure 2). Multiple randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have consistently found carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to be superior to medical therapy alone in this population. Clinical features associated with higher benefits from CEA are more severe carotid lesions (70%–99%), male sex, older age (> 75 years) and hemispheric and cortical strokes (as opposed to retinal or lacunar strokes). The benefits of CEA are greatest within 14 days of the ischaemic event and decline as time passes.

Figure 2
Diagnostic algorithm for patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease. *Symptoms of stroke/transient ischaemic attack within 6 months.

The management of asymptomatic carotid disease is more controversial. Early trials found better outcomes with CEA compared with medical therapy for significant carotid disease in asymptomatic patients. However, medical therapy has evolved greatly since the 1990s and early 2000s when there were little statin use, no antithrombotic option other than aspirin and no specific goal for treating blood pressure and diabetes. Lacking newer data, the ESC/ESVS guideline only recommends revascularisation in asymptomatic patients with 60%–99% who have additional risk factors, such as a history of contralateral transient ischaemic attack/stroke, ipsilateral silent infarction or anatomically high-risk findings on imaging (lipid-rich core or intraplaque haemorrhage on MRA, large echolucent and hypoechogenic plaque on ultrasound or rapid stenosis progression) (Figure 3). The ongoing CREST-2 (carotid revascularization for primary prevention of stroke) trial will help determine whether CEA, carotid artery stenting (CAS) or modern medical therapy is the best strategy for patients with asymptomatic significant carotid stenosis.

### Duration of asymptomatic status and outcomes following carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in the carotid revascularization endarterectomy vs stenting trial [^11116cNr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Most carotid revascularization studies define asymptomatic as symptom-free for more than 180 days; however, it is unknown if intervention carries similar risk among those currently asymptomatic but with previous symptoms (PS) vs those who were always asymptomatic (AA).

Methods

We compared the periprocedural and 4-year risks of PS vs AA patients in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST) randomized to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS)/angioplasty. Proportional hazards models adjusting for age, sex, and treatment were used to assess the risk of periprocedural stroke and/or death (S+D; any S+D during periprocedural period), stroke and death at 4 years (any S+D within the periprocedural period and ipsilateral stroke out to 4 years) and the primary end point at 4 years (any stroke, death, and myocardial infarction within the periprocedural period and ipsilateral stroke out to 4 years). Analysis was performed pooling the CEA-treated and CAS-treated patients, and separately for each treatment.

Results

Of 1181 asymptomatic patients randomized in CREST, 1104 (93%) were AA and 77 (7%) were PS. There was no difference in risk when comparing the AA and PS cohorts in the pooled CAS+CEA population for periprocedural S+D (2.0% vs 1.3%), S+D at 4 years (3.6% vs 3.2%), or the primary end point (5.2% vs 5.8%). There were also no differences among those assigned to CEA (periprocedural S+D, 1.5% vs 0%; S+D at 4 years, 2.7% vs 0%; or primary end point, 5.1% vs 2.4%) or CAS (periprocedural S+D, 2.5% vs 2.8%; S+D at 4 years, 4.4% vs 6.9%; or primary end point, 5.3% vs 9.8%) when analyzed separately.

Conclusions

In CREST, only a small minority of asymptomatic patients had previous ipsilateral symptoms. The outcomes of periprocedural S+D, periprocedural S+D, and ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years, and the primary end point did not differ for AA patients compared with PS patients.
