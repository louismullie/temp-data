## Question

What drug to use acutely in Atrial fibrillation with RVR in a hypotensive patient without heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which drug to use acutely for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in a hypotensive patient who does not have heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about hemodynamic stability and whether immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated. Then, I should verify which pharmacologic rate-control agents are safe and effective in hypotension without heart failure. Next, I will compare the relative risks of beta-blockers versus nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in this scenario. After that, I should consider alternatives like digoxin or amiodarone if first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective. Finally, I will outline dosing, monitoring, and when to escalate to cardioversion, ensuring I align with contemporary guidelines and safety data [^114aa20a] [^6fc410d1].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: hypotension in AF with RVR is a red flag that pushes me to consider immediate synchronized cardioversion if the instability is attributable to the arrhythmia, especially with ongoing ischemia, shock, or organ hypoperfusion, so I should not jump straight to drugs before I exclude the need for electricity [^6fc410d1] [^78614778] [^9bd193a0].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic options in hypotension without heart failure: guidelines prioritize beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for acute rate control in hemodynamically stable AF with RVR, but both classes can lower blood pressure, so in hypotension I need to choose the agent with the least negative inotropic and vasodilatory impact and use cautious dosing with close monitoring [^114aa20a] [^789212a8].

> I will now examine beta-blockers: metoprolol 2.5–5 mg IV every 5–15 minutes up to three doses is standard, with esmolol as an alternative given its ultra-short half-life and titratability; importantly, beta-blockers reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand but can worsen hypotension in decompensated states, so in a patient without heart failure who is hypotensive, I should give small, incremental doses with frequent vitals and be prepared to stop if blood pressure drops further [^789212a8] [^8a526f40] [^7bbb8068].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about calcium channel blockers: diltiazem and verapamil are effective for rate control but are more likely to cause hypotension due to vasodilation and negative inotropy; in a patient who is already hypotensive, even a standard diltiazem bolus can precipitate further pressure drops, so if I use them at all, it should be at reduced dose with extreme caution and readiness to treat hypotension, and some clinicians avoid them entirely in this setting [^789212a8] [^f7911132] [^3b43df01].

> Let me consider alternatives if beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated: digoxin 0.25 mg IV with repeat dosing to a total of 1.5 mg over 24 hours is a reasonable option because it slows AV nodal conduction without vasodilation or negative inotropy, though onset is slow and it is better as adjunctive therapy rather than sole acute control; amiodarone 300 mg IV over 1 hour can be considered in critically ill patients or when other agents fail, but I need to remember the risk of pharmacologic conversion and thromboembolism if AF duration is unclear or prolonged [^bb53d2e0] [^a5ea5582] [^d171daab].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought diltiazem might be acceptable at a lower dose in hypotension, but I should double-check the hemodynamic data: studies show diltiazem is associated with more hypotension than metoprolol in some contexts, and even low-dose strategies do not eliminate risk, so in a patient with baseline hypotension and no heart failure, beta-blockers remain the safer first-line pharmacologic choice with careful titration and monitoring [^3178884d] [^3b43df01] [^05adf3f6].

> Next, I should review dosing and monitoring: start with metoprolol 2.5–5 mg IV over 2 minutes, reassess blood pressure and heart rate every 5–15 minutes, and repeat up to three doses if blood pressure remains adequate; if the heart rate is controlled but hypotension worsens, I should pause further beta-blocker dosing and consider fluids or vasopressors as indicated, and if the patient becomes unstable, I should escalate to immediate synchronized cardioversion rather than persisting with drugs [^789212a8] [^78614778].

> I need to ensure I address anticoagulation and thromboembolic risk if cardioversion becomes necessary: if AF duration is more than 48 hours or unknown, I should follow anticoagulation protocols before cardioversion, but in unstable patients, cardioversion should not be delayed for anticoagulation when instability is driven by the arrhythmia, with post-cardioversion anticoagulation managed afterward [^6fc410d1] [^9bd193a0].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is: in a hypotensive patient with AF with RVR and no heart failure, prioritize immediate synchronized cardioversion if the patient is unstable; if the patient is hypotensive but stable enough for a cautious pharmacologic trial, use metoprolol 2.5–5 mg IV with careful titration and close monitoring, avoid diltiazem or verapamil if possible due to hypotension risk, and consider digoxin or amiodarone only if beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, with a low threshold to proceed to cardioversion if deterioration occurs [^6fc410d1] [^114aa20a] [^789212a8] [^bb53d2e0].

---

In hypotensive atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and no heart failure, **immediate synchronized cardioversion is first-line** if the patient is unstable or if hypotension is severe or symptomatic [^6fc410d1] [^78614778]. If the patient is stable enough for pharmacologic therapy, **use cautious IV metoprolol or esmolol** for rate control, as these are preferred over diltiazem or verapamil in hypotension because they are less likely to worsen blood pressure [^notfound]. Avoid nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) due to their negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects, which can exacerbate hypotension [^f7911132]. If beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, consider IV amiodarone or digoxin as alternatives, recognizing their slower onset and potential risks [^d171daab] [^bb53d2e0]. Monitor closely for hemodynamic deterioration and be ready to escalate to cardioversion if instability develops [^6fc410d1].

---

## Indications for immediate cardioversion

Immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated when **hypotension is severe, symptomatic, or accompanied by ongoing ischemia, shock, or organ hypoperfusion** [^6fc410d1] [^78614778]. It is the fastest and most effective way to restore perfusion and should not be delayed for pharmacologic rate control in unstable patients [^9bd193a0].

---

## Pharmacologic rate control options

If the patient is hypotensive but stable enough for pharmacologic therapy, **choose agents with minimal negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects**:

| **Medication** | **Dose and administration** | **Considerations in hypotension** |
|-|-|-|
| Metoprolol | 2.5–5 mg IV every 5–15 min, up to 3 doses | Preferred beta-blocker; less hypotension than CCBs; monitor closely |
| Esmolol | 500 mcg/kg IV bolus over 1 min, then 50–300 mcg/kg/min infusion | Ultra-short acting; titratable; stop if hypotension worsens |
| Amiodarone | 300 mg IV over 1 h, then 10–50 mg/h infusion | Alternative when beta-blockers contraindicated; slower onset; monitor for hypotension |
| Digoxin | 0.25 mg IV, repeat every 6 h to max 1.5 mg in 24 h | Slow onset; use if beta-blockers contraindicated; monitor for toxicity |

---

## Medications to avoid

Avoid **nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil)** in hypotensive patients without heart failure because their negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects can worsen hypotension [^f7911132] [^789212a8]. Also avoid **beta-blockers in decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock**, which is not the case here but remains a general precaution [^789212a8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting beta-blockers

Beta-blockers are **effective for acute rate control** in AF with RVR and are less likely than CCBs to cause hypotension in this setting [^3178884d]. Observational data suggest metoprolol achieves rate control with fewer adverse events than diltiazem, including less hypotension, though both are generally safe when used carefully [^3178884d].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- Continuous cardiac and blood pressure monitoring during and after drug administration.
- Be prepared to escalate to synchronized cardioversion if hypotension worsens or the patient becomes unstable [^6fc410d1].
- Assess for contraindications to beta-blockers (e.g. severe bradycardia, reactive airway disease) before use [^7bbb8068].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Immediate synchronized cardioversion if unstable or if hypotension is severe or symptomatic [^6fc410d1] [^78614778].
- **If stable for pharmacologic therapy**: Use cautious IV metoprolol or esmolol for rate control [^789212a8].
- **Avoid**: Diltiazem and verapamil due to risk of worsening hypotension [^f7911132].
- **Alternatives**: Consider amiodarone or digoxin if beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective [^d171daab] [^bb53d2e0].
- **Monitor**: Continuous hemodynamic monitoring and readiness to cardiovert if deterioration occurs [^6fc410d1].

---

In hypotensive AF with RVR and no heart failure, **prioritize cardioversion if unstable**; if stable, use cautious IV beta-blockade (metoprolol or esmolol) and avoid CCBs, with amiodarone or digoxin as second-line options.

### Management of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review [^c8be0fa6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological management options for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (AFRVR) in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the acute care setting.

Methods

This study was a systematic review of observational studies or randomized clinical trials (RCT) of adult patients with AFRVR and concomitant ADHF in the emergency department (ED), intensive care unit, or step-down unit. The primary effectiveness outcome was successful rate or rhythm control. Safety outcomes were adverse events, such as symptomatic hypotension and venous thromboembolism.

Results

A total of 6577 unique articles were identified. Five studies met inclusion criteria: one RCT in the inpatient setting and four retrospective studies, two in the ED and the other three in the inpatient setting. In the RCT of diltiazem versus placebo, 22 patients (100%) in the treatment group had a therapeutic response compared to 0/15 (0%) in the placebo group, with no significant safety differences between the two groups. For three of the observational studies, data were limited. One observation study showed no difference between metoprolol and diltiazem for successful rate control, but worsening heart failure symptoms occurred more frequently in those receiving diltiazem compared to metoprolol (19 patients [33%] vs. 10 patients [15%], p = 0.019). A single study included electrical cardioversion (one patient exposed with failure to convert to sinus rhythm) as nonpharmacological management. The overall risk of bias for included studies ranged from serious to critical. Missing data and heterogeneity of definitions for effectiveness and safety outcomes precluded the combination of results for quantitative meta-analysis.

Conclusions

High-level evidence to inform clinical decision making regarding effective and safe management of AFRVR in patients with ADHF in the acute care setting is lacking.

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^ec29167e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.

### Emergency medicine updates: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^8a305e2a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. When AF occurs in the context of a rapid ventricular rate/response (RVR), this can lead to complications, including hypoperfusion and cardiac ischemia. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this dysrhythmia.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning AF with RVR for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Differentiating primary and secondary AF with RVR and evaluating hemodynamic stability are vital components of ED assessment and management. Troponin can assist in determining the risk of adverse outcomes, but universal troponin testing is not required in patients at low risk of acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease - especially patients with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal AF that are similar to their prior events. Emergent cardioversion is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Rate or rhythm control should be pursued in hemodynamically stable patients. Elective cardioversion is a safe option for select patients and may reduce AF symptoms and risk of AF recurrence. Rate control using beta blockers or calcium channel blockers should be pursued in those with AF with RVR who do not undergo cardioversion. Anticoagulation is an important component of management, and several tools (e.g. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) are available to assist with this decision. Direct oral anticoagulants are the first-line medication class for anticoagulation. Disposition can be challenging, and several risk assessment tools (e.g. RED-AF, AFFORD, and the AFTER (complex, modified, and pragmatic) scores) are available to assist with disposition decisions.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning AF with RVR can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Direct-current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter — recommendations: When a rapid ventricular response does not respond promptly to pharmacological measures in AF with ongoing myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or HF, immediate R-wave synchronized direct-current cardioversion is recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended for AF with preexcitation when very rapid tachycardia or hemodynamic instability occurs (Level of Evidence: B). Cardioversion is recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability when AF symptoms are unacceptable, and in case of early relapse after cardioversion, repeated direct-current attempts may be made following administration of antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). As Class IIa, direct-current cardioversion can be useful to restore sinus rhythm as part of a long-term management strategy in AF (Level of Evidence: B), and patient preference is a reasonable consideration for infrequently repeated cardioversions in symptomatic or recurrent AF (Level of Evidence: C). As Class III, frequent repetition of direct-current cardioversion is not recommended when periods of sinus rhythm are relatively short after multiple procedures despite prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Level of Evidence: C), and electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in patients with digitalis toxicity or hypokalemia (Level of Evidence: C).

Atrial fibrillation/flutter cardioversion — indications and anticoagulation: Unstable patients or those with ongoing cardiac ischemia caused or exacerbated by atrial fibrillation/flutter require prompt cardioversion. Clinicians should consider whether the arrhythmia is causative or secondary to rapid ventricular response to guide initial pharmacologic stabilization; the hemodynamic benefits of successful cardioversion have been documented and risk of hypotension and hypoperfusion with negative inotropes has been demonstrated even in normotensive patients. Depending on the clinical scenario, patients cardioverted from atrial fibrillation/flutter of greater than 48 hours' duration are candidates for anticoagulation, and hemodynamically unstable patients and those with ongoing cardiac ischemia are likely to benefit from immediate restoration of sinus rhythm and avoidance of hypotension caused by pharmacological therapies.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — pharmacological rate control (Class I): Measurement of the heart rate at rest and control of the rate with pharmacological agents are recommended for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^c940f894]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart rate control for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department (ED) is often achieved utilizing intravenous (IV) non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) or beta blockers (BB). For patients with concomitant heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the American Heart Association and other clinical groups note that CCB should be avoided due to their potential negative inotropic effects. However, minimal evidence exists to guide this current recommendation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of adverse effects in the HFrEF patient population whose AF with RVR was treated with IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED.

Methods

This single center, retrospective review included patients ≥ 18 years old with HFrEF who presented in AF with RVR and received IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was adverse effects of therapy defined as: 1) hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg requiring fluid bolus or vasopressors) or bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min) within 60 min of medication administration 2) worsening heart failure symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirements within four hours or inotropic support within 48 h. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of rate control failure, patient disposition, ED length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, with 57 receiving diltiazem and 68 receiving metoprolol. Overall adverse effects for diltiazem and metoprolol were similar (32% vs. 21%, P = 0.217). However, there was a significantly higher incidence of worsening heart failure symptoms within the diltiazem group (33% vs 15%, P = 0.019). Rate control failure at 60 min did not differ significantly between diltiazem and metoprolol (51% vs 62%, P = 0.277).

Conclusions

In HFrEF patients with AF, there was no difference in total adverse events in patients treated with IV diltiazem compared to metoprolol. However, the diltiazem group had a higher incidence of worsening CHF symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirement within four hours or initiation of inotropic support within 48 h.

Intravenous magnesium and rate-control agents — evidence in AF with rapid ventricular response: A meta-analysis including '6 RCTs (n = 745 patients)' reported intravenous magnesium superior for rate control '(63% versus 40%; OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.80–3.45])' and modestly effective for rhythm conversion '(21% versus 14%; OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.08–2.84])' versus standard methods, with subgroup results favoring a lower dose '(≤ 5 g) (24% versus 13%; OR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.22–3.61])' over a higher dose '(> 5 g) (16% versus 13%; OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.65–2.32])' for rhythm control compared with placebo. In critically ill patients, a retrospective series 'of 38 patients' found intravenous amiodarone decreased heart rate without BP decrease versus intravenous diltiazem and digoxin, and a study of '60 critically ill patients' randomized to diltiazem 'a 25-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/h for 24 hours', amiodarone 'a 300-mg bolus', or amiodarone 'a 300-mg bolus followed by 45 mg/h for 24 hours' showed a ' > 30% rate reduction within 4 hours' was not different, with diltiazem achieving better 24-hour rate control but more hypotension requiring discontinuation. In HFrEF populations, retrospective analyses associated diltiazem with increased acute kidney injury within 48 hours when 'LVEF ≤ 50%' compared with normal EF '(10% versus 3.6%; P = 0.002)' and with a higher incidence of worsening HF symptoms '(33% versus 15%; P = 0.019)', while 'Neither analysis noted an increase in the in-hospital mortality rate, need for a higher level of care, or hypotension'.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation — basis for cardioversion indicates that cardioversion may be performed electively to restore sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF, may be immediate when the arrhythmia is the main factor responsible for acute heart failure, hypotension, or worsening angina in coronary artery disease, and carries a risk of thromboembolism unless anticoagulation prophylaxis is initiated before the procedure, with risk greatest when the arrhythmia has been present for longer than 48 h.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Acute pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) — agent-specific notes: Intravenous esmolol may have modest efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset AF, but this has not been established by comparison with placebo; it is not useful in patients with persistent AF, a response may be expected within 1 h after initiation of intravenous infusion, and hypotension and bronchospasm are major adverse effects. Verapamil and diltiazem have not been found effective for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF but act rapidly to control the rate of ventricular response; negative inotropic effects might result in hypotension and caution should be used in patients with heart failure (HF). Digitalis glycosides are generally not more effective than placebo for conversion of recent-onset AF to sinus rhythm, may prolong episodes of paroxysmal AF, and manifestations of digitalis toxicity are dose related. Disopyramide has not been tested adequately for conversion of AF but may be effective when administered intravenously; adverse effects include drying of mucous membranes, constipation, urinary retention, and depression of left ventricular (LV) contractility, making it a relatively unattractive option. Sotalol has no proved efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF when given either orally or intravenously, but it does control the heart rate; in patients who tolerate AF relatively well, a wait-and-see approach using oral sotalol is an appropriate option, and side effects consist mainly of QT prolongation associated with torsades de pointes.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^f64ecc55]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

### Acute rate control with metoprolol versus diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^049bcfa9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare heart rate control between parenteral metoprolol and diltiazem and identify safety outcomes in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included adult patients with HFrEF who received intravenous (IV) metoprolol or diltiazem for AFib RVR in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was rate control defined as HR < 100 bpm or a HR reduction ≥ 20% within 30 min of first dose administration. The secondary outcomes included rate control within 60 min and 120 min from first dose, need for repeat dosing, and disposition. Safety outcomes included hypotensive and bradycardic events.

Results

Out of 552 patients, 45 patients met the inclusion criteria with 15 in the metoprolol group and 30 in the diltiazem group. Using bootstrapping method, patients treated with metoprolol were equally able to reach the primary outcome as those treated with diltiazem (BCa 95% CI: 0.14, 4.31). Hypotensive and bradycardia events remained zero in both groups.

Conclusion

Our study provides further evidence that short term use of diltiazem is likely as safe and effective as metoprolol in the acute management of HFrEF patients with AFib RVR and provides support for the use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in this patient population.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — randomized trials of acute rate control report the following quantitative results: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL, seventeen of the 23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. In another randomized clinical trial of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control, at 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%), and the percentage who achieved rate control was higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). In a randomized, parallel, open-label study of esmolol versus verapamil in acute AF or AFL, fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted, with mild hypotension observed in both treatment groups.

Atrial fibrillation and flutter with rapid ventricular response — medical therapies include the following recommendations: Intravenous (IV) administration of a β-adrenergic blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist is recommended to slow the ventricular rate in the acute setting in adult patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response without preexcitation (COR 1, LOE B-NR). IV amiodarone can be useful for rate control in critically ill adult patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response without preexcitation (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). In adult patients with preexcitation atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, digoxin, nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, β-adrenergic blockers, and IV amiodarone should not be administered (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD). Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and IV β-adrenergic blockers should not be used in adult patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and decompensated heart failure because these may lead to further hemodynamic compromise (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-EO).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — mechanisms, efficacy, and practical considerations for rate control: The main determinants of ventricular rate during AF are the intrinsic conduction characteristics and refractoriness of the AV node and autonomic tone, and drugs that prolong the AV nodal refractory period are generally effective. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions designed to achieve rate control in AF has been about 80% in clinical trials. There is no evidence that pharmacological rate control has any adverse influence on LV function, but bradycardia and heart block may occur, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF, especially the elderly. When rapid control is required or oral administration is not feasible, medication may be administered intravenously; otherwise, in hemodynamically stable patients with a rapid ventricular response, negative chronotropic medication may be administered orally. Combinations may be necessary to achieve rate control in both acute and chronic situations, some patients may require permanent pacing for symptomatic bradycardia, and nonpharmacological therapy should be considered when pharmacological measures fail.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — supportive management of postoperative AF (POAF) after noncardiac surgery notes that postoperative pain, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, fluid shifts, and sepsis can contribute to new-onset POAF and a rapid ventricular response, and aggressive management of these triggers is essential. Hemodynamically stable patients with POAF may require specific therapy to achieve an optimal heart rate (< 110 bpm). Medications that block atrioventricular nodal conduction, such as beta blockers or CCBs, can be used for ventricular rate control, and digoxin can be considered as an adjunct or if other agents are contraindicated. Among patients with AF refractory to rate control with atrioventricular nodal blockers, rhythm control with synchronized electrical direct current cardioversion or pharmacological cardioversion with antiarrhythmic drugs can be considered. Exclusion of left atrial appendage thrombus before implementing rhythm control may be indicated in patients with a prolonged duration (> 48 hours) of AF or in patients at high risk for thromboembolism. Synchronized direct current cardioversion is recommended for hemodynamically unstable AF with a rapid ventricular response associated with hypotension.

Atrial fibrillation — quinidine for cardioversion: quinidine is used less frequently than other pharmacological agents, due to the perception that it is less efficacious and has more frequent side effects, although direct comparative studies are lacking. Quinidine is usually administered after digoxin or verapamil has been given to control the ventricular response rate. Potential adverse effects include QT-interval prolongation that may precede torsades de pointes, nausea, diarrhea, fever, hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. During the initiation of quinidine therapy, hypotension and acceleration of the ventricular response to AF may occur on a vagolytic basis. A clinical response may be expected 2 to 6 h after administration.

Atrial fibrillation with heart failure — rate control pharmacotherapy: In RATE-AF, 160 patients (≥ 60 years) with persistent AF and HF (81% with LVEF ≥ 50%) were randomized to digoxin or bisoprolol; there was no significant difference in the primary QOL endpoint at 6 months, secondary outcomes (including natriuretic peptides) were lower with digoxin, resting heart rate did not differ at 12 months, and adverse effects were less common with digoxin. Post hoc analyses in HF on chronic digoxin associated serum digoxin levels ≥ 1 ng/mL with increased mortality and hospitalization, whereas levels < 0.8 ng/mL were associated with the lowest mortality rate. In DAAF, among 239 patients (12% with HF), intravenous digoxin significantly decreased heart rate at 2 hours versus placebo. In critically ill patients, a randomized trial of 60 patients (13 with HF) showed significant rate control with both intravenous diltiazem and amiodarone, with a higher frequency of hypotension requiring discontinuation with diltiazem; a retrospective intensive care unit series of 38 patients (9 with HF) found intravenous amiodarone lowered ventricular rate without BP decrease compared with intravenous diltiazem and digoxin. The text cautions that intravenous beta blockers may cause hypotension in hemodynamic instability, that intravenous amiodarone can also be associated with hypotension (especially with bolus), and that the possibility of conversion to sinus rhythm and thromboembolism should factor into risk–benefit decisions when choosing intravenous amiodarone for rate control.

### Low-dose diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^05adf3f6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Diltiazem is one of the most commonly used medications to control the rapid ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF). The recommended starting dose is an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg over 2 minutes. To avoid hypotension, we have empirically used a lower dose of diltiazem. We compared the efficacy and safety of different doses of diltiazem in rapid AF.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was undertaken in patients who presented to the emergency department with rapid AF. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to diltiazem dosage: low dose (≤ 0.2 mg/kg), standard dose (> 0.2 and ≤ 0.3 mg/kg), and high dose (> 0.3 mg/kg). We compared the rates of therapeutic response (adequate rate control) and complications (such as hypotension). Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of diltiazem dose on the occurrence of complications.

Results

A total of 180 patients were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in the rates of therapeutic response for the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups (70.5%, 77.1%, and 77.8%; P = 0.605). The rates of hypotension in the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups were 18%, 34.9%, and 41.7%, respectively. After adjusting confounding variables, the rate of hypotension was significantly lower in the low-dose group in comparison with the standard-dose group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.94).

Conclusions

Low-dose diltiazem might be as effective as the standard dose in controlling rapid AF and reduce the risk of hypotension.

Atrial fibrillation — short-term and long-term treatment goals: For patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial therapy may be anticoagulation and rate control, while the long-term goal is to restore sinus rhythm. When cardioversion is contemplated and the duration of AF is unknown or exceeds 48 h, patients who do not require long-term anticoagulation may benefit from short-term anticoagulation. Early cardioversion may be necessary if AF causes hypotension or worsening HF, making the establishment of sinus rhythm a combined short- and long-term therapeutic goal. In contrast, amelioration of symptoms by rate control in older patients may steer the clinician away from attempts to restore sinus rhythm. In some circumstances, when the initiating pathophysiology of AF is reversible, as for instance in the setting of thyrotoxicosis or after cardiac surgery, no long-term therapy may be necessary.

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia — clinical considerations for acute management note that electrical cardioversion is always indicated for hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, and monomorphic VT is usually related to a structural abnormality such as MI scarring but is mechanistically heterogeneous; some "idiopathic" VTs respond well and terminate with intravenous verapamil or adenosine, and if these unique VT entities cannot be recognized with confidence, it is prudent to assume that one is dealing with VT related to structural heart disease. Timely termination is usually desirable even if VT is well tolerated, this can be achieved with cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, or pacing techniques, and DC cardioversion even at early stage or as a "first line" is reasonable; caution needs to be exercised if the patient also has concurrent AF (e.g., double tachycardia), and if such is the case, the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation need to be followed when feasible. Initial treatment often includes the administration of intravenous antiarrhythmic medication, with advantages including the lack of necessity for anesthesia and ready availability and disadvantages including delay in termination, failure to terminate in some patients, and adverse effects including hypotension and proarrhythmia; only intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, and amiodarone are widely available and intravenous ajmaline is used frequently in some European countries. Intravenous amiodarone loading has proved useful in unstable and recurrent VT and it is also reasonable in patients in whom oral amiodarone is required after the intravenous phase; although intravenous amiodarone has an early effect on AV nodal conduction, the effects on myocardial conduction and refractoriness are gradual in onset and maximum effect may not be seen for weeks or months, so intravenous amiodarone is not ideal for early conversion of stable monomorphic VT, whereas intravenous procainamide is more appropriate when early slowing of the VT rate and termination of monomorphic VT are desired; close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular status is recommended in the presence of congestive HF or severe LV dysfunction as intravenous procainamide can cause transient hypotension, and lidocaine is effective when VT is thought to be related to myocardial ischemia.

### Comparison of sustained rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: metoprolol vs. diltiazem [^f97d3bb0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare sustained rate control with intravenous (IV) diltiazem vs. IV metoprolol in acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective chart review at a large, academic medical center identified patients with AF with RVR diagnosis who received IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was sustained rate control defined as heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute without need for rescue IV medication for 3 h following initial rate control attainment. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control, HR at initial control and 3 h, time to oral dose, admission rates, and safety outcomes.

Results

Between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018, 51 patients met inclusion criteria (diltiazem n = 32, metoprolol n = 19). No difference in sustained rate control was found (diltiazem 87.5% vs. metoprolol 78.9%, p = 0.45). Time to rate control was significantly shorter with diltiazem compared to metoprolol (15 min vs. 30 min, respectively, p = 0.04). Neither hypotension nor bradycardia were significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Choice of rate control agent for acute management of AF with RVR did not significantly influence sustained rate control success. Safety outcomes did not differ between treatment groups.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part II. prevention of thromboembolic complications [^49bc8c75]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians should be familiar with the acute management of atrial fibrillation and the initiation of chronic therapy for this common arrhythmia. Initial management should include hemodynamic stabilization, rate control, restoration of sinus rhythm, and initiation of antithrombotic therapy. Part II of this two-part article focuses on the prevention of thromboembolic complications using anticoagulation. Heparin is routinely administered before medical or electrical cardioversion. Warfarin is used in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation who are at higher risk for thromboembolic complications because of advanced age, history of coronary artery disease or stroke, or presence of left-sided heart failure. Aspirin is preferred in patients at low risk for thromboembolic complications and patients with a high risk for falls, a history of noncompliance, active bleeding, or poorly controlled hypertension. The recommendations provided in this article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

### Endocardial transcatheter stimulation of the AV nodal fat pad: stabilization of rapid ventricular rate response during atrial fibrillation in left ventricular failure [^2d03aac0]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent acute studies demonstrated that atrioventricular (AV) node vagal stimulation during atrial fibrillation (AF) decreases the mean ventricular rate, thus improving hemodynamics.

Methods and Results

We report a case of a woman with acute heart failure (HF), chronic AF with untreatable ventricular rapid response, in severe hypotensive state due to a cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent left ventricular (LV) pacemaker implantation and received 50 Hz AV node stimulation, delivered through a posteroseptal atrial lead, thus allowing a 100% pacing. Hemodynamics improvements allowed carvedilol titration; the rate was below 85 bpm after 4 days, then the atrial lead was removed.

Conclusions

This novel strategy may allow controlling the rapid AV response in patients undergoing pacemaker implantation.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — electrical therapies: In adult patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm (1 C-LD). Urgent direct-current cardioversion of new onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is recommended for adult patients with hemodynamic compromise, ongoing ischemia, or inadequate rate control (1 C-LD). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults using any currently US-approved biphasic wave form defibrillator, an initial energy setting of at least 200 J is reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2a B-R). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults as an initial treatment strategy is uncertain (2b B-R). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial flutter in adults, an initial energy setting of 200 J may be reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2b C-LD). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion as a rescue treatment for shock-refractory atrial fibrillation in adults is uncertain (2b C-LD).

### Evaluation of the blood pressure effects of diltiazem versus metoprolol in the acute treatment of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate [^3b43df01]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the difference in blood pressure effects of diltiazem intravenous push (IVP) and metoprolol IVP in the acute management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AF with RVR).

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study evaluating patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) between January 2012 and September 2018 in AF with RVR and received either diltiazem IVP or metoprolol IVP as the first agent for rate control. The primary objective was the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) within one hour of initial medication administration. Secondary outcomes included repeat doses within one hour, rate control to < 110 beats per minute, and SBP < 90 mmHg or decrease by > 40% within three hours. Subgroup analysis of patients with a baseline SBP < 110 mmHg was conducted.

Results

Of the 160 patients included, 80 received diltiazem and 80 metoprolol. The primary outcome of median change in SBP at one hour was a difference of -9 [-21 to 6] mmHg in the diltiazem group versus a difference of -4 [-18 to 9] mmHg in the metoprolol group (p = 0.102). Subgroup analysis (n = 28) of patients with a baseline SBP < 110 mmHg demonstrated an increase of 7 [-0.25 to 19] mmHg in the diltiazem group versus increase of 7 [0 to 13] in the metoprolol group (p = 0.910).

Conclusion

No significant difference was observed in the blood pressure effects of diltiazem IVP versus metoprolol IVP in the acute management of AF with RVR.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with concomitant heart failure [^2efb3dd0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Atrial fibrillation (Afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is acutely treated with intravenous push (IVP) metoprolol (MET) or diltiazem (DIL). In heart failure (HF) patients, diltiazem is not recommended due to negative inotropic effects. Studies comparing the treatment of atrial fibrillation often exclude HF. Hirschy et al. evaluated HF patients with concomitant Afib with RVR who received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem to determine their effectiveness and safety. They found similar safety and effectiveness outcomes between the two groups.

Methods

This retrospective, IRB-approved study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency center (EC) with Afib with RVR and HF from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2021. Included patients were 18 years of age or older, received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem in the EC, and had a recorded baseline ejection fraction (EF). The primary effectiveness outcome was successful heart rate (HR) control 30 min after treatment with either IVP metoprolol or diltiazem, which was defined as HR < 100 beats per minute (bpm). Secondary effectiveness outcomes included HR control 60 min post-IVP and at EC discharge or transfer and HR reduction > 20% at 30 min after IVP, 60 min after IVP, and at time of discharge or transfer. Other secondary outcomes included the time to adequate HR control, the total dose of IVP metoprolol or diltiazem given, any additional rate-controlling agents given, and crossover between metoprolol and diltiazem. Safety outcomes included bradycardia, hypotension, shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirements, change in EF, acute kidney injury or renal replacement therapy.

Results

Of 2580 evaluated, 193 patients were included (134 DIL vs. 59 MET) with age 73.3 ± 12.2 years, 63% female. The average EF was 48.2 ± 14.2% and 30% of patients had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) while 64% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Effective heart rate control 30 min post-IVP was not different between the two groups (55% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.063). DIL effectively controlled HR quicker than MET (13 [9, 125] DIL vs. 27 [5, 50] MET, min, p = 0.009). DIL resulted in greater HR reductions at 30 min (33.2 ± 25.4 DIL vs. 19.7 ± 19.7 MET, bpm, p < 0.001) and at 60 min (31 ± 23.5 DIL vs. 19.6 ± 19.1 MET, bpm, p = 0.002). DIL also more frequently resulted in a HR reduction of 20% or greater at 30 min (63% DIL vs. 27% MET, p < 0.001), 60 min post-IVP (59% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.019), and at time of patient discharge or transfer from the EC (70% DIL vs. 49% MET, p = 0.005). No differences in safety outcomes were identified.

Conclusion

Acute management of patients with Afib with RVR and HF is challenging. While successful rate control at 30 min was not significantly different between diltiazem and metoprolol, IVP diltiazem reduced HR more quickly and reduced HR by 20% or greater more frequently than IVP metoprolol with no safety outcome differences. Further studies are needed to evaluate diltiazem's safety in patients with Afib and HF.

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^3178884d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^cdb12be9]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

In these 2025 Advanced Life Support Guidelines, the American Heart Association provides comprehensive recommendations for the resuscitation and management of adults experiencing cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies. Based on structured evidence reviews and the latest clinical research, these guidelines offer evidence-based strategies to optimize survival and patient outcomes. The 2025 guidelines provide guidance for the treatment of cardiac arrest, including ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity, as well as peri-arrest conditions such as atrial fibrillation and flutter with rapid ventricular response. Recommendations are made for defibrillation, electrical cardioversion, advanced airway management, drug therapies, and intravenous access. Additionally, guidelines are provided for the use of double sequential defibrillation, head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and point-of-care ultrasound in the advanced life support setting. Termination of resuscitation rules have been refined to guide decision-making based on the emergency medical services professional's scope of practice. Finally, these guidelines also underscore the importance of identifying causative versus secondary arrhythmias to inform the appropriate timing of therapeutic strategies.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^9bd193a0]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

### Calcium chloride before I.V. diltiazem in the management of atrial fibrillation [^1a463d08]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Diltiazem is commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Although it is very effective for rate control, up to an 18% prevalence of reported diltiazem-induced hypotension [defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mm Hg], and a mean of 9.7% hypotension have been reported from several studies totaling over 450 patients. This hypotension may complicate therapy. Our objective was to determine if calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) pre-treatment would blunt a SBP drop after i.v. diltiazem, while allowing diltiazem to maintain its efficacy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. Seventy-eight patients with AFF and a ventricular rate of ≥ 120 beats per minute were enrolled. Half received i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment; the other half received placebo. All patients then received i.v. diltiazem in a standard, weight-based dose. A second dose of CaCl(2) pre-treatment or placebo and diltiazem was given if clinically indicated for additional rate control. Both CaCl(2) and placebo pre-treatment groups had equal lowering of heart rate (p < 0.001). There were no adverse events in the calcium pre-treatment study arm. One patient in the placebo group became paradoxically more tachycardic and apneic after the diltiazem infusion. Although i.v. CaCl(2) seems to be equally safe compared to placebo as a pre-treatment in the management of AFF with RVR, we were unable to find a statistically significant blunting of SBP drop with CaCl(2) i.v. pre-treatment. Until further research determines a benefit exists, we cannot recommend i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment before diltiazem in the treatment of AFF with RVR.

### Verapamil hci [^0c7e3741]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Verapamil is indicated for the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including:

- Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [LGL] syndromes). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted prior to Verapamil administration.

- Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, except when the atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation are associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [LGL] syndromes).

In controlled studies in the U.S., about 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous Verapamil hydrochloride. Uncontrolled studies reported in the world literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. About 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate respond with a decrease in heart rate of at least 20%. Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after Verapamil hydrochloride and may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, since the conversion rate after placebo was similar. The effect of a single injection lasts for 30–60 minutes when conversion to sinus rhythm does not occur.

Because a small fraction (< 1.0%) of patients treated with Verapamil hydrochloride respond with life-threatening adverse responses (rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation with an accessory bypass tract, marked hypotension, or extreme bradycardia/asystole — see Contraindications and Warnings), the initial use of intravenous Verapamil hydrochloride should, if possible, be in a treatment setting with monitoring and resuscitation facilities, including DC-cardioversion capability (see Suggested Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions). As familiarity with the patient's response is gained, an office setting may be acceptable.

Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after intravenous Verapamil.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation [^6fe6de7a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, it remains unclear whether β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred for the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the emergency department between 2015 and 2019 with AF with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and received IV metoprolol or diltiazem. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved rate control (defined as heart rate < 100 beats per minute). Secondary outcomes included time to rate control, percentage of patients requiring additional agents for rate control, and incidence of cardioversion, bradycardia, and hypotension.

Results

A total of 200 patients were included in this study. Rate control was achieved in 35% and 41% of the metoprolol and diltiazem groups, respectively (P = 0.38). Mean time to rate control was not significantly different between the metoprolol and diltiazem groups (35 vs 21 minutes, P = 0.23). One patient developed hypotension, no patient developed bradycardia, and 4 patients required electric cardioversion. No adverse events were observed in patients with ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in the achievement of rate control between IV metoprolol and diltiazem. This is the largest study to date comparing the two classes of agents for acute rate control in AF. No patient-specific factors were identified that would influence the preferential use of one medication over the other.

Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia — definition and at-risk populations are described as follows: The term "hemodynamically unstable" has not been rigidly defined but is widely used, and it connotes a tachycardia associated with hypotension and poor tissue perfusion that is considered to have the imminent potential to lead to cardiac arrest or shock if left untreated. Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia is usually, but not exclusively, observed in patients with poor ventricular function, yet patients with normal ventricular function can have unstable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation if the tachycardia is rapid enough, as in the long QT syndrome and other abnormal repolarization syndromes, and even idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia can cause hypotension because of a vasovagal reaction.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^651f87e6]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

AHA 2025 Adult Advanced Life Support — acute rate control strategy selection in atrial fibrillation/flutter: Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and β-adrenergic blockers are reported as effective for rate control, and systematic reviews show that IV diltiazem improves heart rate control when compared to IV metoprolol. Amiodarone is effective for rate control without preexcitation when there are contraindications to these agents, whereas digoxin is less commonly used in the acute setting because of the slow onset of effect. In an observational study, optimal amiodarone dosing for heart rate control was examined in 80 critically ill patients, most with cardiogenic shock or sepsis. In atrial fibrillation or flutter with concomitant preexcitation after AV nodal blocking agents, cardioversion is recommended as the most appropriate management. Because of negative inotropic effects, nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may further decompensate patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and symptomatic heart failure, though patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may tolerate them better; β-blockers can be safe in cardiomyopathy but harmful in decompensated patients. Limited evidence suggests that intravenous diltiazem may cause increased risk of decompensation compared to intravenous β-adrenergic blockers, and multiple studies have demonstrated β-adrenergic blockers are safe for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular arrhythmias in chronic heart failure — The course of patients with HF is frequently complicated by supraventricular tachyarrhythmias; the most common treatable atrial arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which affects 10% to 30% of patients with chronic HF and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and worse long-term prognosis. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias may exert adverse effects by 4 different mechanisms, including loss of atrial enhancement of ventricular filling with compromised output, rapid heart rate increasing demand and decreasing coronary perfusion, diminished contraction and relaxation with rapid ventricular response, and stasis in fibrillating atria predisposing to emboli. In most patients with an ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, the rapidity of ventricular response is more important than the loss of atrial support, because restoration of sinus rhythm does not result in predictable clinical benefits, and rapid supraventricular arrhythmias may actually cause or exacerbate a cardiomyopathy.

Beta blockers — evidence note states intravenous beta blockade options and perioperative comparison: "Intravenous beta blockade with propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol, or esmolol is effective for control of the rate of ventricular response to AF". These agents "may be particularly useful in states of high adrenergic tone (e.g., postoperative AF)". It also reports that "After noncardiac surgery, intravenous esmolol produced more rapid conversion to sinus rhythm than diltiazem, but rates after 2 and 12 h were similar with both treatments".

Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure (HF) — key guideline recommendations state that in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected, and an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control is recommended; in appropriate patients with AF and HFrEF on guideline-directed medical therapy and with reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation is beneficial to improve symptoms, quality of life (QOL), ventricular function, and cardiovascular outcomes; in symptomatic AF with HFpEF and reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms and QOL; for AF with HF, digoxin is reasonable for rate control, either with other rate-controlling agents or as monotherapy if others are not tolerated; when AF with HF presents with rapid ventricular rates and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control; in AF, HF, HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 50%) with refractory rapid ventricular response and not candidates for or failing rhythm control, atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with biventricular pacing can be useful to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; in AF and HF with implanted biventricular pacing where effective pacing percentage cannot be achieved pharmacologically, AVNA can be beneficial to improve functional class, reduce ICD shock risk, and improve survival; after recovery of LV function from AF‑induced cardiomyopathy, long-term surveillance can be beneficial to detect recurrent AF; for suspected AF‑induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms on pharmacological rate control, a stricter rate-control strategy (target heart rate ≤ 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during moderate exercise) may be reasonable; in AF and HFrEF undergoing AVNA, His bundle or left bundle branch area pacing may be reasonable as an alternative to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; and in AF with known LVEF < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered because of the potential to exacerbate HF.

### Evaluation of diltiazem dosing strategies in the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^1e91b23f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of treatment failure between oral (PO) immediate release (IR) tablet and continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) diltiazem following an initial loading dose in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This single center, retrospective cohort study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 in AF with RVR who received oral or continuous diltiazem after an initial intravenous loading dose. The primary objective of this study is to identify the percentage of patients with treatment failure four hours after initiation of diltiazem IR PO tablet or continuous IV infusion. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay (LOS), ED disposition, and clinically significant hypotension.

Results

Of the 171 patients included, 85 received PO IR diltiazem and 86 received CIVI diltiazem. There was no significant difference in the composite outcome of treatment failure between the PO and CIVI groups (60% vs 59%, p = 0.93). Patients who received PO diltiazem were more frequently discharged from the ED (31.8% vs 4.7%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in hospital LOS (6.6 vs 6.5 days, p = 0.06) or clinically significant hypotension (11.7% vs 8.1% p = 0.428).

Conclusion

Initiating immediate-release oral diltiazem after an initial IV bolus does not result in more treatment failures than initiating a continuous infusion.

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^ae27f400]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

### Analysis of current management of atrial fibrillation in the acute setting: GEFAUR-1 study [^f72cac46]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Limited information relative to the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department (ED) daily practice is available. This study evaluates current management of atrial fibrillation in this setting to identify areas for practice improvement.

Methods

This was a prospective multicenter observational study carried out in 12 EDs. Adults in whom atrial fibrillation was demonstrated in an ECG obtained in the ED were included. Clinical variables and atrial fibrillation management in the ED were prospectively collected by the treating physicians using a standardized questionnaire. Patients with rapid ventricular response (> 100 beats/min) were considered eligible for rate control, and patients with recent-onset episodes (< 48 hours) were eligible for rhythm control.

Results

Of 1,178 patients, 41% presented with a rapid ventricular response and 21% had recent-onset episodes. Rhythm control was attempted in 42% of eligible patients, with antiarrhythmic drugs in 88% of cases (I-C drugs in 44% of patients; amiodarone in 43% of patients). Overall effectiveness of pharmacologic cardioversion was 63% (amiodarone 54.5%, flecainide 93%), whereas electrocardioversion was effective in 87.5% of cases. Rate control was performed in 68.3% of eligible patients (overall effectiveness 47.8%); digoxin was used in 67% of cases (effectiveness 45%). Both strategies were selected in 4.5% of cases, whereas no treatment for atrial fibrillation was performed in 60% of patients.

Conclusion

In our ED population, rate-control effectiveness is poor and rhythm control is not attempted in most recent-onset episodes. Methods to improve rate-control effectiveness, the selection of patients for rhythm control, and the use of electrocardioversion appear warranted.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil HCl) [^937bba46]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Intravenous Verapamil HCI is indicated for the following:

Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [W-P-W] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [L-G-L] syndromes). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted prior to verapamil hydrochloride administration.
Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation except when the atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation are associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [W-P-W] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [L-G-L] syndromes).

In controlled studies in the United States, about 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous verapamil. Uncontrolled studies reported in the world literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. About 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate respond with a decrease in ventricular rate of at least 20%. Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after verapamil and may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, since the conversion rate after placebo was similar. Slowing of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter lasts 30 to 60 minutes after a single injection.

Because a small fraction (< 1%) of patients treated with verapamil respond with life-threatening adverse responses (rapid ventricular rate In atrial flutter/fibrillation and an accessory bypass tract, marked hypotension, or extreme bradycardia/asystole - see Contraindications and Warnings), the initial use of intravenous verapamil should, if possible, be in a treatment setting with monitoring and resuscitation facilities, including DC-cardioversion capability (see Suggested Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions). As familiarity with the patient's response is gained, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after intravenous verapamil.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^c2ce684a]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

Cardiac

Holding

Sinus tachycardia is the norm after IL-2, but this should return to a pre-defined baseline before administering further doses of IL-2. If the heart rate remains above 100–120 beats per minute after correcting hypotension in an afebrile patient, when a dose is due, that dose should be delayed or skipped.

Stopping

Sustained rapid (> 130–140/min) supraventricular tachycardia or rapid atrial fibrillation will require intervention, and stopping of IL-2, at least for the current cycle. If the supraventricular arrhythmia can be converted to NSR quickly or the heart rate and blood pressure managed despite atrial fibrillation, then consideration could be given to resuming IL-2 treatment. Once treated, IL-2 may be administered in a subsequent cycle. Ventricular tachycardia or evidence of ischemic myocardial damage are indications for permanently stopping IL-2 treatment. A diagnosis of myocarditis should prompt discontinuation of that cycle of IL-2, but if LVEF returns to baseline, patients may cautiously proceed with additional cycles of HD IL-2, usually without recurrence of this side effect.

Hypotension

Holding

IL-2 dosing should be delayed until hypotension recovers from the previous dose and the vasopressor level (if applicable) is at a baseline established for dosing. If hypotension requires additional fluid boluses then an assessment of respiratory function will help determine when the next dose can be administered. If high doses of phenylephrine continue to be required, some patients will respond to replacing phenylephrine with norepinephrine at low doses (prefer 2–4 mcg/kg/min but may titrate up to 10 mcg/kg/min for short periods of time). If high-doses of vasopressors are needed, IL-2 should be discontinued.

Stopping

The degree and duration of significant hypotension progresses during the week, and thus may require more fluid or higher doses of vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. When hypotension requires maximum doses of vasopressors or a change to alternate vasopressors, such norepinephrine, IL-2 should be stopped. IL-2 should also be stopped if fluid overload precludes using fluids for maintaining blood pressure, as pulmonary reserve may be compromised.

### DOsing strategy effectiveness of diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^ecefca4b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the dose-dependent comparative safety and effectiveness between weight-based and alternative dosing strategies for diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response who received treatment with intravenous diltiazem. Groups were retrospectively categorized according to the initial dose: low (< 0.1875 mg/kg), weight-based (0.1875 to 0.3125 mg/kg), and high (> 0.3125 mg/kg). The primary outcome was rate control (heart rate < 100 beats/min) within 30 minutes of treatment.

Results

Of 345 records, 252 were included. Because of scarcity (N = 6), outcomes for the high-dose group were not analyzed. By 30 minutes, the weight-based dosing group had more often achieved rate control (weight-based 55%; low 27%; difference 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17% to 40%]). Regression analysis identified the weight-based dosing group (odds ratio 3.63, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.39) and initial heart rate of less than 145 beats/min (odds ratio 2.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.51) as variables associated with the primary outcome. The weight-based dosing group less often required rescue therapy (weight-based 6%; low 17%; difference -12% [95% CI -20% to -4%]) relative to the low-dose group. Mortality was higher in the low-dose group than in the weight-based dosing group (low 7%; weight-based 1%; difference 6% [95% CI 1% to 11%]).

Conclusion

This study shows dose-dependent hemodynamic effects with diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Weight-based diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) was associated with greater rate control with no evidence of increased adverse effects. There was no perceived advantage in using lower, alternative doses.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^d3f0ad66]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmias

There is fairly uniform practice with respect to managing cardiac arrhythmias with serious arrhythmias being uncommon. Sinus tachycardia is to be expected and a new baseline acceptable heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute is generally recorded in the standing orders along with a directive against the use of beta blockers. The rate typically increases after each IL-2 dose, peaks at 2–4 hours and returns to baseline prior to the next dose. It is a compensatory response to hypotension, but is also a consequence of secondary cytokine and stress related epinephrine release and fever. It is important to distinguish the cause in order to avoid unnecessary fluid boluses. The tachycardia seems to become more pronounced and prolonged with an increased number of doses. It usually resolves over time between doses and is back to baseline before the next dose. Some centers extend the time between doses to allow recovery and others hold a dose until the next scheduled administration time.

Isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are not a contraindication to continued IL-2 dosing, but if the frequency increases (above 10/min), or patterns such as quadrigeminy or couplets or greater arise, holding IL-2 doses until recovery may be necessary. Less common cardiac arrhythmias requiring immediate intervention include supraventricular tachycardia with rapid response, atrial fibrillation with rapid response, and ventricular tachycardia. Patients may continue IL-2, if SVT or atrial fibrillation are converted/controlled, sinus rhythm is maintained or heart rate is controlled and there are no signs of cardiac damage. Ventricular tachycardia requires evaluation for cardiac damage and is an absolute contraindication to more IL-2. Rarely, evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis is noted clinically or on an EKG. This may reflect lymphocytic infiltration. If concerns exist regarding myocarditis or ischemia, then cardiac enzymes or troponin should be monitored at least daily and IL-2 discontinued if confirmed.

### Rate control versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: lessons learned from clinical trials of atrial fibrillation [^264febd4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se. Occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The latter will depend on the frequency, duration and symptoms associated with recurrence, and may require a change in the rhythm control therapy, e.g., change the antiarrhythmic drug, or initiate or redo atrial fibrillation ablation. And a rhythm control strategy should include careful attention to and treatment of comorbidities (hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, etc.). If a rate control strategy is chosen, treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always required to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful to obtain satisfactory rate control in combination with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Digoxin may be useful as primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is usually a resting rate less than 110 beats per minute, although resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common, rate control therapy should be a part of the treatment regimen.

### Electrocardiographic findings associated with early clinical deterioration in acute pulmonary embolism [^b507daa3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Key outcome measures

The primary outcome was the incidence of one or more discrete clinical deterioration events that were considered PE‐related complications, including death. Clinical deterioration included any episode that required hospital‐based monitoring or hospital‐based support or intervention. As previously reported, clinical deterioration endpoints included respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, new dysrhythmia, sustained hypotension requiring intravenous volume expansion or adrenergic medication, and escalated PE interventions.

In this prospective study, each site had institutional guidelines on PE management. We defined respiratory failure as respiratory distress associated with emergent or unplanned mechanical ventilation (intubation, non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation, or cricothyrotomy). We defined cardiac arrest as new episodes of unstable cardiac rhythm or absent electrical activity with advanced cardiac life support for asystole, pulseless electrical activity, ventricular fibrillation, or unstable ventricular tachycardia. We defined new dysrhythmia as the onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, atrial flutter, SVT, stable ventricular tachycardia, or bradycardia that was not present at the ED presentation. We defined sustained hypotension as systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg (or > 40 mm Hg decrease from baseline) or shock index greater than 1.0 for > 15 minutes with administration of > 499 mL of intravenous fluids bolus for volume expansion or an infusion of norepinephrine, dopamine, or epinephrine. Escalated PE interventions included reperfusion interventions (systemic or catheter‐directed thrombolysis, mechanical catheter directed aspiration, and surgical thrombectomy) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation interventions. Clinical deterioration episodes were considered as single discrete episodes if separated by 12 hours or more. Individual patients could have more than one episode of clinical deterioration within the 5‐day window. We followed patients via electronic medical record review during the hospital stay and up to 30 days later, as previously published.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^9d2a8d89]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — definition and electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics — is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. On the ECG, AF is characterized by the replacement of consistent P waves by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that vary in amplitude, shape, and timing, associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular response when atrioventricular (AV) conduction is intact, and regular cardiac cycles (R-R intervals) are possible in the presence of AV block or ventricular or AV junctional tachycardia. The ventricular response to AF depends on electrophysiologically (EP) properties of the AV node and other conducting tissues, the level of vagal and sympathetic tone, the presence or absence of accessory conduction pathways, and the action of drugs, and in patients with implanted pacemakers, diagnosis of AF may require temporary inhibition of the pacemaker to expose atrial fibrillatory activity. A rapid, irregular, sustained, wide-QRS-complex tachycardia strongly suggests AF with conduction over an accessory pathway or AF with underlying bundle-branch block, and extremely rapid rates (over 200 beats per minute) suggest the presence of an accessory pathway or ventricular tachycardia.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) quality measure QM-8 — inappropriate prescription of nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist prior to discharge — defines the measure as the percentage of patients, age ≥ 18 y, with reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40) and a diagnosis of AF who were inappropriately prescribed a nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist prior to discharge; the numerator is patients with a diagnosis of AF and reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40) who were prescribed a nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist prior to discharge, and the denominator is all patients with AF and reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40), with denominator exclusions of patients age < 18 y; the rationale notes that beta blockers are the most common agents used for rate control, followed by nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone, and advises that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and decompensated heart failure (HF) because of negative inotropic effects but may be used in HF with preserved left ventricular systolic function, and also that these agents should not be used in patients with pre-excitation and AF because they may accelerate ventricular rate to precipitate hypotension or ventricular fibrillation; the clinical recommendation states that nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists should not be used in patients with decompensated HF as these may lead to further hemodynamic compromise (Class III, Level of Evidence: C).

### Dysrhythmias and heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction: an emergency medicine review [^1d85740f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may suffer several complications after the acute event, including dysrhythmias and heart failure (HF). These complications place patients at risk for morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates literature and guideline recommendations relevant to the acute emergency department (ED) management of AMI complicated by dysrhythmia or HF, with a focus on evidence-based considerations for ED interventions.

Discussion

Limited evidence exists for ED management of dysrhythmias in AMI due to relatively low prevalence and frequent exclusion of patients with active cardiac ischemia from clinical studies. Management decisions for bradycardia in the setting of AMI are determined by location of infarction, timing of the dysrhythmia, rhythm assessment, and hemodynamic status of the patient. Atrial fibrillation is common in the setting of AMI, and caution is warranted in acute rate control for rapid ventricular rate given the possibility of compensation for decreased ventricular function. Regular wide complex tachycardia in the setting of AMI should be managed as ventricular tachycardia with electrocardioversion in the majority of cases. Management directed towards HF from left ventricular dysfunction in AMI consists of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, nitroglycerin therapy, and early cardiac catheterization. Norepinephrine is the first line vasopressor for patients with cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion on clinical examination. Early involvement of a multi-disciplinary team is recommended when caring for patients in cardiogenic shock.

Conclusions

This review discusses considerations of ED management of dysrhythmias and HF associated with AMI.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^f7911132]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. (5.2)
Second-or third-degree AV block. (5.3)
Heart failure. (5.4)
Hypotension. (5.5)

5.1 Tachycardia and Hypotension in patients with AF/AFL and accessory bypass tract

Diltiazem may cause ventricular fibrillation if given to patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome. Distinguish atrial fibrillation with aberrancy (bundle branch block) from pre-excited atrial fibrillation prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Hemodynamic Deterioration in Patients with Wide Complex Tachycardia

Diltiazem may cause hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. Distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 AV Block

Diltiazem prolongs AV nodal conduction and refractoriness that may cause second- or third-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Concomitant use of diltiazem with agents known to affect cardiac conduction may result in additive effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If high-degree AV block occurs in sinus rhythm, discontinue diltiazem and institute appropriate supportive measures [see Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Heart Failure

Diltiazem is a negative inotrope and can cause decreased systolic function and heart failure. Do not initiate in patients with acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock. If heart failure develops during diltiazem treatment, discontinue treatment and treat heart failure appropriately.

5.5 Hypotension

Diltiazem can cause symptomatic hypotension. Patients with low blood pressure at baseline and those on concomitant medications that decrease blood pressure, intravascular volume, or myocardial contractility are at increased risk for hypotension.

Atrial flutter — acute treatment (Figure 18) follows a hemodynamic stability algorithm. In hemodynamically stable patients, rhythm control includes "Synchronized cardioversion, oral dofetilide, IV ibutilide, and/or rapid atrial pacing† (Class I)" and rate control includes "IV beta blockers, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (Class I)", with "IV amiodarone (Class IIa)" as an additional option. If not hemodynamically stable, rhythm control specifies "Synchronized cardioversion (Class I)", whereas rate control lists "IV amiodarone (Class IIb)". "Anticoagulation as per guideline is mandatory", and "For rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, synchronized cardioversion or rapid atrial pacing is not appropriate".

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with HF (atrioventricular nodal ablation and pacing), ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing atrioventricular nodal ablation and biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QoL, and ejection fraction in patients with AF, HFrEF (LVEF < 50%), and refractory rapid ventricular response ineligible for or if rhythm control has failed.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^d7feb4c2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

Class II

β Blockers are recommended as a first‐line therapy for rate control in AF with COVID‐19 infection. 46 All β blockers may have drug interactions with lopinavir/ritonavir, including PR prolongation, second‐degree heart block, and third‐degree heart block. 24, 47 Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase carvedilol and metoprolol serum concentration through CYP2D6 inhibition, 47 and telemetry should be monitored closely (Figure 1).

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine inhibit CYP2D6 and may increase plasma concentration of metoprolol 48; a similar effect may be observed in carvedilol but has never been studied.

Carvedilol is a nonselective β blocker. Only immediate release is recommended in AF guidelines and only oral form is available, which limits its utility in acute AF with rapid ventricular response. 17, 49 Metoprolol and esmolol are cardioselective β blockers. 50 Metoprolol comes in both intravenous and oral forms, 17 whereas esmolol only has intravenous preparation. Both are effective when administered in AF, with rapid ventricular response. 17 β Blockers should also be avoided in acute decompensated CHF and bronchospasm. 49

Class III

Amiodarone blocks multiple ion channels, including I Na, I Kr, calcium channel, and acetylcholine‐dependent potassium channel, as well as α and β receptors. 38 It prolongs QT but is rarely associated with torsade de pointes (< 0.5%). 51 Amiodarone is the most effective and most common AAD used in AF. 52 It is preferred for AF rate and rhythm control in critically ill COVID‐19 patients with significant CHF or borderline blood pressure. 46 However, information on amiodarone and COVID‐19 pharmacotherapy interactions is limited. Surveillance for liver, lung, and thyroid toxicity is recommended for long‐term amiodarone therapy and for short‐term use if clinically indicated. Long‐ and short‐term presentations of amiodarone toxicity have been reported. 53, 54 Pulmonary toxicity may be a concern for COVID‐19 patients with severe pneumonia who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Amiodarone should be used with extreme caution when coadministered with lopinavir/ritonavir (QT prolongation).

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^69a61efe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

Outpatient "pill-in-the-pocket" efficacy — among 268 patients with minimal heart disease, 58 patients (22%) were excluded because of treatment failure or side effects; using resolution of palpitations within 6 h after drug ingestion as the criterion of efficacy, treatment was successful in 534 episodes (94%) during 15–16 mo follow-up, with conversion occurring over a mean of 2 h; among patients with recurrences, treatment was effective in 84%, adverse effects were reported by 7% of patients, and 5% dropped out; this approach appears feasible and safe for selected patients with atrial fibrillation, but the safety of this approach without previous inpatient evaluation remains uncertain.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrest pharmacology and wide QRS complex tachycardia — High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV, as opposed to a standard dose of 1 mg) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation improved survival to hospital admission but showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival, and the administration of vasopressin is no longer recommended. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital arrest, administration of 2 to 4 g magnesium intravenously did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge, with exceptions such as marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which intravenous magnesium is warranted. Post–myocardial infarction prophylactic antiarrhythmic use found routine lidocaine and procainamide associated with increased mortality and beta blockers associated with a significantly lower mortality rate; a subsequent randomized controlled trial involving 1073 patients showed high-dose amiodarone led to a higher mortality rate, while a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For a stable, wide QRS complex tachycardia, patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise, and administration of a calcium channel blocker such as verapamil to a patient with VT may result in severe hypotension or syncope, with the exception of verapamil-sensitive VT that occurs in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize on initial presentation.

Atrioventricular conduction in atrial fibrillation (AF) with preexcitation syndromes — Conduction over an accessory pathway during AF can cause dangerously rapid ventricular responses and, in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, may degenerate to ventricular fibrillation with risk of death; intravenous digitalis, verapamil, or diltiazem do not block the accessory pathway and may accelerate ventricular rate, and "these agents are contraindicated in this situation", while "caution should be exercised" with beta blockers in AF associated with preexcitation.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^c2ba6e75]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in HFpEF — rate control and anticoagulation are addressed, with beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers often considered as first-line for heart rate control, and aggressive rate control should be avoided. In RATE-AF, at 6 months rate control and quality of life were similar between bisoprolol and digoxin, while several secondary endpoints favored digoxin at 12 months but with higher rates of dizziness, lethargy, and hypotension with beta-blockers. Thus, in specific cases, digoxin may be considered as an add-on strategy if beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are inadequate or contraindicated in individuals with HFpEF. Anticoagulation is recommended based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score to mitigate thromboembolic risk, and given the prevalence of hypertension and older age, anticoagulation should thus be considered in practically all individuals with AF and HFpEF unless contraindicated.

### Impact of an emergency department observation unit management algorithm for atrial fibrillation [^ac157811]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Initially, patients were assessed for stability, which was primarily determined by the discretion of the provider, with instability being suggested by chest pain, ST‐segment changes concerning for ischemia, respiratory distress, hypoxia, or hypotension. Patients deemed unstable were excluded from the treatment algorithm and were instead resuscitated as indicated by the clinical scenario.

After the initial evaluation and assessment of stability, intravenous (IV) diltiazem was recommended as the initial medication for rate control at an initial dose of 0.1 to 0.25 mg/kg or 10 to 20 mg IV over 2 minutes. This dose could be repeated 15 minutes later if the heart rate remained > 110 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure remained adequate. Simultaneously, 30 mg of oral diltiazem was recommended to be administered after the initial bolus was given, which would be scheduled to be given every 6 hours while the patient remained in the ED. If the patient's heart rate continued to be > 110 bpm after 2 doses of intravenous diltiazem and 30 mg of oral diltiazem, providers were instructed to consider initiation of a continuous diltiazem infusion at 5 mg/h titrated to a heart rate of 80 to 110 bpm, increased in increments of 3 to 5 mg/h every 5 minutes, as blood pressure allowed.

### Amiodarone for cardioversion on recent-onset atrial fibrillation… [^839dc39f]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Recent-onset atrial fibrillation, defined as an onset within one week, is a major issue in clinical practice, and recent advances have shown that cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm provides better patient outcomes. Cardio-version can be attempted with electric and pharmacologic methods. Immediate electric cardioversion is indicated in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response who have evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or heart failure that does not respond to pharmacologic interventions. In all other cases, pharmacologic cardioversion can be attempted. Medications available for cardioversion include the class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs. Class Ic medications such as propafenone and flecainide have been shown to be effective therapeutic options. Amiodarone, a class III agent, also has been shown to be effective in treating this cardiac disease; however, it is not approved by the U. S.

Food and Drug Administration for treating this arrhythmia. To evaluate amiodarone, Chevalier and colleagues compared the safety and efficacy of this medication in the treatment of recent-onset atrial fibrillation. The main outcome measure was rate of cardioversion within 24 hours. Other data collected included rates of cardioversion at one to two, three to five, and six to eight hours. Mortality and adverse events also were analyzed. There were six studies that compared amiodarone to placebo, and seven studies compared it to the class Ic antiarrhythmics, for a total of 1, 174 patients. The results showed that there was no difference between amiodarone and placebo with regard to cardioversion rates at one to two hours, but there was a significant improvement in cardioversion rates with amiodarone after six to eight hours.

The authors conclude that amiodarone is as safe and effective as the class Ic antiarrhythmic medications at 24 hours in cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation. It provides an alternative for patients who are not candidates for the more rapid-acting antiarrhythmic medication, such as those with ventricular dysfunction and ischemic heart disease, in whom rapid cardioversion is not required. They also state that these data were based on intravenous amiodarone and further studies need to be done using the oral preparation, to establish the optimal dose, and to determine when to start outpatient treatment.

### Reducing diltiazem-related hypotension in atrial fibrillation: role of pretreatment intravenous calcium [^205109a1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) calcium pretreatment for preventing diltiazem-induced hypotension and assessed its safety in adult patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 217 adults with AF/AFL and a ventricular rate > 120 beats per minute, who were randomized into three groups: those who received an IV NaCl 0.9% placebo pretreatment prior to IV diltiazem (PD; 73 patients) and those who received 90 mg (C90D; 71 patients) and 180 mg (C180D; 73 patients) IV calcium chloride pretreatment before IV diltiazem. We compared participants' systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) at baseline and at 5, 10, and 15 min post-treatment, as well as the incidence of adverse events (e.g., hypotension, urticaria, nausea) among the groups.

Results

The PD and C90D pretreatment groups had significantly lower HR measurements at 10 and 15 min compared to the C180D group. In addition, at 5 min, the mean SBP in the PD group was significantly lower compared to the C90D and C180D groups. At 10 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in the C180D group than in the other groups. Furthermore, at 15 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in both the C90D and C180D groups than in the PD group. There were no significant differences between the calcium pretreatment and placebo groups in terms of the need for additional diltiazem doses or the incidence of adverse events.

Conclusion

IV calcium pretreatment effectively prevents diltiazem-induced hypotension in patients with AF/AFL with RVR without compromising the efficacy of diltiazem in achieving and maintaining ventricular rate control.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^4be47d5b]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Management of patients with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) includes guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF, thromboembolism prophylaxis, and risk factor modification, with cardioversion if indicated via electrical cardioversion (1) or pharmacological cardioversion (2a). For rate control with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, NDCC (Diltiazem, Verapamil) is classified as (3: Harm), while beta blockers (1), digoxin (2a), and IV amiodarone* for acute rate control (2a) are listed; with LVEF > 40%, beta blockers or NDCC (1), digoxin (2a), and IV amiodarone* for acute rate control (2a) are listed. The figure also directs to evaluate if appropriate for rhythm control with catheter ablation.
