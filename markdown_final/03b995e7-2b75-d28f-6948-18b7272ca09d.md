## Question

What cephalosporin should be started for acute appendicitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cephalosporin should be started for acute appendicitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the appendicitis is uncomplicated versus complicated, because that dictates spectrum and duration. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens and the need for anaerobic coverage. Next, I will review guideline-backed cephalosporin options and dosing, including whether to add metronidazole. After that, I should consider special populations like children, older adults, and those with beta-lactam allergy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and confirm duration and monitoring plans, making sure I cite the highest-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: acute appendicitis spans uncomplicated (nonperforated, no abscess) and complicated (perforated, gangrenous, abscess, or generalized peritonitis), and this classification drives both antibiotic choice and duration, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring to that distinction before naming a drug [^70955acc] [^4227afc6].

> I will now examine the microbiology. The predominant organisms are gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae (notably E. coli) and anaerobes such as Bacteroides, with streptococci also common, so empiric therapy should reliably cover these, particularly anaerobes in complicated disease or when perforation is suspected [^4ba4d3b4] [^4227afc6].

> Next, I should review guideline-endorsed cephalosporin regimens. For lower-risk, community-acquired intra-abdominal infection — which includes uncomplicated appendicitis — ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus metronidazole is recommended as first-line empiric therapy, with cefuroxime plus metronidazole as an alternative when local susceptibility and experience support it, and these choices balance efficacy with stewardship by avoiding unnecessary antipseudomonal or anti-enterococcal coverage in low-risk patients [^4227afc6] [^abf3c01e].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric data before extrapolating. In children with uncomplicated appendicitis, ceftriaxone plus metronidazole has been associated with lower surgical site infection rates than cefoxitin monotherapy, supporting the same dual-agent approach in pediatrics when a cephalosporin is chosen, while still aligning with broader guidance to prefer narrower-spectrum combinations when appropriate [^f5df3233] [^4227afc6].

> Let me consider dosing and practicality. Ceftriaxone 1–2 grams IV every 24 hours plus metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours is a commonly used, evidence-informed regimen that simplifies administration and has been employed in contemporary trials and practice, with metronidazole providing essential anaerobic coverage that cephalosporins alone do not reliably achieve [^ef3f1358] [^4227afc6].

> Wait, let me verify the role of cefuroxime monotherapy. Initially, I thought cefuroxime alone might suffice in uncomplicated cases, but that would omit anaerobic coverage, which is not aligned with guideline recommendations for appendicitis even when uncomplicated; I should correct that and emphasize adding metronidazole to cefuroxime if that agent is selected, reserving cefuroxime monotherapy only for prophylaxis contexts, not treatment [^4227afc6] [^abf3c01e].

> I need to ensure I address complicated appendicitis. For perforated or gangrenous disease, the same narrower-spectrum cephalosporin backbone (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus metronidazole remains appropriate in lower-risk patients, whereas higher-risk patients or those with severe sepsis may require broader agents such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem, with duration guided by source control and clinical response rather than fixed long courses [^4227afc6] [^c9b949dd].

> Next, I should review special populations. In children, the same ceftriaxone plus metronidazole regimen is reasonable and supported by comparative data, while in older adults I should maintain a low threshold for broader coverage if frailty, delay in presentation, or systemic instability is present. In beta-lactam allergy, I should avoid cephalosporins and use fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole or moxifloxacin monotherapy per guideline alternatives [^f5df3233] [^d46b4faa].

> I should double-check duration and stewardship. For uncomplicated appendicitis managed nonoperatively, total antibiotic durations of 7–10 days are typical in trials, whereas for complicated appendicitis after adequate source control, contemporary guidance supports short postoperative courses, often 24–48 hours, with the APPIC RCT demonstrating noninferiority of 2 versus 5 days when using cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, reinforcing the principle to treat the shortest effective duration [^d39630e9] [^ef3f1358] [^c9b949dd].

> But wait, what if the patient is heading straight to the operating room? I need to ensure preoperative prophylaxis is not conflated with treatment. Pre-incision single-dose cefazolin or cefuroxime is standard for surgical prophylaxis, whereas the therapeutic regimen I'm recommending applies when treating nonoperatively or when continuing antibiotics postoperatively for complicated disease, so I should not mix these indications [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. For acute uncomplicated appendicitis treated nonoperatively, start ceftriaxone 1–2 grams IV every 24 hours plus metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours, typically for a total of 7–10 days with transition to oral agents when improving. For complicated appendicitis, use the same cephalosporin backbone plus metronidazole and tailor duration to source control and clinical response, generally 24–48 hours postoperatively when source control is adequate, extending only if clinical, laboratory, or imaging evidence suggests ongoing infection [^4227afc6] [^ef3f1358] [^c9b949dd].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and contingencies. Monitor for clinical deterioration within 24–48 hours, reassess pain control, and maintain a low threshold to escalate therapy or pursue surgery if there is no improvement. In children, consider that antibiotic-first management has higher failure rates than surgery, so shared decision-making and close follow-up are essential, and in all patients, avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum agents to mitigate resistance and adverse effects [^ffd32ec3] [^4227afc6].

For acute appendicitis, **ceftriaxone plus metronidazole** is the preferred cephalosporin-based regimen because it provides reliable coverage of gram-negative rods and anaerobes, is supported by contemporary guidelines, and is associated with lower surgical site infection rates than cefoxitin monotherapy [^4227afc6] [^f5df3233]. Cefuroxime plus metronidazole is an **acceptable alternative** when ceftriaxone is unavailable or contraindicated [^4227afc6] [^ef3f1358]. For uncomplicated cases managed nonoperatively, total antibiotic duration is typically 7–10 days, whereas complicated cases generally receive 3–5 days postoperatively once source control is achieved [^d39630e9] [^93e78dd6]. Avoid cephalosporins in patients with a true beta-lactam allergy and use ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole or moxifloxacin monotherapy instead [^d46b4faa].

## Recommended cephalosporin regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended cephalosporin regimen** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated appendicitis (non-perforated) | Ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV every 24 hours + metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours | - Broad-spectrum coverage of gram-negative rods and anaerobes <br/> - Lower SSI than cefoxitin monotherapy [^f5df3233] <br/> - Supported by SIS 2024 guidelines [^4227afc6] |
| Complicated appendicitis (perforated, gangrenous, or abscess) | Ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV every 24 hours + metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours | - Effective against mixed flora including anaerobes <br/> - Supported by SIS 2024 guidelines [^4227afc6] |
| Alternative regimen (if ceftriaxone unavailable or contraindicated) | Cefuroxime 1.5 g IV every 8 hours + metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours | - Acceptable alternative with similar spectrum <br/> - Supported by SIS 2024 guidelines [^4227afc6] [^ef3f1358] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

- **Uncomplicated appendicitis (non-operative management)**: Total antibiotic duration is typically 7–10 days, often transitioning to oral therapy once the patient is clinically stable [^d39630e9].
- **Complicated appendicitis (postoperative management)**: Short-course antibiotics (3–5 days) are recommended once adequate source control is achieved, with no demonstrated benefit from prolonged therapy [^93e78dd6] [^c9b949dd].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting cephalosporin use

- **Ceftriaxone plus metronidazole**: Associated with significantly lower surgical site infection rates compared to cefoxitin monotherapy in pediatric uncomplicated appendicitis (0.2% vs 2.7%; OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02–0.60) [^f5df3233].
- **Cefuroxime plus metronidazole**: Demonstrated noninferiority to standard 5-day regimens in complex appendicitis, with fewer antibiotic-related adverse effects and shorter duration of therapy [^ef3f1358].
- **General support**: Cephalosporins, particularly third-generation agents, provide reliable coverage of common appendicitis pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Bacteroides species [^4ba4d3b4].

---

## Special considerations

- **Beta-lactam allergy**: Avoid cephalosporins; use ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole or moxifloxacin monotherapy as alternatives [^d46b4faa].
- **Pediatric patients**: Ceftriaxone plus metronidazole is effective and well tolerated, with lower SSI rates than cefoxitin monotherapy [^f5df3233].
- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Use the narrowest effective spectrum and shortest effective duration to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^4227afc6] [^c6e5b9f6].

---

Ceftriaxone plus metronidazole is the **preferred cephalosporin regimen** for acute appendicitis, with cefuroxime plus metronidazole as an alternative; duration should be tailored to disease severity and whether surgery is performed, with 7–10 days for nonoperative management and 3–5 days postoperatively when source control is adequate.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis in adults: a review [^70955acc]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the world, with an annual incidence of 96.5 to 100 cases per 100 000 adults.

Observations

The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is based on history and physical, laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Classic symptoms of appendicitis include vague periumbilical pain, anorexia/nausea/intermittent vomiting, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, and low-grade fever. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made in approximately 90% of patients presenting with these symptoms. Laparoscopic appendectomy remains the most common treatment. However, increasing evidence suggests that broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy or combination therapy with either cephalosporins or fluroquinolones with metronidazole, successfully treats uncomplicated acute appendicitis in approximately 70% of patients. Specific imaging findings on computed tomography (CT), such as appendiceal dilatation (appendiceal diameter ≥ 7 mm), or presence of appendicoliths, defined as the conglomeration of feces in the appendiceal lumen, identify patients for whom an antibiotics-first management strategy is more likely to fail. CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, and a dilated appendix greater than 13 mm are associated with higher risk of treatment failure (≈40%) of an antibiotics-first approach. Therefore, surgical management should be recommended in patients with CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, or a dilated appendix who are fit for surgery, defined as having relatively low risk of adverse outcomes or postoperative mortality and morbidity. In patients without high-risk CT findings, either appendectomy or antibiotics can be considered as first-line therapy. In unfit patients without these high-risk CT findings, the antibiotics-first approach is recommended, and surgery may be considered if antibiotic treatment fails. In unfit patients with high-risk CT findings, perioperative risk assessment as well as patient preferences should be considered.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acute appendicitis affects 96.5 to 100 people per 100 000 adults per year worldwide. Appendectomy remains first-line therapy for acute appendicitis, but treatment with antibiotics rather than surgery is appropriate in selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis.

### The surgical infection society guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection: 2024 update [^0a5ab974]. Surgical Infections (2024). High credibility.

Acute appendicitis — non-operative management: We suggest a carbapenem for empiric therapy of patients undergoing non-operative management of acute appendicitis (Grade 2-B). This is based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis including nine RCTs and 12 observational studies totaling 4,551 patients that compared antibiotic regimens using surgery as a common comparator; the surgical procedure had significantly higher one-year treatment success than cephalosporins or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLICs) but not carbapenems, and carbapenems were associated with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: what do meta-analyses say? [^5c38759b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Appendectomy is considered the gold standard for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Nevertheless, for a selected subgroup of patients with no risk factors for complicated appendicitis and/or high surgical risk, conservative therapy with antimicrobials may be safe and effective. The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis must be made on an individual basis and these patients may be followed closely.

Antibiotics

Most antibiotic regimens were consistent with 2010 and 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Surgical Infection Society (SIS) guidelines for treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. Initial parenteral antibiotic regimens used included a second- or third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefmetazole, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) plus metronidazole (or tinidazole) or single-agent regimens of amoxicillin-clavulanate (or ampicillin-sulbactam), piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem (ertapenem or meropenem). Oral (and alternative parenteral) regimens, started upon hospital discharge, included a fluoroquinolone or an advanced generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Four trials (12%) used intravenous and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (or ampicillin-sulbactam), which are recommended against by IDSA and SIS guidelines. In three pediatric trials, ciprofloxacin was used. One pilot RCT allowed outpatient management facilitated by administration of long-acting ertapenem. Daily-dosed ceftriaxone and metronidazole have also been used. Conservatively managed patients have been shown to experience more, mostly mild, antibiotic-related side effects compared with appendectomy patients.

Total intravenous and oral antibiotic duration ranged from 4 to 15 days. The most common total antibiotic duration was 10 days, which was used in 12 trials (35%).; seven trials (21%) used 7 days. The shortest duration was 4 days, used in four trials (12%).,

Pain Control

Although worsening or persistent pain were criteria for antibiotic nonresponse leading to appendectomy, pain control regimens generally were not specified in published trials, with only six (18%) reporting analgesia, and none describing extent of pain control. Three trials (9%) used a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, as a scheduled regimen, two (6%) used morphine, and one (3%) an unspecified narcoticas needed, and one (3%) used paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene for outpatients.

TABLE 2
Areas of Uncertainty for Conservative Antibiotic Treatment of Acute Uncomplicated Appendicitis

This systematic review identifies patient populations most studied and common selection criteria and care methods, provides critical analysis in the context of applicable clinical guidelines and related research, and highlights areas of uncertainty so that patients can be best informed and managed should they consider this approach and researchers can better target unanswered questions about this care. Future studies that address biases associated with enrollment and response evaluation, use best-practice pain control and antibiotic selection, better define cancer risk, and explore longer time thresholds for response, minimized diet restriction and hospital stays, and antibiotic retreatment will further our understanding of the potential effectiveness of conservative management.

### 2 days versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority randomised trial [^ef3f1358]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study APPIC was published by Elisabeth M L de Wijkerslooth and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute appendicitis. In the APPIC study, the trial question was: is a short 2-day course of postoperative antibiotics noninferior to a standard 5-day course in patients with complex appendicitis? In the APPIC study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the APPIC study, the population was: 1005 patients. The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 8 years with complex appendicitis. The key exclusion criteria were no informed consent; interval appendectomy; clinical suspicion of severe sepsis; conservative treatment of acute appendicitis; immunocompromised state; pregnancy. In the APPIC study, the interventions were: n = 502 short 2-day course (intravenous cefuroxime/metronidazole 1,500/500 mg TID or ceftriaxone/metronidazole once daily 2,000 mg/TID 500 mg for 48 hours according to local antibiotic policy) n = 503 standard 5-day course (intravenous cefuroxime/metronidazole 1,500/500 mg TID or ceftriaxone/metronidazole once daily 2,000 mg/TID 500 mg for 5 days according to local antibiotic policy). In the APPIC study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in the rate of infectious complications and death within 90 days (10% vs. 8%; AD 2%, 95% CI -1.6 to 5.6). In the APPIC study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in hospital readmission (12% vs. 6%; OR 2.135, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.4) Significant decrease in adverse effects of antibiotics (9% vs. 22%; OR 0.344, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.5). In the APPIC study, the conclusion was: in patients aged ≥ 8 years with complex appendicitis, short 2-day course was noninferior to standard 5-day course with respect to the rate of infectious complications and death within 90 days.

### Variation in classification and postoperative management of complex appendicitis: a European survey [^67ec8e28]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis is a highly prevalent surgical emergency in both children and adults. Yet, the optimum management of this disease remains a subject of controversy. The non-operative management is increasingly being studied, but emergency appendectomy remains the cornerstone of treatment in most hospitals. If the surgeon classifies the type of appendicitis as complex, antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued after surgery. This aims to prevent infectious complications, including recurrent intra-abdominal infections. The available guidelines recommend to extend prophylaxis for 3–7 postoperative days. The alarming emergence of antimicrobial resistance worldwide warrants optimization of antibiotic use, as presented as a key focus by the WHO. Therefore, it is key to carefully select patients that benefit from prolonged prophylaxis and to define the most optimal regimen.

A survey among Dutch surgeons demonstrated that a clear standard of care is missing both in patient selection and in determining the length of treatment. The definition of complex appendicitis used in studies varies. Apart from its common component: perforated appendicitis, it may or may not also include unperforated gangrenous appendicitis, appendicitis in the presence of a faecolith and/or appendicitis in the presence of pus, or purulent peritonitis, or abscess. Postoperative antibiotic use is left to the discretion of the surgeon. Five days of antibiotics, switched from an intravenous to oral route as early as 48 h after surgery, is common use in many centers in the Netherlands. Another strategy, which is gaining ground, consists of 3 days of intravenous antibiotics only. Intravenous regimens most used are cefuroxime or ceftriaxone in combination with metronidazole. Amoxicillin–clavulanate is often chosen as oral antibiotic. Little is reported in the literature regarding the common practice of prolonged prophylaxis after appendectomy in other countries. Some studies have reported variability in care for patients with complex appendicitis. Most studies included only pediatric patients, and few focused on the postoperative management of appendicitis. In pursuit of the optimum antibiotic regimen for complex appendicitis, a variety of treatment protocols have been reported. Limiting antibiotic use to 5 days at most is widely accepted, but no specific duration of postoperative antibiotic use has proven most optimal. Previous research has shown that standardization of practice can be beneficial in terms of clinical outcomes after appendectomy (i.e. postoperative abscess formation and length of hospital stay). Identifying variation in practice may therefore reveal opportunities for quality improvement.

The aim of this study was to determine the variation in the classification and postoperative management of complex appendicitis on an international level.

### Contemporary microbiology and antimicrobial treatment of complicated appendicitis: the value of a short-term study [^4ba4d3b4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial stewardship interventions to curtail the use of third-generation cephalosporins and antipseudomonal penicillins for the treatment of complicated appendicitis in children are challenging given the tendency to treat complicated disease with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Reasons for this are unclear, but there is a paucity of contemporary microbiologic data associated with the child presenting with either acute perforated or gangrenous appendicitis. This study aimed to justify the appropriateness of an empiric regimen consisting of ampicillin, tobramycin/gentamicin plus metronidazole and to analyze duration of postoperative therapy.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study from February 1, 2017, to October 31, 2018, in children who underwent appendectomy or interventional radiologic drainage for primary complicated appendicitis. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had a pathogen isolated from peritoneal fluid culture that was not susceptible to the recommended empiric therapy. The secondary outcomes were the total duration of antimicrobial therapy and the proportion of patients with a postoperative infectious complication within 30 days after intervention.

Results

Of 425 children with primary acute appendicitis, 158 (37%) had complicated appendicitis at presentation. Culture was performed in 53 (40%) of the 133 who underwent a surgical or interventional radiologic intervention. The group with peritoneal cultures was more likely to present with longer symptom duration before admission [3 (interquartile range, 2–5) vs 2 (interquartile range, 1–2) days; P < 0.001] and with purulent peritonitis [47% (25/53) vs 13% (10/80); P < 0.001]. The most common pathogens isolated were anaerobes (81%), Escherichia coli (74%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (62%). Only 4% of isolated bacteria were resistant to empiric therapy. Postoperative infectious complications were documented in 23 (17%) patients and were not associated with the presence of a resistant pathogen or the choice of antimicrobial agents but with more severe disease and higher C-reactive protein values (303 vs 83mg/L; P = 0.03) at presentation.

Conclusions

In a cohort of previously healthy children presenting with complicated appendicitis requiring surgical drainage, the most common bacteria from peritoneal cultures continue to be S. anginosus, aminoglycoside-susceptible Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes. In an attempt to reduce extended-spectrum cephalosporin use, these data were useful in supporting the use of metronidazole with ampicillin and an aminoglycoside, rather than third-generation cephalosporins.

### Extended-versus narrower-spectrum antibiotics for appendicitis [^f2df2590]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Appendicitis guidelines recommend either narrower- or extended-spectrum antibiotics for treatment of complicated appendicitis. The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of extended-spectrum versus narrower-spectrum antibiotics for children with appendicitis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of children aged 3 to 18 years discharged between 2011 and 2013 from 23 freestanding children's hospitals with an appendicitis diagnosis and appendectomy performed. Subjects were classified as having complicated appendicitis if they had a postoperative length of stay ≥ 3 days, a central venous catheter placed, major or severe illness classification, or ICU admission. The exposure of interest was receipt of systemic extended-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin ± tazobactam, ticarcillin ± clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefepime, or a carbapenem) on the day of appendectomy or the day after. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission for wound infection or repeat abdominal surgery. Multivariable logistic regression, propensity score weighting, and subgroup analyses were used to control for confounding by indication.

Results

Of 24984 patients, 17654 (70.7%) had uncomplicated appendicitis and 7330 (29.3%) had complicated appendicitis. Overall, 664 (2.7%) patients experienced the primary outcome, 1.1% among uncomplicated cases and 6.4% among complicated cases (P < .001). Extended-spectrum antibiotic exposure was significantly associated with the primary outcome in complicated (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43 [95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.93]), but not uncomplicated, (adjusted odds ratio, 1.32 [95% confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.98]) appendicitis. These odds ratios remained consistent across additional analyses.

Conclusions

Extended-spectrum antibiotics seem to offer no advantage over narrower-spectrum agents for children with surgically managed acute uncomplicated or complicated appendicitis.

Surgical Infection Society — antimicrobial stewardship in CA-IAI: We recommend limiting antimicrobial agent therapy to 24 hours in patients with traumatic bowel perforations operated on within 12 hours (Grade I-A), patients with acute or gangrenous appendicitis without perforation (Grade I-A), or patients with acute or gangrenous cholecystitis without perforation (Grade I-A). We recommend oral antimicrobial agents with good bioavailability as substitutes for IV agents upon return of adequate gastrointestinal function (Grade I-B). We recommend oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole to complete a short course of antimicrobial agent therapy (Grade I-B). We recommend against use of most cephalosporin-, aztreonam-, or fluoroquinolone-based regimens for empiric therapy of CA-IAI in geographic areas with a high prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (Grade I-B).

Complicated appendicitis — post-operative duration after appendectomy with adequate source control: We suggest limiting post-operative antibiotic agents to 24–48 hours for low- and high-risk patients with adequate source control for complicated appendicitis undergoing appendectomy (Grade 2-B). Supporting evidence includes two RCTs: a pragmatic, open-label, multi-center, non-inferiority RCT of 1,066 patients comparing two- versus five days of IV post-operative antibiotics (cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole), where the composite endpoint was infectious complications and mortality within 90 days, adverse effects were significantly lower in the two-day group but hospital readmission was more frequent; and an open-label, single-center RCT comparing short (24 h) versus extended (> 24 h) courses, reporting complication rates of 17.9% and 29.3% for the 24-hour and extended groups, respectively, with shorter hospital length of stay in the 24-hour group.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^fe9c71fb]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The role of conservative antibiotic treatment for initial management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis is an area of continued controversy. Because of evidence gaps, it has not generally been concluded that antibiotic treatment should routinely replace surgery. These gaps include few data outside healthy young adults, limited comparison with laparoscopic surgery, and incomplete assessment of patient-related and long-term outcomes. Meta-analyses have found conservative treatment associated with similar or fewer complications overall compared with surgery, – and a recent guideline now acknowledges that this management can be successful for selected patients who wish to avoid surgery and accept the possibility of recurrence. However, guidance does not exist to best advise patients and provide this care. This systematic review describes the patient selection criteria and range of medical treatments used in published trial methods of conservative antibiotic management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. While RCT (level II; RCTs with some negative criteria) evidence of comparative effectiveness of conservative treatment in relation to urgent appendectomy exists, the full body of experience includes other prospective and retrospective, comparative and noncomparative trials. In total, our search found 34 studies describing 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants. For patients, this summary facilitates discussion about the extent to which their clinical profile is supported by trial experience and what they should expect should they choose nonoperative treatment. For providers, this review identifies common patterns of specific care components in order to guide their management.

### Role of preoperative antibiotic treatment while awaiting appendectomy: the PERFECT-antibiotics randomized clinical trial [^d7bc3c2c]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Antibiotics are thought to decelerate inflammation progression and reduce complications in acute uncomplicated appendicitis. The evidence of their effectiveness is insufficient, and treatment practices vary widely.

Objective

To investigate the effect of preoperatively started antibiotic treatment on the rate of appendiceal perforation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, noninferiority, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2 hospitals in Finland and 1 hospital in Norway between May 18, 2020, and January 22, 2023. Data analysis was performed from March 2023 to March 2024. Eligible patients were adults (aged > 18 years) diagnosed with presumed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Patients with allergies or other contraindications to study antibiotics, previously started antibiotic treatment, pregnancy, a suspicion of perforated appendicitis, or other reasons to perform prompt surgery were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 with a web-based service simultaneously as the laparoscopic appendectomy was scheduled.

Interventions

Antibiotic treatment started while waiting for surgery (cefuroxime, 1500 mg, and metronidazole, 500 mg, every 8 hours until the surgery) or waiting without antibiotic treatment. Patients in both groups received a single prophylactic dose of antibiotics in the induction of anesthesia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was perforated appendicitis diagnosed during surgery. The absolute difference in perforation rates was compared between the groups by an intention-to-treat analysis, and the predefined noninferiority margin was 5 percentage points. Secondary outcomes included surgical site infections within 30 days.

Results

A total of 1797 patients were randomly assigned to either the antibiotic group (n = 901) or no-antibiotic group (n = 896). Median (IQR) patient age was 35 (28–46) years, and 793 patients (45%) were female. After randomization, 23 patients (1.3%) were excluded, leaving 1774 patients for the intention-to-treat analyses. The difference between the appendiceal perforation rates met the noninferiority threshold: 74 of 888 patients in the antibiotic group (8.3%) vs 79 of 886 patients in the no-antibiotic group (8.9%; absolute difference, 0.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.0 to 3.2 percentage points; P = 0.66; risk ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.45). For secondary outcome, the surgical site infection rate was slightly lower in the antibiotic group (14 of 887 [1.6%]) vs the no-antibiotic group (28 of 886 [3.2%]; absolute difference, 1.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.2 to 3.0 percentage points; P = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this multicenter noninferiority randomized clinical trial, preoperatively started antibiotic treatment did not decrease the risk of appendiceal perforation when appendectomy was performed within 24 hours in adult patients with presumed uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

### Treating appendicitis with antibiotics [^1255c062]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A nonsurgical approach using antimicrobial agents has been advocated as the initial treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. Several studies and meta-analyses explored this approach. Because many of these studies included individuals with resolving appendicitis, their results were biased. Antimicrobials, however, are warranted and needed for the management of surgical high-risk patients with perforated appendicitis and those with localized abscess or phlegmon. Randomized placebo-controlled trials that focus on early identification of complicated acute appendicitis patients needing surgery and that prospectively evaluate the optimal use of antibiotic treatment in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis are warranted.

### Appendectomy within 30 days of initiating antibiotic treatment for appendicitis… [^c21e65e8]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Which patient factors are associated with appendectomy after starting antibiotics for acute appendicitis. Findings This cohort study including 735 patients with appendicitis initially treated with antibiotics found that appendicitis severity was not associated with risk of appendectomy within 30 days, but presence of appendicolith was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that presence of an appendicolith was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of undergoing appendectomy within 30 days of initiating antibiotics. Clinical characteristics often used to describe severity of appendicitis were not associated with odds of 30-day appendectomy. This information may help guide more individualized decision-making for people with appendicitis.

This cohort study using data from the CODA trial found a significant and persistent association between radiographic evidence of an appendicolith and 30-day appendectomy in participants initiating antibiotics, even after controlling for physiologic characteristics and other radiographic findings. Of note, several factors often presumed by clinicians to be consistent with more severe appendicitis were not independently associated with appendectomy, but ORs were in the expected direction. An emerging theory proposes that appendicitis has 2 phenotypes, 21 a simple type and a severe type, and that the first does not necessarily evolve to the second if left untreated. The simple type is thought likely to respond to antibiotics22 and may even be self-limiting.

23–25 The severe type is thought to be associated with perforation on presentation and less likely to resolve successfully with antibiotics. Interestingly, patient advisor feedback during the design phase of the CODA trial indicated that some patients would find antibiotics to be a preferable alternative even if they were in a subgroup with an up to 75% chance of appendectomy after antibiotics. This cohort study found that the presence of appendicolith was associated with the greatest risk for undergoing appendectomy within 30 days of initiating antibiotics, among examined factors. Multiple factors that clinicians associate with disease severity were not independently associated with appendectomy. Beyond these factors, site characteristics, potentially including physician decision-making and unmeasured processes of care and structural barriers, may also be involved in determining which patients get an appendectomy.

These findings may be helpful in developing patient-facing tools to support informed decision-making in the treatment of appendicitis.

### Appendectomy versus antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis [^64054a0d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common emergency general surgical conditions worldwide. Uncomplicated/simple appendicitis can be treated with appendectomy or antibiotics. Some studies have suggested possible benefits with antibiotics with reduced complications, length of hospital stay, and the number of days off work. However, surgery may improve success of treatment as antibiotic treatment is associated with recurrence and future need for surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated/simple acute appendicitis compared with appendectomy for resolution of symptoms and complications.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov) on 19 July 2022. We also searched for unpublished studies in conference proceedings together with reference checking and citation search. There were no restrictions on date, publication status, or language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies where most participants were adults with uncomplicated/simple appendicitis. Interventions included antibiotics (by any route) compared with appendectomy (open or laparoscopic).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodology expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Primary outcomes included mortality and success of treatment, and secondary outcomes included number of participants requiring appendectomy in the antibiotic group, complications, pain, length of hospital stay, sick leave, malignancy in the antibiotic group, negative appendectomy rate, and quality of life. Success of treatment definitions were heterogeneous although mainly based on resolution of symptoms rather than incorporation of long-term recurrence or need for surgery in the antibiotic group.

Main Results

We included 13 studies in the review covering 1675 participants randomised to antibiotics and 1683 participants randomised to appendectomy. One study was unpublished. All were conducted in secondary care and two studies received pharmaceutical funding. All studies used broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens expected to cover gastrointestinal bacteria. Most studies used predominantly laparoscopic surgery, but some included mainly open procedures. Six studies included adults and children. Almost all studies aimed to exclude participants with complicated appendicitis prior to randomisation, although one study included 12% with perforation. The diagnostic technique was clinical assessment and imaging in most studies. Only one study limited inclusion by sex (male only). Follow-up ranged from hospital admission only to seven years. Certainty of evidence was mainly affected by risk of bias (due to lack of blinding and loss to follow-up) and imprecision. Primary outcomes It is uncertain whether there was any difference in mortality due to the very low-certainty evidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.95; 1 study, 492 participants). There may be 76 more people per 1000 having unsuccessful treatment in the antibiotic group compared with surgery, which did not reach our predefined level for clinical significance (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96; I² = 69%; 7 studies, 2471 participants; low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes At one year, 30.7% (95% CI 24.0 to 37.8; I² = 80%; 9 studies, 1396 participants) of participants in the antibiotic group required appendectomy or, alternatively, more than two-thirds of antibiotic-treated participants avoided surgery in the first year, but the evidence is very uncertain. Regarding complications, it is uncertain whether there is any difference in episodes of Clostridium difficile diarrhoea due to very low-certainty evidence (Peto OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.89; 1 study, 1332 participants). There may be a clinically significant reduction in wound infections with antibiotics (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.68; I² = 16%; 9 studies, 2606 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether antibiotics affect the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess or collection (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.07; I² = 19%; 6 studies, 1831 participants), or reoperation (Peto OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.16; 1 study, 492 participants) due to very low-certainty evidence, mainly due to rare events causing imprecision and risk of bias. It is uncertain if antibiotics prolonged length of hospital stay by half a day due to the very low-certainty evidence (MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.01; I² = 97%; 11 studies, 3192 participants). The incidence of malignancy was 0.3% (95% CI 0 to 1.5; 5 studies, 403 participants) in the antibiotic group although follow-up was variable. Antibiotics probably increased the number of negative appendectomies at surgery (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.54 to 6.49; I² = 17%; 5 studies, 707 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics may be associated with higher rates of unsuccessful treatment for 76 per 1000 people, although differences may not be clinically significant. It is uncertain if antibiotics increase length of hospital stay by half a day. Antibiotics may reduce wound infections. A third of the participants initially treated with antibiotics required subsequent appendectomy or two-thirds avoided surgery within one year, but the evidence is very uncertain. There were too few data from the included studies to comment on major complications.

### Appendectomy versus antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis [^1af84389]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain. Present day treatment of choice for acute appendicitis is appendectomy, however complications are inherent to operative treatment. Though surgical appendectomy remains the standard treatment, several investigators have investigated conservative antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis and reported good results.

Objectives

Is antibiotic treatment as effective as surgical appendectomy (laparoscopic or open) in patients with acute appendicitis on recovery within two weeks, without major complications (including recurrence) within one year?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 6, 2011); MEDLINE (until June 2011); EMBASE (until June 2011); Prospective Trial Registers (June 2011) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials (RCT and qRCT) comparing antibiotic treatment with appendectomy in patients with suspected appendicitis were included. Excluded were studies which primarily focused on the complications of acute appendicitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The review authors contacted the trial authors for additional information if required. Statistical analysis was carried out using Review Manager and MetaAnalyst. A non-inferiority analysis was performed, comparing antibiotic treatment (ABT) to the gold standard (appendectomy). By consensus, a 20% margin of non-inferiority was considered clinically relevant.

Main Results

Five RCT's (901 patients) were assessed. In total 73.4% (95% CI 62.7 to 81.9) of patients who were treated with antibiotics and 97.4 (95% CI 94.4 to 98.8) patients who directly got an appendectomy were cured within two weeks without major complications (including recurrence) within one year. The lower 95% CI was 15.2% below the 20% margin for the primary outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

The upper bound of the 95% CI of ABT for cure within two weeks without major complications crosses the 20% margin of appendectomy, so the outcome is inconclusive. Also the quality of the studies was low to moderate, for that reason the results should be interpret with caution and definite conclusions cannot be made. Therefore we conclude that appendectomy remains the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. Antibiotic treatment might be used as an alternative treatment in a good quality RCT or in specific patients or conditions were surgery is contraindicated.

### Non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children, why not? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^881efc11]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The three studies included in the present meta-analyses used, as NOM, intravenous therapy with meropenem combined with metronidazole (n = 2) or piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 1) for at least 48 h. Subsequently, the intravenous therapies were switched to oral ciprofloxacin combined with oral metronidazole for an additional 5–8 days. One potential concern may relate to the risk of Clostridioides Difficile Infection (CDI), a serious antibiotic-related complication that has been reported among children undergoing treatment for appendicitis. A retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information System has recently reported that only 0.2% of the nearly 106,000 patients developed CDI, suggesting that this event is rare. Furthermore, the antibiotic treatment duration is a key issue. Indeed, evidence is now available showing that prolonged antibiotic treatment can lead to the emergence of resistant bacteria. Accordingly, local antibiotic protocols have been established in some centers for the optimization of treatments for pediatric acute appendicitis. For instance, Surlemont et al. have proposed that to limit antibiotic overuse, treatment should not exceed 48 h for uncomplicated appendicitis, eventually prolonged to 5 days for perforated appendicitis/peritonitis.

Another important matter of concern is represented by the selection of the antibiotic to be given intravenously. All the 3 studies used carbapenems with broad spectrum, namely meropenem and the combination piperacillin/tazobactam, whereas most of the antimicrobial stewardship programs now suggest the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotic combinations (i.e. ceftriaxone/metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate) for the treatment of appendicitis to limit the increasing prevalence of multidrug resistance. It must be, indeed, considered that in most European countries (such as Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Spain) the presence of carbapenems-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has become a serious life-threatening condition, and carbapenem-sparing regimens have been advocated. Thus, meropenem should not be considered as the first treatment option in countries with a high rate of resistance to carbapenems. Worthy of mention, some recent studies have confirmed the optimal clinical efficacy and safety of amoxicillin associated with clavulanic acid for the treatment of acute appendicitis in children. Accordingly, short-term therapy with this combined regimen should be considered as first-line treatment for uncomplicated peritonitis in children.

### Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid versus appendicectomy for treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^dcdf3082]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Researchers have suggested that antibiotics could cure acute appendicitis. We assessed the efficacy of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid by comparison with emergency appendicectomy for treatment of patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

Methods

In this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised trial, adult patients (aged 18–68 years) with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, as assessed by CT scan, were enrolled at six university hospitals in France. A computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to allocate patients randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (3 g per day) for 8–15 days or emergency appendicectomy. The primary endpoint was occurrence of postintervention peritonitis within 30 days of treatment initiation. Non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in rates was lower than 10 percentage points. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00135603.

Findings

Of 243 patients randomised, 123 were allocated to the antibiotic group and 120 to the appendicectomy group. Four were excluded from analysis because of early dropout before receiving the intervention, leaving 239 (antibiotic group, 120; appendicectomy group, 119) patients for intention-to-treat analysis. 30-day postintervention peritonitis was significantly more frequent in the antibiotic group (8%, n = 9) than in the appendicectomy group (2%, n = 2; treatment difference 5.8; 95% CI 0.3–12.1). In the appendicectomy group, despite CT-scan assessment, 21 (18%) of 119 patients were unexpectedly identified at surgery to have complicated appendicitis with peritonitis. In the antibiotic group, 14 (12% [7.1–18.6]) of 120 underwent an appendicectomy during the first 30 days and 30 (29% [21.4–38.9]) of 102 underwent appendicectomy between 1 month and 1 year, 26 of whom had acute appendicitis (recurrence rate 26%; 18.0–34.7).

Interpretation

Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid was not non-inferior to emergency appendicectomy for treatment of acute appendicitis. Identification of predictive markers on CT scans might enable improved targeting of antibiotic treatment.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^6544fa02]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

For more than a century, appendicectomy has been the treatment of choice for appendicitis. Recent trials have challenged this view. This study assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy compared with appendicectomy in patients with non‐perforated appendicitis.

Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted for randomized trials comparing antibiotic therapy with appendicectomy in patients with non‐perforated appendicitis. Key outcomes were analysed using random‐effects meta‐analysis, and the quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

Five studies including 1116 patients reported major complications in 25 (4.9 per cent) of 510 patients in the antibiotic and 41 (8.4 per cent) of 489 in the appendicectomy group: risk difference −2.6 (95 per cent c.i. –6.3 to 1.1) per cent (low‐quality evidence). Minor complications occurred in 11 (2.2 per cent) of 510 and 61 (12.5 per cent) of 489 patients respectively: risk difference −7.2 (−18.1 to 3.8) per cent (very low‐quality evidence). Of 550 patients in the antibiotic group, 47 underwent appendicectomy within 1 month: pooled estimate 8.2 (95 per cent c.i. 5.2 to 11.8) per cent (high‐quality evidence). Within 1 year, appendicitis recurred in 114 of 510 patients in the antibiotic group: pooled estimate 22.6 (15.6 to 30.4) per cent (high‐quality evidence). For every 100 patients with non‐perforated appendicitis, initial antibiotic therapy compared with prompt appendicectomy may result in 92 fewer patients receiving surgery within the first month, and 23 more experiencing recurrent appendicitis within the first year.

Conclusion

The choice of medicalsurgical management in patients with clearly uncomplicated appendicitis is value‐ and preference‐dependent, suggesting a change in practice towards shared decision‐making is necessary.

### Long-term results following antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis in adults [^25654c70]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis as alternative to surgical appendectomy is a well-recognized possibility, with favourable response rates of 0.77–0.91 according to randomized and consecutively evaluated patients. However, it is still a controversy to what extent antibiotic treatment should be offered systematically as a first-line therapy. It has even been doubted whether antibiotics offers significant resolution of inflamed appendices. This uncertainty is probably in part dependent on that long-term results are essentially lacking in the literature, although satisfying acute and long-term outcomes are reported in both adults and children with uncomplicated appendicitis. The resolution of pain and clinical signs of inflammation was around 75–90% of treated patients depending on clinical stage and selection of patients. The choice of antibiotics is also important, which may vary between countries and across time in different geographic areas. In the present study, we present long-term results on outcome that should encourage physicians to choose antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis as a safe and evidence-based alternative to acute surgical operations.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^273d9834]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that increased use of imaging may be identifying appendicitis at an earlier stage than in the past, and also misidentifying nonappendicitis, leading to unnecessary care of what would otherwise be a self-resolving condition. One recent RCT reported comparable outcomes among participants treated with supportive care without antibiotics as with antibiotics. However, in this study, participants were selected as low-risk based on clinical and CT criteria (e.g. no more than mild fat infiltration), as well as their and their physician's willingness for enrollment, and accounted for only about 20% of all presenting patients with presumed appendicitis (whereas at operation, about 80% are nonperforated). Furthermore, there was no surgery control arm to confirm the existence and severity of appendicitis. Despite this one intriguing study, considering the recognized life-threatening complications of appendicitis in the presurgery/antibiotic era and absence of serious septic events reported in conservative treatment trials, if surgery is not performed, antibiotic treatment remains prudent.

Antibiotic treatment used in most trials was consistent with 2010 and 2017 IDSA and SIS guidelines for mild-to-moderate community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. These guidelines are based on clinical trials of antibiotics for patients with a range of intra-abdominal infections, including complicated appendicitis, and in vitro activity. One exception is that ampicillin-sulbactam and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were used in four trials (12%), but are recommended against by guidelines because of high Escherichia coli resistance rates and inferior clinical outcomes in comparative trials. One RCT that used intravenous and oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid could not demonstrate noninferiority of nonoperative treatment. Inadequate in vitro activity of these antibiotics was cited as a trial limitation. However, antibiotic response rates in trials using these drugs were high, 88% to 100%. Other trials used oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid following improvement on a more broadly active intravenous antibiotic regimen. –

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^b2eba640]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common reason for an emergency abdominal surgery, with a lifetime appendectomy risk of 12% for males and 23% for females. Although conservative (i.e. nonoperative) treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics has yet to be routinely recommended over appendectomy, and evidence gaps exist that are being addressed in ongoing trials, this management is becoming increasingly accepted as a reasonable option for patient shared decision-making. In a 2016 guideline, the World Society of Emergency Surgery concluded that antibiotic therapy can be successful in selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis who wish to avoid surgery (level of evidence 1; grade of recommendation, A). A 2014 survey of Irish surgeons found that about one fifth routinely treat appendicitis nonoperatively. However, little clinical guidance exists for practitioners in terms of how nonoperative treatment is administered so they can best select and inform patients, and provide care to achieve similar efficacy and safety as established in published trials.

Since the mid-1990s, eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated conservative antibiotic treatment in comparison with urgent appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis. – In 2015, Salminen et al.reported by far the largest RCT, which involved 530 adults, and found fewer complications, 6% initial antibiotic nonresponse and 23% 1-year recurrence rates, and 12 fewer disability days compared with mostly open appendectomy. Meta-analyses that included this trial found conservative treatment associated with similar or fewer total complications as surgery and concluded that it can be offered to patients. –

We report results of a search of all published trials describing the methods of conservative treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. This systematic review describes specific components of medical management that may affect outcomes including patient selection, imaging, antibiotics, pain and diet management, criteria for antibiotic nonresponse and appendectomy, disposition, and follow-up. We summarize the details of medical management, describe the range of approaches, critically evaluate this management in the context of applicable guidelines and related research, and identify areas of uncertainty.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^8d98527e]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Eligibility of studies

RCTs that compared antibiotic treatment with appendicectomy in patients with suspected acute non‐perforated appendicitis were included. Quasi‐RCTs were also included, but only in the sensitivity analysis. Studies with a very high risk of bias, in which both the description of methods and the baseline characteristics indicated that many patients randomized were not included, were excluded.

Data sources and searches

The comprehensive search conducted in the 2011 Cochrane systematic review of Wilms and colleagues 22, which extended until June 2011, was updated. This consisted of three blocks of search terms for the concepts appendicitis, appendicectomy and antibiotic treatment, limited by the Cochrane filters for RCTs and the McMaster University Health Information Research Unit Clinical Queries hedges for therapeutic studies. The searches were adapted and run without language restrictions in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1 January 2011 to 4 December 2015. PubMed was also searched for in‐process citations, and the major clinical trial registries (:International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (ICTRP):) were searched for ongoing trials. Appendix S1 (supporting information) shows details of the search strategy. In addition, reference lists of other previous systematic reviews 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24 comparing antibiotic treatment with appendicectomy in patients with non‐perforated appendicitis were searched.

Study selection

Using standard, pilot‐tested forms and working in teams of two, reviewers screened all titles and abstracts identified by the literature search independently, and obtained full‐text articles of any article identified as potentially eligible by either reviewer. The reviewers used standard, pilot‐tested forms to evaluate the full texts for eligibility and resolved disagreement by discussion or, if necessary, by consulting with a third reviewer.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^8f543edd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

For more than a century, appendicectomy has been the treatment of choice for appendicitis. Recent trials have challenged this view. This study assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy compared with appendicectomy in patients with non-perforated appendicitis.

Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted for randomized trials comparing antibiotic therapy with appendicectomy in patients with non-perforated appendicitis. Key outcomes were analysed using random-effects meta-analysis, and the quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Five studies including 1116 patients reported major complications in 25 (4.9 per cent) of 510 patients in the antibiotic and 41 (8.4 per cent) of 489 in the appendicectomy group: risk difference -2.6 (95 per cent c.i. -6.3 to 1.1) per cent (low-quality evidence). Minor complications occurred in 11 (2.2 per cent) of 510 and 61 (12.5 per cent) of 489 patients respectively: risk difference -7.2 (-18.1 to 3.8) per cent (very low-quality evidence). Of 550 patients in the antibiotic group, 47 underwent appendicectomy within 1 month: pooled estimate 8.2 (95 per cent c.i. 5.2 to 11.8) per cent (high-quality evidence). Within 1year, appendicitis recurred in 114 of 510 patients in the antibiotic group: pooled estimate 22.6 (15.6 to 30.4) per cent (high-quality evidence). For every 100 patients with non-perforated appendicitis, initial antibiotic therapy compared with prompt appendicectomy may result in 92 fewer patients receiving surgery within the first month, and 23 more experiencing recurrent appendicitis within the first year.

Conclusion

The choice of medical versus surgical management in patients with clearly uncomplicated appendicitis is value- and preference-dependent, suggesting a change in practice towards shared decision-making is necessary.

### Antibiotics-first versus surgery for appendicitis: a US pilot randomized controlled trial allowing outpatient antibiotic management [^fa48d098]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Randomized trials suggest that nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics-first is safe. No trial has evaluated outpatient treatment and no US randomized trial has been conducted, to our knowledge. This pilot study assessed feasibility of a multicenter US study comparing antibiotics-first, including outpatient management, with appendectomy.

Methods

Patients aged 5 years or older with uncomplicated appendicitis at 1 US hospital were randomized to appendectomy or intravenous ertapenem greater than or equal to 48 hours and oral cefdinir and metronidazole. Stable antibiotics-first-treated participants older than 13 years could be discharged after greater than or equal to 6-hour emergency department (ED) observation with next-day follow-up. Outcomes included 1-month major complication rate (primary) and hospital duration, pain, disability, quality of life, and hospital charges, and antibiotics-first appendectomy rate.

Results

Of 48 eligible patients, 30 (62.5%) consented, of whom 16 (53.3%) were randomized to antibiotics-first and 14 (46.7%) to appendectomy. Median age was 33 years (range 9 to 73 years), median WBC count was 15,000/μL (range 6,200 to 23,100/μL), and median computed tomography appendiceal diameter was 10 mm (range 7 to 18 mm). Of 15 antibiotic-treated adults, 14 (93.3%) were discharged from the ED and all had symptom resolution. At 1 month, major complications occurred in 2 appendectomy participants (14.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8% to 42.8%) and 1 antibiotics-first participant (6.3%; 95% CI 0.2% to 30.2%). Antibiotics-first participants had less total hospital time than appendectomy participants, 16.2 versus 42.1 hours, respectively. Antibiotics-first-treated participants had less pain and disability. During median 12-month follow-up, 2 of 15 antibiotics-first-treated participants (13.3%; 95% CI 3.7% to 37.9%) developed appendicitis and 1 was treated successfully with antibiotics; 1 had appendectomy. No more major complications occurred in either group.

Conclusion

A multicenter US trial comparing antibiotics-first to appendectomy, including outpatient management, is feasible to evaluate efficacy and safety.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^a8e02e3f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Interventions

Protocol-specified antibiotics consisted of a minimum of a once-daily intravenous regimen (eg, ertapenem or ceftriaxone and high-dose metronidazole) or scheduled doses with coverage for 24 hours followed by oral antibiotics to complete a 10-day total course. Clinical teams selected antibiotics based on guideline recommendations for intra-abdominal infections from the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Discharge criteria, including from the ED, were specified in the study protocol as follows: (1) the patient was stable and had stable and near-normal vital signs; (2) the patient was afebrile; (3) the patient's symptoms were controlled with oral analgesics; (4) the patient could tolerate oral fluids and medications; (5) the patient and clinician agreed that discharge was acceptable; and (6) a timely outpatient follow-up visit was confirmed. Interpretation of these criteria and the decision for outpatient management was at the discretion of the patient's treating physicians. Participants could be cared for solely in the ED or subsequently in an observation unit or hospital based on physician discretion and availability of these care sites. Appendectomy was recommended for participants who developed diffuse peritonitis and/or severe sepsis or septic shock at any time or who experienced worsening symptoms after 48 hours of antibiotic use. However, these criteria were not required for appendectomy to be performed, and the treating clinician and participant ultimately decided on an appendectomy.

### Single daily dosing ceftriaxone and metronidazole vs standard triple antibiotic regimen for perforated appendicitis in children: a prospective randomized trial [^aee998bd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Appendicitis is the most common emergency condition in children. Historically, a 3-drug regimen consisting of ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin (AGC) has been used postoperatively for perforated appendicitis. A retrospective review at our institution has found single day dosing of ceftriaxone and metronidazole (CM) to be a more simple and cost-effective antibiotic strategy. Therefore, we performed a prospective, randomized trial to compare efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these 2 regimens.

Methods

After internal review board approval (IRB no. 04 12–149), children found to have perforated appendicitis at appendectomy were randomized to either once daily dosing of CM (2 total doses per day) or standard dosing of AGC (11 total doses per day). Perforation was defined as an identifiable hole in the appendix. The operative approach (laparoscopic), length of antibiotic use, and criteria for discharge were standardized for the groups. Based on our retrospective analysis using length of postoperative hospitalization as a primary end point, a sample size of 100 patients was calculated for an alpha of .5 and a power of 0.82.

Results

One hundred patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. On presentation, there were no differences in sex distribution, days of symptoms, temperature, or leukocyte count. There was no difference in abscess rate or wound infections between groups. The CM group resulted in significantly less antibiotic charges then the AGC group.

Conclusions

Once daily dosing with the 2-drug regimen (CM) offers a more efficient, cost-effective antibiotic management in children with perforated appendicitis without compromising infection control when compared to a traditional 3-drug regimen.

Pediatric intra-abdominal infection (IAI) empiric therapy and evidence — The most common IAI encountered in children outside the neonatal age group is complicated appendicitis; IAI from other sources is observed much less frequently. As with adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy directed against gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobic bacteria is appropriate for children with perforated appendicitis and other sources of IAI. Randomized controlled trials before 2000 and newer studies support use of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, ertapenem, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, cefoperazone-sulbactam, and combinations of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ceftazidime with metronidazole or clindamycin; in addition, cefuroxime has been approved for use in pediatric patients.

### Two days versus five days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: cost analysis of a randomized, noninferiority trial [^a7082a5c]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Trial Design and Oversight

The APPIC trial was a pragmatic, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial powered for noninferiority. The trial design was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register in December 2016 (code NL5946) and was published in May 2018. The trial was approved by the ethics committees at all participating sites (1 academic center and 14 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands). Details of the trial design and methods were published. This manuscript was prepared in accordance with the "Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials" checklist for noninferiority randomized clinical trials and the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist for economic evaluations of health interventions.

Patients

Patients aged ≥ 8 years were enrolled in the study if they underwent an appendectomy for complex appendicitis and gave informed consent. Complex appendicitis was defined as the presence of necrosis, perforation, or abscess, as assessed intraoperatively. Patients were excluded from participation if they were pregnant, immunocompromised, or American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV. Other exclusion criteria are provided in the full protocol. All patients gave written informed consent.

Randomization

Within 24 hours after the appendectomy trial, patients were randomized to 2 days or 5 days of postoperative antibiotics in a 1:1 ratio. Computerized block randomization was used (random-sized blocks, size range: 4–8), stratified for the center. Treating physicians and patients were not blinded to treatment allocation.

Treatment

The postoperative antibiotic regimen consisted of cefuroxime (1500 mg three times daily) or ceftriaxone (2000 mg once daily) in combination with metronidazole (500 mg three times daily), administered intravenously. In children, the dosage was adjusted according to their weight. A daily single dose of gentamycin iv was allowed as cointervention. After 2 days or 5 days, antibiotics were ceased. The following deviations in regimen were allowed: (1) switch in an antibiotic agent and/or prolongation due to perioperative culture results, (2) early discontinuation due to adverse effects (ie, allergic reaction and thrombophlebitis) or repeated iv failure, and (3) switch in an antibiotic agent and/or prolongation due to an infectious complication.

### Antibiotics as first-line therapy for acute appendicitis: evidence for a change in clinical practice [^4aa785b2]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized studies have indicated that acute appendicitis may be treated by antibiotics without the need of surgery. However, concerns have been raised about selection bias of patients in such studies. Therefore, the present study was aimed to validate previous findings in randomized studies by a full-scale population-based application.

Methods

All patients with acute appendicitis at Sahlgrenska University Hospital (May 2009 and February 2010) were offered intravenous piperacillin plus tazobactam according to our previous experience, followed by 9 days out-hospital oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole. Endpoints were treatment efficacy and complications. Efficient antibiotic treatment was defined as recovery without the need of surgery beyond 1 year of follow-up.

Results

A total of 558 consecutive patients were hospitalized and treated due to acute appendicitis. Seventy-nine percent (n = 442) received antibiotics as first-line therapy and 20% (n = 111) had primary surgery as the second-line therapy. Seventy-seven percent of patients on primary antibiotics recovered while 23% (n = 100) had subsequent appendectomy due to failed initial treatment on antibiotics. Thirty-eight patients (11%) of the 342 had experienced recurrent appendicitis at 1-year follow-up. Primary antibiotic treatment had fewer complications compared to primary surgery.

Conclusions

This population-based study confirms previous results of randomized studies. Antibiotic treatment can be offered as the first-line therapy to a majority of unselected patients with acute appendicitis without medical drawbacks other than the unknown risk for long-term relapse, which must be weighed against the unpredicted but well-known risk for serious major complications following surgical intervention.

### Safety and efficacy of antibiotics compared with appendicectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f87c8a86]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Appendicectomy has been the mainstay for the treatment for acute appendicitis since it was first reported by McBurney in 1889, and the general assumption since the 19th century has been that in the absence of surgical intervention the disease often progresses from uncomplicated to perforated appendicitis. The advent of laparoscopic surgery and the low threshold for operative intervention have led to a risk of high negative appendicectomy rates with unnecessary surgery related morbidity. Only 20% of patients present with complicated appendicitis, and non-operative management with antibiotics and supportive treatment has been explored as a therapeutic option for patients with early uncomplicated appendicitis, with resolution in most of them. Antibiotic treatment was often considered as a bridge to surgery in patients with suspected appendicitis but no clear indications for appendicectomy such as signs of perforation or peritonitis. However, the routine use of antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis was not well supported, owing to inherent pitfalls in the quality and design of individual studies. The role of antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated appendicitis may have been overlooked mainly on the basis of tradition rather than evidence, considering that other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes such as colonic diverticulitis are primarily managed non-operatively.

This time honoured practice has been challenged recently with reports of less morbidity associated with antibiotic treatment than surgery in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. With the availability of diagnostic modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasonography, the small group of patients presenting with complicated appendicitis can be identified. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that despite the increasing trend for surgical exploration for suspected appendicitis over the years, the incidence of perforated appendicitis has been similar across all age groups. However, the management of the large majority with uncomplicated appendicitis warrants further evaluation.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the trials, including a Cochrane review comparing antibiotic treatment and appendicectomy, published in recent years summarised the evidence as either in favour of antibiotic treatment or inconclusive. This could possibly result from inclusion of trials with poor methods or retracted since publication, or from simplifying the evidence as a summary of both randomised and non-randomised studies. The meta-analysis presented here provides a valid and up to date summary of the relevant literature, including a recently published randomised controlled trial of 339 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis. It excludes the study that has been retracted subsequent to publication, as well as another for which it was not clear if patients were randomised. The aim of this meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was to compare antibiotic treatment with appendicectomy for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, with particular reference to safety and efficacy.

### Ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole is superior to cefoxitin alone in the management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children: results from a multicenter collaborative comparative effectiveness study [^f5df3233]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare rates of surgical site infection between the 2 most commonly utilized narrow-spectrum antibiotic regimens in children with uncomplicated appendicitis (ceftriaxone with metronidazole and cefoxitin alone).

Summary Of Background Data

Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have been found to be equivalent to extended-spectrum (antipseudomonal) agents in preventing surgical site infection (SSI) in children with uncomplicated appendicitis. The comparative effectiveness of different narrow-spectrum agents has not been reported.

Methods

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study using clinical data from the Pediatric National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Appendectomy Collaborative Pilot database merged with antibiotic utilization data from the Pediatric Health Information System database from January 2013 to June 2015. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare outcomes between antibiotic treatment groups after adjusting for patient characteristics, surrogate measures of disease severity, and clustering of outcomes within hospitals.

Results

Eight hundred forty-six patients from 14 hospitals were included in the final study cohort with an overall SSI rate of 1.3%. A total of 56.0% of patients received ceftriaxone with metronidazole (hospital range: 0%-100%) and 44.0% received cefoxitin (range: 0%-100%). In the multivariable model, ceftriaxone with metronidazole was associated with a 90% reduction in the odds of a SSI compared to cefoxitin [0.2% vs 2.7%; odds ratio: 0.10 (95% confidence interval 0.02–0.60); P = 0.01].

Conclusions

Ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole is superior to cefoxitin alone in preventing SSIs in children with uncomplicated appendicitis.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^31c0fe34]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Other limitations included insufficient follow‐up in all of the included studies. The rate of recurrent appendicitis was approximately 23 per cent during the first year; it is unknown how much this rate might rise with longer follow‐up. Similarly, introducing broad‐spectrum antibiotics to a large patient population carries the risk of worsening antibiotic resistance. It could be argued that antibiotics should be reserved for patients with a definitive diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis.

Despite the limitations of the available studies, they provide valuable evidence regarding the outcomes of antibiotic first versus immediate surgery for acute non‐perforated appendicitis. The trade‐off between the antibiotic‐first approach – potentially 3 per cent fewer major complications, 7 per cent fewer minor complications, 4 days' shorter sick leave and 92 per cent fewer appendicectomies in the first month – must be balanced against the disadvantages: a 23 per cent recurrence rate within 1 year and slightly longer hospital stay (half a day). Patients averse to surgery are likely to choose an initial trial of antibiotics; those averse to the possibility of recurrence may prefer immediate appendicectomy. Ensuring that the decision is consistent with patients' values and preferences requires shared decision‐making 40.

### Five-year follow-up of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis… [^fef1e3ee]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

However, appendicitis could have recurred in those patients, so the important unanswered question is what were the long-term outcomes for these patients. This study reports the 5-year outcomes for all the patients enrolled in the original Appendicitis Acuta trial. Briefly, the initial APPAC trial was a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical noninferiority trial conducted from November 2009 to June 2012 in Finland involving 530 patients aged 18 to 60 years with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Following CT confirmation for the presence of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, patients were randomized to receive either appendectomy or antibiotic treatment with intravenous ertapenem sodium for 3 days, followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin and metronidazole. Vons et al, 4 randomly assigned 119 patients to surgery and 122 to receive amoxicillin and clavulanic acid after the diagnosis of appendicitis was made by CT scan.

This study differed from APPAC by including patients with complicated appendicitis and those having appendicoliths. Also, the antibiotic used in the Vons study4 was suboptimal for the treatment of serious intraabdominal infection. Thus, APPAC is not directly comparable to prior studies of antibiotic treatment of appendicitis, 2, 4, 8–11 but is more reflective of contemporary approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis. Prior studies of antibiotic treatment of appendicitis have found an association between appendicolith and appendicitis recurrence. 4, 12 Because of this association, patients assessed for eligibility in the APPAC trial were excluded if CT imaging showed an appendicolith. Prior studies regarding appendicolith were not powered to definitively establish the relationship between appendicoliths and appendicitis recurrence when appendicitis is treated with antibiotics. This warrants further study.

In fact, when appendicitis was first described, its existence was supported, in part, by observation in autopsy studies that appendicitis could spontaneously resolve. 1, 14 That appendicitis can resolve with no treatment was recently shown in a randomized trial by Park et al, 15 in which 121 patients with acute CT-confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis received a 4-day course of antibiotic treatment with cefmetazole and metronidazole compared with a group of 124 patients who were observed with no antibiotics or surgery.

### Appendectomy or not? An update on the evidence for antibiotics only versus surgery for the treatment of acute appendicitis in children [^5f33e545]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Appendicitis is a common diagnosis in children being evaluated in the emergency department. After diagnosis, standard treatment has been surgical appendectomy; however, in recent years there is a growing body of evidence evaluating the possibility of nonoperative management in both children and adults. This review will present the current state of the pediatric literature that suggests patients may be successfully treated with antibiotics alone (ie, without surgery), but that a proportion of these patients will have recurrent appendicitis. Given that the literature regarding the option of antibiotic-only management compared with surgery is not yet definitive, there are many factors for providers to discuss with families and patients when considering treatment for acute appendicitis.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^e4e16fb5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is outpatient management with hospital discharge within 24 hours safe among adults receiving antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis?

Findings

In this cohort study, which is a secondary analysis of the Comparison of Outcomes of Antibiotic Drugs and Appendectomy trial, that included 726 participants randomized to receive antibiotics, 46% who were judged to meet stability criteria and were discharged within 24 hours had less than 1 serious adverse event per 100 participants through 7 days. Along with subsequent appendectomies, serious adverse events occurred no more frequently in these patients than among hospitalized patients.

Meaning

These findings support that outpatient antibiotic management is safe for selected adults with acute appendicitis and should be included in shared decision-making discussions of patient preferences for outcomes associated with nonoperative and operative care.

### Antibiotic therapy versus appendectomy for acute appendicitis: a meta-analysis [^1b0841b5]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment has been shown to be effective in treating selected patients with acute appendicitis, and three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of antibiotic therapy alone with that of surgery for acute appendicitis. The purpose of this meta-analysis of RCTs was to assess the outcomes with these two therapeutic modalities.

Methods

All RCTs comparing antibiotic therapy alone with surgery in patients over 18 years of age with suspected acute appendicitis were included. Patients with suspected perforated appendix or peritonitis, and those with an allergy to antibiotics had been excluded in the RCTs. The outcome measures studied were complications, length of hospital stay, and readmissions.

Results

Meta-analysis of RCTs of antibiotic therapy versus surgery showed a trend toward a reduced risk of complications in the antibiotic-treated group [RR (95%CI): 0.43 (0.16, 1.18) p = 0.10], without prolonging the length of hospital stay [mean difference (inverse variance, random, 95% CI): 0.11 (-0.22, 0.43) p = 0.53]. Of the 350 patients randomized to the antibiotic group, 238 (68%) were treated successfully with antibiotics alone and 38 (15%) were readmitted. The remaining 112 (32%) patients randomized to antibiotic therapy crossed over to surgery for a variety of reasons. At 1 year, 200 patients in the antibiotic group remained asymptomatic.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that although antibiotics may be used as primary treatment for selected patients with suspected uncomplicated appendicitis, this is unlikely to supersede appendectomy at present. Selection bias and crossover to surgery in the RCTs suggest that appendectomy is still the gold standard therapy for acute appendicitis.

### A simple and more cost-effective antibiotic regimen for perforated appendicitis [^1e9a05f6]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Appendicitis is the most common abdominal emergency in children. When perforation is encountered, postoperative management is grounded upon the use of intravenous antibiotics. The 3-drug regimen of ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin has long been the accepted standard by pediatric surgeons. Although effective and seemingly inexpensive, this regimen produces a cumbersome dosing schedule, which has inspired the search for a simpler regimen that does not compromise efficacy or expense. To this end, we have introduced a 2-drug regimen of ceftriaxone and Flagyl (Pharmacia Corporation, Chicago, Ill) with once-a-day dosing.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of the most recent 250 patients treated at our institution with perforated appendicitis. Patients treated since the implementation of this 2-drug regimen were compared with the recent historical cohort treated with triple antibiotic coverage. Parameters analyzed between the 2 groups included temperature curves for the first 5 postoperative days, abscess rate, length of hospitalization, length of intravenous antibiotic treatment, and medication charges.

Results

The 2-drug regimen was used in 57 patients (group 1) compared with 193 patients treated with triple antibiotic coverage (group 2). Maximum recorded temperature between the 2 groups was similar upon admission, but the mean maximum temperature in group 1 became significantly lower than group 2 from postoperative day 1 onward (P < .001). Postoperatively, an abscess developed in 8.8% of group 1 compared with 14.2% of group 2, which was not significantly different (P = 0.37). Mean length of stay was 6.8 days in group 1 and 7.8 days in group 2 (P = 0.03). Medication charges to the patient were 81.32 dollars per day in group 1 compared with 318.53 dollars per day in group 2, translating to 1186.05 dollars savings for 5 days.

Conclusions

Once-a-day dosing with ceftriaxone and Flagyl provides adequate antibiotic coverage for the postoperative management of perforated appendicitis in children. This regimen allows patients to more rapidly defervesce compared with traditional triple antibiotic coverage; moreover, this simple regimen provides substantial advantages for administration and expense.

### Randomized clinical trial of antibiotic therapy versus appendicectomy as primary treatment of acute appendicitis in unselected patients [^b0cbcdf6]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A trial in selected men suggested that antibiotic therapy could be an alternative to appendicectomy in appendicitis. This study aimed to evaluate antibiotic therapy in unselected men and women with acute appendicitis.

Methods

Consecutive patients were allocated to study (antibiotics) or control (surgery) groups according to date of birth. Study patients received intravenous antibiotics for 24 h and continued at home with oral antibiotics for 10 days. Control patients had a standard appendicectomy. Follow-up at 1 and 12 months was carried out according to intention and per protocol.

Results

Study and control patients were comparable at inclusion; 106 (52.5 per cent) of 202 patients allocated to antibiotics completed the treatment and 154 (92.2 per cent) of 167 patients allocated to appendicectomy had surgery. Treatment efficacy was 90.8 per cent for antibiotic therapy and 89.2 per cent for surgery. Recurrent appendicitis occurred in 15 patients (13.9 per cent) after a median of 1 year. A third of recurrences appeared within 10 days and two-thirds between 3 and 16 months after hospital discharge. Minor complications were similar between the groups. Major complications were threefold higher in patients who had an appendicectomy (P < 0.050).

Conclusion

Antibiotic treatment appears to be a safe first-line therapy in unselected patients with acute appendicitis.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^2888e5bd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

What is the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy?

Statement 34

In the setting of uncomplicated acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis post-operative antimicrobial therapy is not necessary (Recommendation 1A).

In the event of uncomplicated IAIs, the infection involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum. When the source of infection is treated effectively by surgical excision, post-operative antimicrobial therapy is not necessary, as demonstrated in managing uncomplicated acute appendicitis or cholecystitis.

Statement 35

In patients with IAIs, when patients are not severely ill and when source control is complete, a short course (3–5 days) of post-operative therapy is suggested (Recommendation 1A).

Recently, a prospective study on appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy was published. The study randomized 518 patients with IAIs and adequate source control to receive antibiotics until 2 days after the resolution of fever, leukocytosis, and ileus, with a maximum of 10 days of therapy (control group), or to receive a fixed course of antibiotics (experimental group) for 4 ± 1 calendar days.

In patients with intra-abdominal infections who had undergone an adequate source control procedure, the outcomes after fixed-duration antibiotic therapy (approximately 4 days) were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics (approximately 8 days) that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. In this study, most patients were not severely ill.

Statement 36

In patients with ongoing or persistent IAIs, the decision to continue, revise, or stop antimicrobial therapy should be made on the basis of clinician judgment and laboratory information (Recommendation 1 A).

The high mortality associated with abdominal sepsis requires clinicians to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion of treatment failure and the early diagnosis of ongoing infections. These patients should always be monitored carefully including the potential use of inflammatory response markers.

The most studied biomarkers in clinical settings are the acute phase proteins (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT).

### A prospective, multi centre, randomized clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of ertapenem 3 days versus ampicillin-sulbactam 3 days in the treatment of localized community acquired intra-abdominal infection. (T.E. A. study: three days ertapenem vs three days ampicillin-sulbactam) [^30513980]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The recommendations outlined in the latest guidelines published by the Surgical Infection Society (SIS) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) regarding the proper duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with intra-abdominal infections are limited and non-specific According to these guidelines, an "antimicrobial therapy for established infections should be continued until resolution of clinical signs of infection occurs, including normalization of temperature and WBC count and return of gastrointestinal function".

Such ambiguity is primarily attributable to the lack of clinical trials conducted on the topic of the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy.

These vague guidelines have manifested themselves in clinical practice; in most trials for antibiotic therapy, a fixed period ranging from 5 to 14 days is used for all patients presenting with community-acquired intra-abdominal infection, irrespective of severity of the peritonitis.

It should be noted that secondary peritonitis encompasses several different diseases and, as such, its severity has been known vary significantly.

It has been demonstrated that most patients enrolled in trials involving antibiotic treatment of IAI present with a mild form of the acute illness, which in 35–55% (and, in some studies, up to 70%) of cases is represented by acute appendicitis. It should also be noted that many patients do not suffer from a fully developed and widely spread infection but rather experience a localized infection or simple contamination.

This means that many patients receive superfluous and unnecessary antibiotic treatments. Many non-random trials demonstrated that, by tailoring the duration of the antibiotic therapy to the extent of the infection as assessed during surgery, the same clinical results could be obtained in all groups of treated patients without the use of excessive antibiotic treatment regimens. A recent systematic meta-analysis of twenty-eight studies on the duration of antibiotic therapy in cases of advanced pediatric appendicitis demonstrated that limiting the duration of antibiotic use to only 3 days was not associated with higher rates of intra-abdominal abscesses or wound infection.

### Amoxycillin / clavulanic acid monotherapy in complicated paediatric appendicitis: good enough? [^09477fea]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic choice for complicated appendicitis should be based on both microbiological effectiveness as well as ease of administration and cost especially in lower resourced settings. Data is limited on comparative morbidity outcomes for antibiotics with similar microbiological spectrum of activity. Incidence and morbidity of surgical site infection after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis was assessed after protocol change from triple antibiotic (ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole) regimen to single agent (amoxycillin/clavulanic acid).

Methods

Surgical site infection (SSI) rate, relook surgery rate and length of hospital stay were retrospectively compared in patients treated for acute appendicitis preceding (2014, 2015; "triple-therapy, TT") and following (2017, 2018; "single agent, SA") antibiotic protocol change.

Results

The rate of complicated appendicitis was similar between groups; 72.6% in TT and 66% in SA (p = 0.239). Significantly, SSI occurred in 22.7% of the SA group compared to 13.3% in TT group (OR 1.920, 95% CI 1.000–3.689, p = 0.048). Use of laparoscopy increased from 31% in TT to 89% in SA, but with subgroup analysis this was not associated with increased SSI (17.3% in open and 20.6% in laparoscopic; OR 0.841, 95% CI 0.409–1.728, p = 0.637). Relook rate (OR 1.444, 95% CI 0.595–3.507, p = 0.093) length of hospital stay (U = 6859, z = -1.163, p = 0.245), and ICU admission (U = 7683, z = 0.634 p = 0.522) were equivocal. Neither group had mortalities.

Conclusions

Despite increased SSI with SA, overall morbidity relating to ICU admission, relook rate and length of hospital stay was similar in both groups. More prospective research is required to confirm equivalent overall morbidity and that single agent therapy is more cost-effective with acceptable clinical outcomes.

Antibiotic therapy

13 Should the pre-operative antibiotic therapy be recommended before appendectomy in elderly patients?

The rationale of pre-operative antibiotics in acute appendicitis is to reduce and prevent the formation of abdominal abscess and the superficial wound infections rate, similarly to elective surgery. Several studies investigated the issue, but no specific data to elderly patients are available in literature. A meta-analysis including 9576 patients demonstrated that the administration of pre-operative broad-spectrum antibiotics, when compared to no antibiotics, reduced significantly the rate of intra-abdominal abscess and surgical site infection rate. Despite the absence of data dedicated to elderly that forced to downgrade the level of evidences from high to moderate, after the discussion, we decide to make a strong recommendation to use pre-operative antibiotics, due to the large beneficial effect compared to the very low potential harm of the treatment and the extremely unlikelihood that a study dedicated to elderly patients could vary the outcome.

Statement 13. We recommend pre-operative broad-spectrum antibiotics in elderly patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidences).
14 Should post-operative antibiotic therapy be recommended in elderly patients with acute appendicitis?

The issue of the post-operative antibiotic therapy in intra-abdominal infections and appendicitis is largely debated and studied, with several researches published, but no specific data on elderly patients are available.

International guidelines on intra-abdominal infections recommend no post-operative antibiotics in non-complicated intra-abdominal infections; according to these indications, the guidelines about acute appendicitis in general population confirm the recommendation to not continue antibiotics post-operatively when an adequate and effective source control has been obtained.

The recommendation was based on several researches and studies; Mui and colleagues randomised patients with non-complicated acute appendicitis to receive only pre-operative, short course or 5 days of antimicrobials: They found that the duration of therapy did not affect the rate of post-operative infections and morbidity. The meta-analysis by Andersen and colleagues demonstrated that, in acute appendicitis, the same outcomes (similar post-operative infection rate) were obtained when no post-operative antibiotics were administrated compared with post-operative therapy. Similarly, in acute cholecystitis, two studies demonstrated that post-operative antibiotic therapy in non-complicated setting, did not reduce the post-operative infection rate.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^a5d7bf30]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The most common total intravenous and oral antibiotic duration was 7 to 10 days. Four trials (12%) used only a 4-day duration. The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy trial demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for a median of 4 days (i.e. 2 days after symptom resolution) resulted in similar outcomes as treatment for a median of 8 days among patients with intra-abdominal infection. As opposed to conservative management of appendicitis, all patients in the Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy trial had source control. However, among studies of nonoperative treatment of appendicitis, lower initial antibiotic response rates did not appear to be associated with shorter treatment duration, suggesting a shorter antibiotic course may be possible.

Guidelines do not recommend broad-spectrum regimens with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing bacteria for patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired infections unless antimicrobial resistance risk factors exist, such as recent antimicrobial exposure, past infection with a resistant strain, or high prevalence of resistance in the patient's community or in recent areas of travel. Several trials used broad-spectrum regimens such as piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem. which are discouraged by guidelines to promote antibiotic stewardship.

A major limitation of most past trials is absence of any specific pain control protocol or description of the extent to which pain control was achieved. Persistent or worsening symptoms were consistent criteria for transition to appendectomy, and inadequate analgesia could confound evaluation of antibiotic effectiveness. Related pain management research and guidelines may inform optimal care. For example, concern about masking findings of rupture during antibiotic treatment may cause providers to undertreat pain. However, it has been established that pain control for suspected appendicitis can be achieved safely, including with opiates if necessary, without adversely affecting diagnostic accuracy or obscuring findings of peritonitis. Preappendectomy NSAID administration has been demonstrated safe and opiate sparing. Multimodal analgesia, using acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opiates, and scheduled as opposed to as needed administration, have been shown to optimize analgesia effectiveness. Therefore, a scheduled oral or parenteral NSAID, as was used in a few trials, and/or acetaminophen, and as needed opiates to control pain while treating with antibiotics can be expected to optimize pain control and limit unnecessary opiate use.

Acute appendicitis

The appendectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. Antibiotic therapy is a safe means of primary treatment for patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but this conservative approach is less effective in the long-term due to significant recurrence rates. (Recommendation 1A).

Although the standard treatment for acute appendicitis has historically been the appendectomy, the medical community has recently seen a notable increase in the use of antibiotic therapy as a primary means of treatment.

Several meta-analyses have been published overviewing a series of randomized trials comparing antibiotic therapy to appendectomies for acute uncomplicated appendicitis (cases without abscesses or phlegmon).

Although non-operative, antibioitic-mediated treatments of uncomplicated appendicitis are associated with significantly fewer complications, more manageable pain control, and shorter patient sick leave, this conservative approach features high rates of recurrence and is therefore inferior to the traditional appendectomy.

Considering that only a small number of RCTs of poor methodological quality are currently available, well-designed RCTs are required to better assess the effects of an antibiotic-based approach in conservative treatments of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

Given this controversy, the appendectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. Non-operative antibiotic treatment may be used as an alternative treatment for specific patients for whom surgery is contraindicated.

Both open and laparoscopic appendectomies are viable approaches to surgical treatment of acute appendicitis (Recommendation 1A).

Several randomized trials have compared the diagnostic and therapeutic advantages of laparoscopic and conventional open appendectomies in the treatment of acute appendicitis.

While the trials demonstrated a reduction in wound infections for the laparoscopic appendectomy group, they also exhibited a threefold increase in intra-abdominal abscesses.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^9c0d7058]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses and a recent guideline acknowledge that conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics can be successful for patients who wish to avoid surgery. However, guidance as to specific management does not exist.

Methods

PUBMED and EMBASE search of trials describing methods of conservative treatment was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Results

Thirty-four studies involving 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants were identified. The greatest experience with conservative treatment is in persons 5 to 50 years of age. In most trials, imaging was used to confirm localized appendicitis without evidence of abscess, phlegmon, or tumor. Antibiotics regimens were generally consistent with intra-abdominal infection treatment guidelines and used for a total of 7 to 10 days. Approaches ranged from 3-day hospitalization on parenteral agents to same-day hospital or ED discharge of stable patients with outpatient oral antibiotics. Minimum time allowed before response was evaluated varied from 8 to 72 hours. Although pain was a common criterion for nonresponse and appendectomy, analgesic regimens were poorly described. Trials differed in use of other response indicators, that is, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and reimaging. Diet ranged from restriction for 48 hours to as tolerated. Initial response rates were generally greater than 90% and most participants improved by 24 to 48 hours, with no related severe sepsis or deaths. In most studies, appendectomy was recommended for recurrence; however, in several, patients had antibiotic retreatment with success.

Conclusion

While further investigation of conservative treatment is ongoing, patients considering this approach should be advised and managed according to study methods and related guidelines to promote informed shared decision-making and optimize their chance of similar outcomes as described in published trials. Future studies that address biases associated with enrollment and response evaluation, employ best-practice pain control and antibiotic selection, better define cancer risk, and explore longer time thresholds for response, minimized diet restriction and hospital stays, and antibiotic re-treatment will further our understanding of the potential effectiveness of conservative management.

### Diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^f6e7896c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Appendicitis management — uncomplicated versus complicated cases involves differing strategies, with multicenter trials such as the Appendicitis acuta (APPAC) trial reporting antibiotic only treatment to be safe and effective in adults with first episode uncomplicated appendicitis and similar, albeit more limited, data in children; while approximately 90% of patients in these studies were able to avoid initial surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis, recurrence was estimated to be roughly 20–30% at 5-year follow-up, so it is commonly suggested that treatment options should be presented to the patient, allowing for shared decision-making. Patients with complicated appendicitis are often treated based on clinical presentation, with some trialed on antibiotic treatment while others undergo immediate surgical intervention; if treated nonoperatively, many surgeons recommend interval appendectomy, but approaches vary and are not universally agreed upon. Operative approach and post-operative management also vary, with questions persisting regarding timing of operation, drain placement during surgery for complicated appendicitis, suction versus suction and lavage for perforated appendicitis, and the duration of postoperative antibiotics; because treatment can be drastically different between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis, selecting the optimal imaging modality to differentiate between them is critical.

### Appendicectomy versus antibiotics for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children: an open-label, international, multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^ffd32ec3]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Support for the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with non-operative management rather than surgery has been increasing in the literature. We aimed to investigate whether treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics in children is inferior to appendicectomy by comparing failure rates for the two treatments.

Methods

In this pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group, unmasked, randomised, non-inferiority trial, children aged 5–16 years with suspected non-perforated appendicitis (based on clinical diagnosis with or without radiological diagnosis) were recruited from 11 children's hospitals in Canada, the USA, Finland, Sweden, and Singapore. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the antibiotic or the appendicectomy group with an online stratified randomisation tool, with stratification by sex, institution, and duration of symptoms (≥ 48 h vs < 48 h). The primary outcome was treatment failure within 1 year of random assignment. In the antibiotic group, failure was defined as removal of the appendix, and in the appendicectomy group, failure was defined as a normal appendix based on pathology. In both groups, failure was also defined as additional procedures related to appendicitis requiring general anaesthesia. Interim analysis was done to determine whether inferiority was to be declared at the halfway point. We used a non-inferiority design with a margin of 20%. All outcomes were assessed in participants with 12-month follow-up data. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02687464).

Findings

Between Jan 20, 2016, and Dec 3, 2021, 936 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to appendicectomy (n = 459) or antibiotics (n = 477). At 12-month follow-up, primary outcome data were available for 846 (90%) patients. Treatment failure occurred in 153 (34%) of 452 patients in the antibiotic group, compared with 28 (7%) of 394 in the appendicectomy group (difference 26.7%, 90% CI 22.4–30.9). All but one patient meeting the definition for treatment failure with appendicectomy were those with negative appendicectomies. Of those who underwent appendicectomy in the antibiotic group, 13 (8%) had normal pathology. There were no deaths or serious adverse events in either group. The relative risk of having a mild-to-moderate adverse event in the antibiotic group compared with the appendicectomy group was 4.3 (95% CI 2.1–8.7; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Based on cumulative failure rates and a 20% non-inferiority margin, antibiotic management of non-perforated appendicitis was inferior to appendicectomy.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^3067a5cc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Acute Appendicitis

Acute appendicitis is the most common intra-abdominal condition requiring emergency surgery.

The Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have generated guidelines for the management and treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections on 2010.

Operative intervention for acute, non-perforated appendicitis is the treatment of choice. Non-operative management of patients with acute, non-perforated appendicitis can be considered if there is a marked improvement in the patient's condition prior to operation (Recommendation 1 A).

Antibiotic treatment has been shown to be effective in treating selected patients with acute appendicitis. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of antibiotic therapy alone with that of surgery for acute appendicitis. A meta-analysis of these RCTs concluded that while antibiotics may be useful as primary treatment for selected patients, antibiotics are unlikely to replace appendectomy at present. Selection bias and crossover to surgery in the RCTs suggest that appendectomy is still the gold standard therapy for acute appendicitis. A support for a less emergent approach comes from clinical trials analyzing time to perforation, which indicate this to be an unusual early event.

Both open and laparoscopic approaches to appendectomy are appropriate (Recommendation 1 A).

A systematic review that included 45 randomized trials compared the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of laparoscopic and conventional open appendectomy in the treatment of suspected acute appendicitis. The most consistent findings were an approximately 50% reduction in wound infections but a threefold increase in intra-abdominal abscesses in the laparoscopic appendectomy group. However, subsequently, two large studies have shown that patients undergoing a laparoscopic technique were more likely to be readmitted within 28 days of surgery and that the risk for a complication was higher in the laparoscopic appendectomy group with uncomplicated appendicitis. Taken together, open appendectomy may be preferred, although laparoscopic appendectomy is useful in selected subgroups of patients. Use of either approach should be decided by the surgeon's expertise. The laparoscopic approach is useful for obese patients, elderly patients and patients whose diagnosis is uncertain, especially women of childbearing age.

### Antibiotics versus appendicectomy in the management of acute appendicitis: an ongoing debate [^81fa390a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Opinion

The management of acute appendicitis has traditionally followed a surgical approach, however there has been much recent debate regarding the potential use of antibiotics not only as a bridge to surgery but as a mainstay of treatment. The initial evidence has been limited and is of poor quality, with a general consensus that appendicectomy remains the current gold standard for the management of acute appendicitis, a finding that has been echoed in a number of more recent reviews into this topic including an earlier review by Varadhan et al (2010). Indeed, the main difference between their previous paper and this current paper is the inclusion of an additional randomized controlled trial by Vons et al. A key point to elicit from that paper was that 21 patients (18%) of those randomized to undergo appendicectomy were found at surgery to have complicated appendicitis with peritonitis, despite an earlier CT scan diagnosing uncomplicated appendicitis.

By simply assessing the pathway of treatment for the antibiotic group in the Varadhan et al (2012) paper, significant disadvantages to antibiotic treatment have been demonstrated. 21% of patients (93 / 438) treated with antibiotics crossed over to surgery and underwent appendicectomy, with 10 of those patients demonstrating a perforation and 12 of those patients demonstrating a gangrenous appendix. In addition, 20% of patients (68 / 345) were readmitted to hospital following initial antibiotic treatment with 65 of these patients proceeding to appendicectomy and 20% of those had either a perforated or gangrenous appendix. In the setting of modern surgical practice with such a common intra-abdominal pathology, recurrence and complication rates of this magnitude are unacceptable. With the additional utilization of laparoscopy to aid diagnosis and offer a treatment option, thus reducing the need for radiological imaging with the associated risks, and based on the current evidence, it is clear that antibiotics do not have a role in the primary management of appendicitis at present. It is important to note that Varadhan et al (2012) refer to uncomplicated appendicitis, however, as described earlier, Vons et al (2011) have shown that even CT imaging can fail to appropriately delineate complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis in up to 1 in 5 patients.

Consequently, we continue to propose that the current evidence does not support the routine use of antibiotics as the mainstay of treatment of acute appendicitis and that appendicectomy remains the current gold standard. Despite this, we continue to advocate that definitive evaluation through an appropriately conducted randomized controlled trial should be undertaken to comprehensively examine the optimal management of such a common intra-abdominal pathology.

### The current management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: should there be a change in paradigm? A systematic review of the literatures and analysis of treatment performance [^7327efba]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Hansson et al. published their study in 2009. The diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis was based on clinical grounds with or without the use of imaging studies. This study adopted an unclassical method of subject randomization; using the date of birth of patients, with uneven date being the NOM group. This resulted in a huge difference in the number of subjects among the two groups and resulted in high selection bias. Furthermore, the study had a high crossover rate from the NOM arm to the appendectomy arm. Nearly half of the patients (96 out of 202) assigned to NOM were crossed over to surgery because of either surgeons' preference or patients' request. Besides, only less than half of the patients in the NOM group were followed up one year later. The rate of recurrence in patients treated with NOM was therefore likely underestimated. The study suggested that NOM was a safe alternative to appendectomy. However, the aforementioned factors made the trial less reliable.

Turhan et al. published their result in 2009. This study specified itself as a randomized control trial. Nevertheless, the randomization process was not clearly stated. This might result in potential bias. The diagnosis of uncomplicated acute appendicitis was confirmed by either ultrasonography or computed tomography.

The study published by Vons et al. involved patients from six hospitals. Vons et al. used clearly defined diagnostic criteria with the aid of high quality CT scan to confirm the diagnoses in the study. Despite this, there was still an incidence of 18% for perforated appendicitis on upfront surgery. Randomization method and the results of the trials were well documented. The study also evaluated the risk factors associated with the absence of improvement of appendicitis in the NOM group. Despite no multivariate regression performed, fever at initial presentation, high presenting serum C-reactive protein level and intraluminal fecolith, were likely predictors for poor response to NOM. The antibiotics of choice in the NOM group in this study was amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, with an initial failure rate of 11.7%, which was relatively high compared to other studies. This might be explained by the fact that, Escherichia coli, being the most common bacterial isolates from patients with acute appendicitis, have a high percentage of resistance to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. This regime is currently not recommended for the treatment of acute appendicitis.

### Patient preferences for surgery or antibiotics for the treatment of acute appendicitis [^b727a1c3]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Studies have compared surgical with nonsurgical therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, but none of these studies have a patient-centered perspective.

Objectives

To evaluate how patients might choose between surgical and nonsurgical therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis and to identify targets to make antibiotic treatment more appealing.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study comprised an online survey and an in-person sensitivity analysis survey. For the web survey, a convenience sample of 1728 respondents were asked to imagine that they or their child had acute uncomplicated appendicitis, provided information about laparoscopic and open appendectomy and antibiotic treatment alone, and asked which treatment they might choose. The web survey was open from April 17, 2016, through June 16, 2016, and was disseminated via email link, a poster with a Quick Response code, and social media. For the sensitivity analysis, 220 respondents were given the same scenario and options. Those who chose surgery were asked whether certain factors influenced their decision; each factor was incrementally improved during questioning about whether respondents would consider switching to antibiotics. These participants were recruited at public venues from June 3, 2016, to July 31, 2016. Web survey data were analyzed from June 17, 2016, to September 21, 2017. Sensitivity analysis data were analyzed from August 1, 2016, to September 21, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment preferences.

Results

Among the 1728 web survey respondents, 1225 (70.9%) were female and 500 (28.9%) were male (3 [0.2%] either did not answer or responded as "gender fluid" within the comments section of the survey), and most self-reported being between 50 and 59 years of age (391 [22.6%]) and being non-Hispanic white (1563 [90.5%]). For themselves, 1482 respondents (85.8%) chose laparoscopic appendectomy, 84 (4.9%) chose open appendectomy, and 162 (9.4%) chose antibiotics alone. For their child, 1372 respondents (79.4%) chose laparoscopic appendectomy, 106 (6.1%) open appendectomy, and 250 (14.5%) antibiotics alone. Respondents were somewhat more likely to choose antibiotics for themselves if they had education beyond college (105 [12.6%]; P < .001), identified as other than non-Hispanic white (24 [14.9%]; P < .001), or did not know anyone who had previously been hospitalized (12 [15.8%]; P = 0.02), but they were less likely to choose antibiotics if they were surgeons (11 [5.4%]; P = 0.008). Of the 220 participants interviewed for the sensitivity analysis, 120 (54.5%) were female and 100 (45.5%) were male, and most self-reported being between 18 and 24 years of age (53 [24.1%]) and being non-Hispanic white (204 [92.7%]). Their responses suggested that improvements in the short- and long-term failure rate of antibiotic treatment-rather than reductions in the duration of hospitalization or antibiotic treatment-were more likely to increase the desirability of choosing antibiotics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most patients may choose surgical intervention over antibiotics alone in treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis, but a meaningful number may choose nonoperative management. Therefore, from a patient-centered perspective, this option should be discussed with patients, and future research could be directed at reducing the failure and recurrence rates of antibiotic treatment for appendicitis.

### T.E. A. study: three-day ertapenem versus three-day ampicillin-sulbactam [^fae86166]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-abdominal infections are one of the most common infections encountered by a general surgeon. These infections are difficult to diagnose in their early stages and effective treatment is equally challenging. Ertapenem and Ampicillin-Sulbactam are both recommended as single agent treatments to address localized peritonitis by the SIS (Surgical Infections Society) and the IDSA (Infection Diseases Society of America). According to these guidelines, "an antimicrobial therapy for established infections should be continued until resolution of clinical signs of infection occurs, including normalization of temperature and white blood cell count and return to gastrointestinal function". The ambiguity of these guidelines is the result of a distinct lack of clinical trials investigating the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy. Consequently, in most trials involving antibiotic therapy, an arbitrarily fixed period ranging from 5 to 14 days is used for all patients with intra-abdominal infections, irrespective of the severity of peritonitis. Most patients enrolled in trials involving intra-abdominal infections present with mild peritonitis and acute appendicitis. Furthermore, most cases feature localized infections or simple contamination. These patients often receive superfluous antibiotic treatment. A meta-analysis of twenty-eight studies investigating the duration of antibiotic treatment in cases of advanced pediatric appendicitis demonstrated that limiting the duration of antibiotic treatment to three days was not associated with a higher rate of abdominal abscesses or wound infection. A randomized study demonstrated that shorter duration of Ertapenem therapy is as effective as a 5-day treatment regimen in patients with mild to moderate peritonitis. Given that overuse of antibiotics increases treatment costs, reduces clinical efficacy, and spurs the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and bacterial strains, a conservative shift in antibiotic methodology is of utmost importance.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^c57eacea]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction

Using standard pilot‐tested forms along with detailed instructions and working in teams of two, reviewers extracted data independently. A clinician–methodologist adjudicator resolved disagreements. Finally, authors were contacted to check the data for accuracy, and to provide additional information regarding the original studies, when needed.

The following data were extracted: sample size, participants' characteristics, antibiotic regimens and details of surgical management (laparoscopic or open, any antibiotic use), and the following outcomes (for both treatment groups): major complications at 1 year, including Clavien–Dindo complication classification grade III or above (conditions requiring endoscopic, radiological or surgical intervention, or causing organ dysfunction or death), such as appendiceal perforation, as well as deep infections, incisional hernias and adhesive bowel obstruction not requiring intervention; minor complications at 1 year, such as superficial wound infections, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort; confirmed or suspected recurrence of appendicitis between 1 month and 1 year; rate of appendicectomy within 1 month of intervention; duration of hospital stay; and duration of sick leave.

Risk of bias

In the risk‐of‐bias assessment, each study was evaluated using a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument 27 according to four criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and completeness of data. For each criterion, studies were judged to be at either high or low risk of bias.

### T.E. A. study: three-day ertapenem versus three-day ampicillin-sulbactam [^2e851d8d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The guidelines of the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America state that "an antimicrobial therapy for established infections should be continued until resolution of clinical signs of infection occurs, including normalization of temperature and white blood cell count and return to gastrointestinal function". These indications are limited and non-specific due to a lack of clinical trials investigating the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy. As a consequence, many studies rely on an arbitrarily determined "default" duration of antibiotic treatment without accounting for the severity of a particular infection. Many patients are therefore over-treated with superfluous antibiotic therapy, which increases therapy costs, triggers adverse side-effects, and spurs the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. This precarious situation underscores the need for clinical trials investigating the proper duration of antibiotic therapy.

The Word Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) made an additional contribution to the debate regarding proper antimicrobial drug methodology. The WSES guidelines outline the proper antimicrobial strategies to address biliary, extrabiliary, community-acquired, and hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infections. The authors maintain that arbitrarily determined "default" antibiotic regimens that do not take into account the circumstances of individual cases result in poorer patient outcomes than do scrupulously customized regimens.

The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a three-day treatment regimen of Ampicillin-Sulbactam to that of a three-day regimen of Ertapenem in patients with localized peritonitis ranging from mild to moderate severity. The authors define localized peritonitis as an infectious process that extends beyond a singularly affected viscus into the peritoneal space without involving the entire peritoneal cavity. As in many other studies, most patients presented with acute appendicitis.

### Antibiotic therapy vs appendectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: the APPAC randomized clinical trial [^91a6e147]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An increasing amount of evidence supports the use of antibiotics instead of surgery for treating patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

Objective

To compare antibiotic therapy with appendectomy in the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis confirmed by computed tomography (CT).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter, open-label, noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 2009 until June 2012 in Finland. The trial enrolled 530 patients aged 18 to 60 years with uncomplicated acute appendicitis confirmed by a CT scan. Patients were randomly assigned to early appendectomy or antibiotic treatment with a 1-year follow-up period.

Interventions

Patients randomized to antibiotic therapy received intravenous ertapenem (1 g/d) for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times per day). Patients randomized to the surgical treatment group were assigned to undergo standard open appendectomy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point for the surgical intervention was the successful completion of an appendectomy. The primary end point for antibiotic-treated patients was discharge from the hospital without the need for surgery and no recurrent appendicitis during a 1-year follow-up period.

Results

There were 273 patients in the surgical group and 257 in the antibiotic group. Of 273 patients in the surgical group, all but 1 underwent successful appendectomy, resulting in a success rate of 99.6% (95% CI, 98.0% to 100.0%). In the antibiotic group, 70 patients (27.3%; 95% CI, 22.0% to 33.2%) underwent appendectomy within 1 year of initial presentation for appendicitis. Of the 256 patients available for follow-up in the antibiotic group, 186 (72.7%; 95% CI, 66.8% to 78.0%) did not require surgery. The intention-to-treat analysis yielded a difference in treatment efficacy between groups of -27.0% (95% CI, -31.6% to ∞) (P = 0.89). Given the prespecified noninferiority margin of 24%, we were unable to demonstrate noninferiority of antibiotic treatment relative to surgery. Of the 70 patients randomized to antibiotic treatment who subsequently underwent appendectomy, 58 (82.9%; 95% CI, 72.0% to 90.8%) had uncomplicated appendicitis, 7 (10.0%; 95% CI, 4.1% to 19.5%) had complicated acute appendicitis, and 5 (7.1%; 95% CI, 2.4% to 15.9%) did not have appendicitis but received appendectomy for suspected recurrence. There were no intra-abdominal abscesses or other major complications associated with delayed appendectomy in patients randomized to antibiotic treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with CT-proven, uncomplicated appendicitis, antibiotic treatment did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority compared with appendectomy. Most patients randomized to antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis did not require appendectomy during the 1-year follow-up period, and those who required appendectomy did not experience significant complications.

### Appendectomy versus non-operative treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children: study protocol for a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^74efb6f4]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The APPY trial is based on the hypothesis that a high proportion of children with acute uncomplicated appendicitis can be successfully treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics thereby avoiding a large number of appendectomies. Previous studies of the use of antibiotics in both adults and children suggest that this is likely to be achievable. Whether non-operative treatment with antibiotics is as effective a treatment as appendectomy for this patient population, however, is a more complex question. We believe this is determined by other factors in addition to the success of the initial treatment. For this reason these parameters are included in our composite primary outcome and include incidence of complications in each group, incidence of negative appendectomy and recurrence of appendicitis.

The selection of an appropriate and relevant primary outcome is important for any RCT. Selection of a primary end point which does not reflect the interests of the stakeholder groups involved in treatment selection for a given pathology is likely to lessen the relevance and impact of a trial. For this reason it has been proposed that core outcome sets (COS) be developed. A COS is an established set of outcomes to be measured when evaluating treatment efficacy for a given condition and is usually arrived at by consensus among multiple stakeholder groups (eg, clinicians, researchers, patients/parents, treatment commissioners). The adoption of a COS will likely ensure that outcomes reported are relevant and of importance to multiple stakeholder groups. Further, use of a COS will ensure that a standardised set of outcome measures is reported as a minimum for a given pathology thereby minimising the heterogeneity in outcome reporting between studies. This will improve comparability between studies in quantitative data synthesis such as meta-analysis. Although efforts are underway to develop a COS for children with acute appendicitis, a COS does not exist at present.

Recently, WSES guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis were published

Appendectomy remains the treatment of choice also for acute appendicitis. Antibiotic therapy is a safe means of primary treatment for patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but it is less effective in the long-term due to significant recurrence rates and probably needs the certainty of a CT proven diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis (Recommendation 1A).

Antibiotics alone may be useful to treat patients with early, non-perforated appendicitis, even if there is a risk of recurrence. In the APPAC (Antibiotic Therapy versus Appendectomy for Treatment of Uncomplicated Acute Appendicitis) trial recently published in JAMA enrolling 530 patients with uncomplicated appendicitis confirmed by a CT-scan (257 antibiotic therapy, 273 appendectomy), the 1-year recurrence rate and appendectomy in the antibiotic group was reported as 27%. Although antibiotic therapy can be successful in selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, the risk of disease recurrence limits the application of this treatment strategy. Apart from this high recurrence rate, the need for additional diagnostic certainty with a CT-proven diagnosis further complicates this approach. Finally, in this era of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic overuse should be limited. For all these reasons, appendectomy has remained in international guidelines the gold-standard treatment for acute appendicitis worldwide.

### Long-term results following antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis in adults [^7b29a243]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis has gained interest and inquiries. Reports have demonstrated both safety and high resolution of symptoms and inflammation following antibiotic treatment of appendicitis, but information on long-term results is required. Our present aim was therefore to evaluate long-term recurrence rate of initial antibiotics-alone treatment for suspected acute appendicitis.

Methods

Patients with favourable response to antibiotics in earlier randomized (RCT, n = 97) and population-based (PBT, n = 342) studies as well as subsequently treated non-randomized (Non-R, n = 271) patients are evaluated for long-term risk to relapse demanding surgical appendectomy; altogether 710 patients.

Results

Clinical characteristics among randomized and non-randomized patients were similar without any statistical difference according to abdominal symptoms and degree of systemic inflammation (CRP, WCC) when antibiotic treatment started. Females and males showed the same results. The median follow-up time was 2162 days (5.92 years), and the range across highest and lowest follow-up was 3495 days (range 2–3497) for the entire group, without significant differences among subgroups (RCT, PBT, Non-R). The cumulative probability for relapse of appendicitis demanding appendectomy was: 0.09, 0.12, 0.12 and 0.13 at 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year follow-up, with a probability of 0.86 ± 0.013 without appendectomy after 8 years. This may imply an overall benefit of 60–70% by antibiotics during expected 10-year follow-up accounting for initial treatment failures at 10–23% in our published reports.

Conclusion

Antibiotic treatment is safe and effective as a first-line therapy in unselected adults with acute appendicitis with a risk around 15% for long-term relapse following favourable initial treatment response.

### Long-term results following antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis in adults [^c9b86a1b]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have earlier reported that antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis is safe and was associated with significantly less complications compared to acute surgical interventions, although conventional open appendectomy was not compared specifically to laparoscopic extirpation in our earlier trials. Previously published studies on antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis have mostly included only patients with confirmed positive imaging, which is a kind of restricted patient selection. By contrast, our previous studies included more or less unselected adult patients (> 18 years old) with "assumed appendicitis" (both complicated and uncomplicated) according to Swedish standard criteria based on anamnesis, clinical and abdominal examinations, clinical chemistry as well as imaging in patients where the clinician in charge deemed it necessary for a high probability of positive diagnosis (in 63% of all our patients). Correct diagnoses of acute appendicitis in our hospital in unselected patients are close to 90% specificity, which is a level that applications with CT scans or ultrasound in all patients do not improve under most circumstances, particularly not in acute or emergency patients. Thus, our approach to include unselected patients based on overall clinical judgments should not be regarded a weakness of our protocols. We remain strong in the view that our results reflect standard clinical conditions at least in Scandinavian countries. This conclusion is particularly supported by the fact that RCT, PBT and Non-R studies indicate similar results at follow-up, which is as good as clinical studies can provide.

The role of imaging (CT, MR, ultrasound) for positive diagnosis may well be a matter of continuous debate among clinicians, although overall diagnostics usually leave a window of uncertain opportunities between 85 and 100% specificity. We want to emphasize this fact, to avoid concerned discussions about optimized diagnosis of acute appendicitis, which is still an unsettled matter, although trained physicians usually manage to predict a correct positive diagnosis between 90 and 95%. It is also important to remind that most large hospitals may provide treatment results with negative findings of appendicitis at laparotomy for assumed acute appendicitis (false positive diagnosis) around 5–10% as reported. Thus, we have never tried to select patients, based on clinical or imaging evaluations, with signs of perforated (complicated) or non-perforated (uncomplicated) appendix before offering patients antibiotic treatments. Thus, all our patients were close to unselected, with confirmed or suspected perforations around 20–30% at subsequent appendectomies.

### Long-term results following antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis in adults [^c49dd22b]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

We have earlier published CONSORT flow sheets and inclusions of patients who started on antibiotics (n = 561) due to acute appendicitis in either randomized (RCT; n = 106) or population-based trials (PBT; n = 442). We also include unpublished subsequently treated non-randomized patients (Non-R; n = 271) with favourable initial response to antibiotics. All our patients were offered antibiotic treatment as an alternative to surgery for treatment of assumed acute appendicitis according to clinical evaluations as described and discussed elsewhere. In our published reports, all patients older than 18 years with assumed appendicitis were eligible for inclusion (RCT, PBT). Acute appendicitis was diagnosed according to established practice: the attending physician decided based on disease history, clinical status, computed tomography and gynaecological examination when deemed necessary. Patients were randomized according to birth date (RCT). Evaluation was performed according to intention to treat and per protocol. All patients with suspected appendicitis were invited to have the antibiotics-alone treatment option according to the PBT protocol; with analyses of intention to treat and per protocol as well. All our patients allocated to antibiotics could have surgery without any predetermined specification (required by ethics) if the surgeon in charge deemed it necessary; or if the patient preferred initial operations. Similarly, patients allocated to surgery could choose antibiotics as their first choice. In the RCT study, 369 patients were randomized: 202 were allocated to antibiotics and 167 to surgery; 119 patients started on antibiotics; and 250 had immediate surgery. In the PBT study, a total of 558 consecutive patients were hospitalized and treated due to acute appendicitis: Seventy-nine per cent (442) received antibiotics as their first-line therapy and 20% (n = 111) had or preferred primary surgery; 77% on primary antibiotics recovered, while 23% had subsequent appendectomy due to failed initial resolution on antibiotics. The third group (Non-R, n = 271) of included patients were informed to have antibiotic treatment by physicians in charge on the same premises when deemed reasonable according to encouraging results in our RCT and PBT studies. These patients have thus been subsequently selected from the same patient population as used for inclusion of patients to the RCT and PBT studies, but without any specific selection criteria beyond a patient offer to try antibiotics as a first-line treatment option. They were clinically judged and evaluated in the same way as patients in RCT and PBT groups.

### Five-year follow-up of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in the APPAC randomized clinical trial [^e6080994]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Short-term results support antibiotics as an alternative to surgery for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but long-term outcomes are not known.

Objective

To determine the late recurrence rate of appendicitis after antibiotic therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Five-year observational follow-up of patients in the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing appendectomy with antibiotic therapy, in which 530 patients aged 18 to 60 years with computed tomography-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis were randomized to undergo an appendectomy (n = 273) or receive antibiotic therapy (n = 257). The initial trial was conducted from November 2009 to June 2012 in Finland; last follow-up was September 6, 2017. This current analysis focused on assessing the 5-year outcomes for the group of patients treated with antibiotics alone.

Interventions

Open appendectomy vs antibiotic therapy with intravenous ertapenem for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin and metronidazole.

Main Outcomes and Measures

In this analysis, prespecified secondary end points reported at 5-year follow-up included late (after 1 year) appendicitis recurrence after antibiotic treatment, complications, length of hospital stay, and sick leave.

Results

Of the 530 patients (201 women; 329 men) enrolled in the trial, 273 patients (median age, 35 years [IQR, 27–46]) were randomized to undergo appendectomy, and 257 (median age, 33 years, [IQR, 26–47]) were randomized to receive antibiotic therapy. In addition to 70 patients who initially received antibiotics but underwent appendectomy within the first year (27.3% [95% CI, 22.0%-33.2%]; 70/256), 30 additional antibiotic-treated patients (16.1% [95% CI, 11.2%-22.2%]; 30/186) underwent appendectomy between 1 and 5 years. The cumulative incidence of appendicitis recurrence was 34.0% (95% CI, 28.2%-40.1%; 87/256) at 2 years, 35.2% (95% CI, 29.3%-41.4%; 90/256) at 3 years, 37.1% (95% CI, 31.2%-43.3%; 95/256) at 4 years, and 39.1% (95% CI, 33.1%-45.3%; 100/256) at 5 years. Of the 85 patients in the antibiotic group who subsequently underwent appendectomy for recurrent appendicitis, 76 had uncomplicated appendicitis, 2 had complicated appendicitis, and 7 did not have appendicitis. At 5 years, the overall complication rate (surgical site infections, incisional hernias, abdominal pain, and obstructive symptoms) was 24.4% (95% CI, 19.2%-30.3%) (n = 60/246) in the appendectomy group and 6.5% (95% CI, 3.8%-10.4%) (n = 16/246) in antibiotic group (P < .001), which calculates to 17.9 percentage points (95% CI, 11.7–24.1) higher after surgery. There was no difference between groups for length of hospital stay, but there was a significant difference in sick leave (11 days more for the appendectomy group).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients who were initially treated with antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis, the likelihood of late recurrence within 5 years was 39.1%. This long-term follow-up supports the feasibility of antibiotic treatment alone as an alternative to surgery for uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

### Operation versus antibiotics – the "appendicitis conundrum" continues: a meta-analysis [^9ac25a10]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis continues to constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of this study was to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nonoperative versus surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adult patients.

Methods

A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was performed with respect to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement (end-of-search date: January 29, 2017). Data on the study design, interventions, participants, and outcomes were extracted by two independent reviewers. The random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) was used to calculate pooled effect estimates when substantial heterogeneity was encountered; otherwise, the fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) model was implemented. Quality assessment of included RCTs was performed using the modified Jadad scale.

Results

Five RCTs were included in this review. Overall, 1,430 adult patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis underwent either nonoperative (n = 727) or operative management (n = 703). Treatment efficacy at 1-year follow-up was significantly lower (63.8%) for antibiotics compared with the surgery group (93%) (risk ratio [RR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–0.77; p < 0.001). Overall complications were significantly higher in the surgery group (166/703 [23.6%]) compared with the antibiotics group (56/727 [7.7%]) (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.24–0.43; p < 0.001). No difference was found between the two treatment modalities in terms of perforated appendicitis rates (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.14–1.92), length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD], 0.20; 95% CI, -0.16 to 0.56), duration of pain (WMD, 0.22; 95% CI, -5.30 to -5.73), and sick leave (WMD, -2; 95% CI, -5.2 to 1.1).

Conclusions

Conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in adults warrants further study. Addressing patients' expectations via a shared decision-making process is a crucial step in optimizing nonoperative outcomes.

### Prolonged antibiotic treatment does not prevent intra-abdominal abscesses in perforated appendicitis [^1f1cb421]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is no single evidence-based antibiotic treatment strategy for uncomplicated or perforated appendicitis, particularly because there is no indisputable evidence for any optimal antimicrobial therapy after surgery for appendicitis in children. Despite a marked decline in associated mortality during the past 50 years, perforation and complication rates remain unchanged, because they are influenced strongly by factors untouched by the intervening therapeutic advances. Scanty data exist about optimal duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment, whereas it is important to treat patients with adequate antimicrobial therapy and to avoid overtreatment.

Some authors advocate a predefined duration of antimicrobial treatment, whereas others discontinue antibiotics depending on the patient's clinical signs regardless of length of therapy. Unfortunately, studies that have investigated antibiotic regimens and included duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment as a point of interest often included children with perforated as well as gangrenous appendicitis, thereby assembling a different population, with a lower rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses. The recently published guidelines from the Therapeutic Agents Committee of the Surgical Infection Society for antimicrobial therapy in children recommend that, with respect to perforated appendicitis, treatment duration should be based on the patient's response to treatment and intravenous therapy should be continued until the patient is afebrile, has normal white blood cell counts — in brief, has no symptoms of infection left at all. However, these recommendations are partly based on studies that included children with gangrenous appendicitis. Gangrenous appendicitis is a different entity with an intact intestinal lining that should be treated by resection, with only 24 h of postoperative antibiotics. In the current study, only children with perforated appendicitis were included to narrow the spectrum of the disease and to examine the influence of antibiotic therapy in a patient population that is most prone to develop intra-abdominal abscesses. By selecting this predisposed group, we designed to enlarge the possible effects of the different antibiotic treatment protocols.

### Prolonged antibiotic treatment does not prevent intra-abdominal abscesses in perforated appendicitis [^f450d918]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Appendicitis is the most common acute condition that requires surgery in children. Yet there is no consensus regarding the optimal antimicrobial treatment for children with uncomplicated or complicated appendicitis. Appendicitis has a broad spectrum of severity and therapy should be categorized accordingly. Of all children with appendicitis, those with perforated appendicitis are especially prone to develop intra-abdominal abscesses. Children with perforated appendicitis are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics. However, there is no common opinion about the time period during which antibiotic treatment should be given. Nor is it clear whether prolonged antibiotic treatment reduces the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess formation. Recently, the Therapeutic Agents Committee of the Surgical Infection Society published guidelines on antimicrobial therapy for children with appendicitis in general, including recommendations for treatment of children operated on for perforated appendicitis, based on the available literature. However, little or no evidence exists to decide whether prolonged use of postoperative antibiotic treatment prevents intra-abdominal abscess formation in this particular patient group. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether prolonged use of antibiotics after surgery reduces intra-abdominal abscess formation in children with perforated appendicitis.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^ae44ec8f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is an extremely common disease with a variety of medical and surgical treatment approaches. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians and patients in decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted from 2010 to 2022 to answer 8 key questions relating to the diagnosis of appendicitis, operative or nonoperative management, and specific technical and post-operative issues for appendectomy. The results of this systematic review were then presented to a panel of adult and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the GRADE methodology by subject experts.

Results

Conditional recommendations were made in favor of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis being managed operatively, either delayed (> 12h) or immediate operation (< 12h), either suction and lavage or suction alone, no routine drain placement, treatment with short-term antibiotics postoperatively for complicated appendicitis, and complicated appendicitis previously treated nonoperatively undergoing interval appendectomy. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms although it does also indicate uncertainty.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance with regard to current controversies in appendicitis. The panel also highlighted future research opportunities where the evidence base can be strengthened.

### A curious cause of appendicitis [^43211608]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

S. typhi and S. paratyphi infections are known to present as acute abdomen due to intestinal perforations, salpingitis, gallbladder involvement and indeed, rarely, appendicitis. Non-typhoidal Salmonella species are also rarely associated with appendicitis. On literature review, around half of these relate to Salmonella infection mimicking appendicitis through mesenteric lymphadenopathy rather than via a direct invasion of the appendix, resulting in acute inflammation. The former, 'pseudoappendicitis', presents a diagnostic challenge and has led to the finding of a normal appendix at the time of surgery. There are, however, a few reported cases of acutely inflamed or perforated appendicitis as a result of Salmonella infection, including that of a immunocompromised patient with renal transplant and a pregnant woman. Other enteric bacterial infections have also been identified in the aetiology of appendicitis, particularly Shigella. In a case series of seven patients who had preoperative positive stool cultures for Shigella or Salmonella, and who were found to have acutely inflamed or perforated appendicitis at the time of surgery, five were infected with Shigella sonnei and two with S. typhimurium and S. enteritis.

The protracted course of our patient's recovery mirrors that of other Salmonella appendicitis cases where patients are often readmitted with ongoing symptoms or sepsis before the diagnosis is made. These cases have also necessitated return trips to the operating theatre for drainage of intra-abdominal collections.

Our case emphasises the importance of collecting timely stool and pus samples to send for microbiology. Unfortunately, there was no preoperative stool sample or peritoneal fluid sent for culture during the first laparoscopy, and thus it is feasible that the boy may have been very unlucky and developed Salmonella infection after his appendicectomy. However, given his initial presentation with loose stool and vomiting and later collection, it appears likely that Salmonella infection resulted in acute appendicitis.

Some clinicians believe intraoperative bacteriology in appendicitis is of little benefit, but our case stresses that it is vital. Indeed, as fluid is not routinely sent for bacterial culture, it is thought that Salmonella appendicitis is under-reported. Identifying Salmonella allowed for the most appropriate antibiotic to be selected; although our case had already received broad spectrum IV antibiotics, it was only when he was put on ceftriaxone that his infection was effectively treated.
