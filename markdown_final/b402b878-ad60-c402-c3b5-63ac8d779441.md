## Question

Elevated alt with high cholesterol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage elevated ALT in the context of high cholesterol, including when to start or continue statins, how to monitor, and what to do if ALT rises on therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and baseline risk. Then, I should verify the magnitude and pattern of ALT elevation. Next, I will consider the most likely etiologies, especially NAFLD and metabolic syndrome. After that, I need to check guideline positions on statin safety and monitoring. Then, I will outline a practical management plan for different ALT thresholds, including when to pause or adjust therapy. Finally, I should confirm special populations and summarize a concise, actionable algorithm with safety caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk, because management hinges on ASCVD risk, age, diabetes, and alcohol use. I should confirm whether this is primary or secondary prevention, calculate 10-year ASCVD risk, and screen for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, since NAFLD and dyslipidemia frequently coexist and drive both cardiovascular risk and mild ALT elevations [^3917cb06] [^e1c41e2e].

> Next, I should review the magnitude and pattern of ALT elevation, since this dictates urgency and next steps. Mild elevations less than 3 times the upper limit of normal are common and often benign, whereas ALT greater than 3 times ULN warrants closer evaluation, and ALT greater than 5 times ULN or any ALT elevation with jaundice or coagulopathy demands immediate attention. I need to ensure I also check AST, ALP, and bilirubin to classify hepatocellular versus cholestatic injury and to apply Hy's law principles when appropriate [^9f945fab] [^764adf3d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation. I should consider the most likely etiologies in parallel with statin-related effects. NAFLD is the most common cause of mild, persistent ALT elevations in adults with dyslipidemia, and even high-normal ALT correlates with atherogenic lipoproteins and metabolic risk, so I need to screen for alcohol, diabetes, obesity, and medications while remembering that statins themselves rarely cause clinically significant liver injury [^6394b452] [^df4f0e15] [^eea58b14].

> I will now examine guideline positions on statins and liver safety, because this determines whether I can start or continue therapy. Major guidelines advise obtaining baseline liver enzymes before starting a statin, but they do not recommend routine on-treatment monitoring unless symptoms of hepatotoxicity arise; importantly, statins are not contraindicated in patients with compensated chronic liver disease, including NAFLD, and may even be associated with improved liver outcomes in some cohorts [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627] [^40581eaa] [^2adc3f3e].

> Let me think about how to manage ALT less than 3 times ULN in someone who needs statin therapy. I should confirm that there is no active liver disease or unexplained jaundice, then proceed with statin initiation or continuation, because the cardiovascular benefit outweighs the very low risk of hepatotoxicity; if ALT is already elevated at baseline, I should recheck in about 12 weeks after starting or changing the dose, but routine periodic monitoring is not required in asymptomatic patients [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627] [^9679084e].

> Wait, let me verify the approach when ALT is 3 to 5 times ULN. I should pause and reassess the cause rather than reflexively stopping the statin. I need to check for new medications, supplements, or alcohol, repeat liver tests to confirm persistence, and evaluate for NAFLD, viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. If no alternative etiology is found and the patient is asymptomatic, I can consider continuing the statin with close follow-up, but if ALT continues to rise or symptoms develop, I should reduce the dose or temporarily hold therapy and address the underlying liver disease [^9f945fab] [^6394b452] [^68029f14].

> I should double-check the threshold for stopping therapy. If ALT exceeds 5 times ULN or if there is jaundice, dark urine, or coagulopathy, I need to stop the statin immediately, evaluate for acute liver injury including drug-induced liver injury, and only consider rechallenge after the etiology is clarified and liver tests normalize. This aligns with DILI diagnostic thresholds and statin safety guidance [^764adf3d] [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627].

> But wait, what if the patient already has established chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. I need to ensure I distinguish compensated from decompensated disease. In compensated cirrhosis, statins are generally safe and may confer additional benefits, whereas in decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure, statins should be avoided or used only with specialist input after weighing risks and benefits [^40581eaa] [^2adc3f3e] [^1b10a4e1].

> Let me consider special populations and formulations. In older adults, including those over 80, statins remain safe with the same monitoring principles, and age alone does not increase hepatotoxic risk. In pediatrics, statins are acceptable for indicated dyslipidemias with baseline and symptom-triggered labs. For high-intensity or interacting regimens, I should be more vigilant, but routine monitoring still does not improve detection of serious liver injury [^690ecfa7] [^2655fe70] [^68029f14].

> Next, I should review non-statin lipid-lowering options if statins are not tolerated or contraindicated. Ezetimibe is reasonable and has a low rate of transaminase elevations, though I should still obtain baseline liver tests and monitor if clinically indicated. Bempedoic acid can cause mild ALT increases but is generally well tolerated. Niacin and lomitapide carry higher hepatotoxic risks and require careful selection and monitoring if used at all [^244513f7] [^04ba2586] [^b19fdb62] [^95907c76].

> I need to ensure longitudinal care addresses the underlying liver disease. Weight loss, glycemic control, and alcohol reduction improve NAFLD and may normalize ALT over time, so I should incorporate lifestyle therapy and, when indicated, evaluate for advanced fibrosis with noninvasive scores or elastography. This both mitigates liver risk and supports the safety of continued statin therapy [^3917cb06] [^e1c41e2e].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Baseline ALT and AST before statins, assess ASCVD risk and liver disease etiology, start or continue statins if ALT is less than 3 times ULN, monitor at 12 weeks if ALT is elevated at baseline or if the dose is changed, and if ALT rises to 3 to 5 times ULN, evaluate alternative causes and consider dose adjustment. Stop therapy if ALT exceeds 5 times ULN or if there is jaundice or coagulopathy, and only rechallenge after resolution and clarification of etiology [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627] [^9f945fab].

> In summary, I should confirm that mild ALT elevations in patients with high cholesterol most often reflect NAFLD and metabolic risk rather than statin toxicity, and that statins are generally safe to initiate or continue with baseline labs and symptom-triggered monitoring. The key is to contextualize the ALT value, exclude serious liver disease, and prioritize cardiovascular risk reduction while addressing modifiable liver disease factors [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627] [^40581eaa].

Elevated ALT with high cholesterol most often reflects **NAFLD** [^e1c41e2e] due to metabolic syndrome, but statins are **safe and beneficial** even with mild ALT elevations [^68029f14] [^a7ba5d2d]. Baseline liver tests are reasonable, but routine on-treatment monitoring is not required unless symptoms arise [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627]. If ALT rises to > 3× ULN, evaluate for other causes and adjust therapy as needed; **do not stop statins solely for mild ALT elevations**, as the cardiovascular benefit outweighs the low hepatotoxic risk [^68029f14] [^eea58b14].

---

## Pathophysiological relationship between elevated ALT and high cholesterol

- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**: Strongly linked to metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia; ALT is often mildly elevated (≤ 2–3× ULN) [^e1c41e2e] [^3917cb06].
- **Metabolic syndrome**: Central obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia drive hepatic steatosis and inflammation, elevating ALT [^77a061b7] [^2750645f].
- **Statins and liver enzymes**: Statins can cause mild, transient ALT elevations in 0.5–2% of patients, usually within 3 months and often resolving with continued therapy [^fdc3343a] [^f348e74a].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated ALT in hypercholesterolemia

- **Mild ALT elevations (< 3× ULN)**: Common in NAFLD/metabolic syndrome; not typically associated with significant liver injury [^e1c41e2e] [^3917cb06].
- **Moderate elevations (3–5× ULN)**: Suggest more active liver injury; evaluate for NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, medications, or autoimmune hepatitis [^9f945fab] [^6394b452].
- **Severe elevations (> 5× ULN)**: Rare with statins; prompt evaluation for acute liver injury, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), or other serious liver disease [^764adf3d] [^d3006c51].

---

## Clinical guidelines for managing elevated ALT in hypercholesterolemia

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Mild ALT elevation (< 3× ULN) | - Continue statins <br/> - No routine monitoring <br/> - Address metabolic risk factors (weight, diet, exercise) [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627] [^3917cb06] |
| Moderate ALT elevation (3–5× ULN) | - Evaluate for other causes (NAFLD, alcohol, viral hepatitis, medications) <br/> - Consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation if ALT continues to rise or symptoms develop <br/> - Monitor ALT every 3–6 months until stable [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627] [^9f945fab] |
| Severe ALT elevation (> 5× ULN) | - Immediately discontinue statins <br/> - Evaluate for acute liver injury, DILI, or other serious liver disease <br/> - Do not restart statins until ALT normalizes and etiology is identified [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627] [^764adf3d] |

## Safety of statin therapy in patients with elevated ALT

- **Low hepatotoxic risk**: Statins have a favorable safety profile; severe liver injury is rare (~1/100,000) [^a7ba5d2d] [^eea58b14].
- **Benefit outweighs risk**: Cardiovascular benefits of statins outweigh the low risk of liver injury, even in patients with mild ALT elevations [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627].
- **Compensated liver disease**: Statins are safe and may improve liver enzymes in NAFLD; avoid in decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure [^40581eaa] [^2adc3f3e] [^e330cfe1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of elevated ALT in hypercholesterolemia

- **Confirm persistence**: Repeat ALT after 2–4 weeks to confirm chronic elevation [^notfound].
- **Exclude common causes**: Alcohol use, viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), medications, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^9f945fab] [^6394b452].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or MRI to assess steatosis/fibrosis if ALT remains elevated > 3–6 months [^6394b452] [^6305141d].
- **Noninvasive fibrosis assessment**: FIB-4, APRI, or transient elastography if chronic liver disease is suspected [^6394b452] [^50092316].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Patients with elevated ALT and high cholesterol have higher risks of **cardiovascular disease** and **liver disease progression** (steatohepatitis, fibrosis) [^e1c41e2e] [^77a061b7]. Statins reduce cardiovascular events and may improve liver enzymes in NAFLD, supporting continued use when ALT is only mildly elevated [^e330cfe1] [^2e5361b4].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain ALT, AST, and metabolic panel before starting statins [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627].
- **Routine monitoring**: Not required unless symptoms or significant ALT elevations occur [^68029f14] [^3ec7f627].
- **Patient education**: Report jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, or abdominal pain promptly [^156072ab].
- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight loss, dietary modification, and exercise are foundational in NAFLD and dyslipidemia [^3917cb06] [^e1c41e2e].

---

Elevated ALT with high cholesterol most often reflects **NAFLD** and metabolic risk; statins are safe and beneficial even with mild ALT elevations, so **do not stop statins solely for mild ALT rises**. Use baseline labs, symptom-triggered monitoring, and guideline-based thresholds to guide management, and prioritize cardiovascular risk reduction.

### The liver and lovastatin [^f348e74a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The cholesterol-lowering agents, known as statins, have been in use for 15 years and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. Animal studies and premarketing clinical trials have given signals of hepatotoxicity, primarily minor elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase enzyme (ALT) levels. For that reason, all of the cholesterol-lowering drugs have labeling that requires monitoring of liver enzymes. Postmarketing experience, however, suggests that hepatotoxicity is rare and thus it is timely to revisit the issue. The first of the statins, lovastatin, was approved in 1986 and has acquired 24 million patient-years of clinical experience. Minor elevations in liver enzymes, i.e. ALT 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) occur in 2.6% and 5.0% of patients on lovastatin doses of 20 and 80 mg/day, respectively. These elevations are reversible with continuing therapy, are dose related, and are probably related to cholesterol lowering per se. Rare cases of acute liver failure (ALF) have been reported with all of the cholesterol-lowering drugs. With lovastatin, the rate is approximately 1/1.14 million patient-treatment years, which is 9% of the background rate of all causes of ALF and approximately equal to the background rate of idiopathic ALF. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity has not been effective in preventing serious liver disease, largely because of its rarity and the poor predictive value of minor ALT elevations. In fact, it may increase patient risk because of needless discontinuation of cholesterol-lowering therapy for false-positive results in patients who are benefiting from treatment.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a7ba5d2d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Hepatic adverse events with statins: Statins cause asymptomatic, dose-related transaminase elevations greater than 3 times ULN (ALT greater than AST) in up to 1% of patients in clinical trials, but severe liver disease usually does not develop; statins are safe in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease including with modest elevations (< 3 times ULN), and statins may be safely initiated when needed in individuals with transaminase elevations up to 3 times ULN; severe liver injury is extremely rare, estimated at about 1 in 100 000 patients and not detectable in clinical trials, and monitoring of ALT and AST does not prevent severe liver disease.

Monitoring liver enzyme elevation

Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes during statin therapy is not supported by current evidence, and is thus not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Indeed, routine periodic monitoring could identify patients with isolated increased ALT, AST, or GGT levels, and prompt physicians to reduce or discontinue statin therapy, thereby placing patients at increased risk for CVD events. It is, however, reasonable to measure hepatic function if symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity arise (e.g. unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-coloured urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera). If the patient develops ALT levels > 3× ULN (or lower when combined with a new increase in bilirubin levels), the statin should be discontinued. Other potential aetiologies should be considered before assuming that the elevated liver enzymes are due to the statin.

Take home messages

Mild ALT elevation in isolation in asymptomatic statin users is not clinically relevant. In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not worsen liver disease.
Clinically apparent liver injury with statin therapy is very rare and likely to be a class effect of statins.
Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not justified.
Liver enzymes should be measured in the rare patient who develops symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity.

### An assessment by the statin liver safety task force: 2014 update [^a6efc54f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

In the 2006 Report of the National Lipid Association's Statin Safety Task Force, a panel of experts in hepatology published their findings on specific questions related to the liver blood testing during statin therapy. Among their recommendations was that regulatory agencies reconsider the statin-labeling recommendation at that time, which required post-statin liver enzyme testing. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration altered statin labeling such that unless clinically indicated for other reasons, after a pre-statin therapy baseline evaluation, follow-up liver enzyme testing was not uniformly required after statin initiation. This 2014 report provides an update on interim issues relevant to statins and liver safety. Some of the points discussed include the value of baseline liver enzymes before initiating statin therapy, safety of statin use in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, potential drug interactions between statins and drugs used to treat hepatitis, the use of statins in liver transplant recipients, and the use of statins in patients with autoimmune liver disease. Finally, this panel provides diagnostic and algorithmic approaches when evaluating statin-treated patients who experience elevations in liver enzymes.

Background & Aims

Studies that evaluate the risk of hepatotoxicity from statins in hyperlipidemic subjects with elevated baseline serum transaminases are lacking. We conducted a study to test the hypothesis that patients with elevated baseline liver enzymes have higher risk of statin hepatotoxicity.

Methods

Our study consisted of the following 3 cohorts of patients seen between January 1, 1998 and June 31, 2002: Cohort 1: 342 hyperlipidemic patients with elevated baseline enzymes (AST > 40 IU/L or ALT > 35 IU/L) who were prescribed a statin; cohort 2: 1437 hyperlipidemic patients with normal transaminases who were prescribed a statin; and cohort 3: 2245 patients with elevated liver enzymes but who were not prescribed a statin. The effect of statins on liver biochemistries was assessed over a 6-month period after statins were prescribed. Elevations in liver biochemistries during follow-up were categorized into mild-moderate or severe based on predefined criteria.

Results

The incidence of mild-moderate elevations and severe elevations in liver biochemistries in cohort 1 were 4.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Compared with cohort 1, individuals in cohort 2 had lower incidence of mild-moderate elevations (1.9%, P = 0.002) but not severe elevations (0.2%, P = 0.2). However, between cohorts 1 and 3, there were no differences in the incidence of mild-moderate elevations (4.7% vs. 6.4%, respectively, P = 0.2) or severe elevations (0.6% vs. 0.4%, respectively, P = 0.6). Statin discontinuation during the follow-up was similar between cohorts 1 and 2 (11.1% vs. 10.7%, respectively, P = 0.8).

Conclusions

These data suggest that individuals with elevated baseline liver enzymes do not have higher risk for hepatotoxicity from statins.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^b96e0d2a]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the developed world. In the UK, there are an estimated 180 000 deaths per year from CVD. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) lipid modification guidelines recommend the use of risk prediction tools, to identify individuals at increased risk of CVD. In the UK, QRISK2is recommended while internationally, the Framingham toolis adopted. These tools calculate CVD risk using recognised risk factors, such as hypertension, cholesterol levels, age, smoking and family history of premature CVD.

Although most CVD events can be attributed to the aforementioned major risk factors embedded within routinely-used risk prediction tools, a significant proportion of the population will experience an event in the absence of traditional risk factors. For example, up to 50% of all myocardial infarctions (MI) and strokes occur in individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below the recommended thresholds for lipid modification. In the USA, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III now recommends that to effectively reduce the CVD risk of such patients requires consideration of 'emerging risk factors'.

Liver function enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are examples of emerging biomarkers for CVD risk. The AST to ALT has been shown to reflect disease severity in a number of chronic liver diseases, including alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune liver diseaseand hepatitis C. Previous studieshave demonstrated that CVD is the leading cause of death in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with higher rates coinciding with higher liver-related mortality over follow-up periods from 10 to 20 years.

The detection and identification of liver disease in the community is limited. Liver disease is asymptomatic until the final stages of cirrhosis. However, using the enzymes in a simple ratio (AST/ALT) or as a component of panel marker tests has been shown to have diagnostic accuracy for significant liver disease. In addition, these surrogates of liver injury improve the prediction of future clinical events including cardiovascular outcomes in patients with liver disease. However, it is still unknown whether the AST/ALT ratio can improve prediction for cardiovascular outcomes in a general primary care population. These simple liver markers are routinely available in primary care, offering potential utility in primary care-based risk prediction models. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the inclusion of AST/ALT ratio improves standard 10-year risk prediction models for CVD in a primary care population.

### Efficacy and safety of high-dose pravastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients with well-compensated chronic liver disease: results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^d648e8db]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The hepatotoxic potential of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors in patients with underlying chronic liver disease remains controversial. We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that compared pravastatin (80 mg) to a placebo administered once daily to hypercholesterolemic subjects greater than 18 years of age with at least a 6-month history of compensated chronic liver disease and with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL and a triglyceride (TG) level lower than 400 mg/dL. The efficacy was determined by the percentage change in LDL-C [along with the total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and TG] from the baseline to week 12. The safety was analyzed by the proportion of subjects who developed at least 1 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal for those with normal ALT at the baseline or a doubling of the baseline ALT for those with elevated ALT at the baseline during 36 weeks of treatment. A total of 630 subjects were screened, and 326 subjects were randomized; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was present in 64%, and chronic hepatitis C was present in 23%. In the intent-to-treat population, pravastatin (80 mg/day) significantly lowered the mean LDL-C, TC, and TG values at week 12 and at other times (weeks 4, 8, 24, and 36) in comparison with the placebo. The incidence of subjects who met the primary prespecified ALT event definition was lower in the pravastatin group at all times over the 36 weeks of therapy in comparison with the placebo group, although the difference was not statistically significant. No differences were seen on the basis of the baseline ALT values or among the different liver disease groups.

Conclusion

High-dose pravastatin (80 mg/day) administered to hypercholesterolemic subjects with chronic liver disease significantly lowered LDL-C, TC, and TGs in comparison with the placebo and was safe and well tolerated. The concern over an increased potential for statin-induced hepatotoxicity in patients with chronic liver disease appears to be lessened on the basis of these results.

### Lovastatin [^00854d6d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with Lovastatin and repeated as clinically indicated.

There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including lovastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Lovastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart Lovastatin.

The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of lovastatin.

Moderate (less than three times the upper limit of normal) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with lovastatin (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with lovastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and interruption of treatment was not required.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^ca47a904]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Our analysis suggests that the AST/ALT ratio should not be included in current CVD risk prediction tools for the general primary care population. However, in the era of stratified medicine, those with raised AST/ALT ratio may represent a higher risk subgroup that could benefit from closer monitoring, particularly when ALT is raised. Latest UK guidelinesin primary care recommend clinicians to exclude type I diabetic patients in the use of CVD risk assessment tools as the calculated CVD risk may not be reliable, particularly in younger patients. As diabetes is a spectrum of disease which has been simplified as a binary variable in all standard CVD risk tools, a continuous variable such as the AST/ALT ratio may confer additional advantages for further stratification of these higher risk subgroups. Other potential risk factors for liver disease in subgroup populations with high obesity and alcohol usage should also warrant further analysis in which the AST/ALT ratio may confer larger benefits. Emerging evidence (including the findings in this study) showing the utility the AST/ALT ratio in stratifying liver disease and CVD risk in certain subgroups may inform future guideline development as stronger research evidence emerges. Given that the cost of either analyte is relatively cheap, the AST/ALT ratio's utility in predicting future CVD risk in groups such as those with elevated ALT, type II diabetes, and features of metabolic syndrome, alcohol usage or a combination of these factors may be extremely cost-effective. More broadly, the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the recent Joint British Societiesrecommend now recommend revisiting the value of novel markers in risk prediction tools as more evidence becomes available.

In the context of identifying patients who should not be prescribed statin, the latest NICE lipid modification guidelinesstate that either AST or ALT should be assessed prior to starting statins. The implications of this are that mildly elevated levels will be wrongly seen as a contraindication to the initiation of statins. This study, however, reinforces the concept that liver transaminases, and specifically an elevated AST/ALT ratio, should be seen as identifying those with a greater need for a statin because of increasing CVD risk rather than a contraindication because of the relatively rare occurrence of a statin-induced liver injury.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: common questions… [^e5da3939]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher. Elevated triglyceride levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and severely elevated levels are associated with increased risk of pancreatitis. 1 This article answers commonly asked questions related to the management of hypertriglyceridemia. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increasing age, higher body mass index, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated total cholesterol, and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Up to 33% of adults in the United States have triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher. What Is the Clinical Significance of Hypertriglyceridemia.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines list hypertriglyceridemia as a risk-enhancing factor for CVD. 1, 8 It is also a component of metabolic syndrome and is a feature of atherogenic dyslipidemia. Despite the association between hypertriglyceridemia and CVD, studies have not demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events or deaths with the treatment of isolated hypertriglyceridemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is also a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. 1, 9. EVIDENCE SUMMARY The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines list elevated triglyceride levels as a risk-enhancing factor for CVD. 3 For example, a meta-analysis of 68 studies including more than 300, 000 people showed an association between higher triglyceride levels and CVD that was attenuated after adjusting for HDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol.

11 However, a European prospective study that followed 21, 448 adults 45 to 79 years of age for 11 years showed an increased risk of future coronary heart disease in those with LDL cholesterol levels less than 100 mg per dL and triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher. Hypertriglyceridemia may cause pancreatitis through toxic effects from free fatty acids released by pancreatic lipase.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence-focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^fdc3343a]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Elevation in liver enzymes

Mild elevation in liver transaminases occurs in 0.5–2.0% of patients on any statin, usually within 3 months of initiation of therapy. This may not differ significantly from placebo, and in isolation, is unlikely to be clinically relevant. A systematic meta-analysis of 135 RCTs involving more than 246 000 patients reported that statins as a class produced ∼50% higher risk of transaminase elevation compared with control or placebo. There was a clear dose–response relationship for atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. These elevations were transient, and usually normalized with continuing therapy. Clinically relevant ALT elevations are rare. An analysis of 49 trials involving more than 14 000 patients, reported persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases [> 3× upper limit of normal (ULN)] in 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients on atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo (Table 4).

Table 4
Summary of evidence for possible adverse effects of statin treatment on hepatic function

In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not result in worsening of liver disease, although caution may be needed in patients with pre-existing primary biliary cirrhosis. Moreover, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy are likely to outweigh any potential safety issues, as highlighted by the Joint Task Force guidelines. Indeed, an updated meta-analysis in more than 120 000 patients with chronic liver disease showed that statin use was associated with a lower risk of hepatic decompensation and mortality, and possibly reduced portal hypertension. Statins should not be prescribed, however, in patients with active hepatitis B virus infection until serum levels of AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, and ALP have normalized.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^9679084e]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Monitoring of lipid levels.

There is no consensus on the best approach to monitor lipid profiles in patients before and during treatment. Generally, lipids should be assessed at least twice before starting drug therapy, and then repeated 8–12 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment (Table 3). For individuals being treated for secondary prevention of ASCVD or higher risk primary prevention with LDL-C below treatment intensification thresholds, monitoring annually is reasonable. For low-risk primary ASCVD prevention individuals with LDL-C levels below treatment intensification thresholds, less frequent monitoring (ie, every 5 years) may be appropriate.

Table 3.
Laboratory assessment of patients with dyslipidemias

For biochemical monitoring for adverse effects of statins, we advocate that ALT and creatine kinase (CK) should be measured before starting treatment to obtain a baseline as a point of reference should future concerns arise; however, routine monitoring is generally unnecessary. Several studies have concluded that the rates of statin-induced elevations of aminotransferase levels are rare and may not be significantly different than in the general population. Statins are not contraindicated in individuals with mild baseline elevation in transaminases (< 3× upper limit of normal [ULN]) or in those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and these individuals do not seem to be at increased risk for statin hepatotoxicity. Statins are, however, contraindicated in those with decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure. For those individuals with transaminase elevations > 3× ULN, using a lower starting dose of statin and monitoring transaminases at 4- to 12-week intervals during cautious up-titration may be reasonable. A clinical approach to the patient with statin intolerance is discussed later.

If baseline CK is > 5 times ULN, some would advise refraining from statin initiation and considering alternative therapy because CK may rise even higher when a statin is introduced. However, if a patient has no risk factors for myopathy, CK does not need to be routinely monitored. A clinical approach to the patient with statin intolerance is discussed in more detail later.

### Who should receive a statin these days? Lessons from recent clinical trials [^d36aa6a3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are the most successful cardiovascular drugs of all time. By interrupting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, they activate hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and produce consistent and predictable reductions in circulating LDL cholesterol with resulting reproducible improvements in cardiovascular risk by retarding or even regressing the march of atherosclerosis in all major arterial trees (coronary, cerebral and peripheral). Clinical trials have demonstrated their capacity not only to extend life, but also to improve its quality by retarding the progression of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease and by enhancing central and peripheral blood flow. They are amongst the most extensively investigated pharmaceutical agents in current clinical use. In cardiovascular end-point trials they have proven ability to help prevent that first and all important myocardial infarction and to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence in those who do succumb. They are equally effective in men and women of all ages and at all levels of cardiovascular risk, whether caused by hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. In addition, they improve the outlook of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia whose LDL receptor function is deficient or defective; and all of this comes at minimal risk to the recipient. Their most important potential side effect is myopathy, which on very rare occasions may lead to rhabdomyolysis. Clinical experience shows that myopathic symptoms with creatine kinase levels raised to more than 10 times the upper limit of normal is seen in < 0.01% of recipients and progression to fatal rhabdomyolysis because of renal failure has been recorded in only 0.15 cases per million prescriptions. Liver function abnormalities are also, rarely, seen. Again, the frequency of raised aspartate or alanine aminotransferase to more than three times the normal limit is encountered in no more than 1–2% of all treated patients and is completely reversible upon withdrawal of treatment. Progression to hepatitis or liver failure does not occur. This constellation of benefits with little side effect penalty has resulted in the comparison of statins with antibiotics in the global battle against cardiovascular disease.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^907220f6]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### AASLD practice statement on the evaluation and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children [^4549b956]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Comorbidity management in children with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) states that children with MASLD should undergo comprehensive screening for cardiometabolic conditions and other comorbid diseases at diagnosis and longitudinally, and given the heightened risk of developing type 2 diabetes, we suggest annual monitoring for emergent or progression of cardiometabolic conditions; in those with elevated liver enzymes, we recommend that a subsequent rise in ALT to more than three times the baseline level or ≥ 300 U/L (whichever is lower) should prompt evaluation for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) or other etiologies, and when the baseline level is already close to or exceeds 300 U/L, further caution is warranted; the use of statins in children with MASLD is not contraindicated and may be considered if clinically indicated for hypercholesterolemia.

### Evaluation of short-term safety and efficacy of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in hypercholesterolemic patients with elevated serum alanine transaminase concentrations: PITCH study (PITavastatin versus atorvastatin to evaluate the effect on patients with hypercholesterolemia and mild to moderate hepatic damage) [^ae043b41]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and pitavastatin in patients with mild-to-moderate increased levels of hepatic enzymes.

Methods and Results

In this 12-week, prospective, randomized, open-label, active drug-controlled, and dose-titration study, 189 subjects with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (≥ 3.36 mmol/L) and alanine transaminase (ALT; ×1.25 ≥ and ≤ ×2.5 ULN; 50–100 IU/L) concentrations, but nonalcoholic and serologically negative for viral hepatitis markers at screening, were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with pitavastatin 2–4 mg/day (PITA, n = 97) or atorvastatin 10–20 mg/day (ATOR, n = 92). Pitavastatin and atorvastatin equally reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (-34.6 ± 16.0% and -38.1 ± 16.2%, respectively, P < .0001 each by analysis of variance). Seven (n = 4 PITA, n = 3 ATOR) and 10 (n = 5 PITA, n = 5 ATOR) patients experienced episodes of ALT > 100 IU/L at weeks 4 and 12, respectively, with one patient in each group excluded because of severe ALT elevation > 3× ULN (> 120 IU/L) at week 4. The 135 patients with persistently increased ALT concentrations at screening and randomization showed significant reductions in ALT after 12 weeks of treatment with PITA (n = 68, -8.4%) or ATOR (n = 67, -8.9%; P < .05, analysis of variance). Serial nonenhanced computed tomography in 38 subjects (n = 18 PITA, n = 20 ATOR) showed that both statins reduced the severity of hepatic steatosis, especially in subjects with clear hepatic steatosis at baseline (n = 9 PITA, n = 10 ATOR). Statin treatment of another 38 subjects with spontaneous normalization of ALT at randomization had little effect on ALT levels but did not induce severe ALT elevation (> 100 IU/L).

Conclusions

Conventional doses of pitavastatin and atorvastatin effectively and safely reduce elevated hepatic enzyme concentrations.

Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, JUXTAPID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the JUXTAPID REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Prescribe JUXTAPID only to patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis consistent with HoFH. The safety and effectiveness of JUXTAPID have not been established in patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not have HoFH [see Indications and Usage (1)].

WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

JUXTAPID can cause elevations in transaminases (5.1).

Measure alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then ALT and AST regularly as recommended (2.4, 5.1).
During treatment, adjust the dose of JUXTAPID if the ALT or AST is ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (2.4, 5.1).
Discontinue JUXTAPID for clinically significant liver toxicity (2.4, 5.1).

JUXTAPID increases hepatic fat (hepatic steatosis) with or without concomitant increases in transaminases (5.1).

Hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID may be a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis (5.1).

### Causes and evaluation of mildly elevated liver transaminase levels [^6394b452]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase are commonly discovered in asymptomatic patients in primary care. Evidence to guide the diagnostic workup is limited. If the history and physical examination do not suggest a cause, a stepwise evaluation should be initiated based on the prevalence of diseases that cause mild elevations in transaminase levels. The most common cause is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can affect up to 30 percent of the population. Other common causes include alcoholic liver disease, medication-associated liver injury, viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), and hemochromatosis. Less common causes include α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic conditions (e.g., thyroid disorders, celiac disease, hemolysis, muscle disorders) can also cause elevated liver transaminase levels. Initial testing should include a fasting lipid profile; measurement of glucose, serum iron, and ferritin; total iron-binding capacity; and hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody testing. If test results are normal, a trial of lifestyle modification with observation or further testing for less common causes is appropriate. Additional testing may include ultrasonography; measurement of α(1)-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin; serum protein electrophoresis; and antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1 testing. Referral for further evaluation and possible liver biopsy is recommended if transaminase levels remain elevated for six months or more.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^6d954367]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Liver Enzymes

In three placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 X ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.7% overall for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet and appeared to be dose-related with an incidence of 2.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet 10/80. In controlled long-term (48-week) extensions, which included both newly-treated and previously-treated patients, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 X ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.8% overall and 3.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet 10/80. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, not associated with cholestasis, and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment.

In SHARP, 9270 patients with chronic kidney disease were allocated to receive ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet 10/20 mg daily (n = 4650), or placebo (n = 4620). During a median follow-up period of 4.9 years, the incidence of consecutive elevations of transaminases (> 3 X ULN) was 0.7% for ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet and 0.6% for placebo.

It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before the initiation of treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet, and thereafter when clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including simvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet. Note that ALT may emanate from muscle, therefore ALT rising with CK may indicate myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet.

5.4 Endocrine Function

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin.

### The association of higher levels of within-normal-limits liver enzymes and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome [^605da3df]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

We conclude that a relatively high prevalence of the MetS has been noted in a cohort of apparently healthy individuals who have within-normal-limits concentrations of liver enzymes. The relatively high prevalence of the MetS observed could explain, at least in part, the previously noted epidemiological associations between elevated concentrations of GGT and ALT and future vascular risk. Moreover, our findings suggest that even minute changes, still within the so called "normal range" could point towards a potential dysmetabolic state. These observations could therefore lead to avoiding the usage of cut-off values for normalcy for these two biomarkers. In addition, they should encourage the use of both GGT and ALT as continuous biomarkers that could be used for early signaling of dysmetabolism. Finally, our results support the notion that in the era of early detection, prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders, one cannot be confident that relatively low concentrations of liver enzymes exclude the presence of dysmetabolic changes. A practical consequence might therefore be to follow these enzyme concentrations as continuous biomarkers and take into consideration the possibility that even small changes in their concentrations might be of relevance.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^3e6dd328]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is well known that a high blood level of the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor that contributes to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Many clinical trials have shown that patients with CVD can benefit from using statins to lower LDL-C levels. Lipid-lowering therapy, specifically statins, has become a cornerstone of treatment for dyslipidemia due to their effects on LDL-C levels. As such, statin therapy is endorsed by various guidelines as the first-line pharmacotherapeutic approach for reducing LDL-C levels and CVD risk when they are not adequately controlled by lifestyle changes such as better diet, weight control, and exercise. As physicians, we often encounter concerns about the potential side effects of cholesterol treatment, including myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatic injury. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is reported to be about 1–3%, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Despite extensive data documenting the safety of statins, primary care physicians harbor significant hepatotoxicity concerns, and these concerns act as a barrier to the utilization of statins especially for elderly patients aged 80 years or older. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the liver enzyme elevation during statin therapy in these elderly patients.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^a9b20052]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^d3006c51]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

HDS-associated liver toxicity appears to be an emerging determinant of DILI, with wide geographical variability. A prospective study in Iceland purported 16% of DILI related to HDS, while the US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network reported a similar percentage (16%), with an increase from 7% from 2004 to 2005 to 20% in 2013–2014. Further case–control data suggested rates of 4%–5% in studies in Latin Americaand Germany, respectively.

DILI should be classified according to the dominant pattern of liver enzyme derangement; hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed injury (figure 1).

Initially, alanine transferase (ALT) activity (patients ALT/upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (patients ALP/ULN of ALP) is calculated. Then ALT/ALP ratio (R) is determined. Some of the other commonly encountered phenotypes, and characteristic findings and commonly implicated agents are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Classification of DILI based on liver enzyme derangement

ALT, ALP and bilirubin are the typical indices used to define liver damage, and liver dysfunction in DILI and serial measurements are necessary to portray extent of hepatocellular injury and DILI phase. ALT is sensitive for hepatocyte injury, particularly alongside an elevated bilirubin and this pattern is a reliable biomarker of liver injury in DILI. Elevated aminotransferases do not reflect the extent to which the liver is damaged, particularly in insidious variants of hepatotoxicity such as indolent fibrosis, vascular liver disorders, cirrhosis and microvesicular steatosis secondary to mitochondrial toxicity. Elevated ALP values usually indicate cholestatic damage, which combined with elevated GGT provides evidence the ALP elevation is of hepatic origin. Isolated hyperbilirubinaemia does not qualify as DILI, given possibility of multiple confounding diagnoses. One important consideration is mild transaminase rises that may be apparent in relation to statin therapy, this may simply reflect an adaptive response and does not represent a true DILI. As such, given the benefit of statins in NAFLD(Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and cardiovascular disease such therapies should be continued where feasible.

### Simvastatin [^c9e229ed]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests

Moderate (less than 3xULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported with use of simvastatin.

Persistent increases to more than 3xULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving simvastatin in clinical studies. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have occurred with simvastatin. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase have also been reported.

In Study 4S, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 1,986 adult patients were treated with simvastatin 20 mg once daily, of whom 37% titrated to 40 mg once daily. The percentage of patients with one or more occurrences of transaminase elevations to > 3xULN was 0.7% in patients taking simvastatin compared with 0.6% in patients taking placebo. Elevated transaminases leading to discontinuation of study treatment occurred in 0.4% of patients taking simvastatin and 0.2% of patients taking placebo. The majority of elevated transaminases leading to treatment discontinuation occurred within in the first year.

Patients must adhere to a low-fat diet (< 20% fat) and take supplemental vitamin E and essential fatty acids during lomitapide treatment, and regulators required oversight as the FDA mandated a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy and the EMA developed a risk management plan. In the pivotal Phase 3 study, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were common: GI AEs were experienced by 93% and 74% of patients during the efficacy and safety phases, respectively, and three of 29 patients discontinued due to GI-related AEs and stopped by week 12. Hepatic enzyme elevations occurred, with 34.5% having alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) on 1 or more occasions and 4 patients experiencing levels > 5× ULN.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^4d6e2176]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels. The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e., waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a trial of lifestyle modification is appropriate. If the elevation persists, hepatic ultrasonography and further testing for uncommon causes should be considered.

Statins

There are seven 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methyl‐glutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or "statin" drugs that are used on a daily basis by millions of patients with hyperlipidemia. In general, statins are safe to administer, but myalgias and myopathy may lead to early dose reduction or termination in up to 10% of treated patients. Early on there was concern of self‐limited serum aminotransferase elevations in up to 20% of patient receiving statins, but clinically significant hepatic dysfunction was very uncommon. In the DILIN study, only 22 of 1188 (1.8%) consecutively enrolled patients with DILI were attributed to a statin over an 8‐year period. Both acute cholestatic and hepatocellular injury were observed, as well as fewer patients with autoimmune features. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no significant increase in the incidence of persistently elevated serum aminotransferase levels between statin and placebo therapy, including in patients with known chronic liver disease.–In addition, other studies have suggested that statins in patients with compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis may even reduce the risk of hepatocellular cancer and decompensation. In 2012, the FDA altered the product labels of available statins so that baseline liver biochemistries be obtained but that on‐treatment liver biochemistry monitoring is not required unless clinically indicated. Therefore, we do not recommend checking liver biochemistries in patients receiving statins unless there are new or unexplained symptoms of hepatitis. However, statins should be avoided in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to their hepatic metabolism, but low doses can be considered on an individual basis after assessing overall risk versus benefit.

### Bempedoic acid and ezetimibe (Nexlizet) [^04ba2586]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Increase in Liver Enzymes

In the hyperlipidemia trials, increases in hepatic transaminases (AST and/or ALT) were observed with bempedoic acid. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved with continued therapy or after discontinuation of therapy. Increases to more than 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) in AST occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with bempedoic acid versus 0.4% of placebo patients, and increases to more than 5× ULN occurred in 0.4% of bempedoic acid- treated versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. Increases in ALT occurred with similar incidence between bempedoic acid- and placebo-treated patients. Elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic and not associated with elevations ≥ 2× ULN in bilirubin or with cholestasis.

In the cardiovascular outcomes trial, the incidence of repeated and confirmed ALT and/or AST > 3× ULN was 1.6% in the bempedoic acid-treated group (versus 1.0% placebo). A higher percentage of patients in the bempedoic acid-treated group had hepatic enzyme elevations versus placebo (4.5% versus 3.0%, respectively).

Increase in Creatine Kinase

In the hyperlipidemia trials, approximately 1.0% of patients (versus 0.6% placebo) had elevations of CK levels of 5 or more times the normal value on one or more occasions, and 0.4% of patients (versus 0.2% placebo) had elevations of CK levels of 10 or more times.

Ezetimibe

In 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], 2,396 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 9 to 86 years, 50% were female, 90% were White, 5% were Black or African American, 2% were Asian, 3% other races; 3% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) and elevated LDL-C were treated with ezetimibe 10 mg/day for a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range 0 to 39 weeks).

Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated with ezetimibe and at an incidence greater than placebo in placebo-controlled studies of ezetimibe are shown in Table 3.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^18f9a387]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Why Physicians Mistakenly Discontinue Statins

Reasons why physicians inappropriately discontinue or limit the dose of statins include commonly held myths about statin adverse effects including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cognitive decline, cataracts, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In some cases, this may be driven by concern about litigation, when guidelines specify, for example, monitoring of liver function.

Although rare cases of true hepatotoxicity may exist, 1 statins probably do not cause hepatotoxicity, as stated in the 2013 International Atherosclerosis Society guideline. 18 Fluctuations in blood levels of transaminase enzymes that are often blamed on statins ("transaminitis") are more likely to be caused by fatty liver or by release of enzymes from muscle in patients with statin myopathy. 19, 20 In the Heart Protection Study, in which > 20 000 high‐risk patients were randomized to simvastatin 40 mg versus placebo and were followed for 5 years, hepatotoxicity was undetectable. 21 Athyros et al 22 compared patients with and without abnormal liver function tests in the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) study. They found that liver function tests actually improved among patients given statins, whereas they worsened in patients not given statins. Further, the cardiovascular benefit of statins was greater among patients with abnormal liver function tests than among patients with normal liver function tests at baseline. Their conclusion 22 was that "Statin treatment is safe and can improve liver tests and reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with mild‐to‐moderately abnormal liver tests that are potentially attributable to non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease". Guidelines regarding monitoring of liver function in patients taking statins should be revised accordingly.

### The efficacy and safety of statins for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^ab06cd95]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is an emerging liver disease in Western countries and the most frequent cause of incidental elevation of serum liver enzymes. Dyslipidaemia is frequently observed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and treatment of dyslipidaemia plays a critical role in the overall management of these patients. Moreover, coronary artery disease remains the most common cause of death. Statins are effective lipid-lowering agents, associated with a lowering the risk of cardiovascular events in several interventional randomized clinical trials. However, statins are often underused in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and many physicians are concerned about the prescription of statins to patients with unexplained persistent elevation of liver enzymes or active liver disease. Based on currently available data, statin therapy, at low-to-moderate doses, seems to be safe and has low liver toxicity. Treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is recommended and may also improve liver function tests. In these patients, the risks of not taking statins could outweigh the risks of taking the drug. Conversely, the usefulness of statins for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is still a matter of debate and randomized clinical trials of adequate size and duration are required.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^deb047f8]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This prospective study was designed to evaluate the hepatic safety of statins and find risk factors for hepatotoxicity of statins in the oldest-old population (≥ 80 years old). Demographic and clinical data were collected for each patient. Potential risk factors for statin treatment included age, gender, hepatitis B infection, fatty liver disease, biliary calculus, other chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, et. al), commonly used grug kinds (hypoglycemic drugs, antihypertensives, aspirin, β-adrenoceptor blockers, et. al), alcohol use (no drinking, mild-moderate drinking, or heavy drinking), statin variety (simvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin), and statin dose (low dose or standard dose).

Liver function, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels at baseline (before starting statin therapy), was assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after the initiation of statin therapy. Patients with serum AST > 40 IU/L or ALT > 40 IU/L were considered to have elevated transaminases because the upper limit of normal (ULN) for AST and ALT for our laboratory was 40 IU/L. The elevations in liver biochemistries during the follow-up were defined and categorized depending on the patient's baseline levels of serum aminotransferase. For this study's purposes, "mild" elevations in liver biochemistries was defined as elevations of AST and/or ALT less than 3 times ULN (< 3 × ULN, < 120 IU/L) in patients with normal baseline enzymes. "Moderate" elevations in liver biochemistries was defined as elevations of AST and/or ALT from 3 times up to 10 times ULN (3 × ULN-10 × ULN, 120–400 IU/L) in patients with normal baseline enzymes. "Severe" elevations in liver biochemistries was defined as the development of serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL (regardless of transaminase levels) or elevations in AST and/or ALT greater than 10 times ULN (≥ 10 × ULN, ≥ 400 IU/L) in patients with normal baseline enzymes. During the study period, statins were available at the Zhoupu Hospital pharmacy.

### Long-term experience with lomitapide treatment in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: over 10 years of efficacy and safety data [^e344e459]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Lomitapide — summary of key studies evaluating the efficacy and safety — reports that in a phase 2 study, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased by 50.9% at the highest dose (1.0 mg/kg/d) at wk 16, with dose-dependent liver aminotransferase elevations in 4/6 patients and ALT up to 700 IU/L. In a phase 3 study, mean LDL-C reduction from baseline was 50% at wk 26, 44% at wk 56, and 38% at wk 78; 4 patients had increased transaminase levels of > 5x ULN, and liver fat content was 1.0% ± 1.3% at baseline, 8.6% ± 8.1% at wk 26, and 8.3% ± 8.1% at wk 78. In a phase 3 post-hoc analysis, dosing was individualized from 5–60 mg/d (maximum) and mean LDL-C reduction from baseline at wk 26 was 48% in patients undergoing apheresis vs. 55% of patients not on apheresis treatment; 6/13 patients (46%) had a permanent change to apheresis regimens with 3 stopping and 3 decreasing its frequency. In a phase 3 extension, mean LDL-C reduction at wk 126 was 45.5%, hepatic enzyme elevations occurred in 4 out of 19 (21.1%) patients with ≥ 5x ULN, hepatic fat increased to 7.7% and 10.2% at wk 126 and 246, respectively, and cardiovascular events were seen in 2 patients.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^d48c6a67]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

In the Laboratory

Q: What laboratory tests help to confirm a diagnosis of statin intolerance?

Dr. Sperling: There is no test that typically confirms a diagnosis of statin intolerance, and this is one of the reasons that it is such a difficult clinical entity to address.

Dr. Wong: Obtaining adequate baseline information on current muscle and other symptoms before a patient begins a statin is important, as symptoms are often erroneously attributed to the statin when they were actually present beforehand.

Some papers in the literature suggest that measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is most appropriate for a patient workup, after symptoms of intolerance have emerged.

Some physicians prefer to obtain a baseline CK for comfort, whereas others claim that with a baseline CK, you may end up pursuing the enzyme forever.

Changes in CK levels can occur daily, and CK is not a diagnostic tool. Although there is a general tendency not to look at CK levels in the absence of a specific complaint, a CK measurement 1 to 2 days following intense exercise may be appropriate to see what the highest values might be.

Myositis (defined as muscle inflammation) seems to be associated with exercise, and almost without exception with CK elevations; myalgia (defined as muscle pain) can be relatively nondescript and is seldom associated with CK elevation.

Patients are interested in their liver enzymes. It is recommended that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) measurements be done at baseline and then be repeated, but there is little need for ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes unless warranted.

The ALT and AST levels are measured to determine if a patient is developing liver damage, or even liver failure, which may occur idiosyncratically in 1 in a million patients. This is the same incidence that is seen in patients who are not on statins, so a physician might ask what is really being accomplished by obtaining these measurements. It should be noted that ALT and AST will often increase transiently and harmlessly during the first few weeks of statin therapy.

It should also be noted that some patients may be heavy drinkers, and this may confuse the issue with regard to liver function testing.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^50092316]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked ever more frequently in both primaryand secondary care in an attempt to exclude liver disease, for the monitoring of potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver such as statins, and for the investigation of the generally unwell patient. These tests often produce an abnormal result, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases though they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and likelihood of liver disease, or the blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly presages a cycle of additional liver blood test testing in an otherwise asymptomatic individual, and notably, most patients referred to hospital with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease. For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130 849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016, from 82 general practices and of these, 38 636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkably low, with only 3.9% of those with an abnormal value being diagnosed with significant liver disease within 5 years of the test. Thus, used in isolation, liver blood tests are neither specific diagnostic tools nor specific exclusion tools, whereas they can be more effectively used to assess the extent of liver fibrosis if incorporated into algorithmsor used in conjunction with other modalities.

### The association of higher levels of within-normal-limits liver enzymes and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome [^c7404b80]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors known to be associated with increased future atherothrombotic events. Previous studies have shown that elevated liver enzymes concentrations were associated with the diagnosis of MetS and of its components.

Little is known however, about the association between the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among individuals presenting with within-normal-range liver enzymes. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one paper which demonstrated that even 'normal' levels of ALT are associated with the long-term development of multiple metabolic disorders, including the MetS and diabetes mellitus.

Since both elevated GGT and ALT have demonstrated significant associations with both atherothrombotic burden and vascular risk, we have performed a cross sectional analysis to evaluate the prevalence of the MetS in a relatively large sample of apparently healthy individuals in whom both GGT and ALT as well as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were all within the normal limits.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^1c8be217]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Some concerns have been raised regarding the widespread use of statin therapy. One of common challenges is multimorbidity, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and dyslipidemia, which are the main features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Cardiovascular events may also coexist with other chronic liver diseases, such as fatty liver disease (FLD), Hepatitis B and C, and liver cirrhosis. The clearance of all statins occurs in the liver and can cause elevations of some liver biochemistries, thus there is a concern about the increased risk of liver injury in patients taking statins. There are some studies that indicate that when patients with hyperlipidaemia and other liver diseases, like NAFLD, are treated with statins, elevations of ALT and liver enzyme levels occur in serum. Therefore, the safety of statin treatment in patients with NAFLD has aroused concern. However, based on previous case reports, treatment with statins is safe and may actually improve liver function. In our results, multivariate analysis showed that FLD patients undergoing statin treatment do not appear to have an increased risk of hepatic damage (OR, 3.659; 95% CI (1.376 to 9.726); P = 0.009; Table 2). However, hepatitis patients taking statins did experience hepatic damage (OR, 17.036; 95% CI (6.259 to 46.371); P < 0.001), even though they had normal liver function before statin treatment (Tables 2 and 3).

Moderate consumption of alcohol increases high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) levels. When patients use statins with 30 g alcohol/d, the level HDL-C was significantly increased compared to the control group. Excessive amounts of alcohol worsen liver function, which can increase the impact of statins on the liver. Our results indicate that heavy drinkers taking statins are more susceptible to liver injury (Table 2).

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^3917cb06]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Initial evaluation of a patient with NAFLD states that patients with NAFLD are most commonly referred with incidentally noted hepatic steatosis on imaging or elevated liver chemistries; normal laboratory reference ranges may exceed what is appropriate for NAFLD, in which a true normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ranges from 29 to 33 U/L in men and from 19 to 25 U/L in women; initial evaluation should include screening for metabolic comorbidities, assessment of alcohol intake, exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and physical examination to identify signs of insulin resistance and advanced liver disease; and when the clinical profile is atypical or accompanied by additional signs or symptoms suggesting additional/alternate etiologies, less common causes of steatosis or steatohepatitis should be excluded.

### Statins for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^3376f931]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are common causes of elevated liver enzymes in the general population. NASH and to some extent NAFLD have been associated with increased liver-related and all-cause mortality. No effective treatment is yet available. Recent reports have shown that the use of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with elevated plasma aminotransferases may result in normalisation of these liver enzymes. Whether this is a consistent effect or whether it can lead to improved clinical outcomes beyond normalisation of abnormal liver enzymes is not clear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of statins (that is, lovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin) on all-cause and liver-related mortality, adverse events, and histological, biochemical, and imaging responses in patients with NAFLD or NASH.

Search Methods

We performed a computerised literature search in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded up to March 2013. We did fully recursive searches from the reference lists of all retrieved relevant publications to ensure a complete and comprehensive search of the published literature. We did not apply any restrictions regarding language of publication or publication date.

Selection Criteria

All randomised clinical trials using statins as the primary treatment for NAFLD or NASH versus no treatment, placebo, or other hypolipidaemic agents.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted, and risk of bias of each trial was assessed independently by two or more review authors. Meta-analyses were performed whenever possible. Review Manager 5.2 was used.

Main Results

When the described search method was used and the eligibility criteria of the search results were applied, 653 records were found. Only two of these were randomised clinical trials that were considered eligible for inclusion. We assessed both trials as trials with high risk of bias. One of the trials was a pilot trial in which 16 participants with biopsy-proven NASH were randomised to receive simvastatin 40 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 6) once daily for 12 months. No statistically significant improvement in the aminotransferase level was seen in the simvastatin group compared with the placebo group. Liver histology was not significantly affected by simvastatin. The other trial had three arms. The trial compared atorvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 63) versus fenofibrate 200 mg daily (n = 62) versus a group treated with a combination of the two interventions (n = 61). There were no statistically significant differences between any of the three intervention groups regarding the week 54 mean activity levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase. The triglyceride levels seemed higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group. Liver histology was not assessed in this trial. The presence of biochemical and ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD seemed to be higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group (58% versus 33%). Three patients discontinued treatment due to myalgia and elevated serum creatine kinase activity; one from the atorvastatin group and two from the combination group. Another patient from the atorvastatin group discontinued treatment due to alanine aminotransferase activity that was over three times the upper normal limit. No data for all-cause mortality and hepatic-related mortality were reported in the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the findings of this review, which included two trials with high risk of bias and a small numbers of participants, it seems possible that statins may improve serum aminotransferase levels as well as ultrasound findings. Neither of the trials reported on possible histological changes, liver-related morbidity or mortality. Trials with larger sample sizes and low risk of bias are necessary before we may suggest statins as an effective treatment for patients with NASH. However, as statins can improve the adverse outcomes of other conditions commonly associated with NASH (for example, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome), their use in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis may be justified.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^2655fe70]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy in children and adolescents — initiation and titration (laboratory thresholds and dose escalation) specifies that after 4 weeks, fasting lipid profile (FLP), ALT, and AST are measured and compared with laboratory-specific reported normal values; the threshold for worrisome ALT or AST is ≥ 3 times the upper limit of reported normal; and target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) levels are minimal < 130 mg/dL and ideal < 110 mg/dL. If target LDL–C levels are achieved without potential myopathy symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, therapy is continued and FLP, ALT, and AST are rechecked in 8 weeks and then 3 months. If laboratory abnormalities are noted or symptoms are reported, the medication is temporarily withheld and blood work repeated in 2 weeks, with restart when abnormalities resolve and close monitoring. If target LDL–C levels are not achieved, the dose is increased by one increment (usually 10 mg) and blood work repeated in 4 weeks; if still not achieved, the dose may be increased again or another agent (bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorption inhibitor) may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist.

5.8 Laboratory Abnormalities

Neutropenia

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3).

Evaluate neutrophil counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation and interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e. ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Lymphopenia

ALC less than 500 cells/mm3were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials.

Evaluate lymphocyte counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm3) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Anemia

Decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 8 g/dL were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials.

Evaluate hemoglobin at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e., less than 8 g/dL) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Lipids

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Elevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin therapy. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks after initiation of treatment, and thereafter according to the clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

Liver Enzyme Elevations

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations compared to treatment with placebo.

Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury.

If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.

### Association between elevated liver enzymes and C-reactive protein: possible hepatic contribution to systemic inflammation in the metabolic syndrome [^2750645f]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to test whether the frequent association between liver enzyme elevations and various components of the metabolic syndrome is associated with higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.

Methods and Results

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (Alk-P), and high-sensitivity CRP were measured in 1740 subjects. Adjusted geometric mean CRP was calculated for subjects with normal and elevated ALT and for subjects with normal and elevated Alk-P, adjusting for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, fasting glucose, triglycerides, the presence of hypertension and low HDL cholesterol, and use of aspirin or hormone replacement therapy. Adjusted CRP levels were higher in subjects with elevated ALT (2.21 versus 1.94 mg/L, P = 0.028) or elevated Alk-P (2.58 versus 1.66 mg/L, P < 0.0001). Logistic regression showed that compared with subjects with normal liver function tests, the adjusted odds for high-risk CRP (> 3 mg/L) were significantly higher in subjects with elevated ALT (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, P = 0.002) or elevated Alk-P (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7 to 2.6, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Elevations of liver enzymes are associated with higher CRP concentrations. Hepatic inflammation secondary to liver steatosis is a potential contributor to the low-grade inflammation associated with the metabolic syndrome.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^f4778460]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. Hepatotoxicity is a barrier that limits the ability of primary care physicians to prescribe statins for patients with elevated liver transaminase values and/or underlying liver disease. However, limited population-based data are available on the use of statin therapy and on the hepatotoxicity of statins in very elderly patients. This prospective study evaluated the liver enzyme elevation during statin therapy in very elderly patients (≥ 80 years old).

Methods

Patients with hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C levels ≥ 3.4 and < 5.7 mmol/L), atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease (CHD), or a CHD-risk equivalent were enrolled and received once-daily statin treatment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to study the impact of age, gender, hepatitis B infection, fatty liver disease, biliary calculus, other chronic diseases, drug kinds, alcohol abuse, statin variety, and statin dose variables.

Results

A total of 515 consecutive patients ranging from 80 to 98 years old were included in the analysis. These patients were treated with simvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or atorvastatin. Twenty-four patients (4.7, 95% CI 2.7–6.6) showed an increase in their hepatic aminotransferase levels. No significant difference of hepatic aminotransferase elevation rates was observed in different statin treatment groups. The incidence of mild, moderate, and severe elevation of aminotransferase levels was 62.5% (15/24), 29.2% (7/24), and 8.3% (2/24), respectively. None of the patients developed hepatic failure. Nine patients with moderate or severe aminotransferase elevations discontinued therapy. The time of onset of hepatic aminotransferase elevation ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months after statin treatment. The onset of hepatic aminotransferase elevation was within 1 month for 70.8% of patients. The patients took 2 weeks to 3 months to recover their liver function after statin therapy cessation. Multivariate analysis identified chronic hepatitis B infection and alcohol consumption as independent factors associated with the hepatic response to statins: OR, 12.83; 95% CI (4.36–37.759) and OR, 2.736; 95% CI (1.373–5.454), respectively.

Conclusion

The prevalence of elevated transaminases was higher than published data in very elderly patients. Overall, statin treatment is safe for patients ≥ 80 years old.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^a7456166]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Severe hypercholesterolemia and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) — adjunctive lipid-lowering options and LDL apheresis are outlined: when goal levels are unattainable, an alternative goal is to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels "by at least 50%". New agents are being studied, and mipomersen in combination therapy "can reduce LDL-C by an additional 25% in homozygous FH patients", though "does not achieve the recommended LDL-C target in the vast majority of homozygous FH patients" and "injection-site reactions, hepatic fat and liver enzyme elevations are common". Lomitapide "can also reduce LDL–C levels by up to 50% in homozygous FH patients", but "gastrointestinal side effects and elevation in liver enzymes and hepatic fat are common", and "because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, mipomersen and lomitapide are available only through Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy programs". For selected patients, "LDL apheresis may be considered", with NLA Expert Panel criteria noted as "more inclusive than the Food and Drug Administration–approved indications".

### Proportion of NAFLD patients with normal ALT value in overall NAFLD patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d51ed085]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

NAFLD is usually caused by the abnormal metabolism in patients and tightly associated with dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Abundant studies and clinical practices have proven that the liver enzyme levels such as ALT and so on were increased usually in the NAFLD patients, and these liver enzymes could be used as the diagnostic markers for the NAFLD at some extent. However, not all the studies supported the above conclusion. Sheng et al. reported that some NAFLD patients possessed the normal ALT value, and the residual NAFLD patients had the elevated level of ALT. Amarapurkar et al. reported that the histological and clinical manifestation of NAFLD and NASH patients with normal ALT value were not different with the NAFLD and NASH patients with elevated ALT value. In consideration of these controversial reports and the inconsistent conclusion of ALT value in NAFLD patients, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the proportion of NAFLD patients with normal ALT value in overall NAFLD patients.

In this meta-analysis, we included 4084 patients of 11 studies which were from different regions and study types. We found that the summarized proportion of NAFLD patients with normal ALT value in overall NAFLD patients was 25% (95%CI: 20–31%), In view of the high heterogeneity of this analysis (I² = 92.0%), we performed the subgroup analysis which include region, type of study, diagnostic method, and group size to investigate the resource of heterogeneity. Unfortunately, almost all the heterogeneity of each group was higher than 50%. In addition, we also explore the proportion of NASH patients with normal ALT value in overall NASH patients, and the summarized proportion was 19% (95%CI: 13–27%). Similarly, the heterogeneity of this analysis in NASH patients was also very high (I² = 85.0%). The results of subgroup analysis suggested that all the heterogeneity of each group was higher than 50%. The potential resource of heterogeneity of the summarized proportion of NAFLD patients and NASH patients with normal ALT value may contributed by the genetic factors and individual difference, detailed studies should be conducted to illuminate this phenomenon in the future.

Statin use and monitoring in liver disease are delineated with specific recommendations. "Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease". Furthermore, "Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated", while in decompensated cirrhosis, "use of statins… should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit".

### Metabolic syndrome and transaminases: systematic review and meta-analysis [^77a061b7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) encompasses several cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, central obesity and hypertension. It is a multifactorial non-communicable disease that significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality and is considered a public health burden worldwide.

In addition to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), MetS and its risk factors, including obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM), are associated with liver disease. Liver function is essential for glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Hepatic glucose homeostasis influences insulin sensitivity, while peripheral insulin resistance and lipolysis contribute to fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis).

In this regard, MetS has a direct relationship with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both being predictors of the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

NAFLD affects approximately 25% of the world's population and is a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. This disorder, characterised by lipid deposition in hepatocytes, encompasses a group of liver diseases that resemble alcoholic liver disease, ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. These liver diseases have become the leading causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality and a risk factor for DM, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, MetS and CVD.

In this context, early liver impairment detection would help prevent or diagnose other metabolic disorders. According to recent studies, liver function tests, including serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), can be valuable parameters in the assessment of metabolic status, especially in the investigation of cardio-metabolic disorders. Specifically, several authors have explored the associations between liver enzymes, MetS, and CVD in different populations. In this regard, elevated ALT levels have been shown to help predict CVD in prospective studies, and MetS and its components. Although GGT is considered an indicator of the degree of liver disease and alcohol consumption, several studies have shown that the level of this enzyme is also associated with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular mortality independently of liver damage or alcohol consumption. One of the advantages of these parameters is that they are commonly measured in liver function tests and are well-known markers of liver damage.

Therefore, this possible relationship between serum liver enzymes and MetS has recently attracted much attention. Therefore, the main objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the best degree of evidence on the association between liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) and MetS, determining the effect size of these biomarkers.

### Niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) [^2ed6f7e1]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

ADVICOR should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to NIASPAN, therapy with NIASPAN should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg once daily at bedtime) and the NIASPAN dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Liver Dysfunction

Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses.

ADVICOR should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of ADVICOR.

Niacin preparations and lovastatin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In studies using NIASPAN alone, 0.8% of patients were discontinued for transaminase elevations. In studies using lovastatin alone, 0.2% of patients were discontinued for transaminase elevations.2In three safety and efficacy studies involving titration to final daily ADVICOR doses ranging from 500 mg/10 mg to 2500 mg/40 mg, ten of 1028 patients (1.0%) experienced reversible elevations in AST/ALT to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Three of ten elevations occurred at doses outside the recommended dosing limit of 2000 mg/40 mg; no patient receiving 1000 mg/20 mg had 3-fold elevations in AST/ALT.

In clinical studies with ADVICOR, elevations in transaminases did not appear to be related to treatment duration; elevations in AST and ALT levels did appear to be dose related. Transaminase elevations were reversible upon discontinuation of ADVICOR.

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with ADVICOR and repeated as clinically indicated.

There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including lovastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with ADVICOR, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart ADVICOR.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies: Refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions. (5.1)
Liver Enzyme Abnormalities and Monitoring: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe tablets. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ezetimibe tablets if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 X ULN persist. (5.2)
Skeletal Muscle Effects (e.g. Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis): ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ezetimibe tablets and other concomitant medications, as appropriate. (5.3)

5.1 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies

If ezetimibe tablets is administered with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies, refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Liver Enzymes

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical combination studies of ezetimibe tablets initiated concurrently with a statin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 X ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 1.3% for patients treated with ezetimibe tablets administered with statins and 0.4% for patients treated with statins alone. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ezetimibe tablets if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 X ULN persist.

5.3 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ezetimibe tablets and other concomitant medications, as appropriate.

### Considerations for safe use of statins: liver enzyme abnormalities and muscle toxicity [^36eec0e4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is estimated to be about 1 percent, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Patients with transaminase levels no more than three times the upper limit of normal can continue taking statins; often the elevations will resolve spontaneously. Coexisting elevations of transaminase levels from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and stable hepatitis B and C viral infections are not contra- indications to statin use. Although myalgias are common with statin use, myositis and rhabdomyolysis are rare. When prescribed at one-half the recommended maximal dosage or less, statins are associated with an incidence of myopathy similar to that of placebo; therefore, rou- tine monitoring of creatine kinase levels in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Myopathic symptoms usually resolve approximately two months after discontinuing the statin, and the same statin can be restarted at a lower dosage, or patients can try a different statin. Clinically important drugs that interact with statins and increase the risk of adverse effects include fibrates, diltiazem, verapamil, and amiodarone.

Statin safety monitoring — targeted testing versus routine labs: In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

5.3 Liver Function

Trilipix at a dose of 135 mg once daily administered as monotherapy or co-administered with low to moderate doses of statins has been associated with increases in serum transaminases [AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT)]. In a pooled analysis of three double-blind controlled studies of Trilipix administered as monotherapy or in combination with statins, increases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal on two consecutive occasions in ALT and AST occurred in 1.9% and 0.2%, respectively, of patients receiving Trilipix monotherapy and in 1.3% and 0.4%, respectively, of patients receiving Trilipix co-administered with statins. Increases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal in ALT and AST occurred in no patients receiving low- to moderate-dose statin monotherapy. Increases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal in ALT and AST occurred in 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively in patients receiving high-dose statin monotherapy. In a long-term study of Trilipix co-administered with statins for up to 52 weeks, increases of > 3 times the upper limit of normal on two consecutive occasions of ALT and AST occurred in 1.2% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. When transaminase determinations were followed either after discontinuation of treatment or during continued treatment, a return to normal limits was usually observed. Increases in ALT and/or AST were not accompanied by increases in bilirubin or clinically significant increases in alkaline phosphatase.

### The safety of statins in clinical practice [^eea58b14]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events (heart attacks, strokes, and the need for arterial revascularisation). Adverse effects from some statins on muscle, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare at standard doses, and on the liver, in increasing levels of transaminases, are unusual. Myopathy — muscle pain or weakness with blood creatine kinase levels more than ten times the upper limit of the normal range — typically occurs in fewer than one in 10,000 patients on standard statin doses. However, this risk varies between statins, and increases with use of higher doses and interacting drugs. Rhabdomyolysis is a rarer and more severe form of myopathy, with myoglobin release into the circulation and risk of renal failure. Stopping statin use reverses these side-effects, usually leading to a full recovery. Asymptomatic increases in concentrations of liver transaminases are recorded with all statins, but are not clearly associated with an increased risk of liver disease. For most people, statins are safe and well-tolerated, and their widespread use has the potential to have a major effect on the global burden of cardiovascular disease.

### (ezetimibe and atorvastatin) (Lypqozet) [^fa6cf264]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Liver Enzymes

Atorvastatin

Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg atorvastatin, respectively.

One patient in clinical trials of atorvastatin developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin.

Ezetimibe

In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 times ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was similar between ezetimibe (0.5%) and placebo (0.3%).

In controlled clinical combination studies of ezetimibe coadministered with atorvastatin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 times ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 0.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe administered with atorvastatin. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, not associated with cholestasis, and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment.

Ezetimibe and Atorvastatin Tablets

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets.

Ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets [see Contraindications (4)].

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

### An evaluation of alanine transaminase and creatine kinase elevations with the use of ezetimibe in an ambulatory care setting [^4a134b9e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Authors evaluating the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe have demonstrated a low occurrence of serious adverse reactions, such as elevations in alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or creatine kinase (CK). This study describes the incidence of ALT and CK elevations among those patients who were prescribed ezetimibe in a large ambulatory care population to further elucidate the safety of ezetimibe in a diverse "real-world" population.

Methods

Adults (≥ 18 years) with at least one prescription for ezetimibe between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2007, were eligible. All patients with an ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (3X ULN) and/or CK greater than 3X ULN any time after the first sold date of ezetimibe were identified. Medical records were reviewed by the use of predetermined assessment criteria to further classify patients and determine whether the elevation was possibly related, related, or not related to ezetimibe treatment.

Results

There were 4958 patients with a prescription for ezetimibe within the study period. Of these patients, 4332 (87%) had either an ALT or CK drawn. There were 82 patients identified with ALT greater than 3X ULN (n = 44) or with a CK greater than 3X ULN (n = 38). Of 82 patients, 17 (21%) were deemed possibly related to ezetimibe, of which only 5 (0.1%) had no other reasons noted for the elevation. In all cases the ezetimibe was prescribed in combination with a statin.

Conclusions

The incidence of ALT or CK elevations greater than 3X ULN in a large diverse population of patients was rare and similar to placebo rates in other published trials.

### Statin intolerance in a referral lipid clinic [^b7369edf]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Statins effectively prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but rates of statin discontinuation after adverse events are high.

Objective

Describe the range and relative frequencies of adverse events potentially attributable to statins in lipid referral practice and assess statin rechallenge outcomes.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 642 patients with statin-associated adverse events evaluated in a referral lipid clinic between January 1, 2004 and January 27, 2011.

Results

Patients experiencing adverse events by organ system included 92% with musculoskeletal, 8% central nervous system, 10% liver, 8% gastrointestinal, 5% peripheral nervous system, 5% skin, and 3% other events. Overlap of organ system involvement occurred in 22.5%. At least 1 follow-up visit was made by 557 patients, among whom overall median follow-up was 25 months. Among patients treated with a statin in the clinic, 71% remained on a statin at the last follow-up visit. Patients with hepatic transaminase increases by history were numerically more likely than the overall group to resume or remain on statin treatment, whereas those reporting central nervous system or gastrointestinal symptoms trended lower for statin maintenance. Among patients who experienced an adverse event after statin rechallenge, the majority (64%) were being treated with intermittent, nondaily dosing at the time of the adverse event.

Conclusion

Although musculoskeletal symptoms are reported by 90% of patients with statin intolerance, symptoms involving other organ systems may be more frequent than previously supposed. Understanding the range of symptoms, time course, and impact on daily activities informs counseling in patient-centered practice, but assessment of causation by statins remains challenging.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^5e037199]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the leading cause of death, with a higher prevalence in older adults. Greater than 80% of CVD-related mortality occurs in patients ≥ 65 years old. There are many reports suggesting that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of CVD. Statins are the first-line therapies for dyslipidemia and specify target LDL-C levels, but they are all hepatically cleared and can cause elevations in liver biochemistries. The potential risk for hepatotoxicity limited the use of statins. This is especially true for patients over 80 years old. Thus, there is a treatment paradox in the elderly: the more the risk of vascular disease, the less frequently statin therapy is initiated. To ascertain the role of age in the risk of hepatotoxicity during statin therapy, our study selected very elderly patients, whose ages ranged from 80 to 98 years (mean age of 83.8 years). We found that there is no correlation between age and liver enzyme elevation during statin therapy in patients older than 80 years old. This is supported by multiple studies in different countries in other age range.

Elderly people often suffer from more than one chronic disease such as diabetes, heart failure, and cognitive impairment. The co-occurrence of two but often more than two medical conditions within a single person is called multimorbidity. Drug-induced liver injury is a major cause of liver injury. Drug metabolism, distribution and elimination change with age. The elderly experience increased drug distribution and decreased hepatic clearance, which makes them more sensitive to polypharmacy which can lead to drug-induced liver injury. Hepatocellular injury and cholestasis are two of the most severe manifestations of drug-induced liver injury, accounting for nearly half of all hepatotoxic disease. It has been shown that elderly people who used concomitant drugs were more likely to experience cholestatic-type drug-induced liver injury. In our study, simple factor analysis showed that biliary tract diseases are related to drug-induced liver injury; however, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that these two diseases are unrelated (Tables 2 and 4).

### Resistant nonalcoholic fatty liver disease amelioration with rosuvastatin and pioglitazone combination therapy in a patient with metabolic syndrome [^9ea727bb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case describing resolution of persistently elevated aminotransferases in a patient with severe, resistant nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using combination therapy.

Case Summary

A 47-year-old obese male patient presented with a history of elevated aminotransferases and numerous statin intolerances. In addition to worsening control of diabetes and dyslipidemia, severe NAFLD was confirmed. Rosuvastatin was started, which induced short-term elevations in aminotransferases resulting in patient discontinuation. Biochemical markers of NAFLD worsened over time. Therefore, both rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and pioglitazone 15 mg daily were started simultaneously to potentially blunt the early increase in transaminases seen with rosuvastatin. At 2 weeks, the patient's alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) had decreased 57% and 56% from baseline, respectively. By 9 months, the patient's ALT and AST serum concentrations had normalized. Repeat liver ultrasound demonstrated improvement in steatosis grading and reduction in liver size. These improvements occurred despite a 4.5-kg weight gain since starting rosuvastatin and pioglitazone.

Discussion

Pharmacotherapy in NAFLD is not well validated, particularly combination therapy. Medications that target obesity-related consequences are commonly used, although evidence regarding biochemical and histological improvement is inconclusive. Consideration should be given to the use of combination of thiazolidinediones and statins for rapid biochemical improvement and long-term histological impact.

Conclusions

The improvement in this patient's biochemical and ultrasonographic markers of resistant, severe NAFLD was rapid and sustained with combination therapy. This case represents a potential solution for initiating or maintaining statin therapy in patients with NAFLD who are at high cardiovascular risk.

Liver enzyme elevation

Twenty-four patients experienced increases in their hepatic aminotransferase levels, and the total rate of persistent elevation in hepatic aminotransferase levels was 4.7% (Tables 2 and 3). For each individual satin, the total rate was: 6.1% (6/98) for simvastatin, 6.9% (8/116) for fluvastatin, 5.0% (4/80) for pravastatin, 1.2% (1/85) for rosuvastatin, and 3.7% (5/136) for atorvastatin (Table 2). The incidence of mild, moderate, and severe aminotransferase elevation was 62.5% (15/24), 29.2% (7/24), and 8.3% (2/24), respectively (Table 3). None of the patients developed hepatic failure. Nine patients with moderate or severe aminotransferase elevations discontinued therapy. The time of onset of hepatic aminotransferase elevation ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months following the initiation of statin treatment (Table 3). The onset of hepatic aminotransferase elevation occurred within 1 month for 70.8% (17/24) of patients (Table 3). Patients required 2 weeks to 3 months to recover from their liver function after cessation of statin therapy (Table 3).

### Association between high-normal levels of alanine aminotransferase and risk factors for atherogenesis [^df4f0e15]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Liver disease has been associated with cardiovascular disorders, but little is known about the relationship between serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and markers of atherogenesis. We investigated the relationship between low-normal and high-normal levels of ALT and an extended panel of cardiovascular risk factors among individuals with no known diseases in a primary care setting.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from 6442 asymptomatic patients at wellness visits to a primary care setting in central Virginia from 2010 through 2011. Serum levels of ALT were compared with levels of lipids and lipoproteins, as well as metabolic, inflammatory, and coagulation-related factors associated with risk for cardiovascular disease.

Results

Serum levels of ALT were higher than 40 IU/L in 12% of subjects, and in the high-normal range (19–40 IU/L in women and 31–40 IU/L in men) in 25% of subjects. ALT level was associated with the apolipoprotein B level, concentration and particle size of very-low-density lipoproteins, concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (LDL-P), and percentages of small dense LDL (sdLDL) and sdLDL-cholesterol (sdLDL-C) (P < .0001 for all). A high-normal level of ALT was associated with higher levels of LDL-C, LDL-P, sdLDL-C, and sdLDL particles (P < .001 for all). These effects were independent of age, body mass index, and hyperinsulinemia. Increasing levels of ALT and fasting hyperinsulinemia (> 12 μU/mL) synergized with increasing levels of triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein particles, LDL-P, sdLDL-C, and percentage of sdLDL-C. Levels of APOA1, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein-class 2 were associated inversely with serum level of ALT (P < .0001 for all).

Conclusions

In an analysis of asymptomatic individuals, increased serum levels of ALT (even high-normal levels) are associated with markers of cardiovascular disease.

Recommendation‐specific supportive text

An exploratory analysis of the JUPITER trial compared outcomes in 5695 participants age 70–97 years to those age 50–69 years old. Within this older subgroup, rosuvastatin reduced major ASCVD events by 39% with favorable point estimates for cardiovascular death and total mortality and greater absolute reductions in major ASCVD events compared to the younger group. Assessment for adverse effects, and measurements of lipid values, liver function tests, and hemoglobin A1C occurred every six months. Serious adverse events were more common in older than younger patients, but similar between rosuvastatin and placebo within each age group. As discussed in Question 4, new onset T2DM was more common in the rosuvastatin group in older patients, but comparable to the increase seen in younger participants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration removed the recommendation for routine liver function test measurements with statin therapy in 2012. The 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend measurement of liver function tests at baseline and if there are signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity during therapy. The guidelines further recommend a comprehensive evaluation of musculoskeletal symptoms prior to statin treatment because such symptoms are common in the general adult population and especially in older individuals. Serum creatine kinase testing should be performed for patients with severe SAMS or muscle weakness during treatment. Monitoring of LDL‐C is recommended 4 to 12 weeks after starting therapy or making statin dose adjustments and every 3 to 12 months thereafter as clinically indicated to monitor adherence and safety without distinctions by patient age. Among those with risk factors for the development ofT2DM, monitoring of hemoglobin A1C levels is also recommended. Clinicians should use these results and shared decision making to manage therapy to achieve patient‐specific therapeutic objectives.
The fundamental competent and practical steps of shared decision‐making include: information sharing, patient education, exploring patient preferences, decision support tools, deliberation and discussion, shared decision‐making agreement, and ongoing communication and review. Given limited evidence of improved ASCVD outcomes with statin therapy in adults age 75 years or older, including these patients in decision making about statin initiation, type of statin and statin intensity, and about continuation or discontinuation of therapy is important to reduce decisional conflict and ensure that therapy is consistent with patient priorities and preferences. Prospective randomized trials that utilized shared decision‐making with or without validated decision tools in younger patients have demonstrated reductions in decisional conflict and increased patient acceptance of statin therapy.as has provision of statistics addressing relative risk reduction in ASCVD events. The Mayo Clinic Statin Choice Decision Aid has been validated in clinical trials, and is available to facilitate shared decision‐making in clinical practice. Older adults with multimorbidity may face multiple preference‐sensitive decisions, and treatment of one condition may exacerbate another condition, making it impractical to use decision aids for each choice. A better approach to eliciting preferences among older adults with multimorbidity may be to ask patients to rank a set of universal health outcomes such as living as long as possible, preserving function, and alleviating pain and other symptoms. The clinician and patient can then consider these factors within the shared decision‐making process. Statin therapy could be considered in terms of how likely it is to help the patient achieve their most‐desired outcome or avoid their least‐desired outcome. Understanding a patient's priorities can help to inform the overall approach to medications, including statins.

### Hepatotoxicity of statins as determined by serum alanine aminotransferase in a pediatric cohort with dyslipidemia [^bc930b08]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of statins, as determined by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), in children and adolescents with dyslipidemia in real-world clinical practice.

Study Design

Clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected between September 2010 and March 2014. We compared ALT levels between patients prescribed versus not prescribed 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), and then compared ALT before and after initiation of statins.

Results

Over the 3.5-year observation period, there were 2704 ALT measurements among 943 patients. The mean age was 14 years; 54% were boys, 47% obese, and 208 patients were treated with statins. Median follow-up after first ALT was 18 months. The mean (SD) ALT in statin and non-statin users was 23 (20) U/L and 28 (28) U/L, respectively. In models adjusted for age, sex, and race, ALT was 2.1U/L (95% CI 0.1 to 4.4; P = 0.04) lower among statin users, which was attenuated after adjustment for weight category. Patients started on statins during the observation period did not demonstrate an increase in ALT over time (ALT 0.9U/L [95% confidence interval -5.2 to 3.4] increase per year; P = 0.7).

Conclusions

In our study population, we did not observe a higher burden of ALT elevations among pediatric patients on statins as compared to those with dyslipidemia who are not on statins, supporting the hepatic safety of statin use in childhood.

### Is there value in liver function test and creatine phosphokinase monitoring with statin use? [^823f41b9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Statins have transformed the care of patients with vascular disease. Patients in almost every category that has been studied have benefited substantially. On the other hand, although the incidence of side effects is remarkably low, statins, like any other therapy, are not entirely free of serious risks. From the outset, based on the mechanism of action of statins, hepatotoxicity has been a concern. Moreover, although the mechanisms remain obscure, significant skeletal muscle injury, which can lead to renal failure and death, unquestionably does occur. To mitigate these risks, screening and monitoring programs for hepatic and skeletal muscle injury were put in place when statins were introduced into clinical practice. This article reviews the benefits and the costs of these efforts. Although the benefits have not been shown, the costs are real and substantial. These include the harm caused by inappropriate withdrawal of therapy, which has been shown to be life-saving, as well as the considerable financial expenditure. The conclusion that follows, based on the evidence in hand, is that although these programs were appropriate at the time statins were introduced, they are not appropriate now.

### Niacin (niaspan) [^ab57c0e0]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

5.2 Skeletal Muscle

Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin and statins. Physicians contemplating combined therapy with statins and NIASPAN should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.

The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased when lovastatin or simvastatin are coadministered with NIASPAN, particularly in elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism.

5.3 Liver Dysfunction

Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses.

NIASPAN should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of NIASPAN.

Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily NIASPAN doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg, 245 patients received NIASPAN for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with NIASPAN. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of NIASPAN patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN.

In three safety and efficacy studies with a combination tablet of NIASPAN and lovastatin involving titration to final daily doses (expressed as mg of niacin/ mg of lovastatin) 500 mg/10 mg to 2500 mg/40 mg, ten of 1028 patients (1.0%) experienced reversible elevations in AST/ALT to more than 3 times the ULN. Three of ten elevations occurred at doses outside the recommended dosing limit of 2000 mg/40 mg; no patient receiving 1000 mg/20 mg had 3-fold elevations in AST/ALT.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^b19fdb62]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Niacin in adults with hypertriglyceridemia — clinical use cautions and recommendation are as follows: "Niacin is typically prescribed in doses of 500 to 2000 mg daily and is contraindicated in persons with active liver disease or unexplained, persistent elevations in liver transaminases, active peptic ulcers, or arterial bleeding", and "Niacin is not used in combination with statins due to increased adverse events". The guideline notes that "In 2016, the FDA recommended that niacin not be routinely used or combined with statins after trial data showed that the benefit for the combination did not exceed the potential risk for adverse events". Based on the evidence appraisal, "the task force strongly recommended against the use of niacin in usual care of adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL)" due to "moderate certainty of increased risk of serious adverse events" and "low certainty of a trivial benefit in reduction of MI".

### Baricitinib (Olumiant) [^1ee238a4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphopenia – ALC less than 500 cells/mm3were reported in OLUMIANT clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with OLUMIANT, but not placebo.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ALC less than 500 cells/mm3.

In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with ALC less than 200 cells/mm3. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with COVID-19 and an ALC less than 200 cells/mm3.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on ALC [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)].

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 8 g/dL were reported in OLUMIANT clinical trials. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on hemoglobin levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)].

In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥ 10 times the ULN were observed in patients in OLUMIANT clinical trials. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt OLUMIANT until this diagnosis is excluded [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 12 weeks following OLUMIANT initiation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

### Effect of statin use on liver enzymes and lipid profile in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^2e5361b4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are recommended for treatment of dyslipidemia to reduce the overall cardiovascular risk in patients with NAFLD. However, statin treatment was underutilized and the effect of statins on liver enzymes remained unclear in this patient population.

Objectives

This study aimed to provide real-world evidence of the safety and effect of statin use in patients with NAFLD.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional survey study of adults with NAFLD using pooled data from the US NHANES database 2009–2018. NAFLD was defined by Fatty Liver Index (FLI) ≥ 60 and United States Fatty Liver Index (USFLI) ≥ 30. Multivariate regression analyses adjusted for baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were performed to compare the liver enzymes and lipid profile between statin and non-statin users.

Results

The study included 2,533 adults with NAFLD, representing 22.6 million individuals in the US, with 27% receiving statin treatment between 2009 and 2018. The mean differences of liver enzymes for AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT between statin and non-statin users were -0.86 (p = 0.539), -3.49 (p = 0.042), -0.25 (p = 0.913), and 0.57 (p = 0.901), respectively. In individuals with NAFLD and dyslipidemia, total cholesterol and LDL levels were significantly lower in statin users compared to non-statin users (mean difference, -28.9; p < 0.001 and -27.7; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The use of statins was not associated with elevated liver enzymes in patients with NAFLD. Significantly lower levels of ALT, total cholesterol, and LDL were observed in statin users compared to non-statin users.

Statin use in NAFLD/NASH includes safety context and treatment guidance: Patients with NAFLD and NASH are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and although elevated aminotransferases are not uncommon in patients receiving statins, serious liver injury from statins is rarely seen in clinical practice; there are no RCTs with histological endpoints which investigated statins to treat NASH. Given the lack of evidence to show that patients with NAFLD and NASH are at increased risk for serious drug induced liver injury from statins, statins can be used to treat dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD and NASH. (Strength – 1, Quality – B). Until RCTs with histological endpoints prove their efficacy, statins should not be used to specifically treat NASH. (Strength – 1, Quality – B).

### Metabolic syndrome is linked to a mild elevation in liver aminotransferases in diabetic patients with undetectable non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by ultrasound [^01c7f40f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite ongoing findings on the relationship between elevated levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and metabolic syndrome (MetS), this association in diabetic patients without a known cause for liver enzymes elevation other than diabetes, per se, remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between circulating liver enzymes and MetS in a relatively large sample of patients with diabetes.

Methods

A total of 670 diabetic patients, without known causes of hepatocellular injury, were enrolled. Patients with ultrasonographic signs of fatty liver disease were not included. Fasting blood samples were obtained and biochemical characteristics were measured. MetS was defined according to the international diabetes federation criteria.

Results

Serum ALT and AST were significantly higher in patients with MetS (p < 0.001). High waist circumference and low HDL-cholesterol were significantly associated with elevated ALT (OR = 2.56 and 2.0, respectively) and AST (OR = 2.23 and 2.21, respectively). ALT and AST were significantly associated with MetS (OR = 2.17 and 2.31, respectively). These associations remained significant after multiple adjustments for age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, HbA1c and medications. There was a significant (p < 0.01) positive association between the number of the MetS features and the level of ALT or AST.

Conclusion

In diabetic patients without ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver, elevated aminotransferases are independently associated with MetS. Despite negative ultrasound results in diabetic patients with MetS, the serum level of liver aminotransferases may be elevated and should be more thoroughly monitored.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus, as a metabolic disorder, is one of the most prevalent global public health issuesand contributes to a rise in morbidity and mortality. According to estimates from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 1 in 11 individuals between the ages of 20 and 79 had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2015, which could reach 629 million by 2045. Diabetes is hyperglycaemia resulting from insulin deficiency, insulin resistance or both.

Prediabetes is a major diabetes risk factor. It is a hyperglycaemic condition marked by impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or glycated haemoglobin (A1C) of 6.0%–6.4%, or a combination of these.

Both dyslipidaemia and hypertension are significant risk factors for T2DM. According to the American Diabetes Association, patients with T2DM who have dysregulated levels of lipids such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, very‐low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL), low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) are diagnosed with diabetic dyslipidaemia. Alternatively, lipid markers may be a useful predictor of risk in diabetic patients.

In addition, prediabetes and T2DM are common metabolic syndrome (MetS) manifestations. Some studies indicate that individuals with metabolic syndrome are four times more likely to develop T2DM. MetS are characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, abdominal obesity or a high BMI ratio, glucose intolerance or insulin resistance, hypertension and microalbuminuria.

Insulin resistance syndrome may result in hepatic dysfunction, resulting in T2DM. Therefore, patients with advanced liver disease have a higher incidence of diabetes than the general population. Conversely, releasing free fatty acids (FFAs) due to T2DM decreases hepatic mitochondrial function. In turn, this causes further triglyceride storage in the hepatocyte and, ultimately, liver damage.

Serum levels of liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and to a lesser extent γ‐glutamyltransferase (GGT), are frequently used as indicators of liver damage. In the past decade, several studies have linked serum concentrations of these enzymes to multiple metabolic syndrome symptoms, including hepatic insulin resistance, T2DM and dyslipidaemia.

Since then, little research has been conducted on the relationship between dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome and liver enzyme levels in pre‐diabetic and T2DM patients. In order to determine the relationship between these risk factors and the development of prediabetes and diabetes in the adult population ofcohort centre, this study was conducted on three groups: healthy, pre‐diabetic and T2DM.

### Evinacumab in homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: long-term safety and efficacy [^f80e6b86]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, there were no clinically relevant changes in liver function parameters from baseline to Week 24 (see Supplementary data online, Table S6). Eight (6.9%) patients in the overall population [evinacumab-naïve group (n = 3); evinacumab-continue group (n = 5)] experienced TEAEs related to liver function, including abnormal hepatic function (n = 1; 0.9%), acute hepatitis (n = 1; 0.9%), increase in alanine aminotransferase (n = 4; 3.4%), increase in aspartate aminotransferase (n = 4; 3.4%), increase in blood creatine phosphokinase (n = 1; 0.9%), and an increase in transaminases (n = 1; 0.9%; see Supplementary data online, Table S7). Two TEAEs related to liver function [abnormal hepatic function (n = 1; 0.9%) and increase in transaminases (n = 1; 0.9%)] were considered related to evinacumab treatment and possibly related to concomitant LLTs (lomitapide or rosuvastatin). All other TEAEs related to liver function were considered unrelated to evinacumab treatment. One (0.9%) patient experienced a serious TEAE of acute hepatitis of moderate intensity on study Day 1120, 27 days after the 40th dose of evinacumab. Laboratory tests showed the patient to have elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase [2624 U/L (normal range: 9–34 U/L)] and alanine aminotransferase [680 U/L (normal range: 6–41 U/L)]. The patient was admitted to hospital on study Day 1121. Although asymptomatic, the patient reportedly had an alcohol intake more than the usual a few days prior. An elevated level of cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin M antibody was noted, and the patient was diagnosed with possible hepatitis virus. The patient received no treatment, but administration of the study drug was interrupted. On study Day 1127, the event of acute hepatitis was considered resolved, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. The study drug was resumed with the patient receiving evinacumab on study Day 1149. No patient experienced a liver-related TEAE leading to a permanent discontinuation of study treatment.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol) [^b7b07d77]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of LESCOL XL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1.1% of patients receiving fluvastatin in clinical trials. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with fluvastatin. There have been rare post-marketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including LESCOL XL.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.

Consider liver enzyme testing before LESCOL XL initiation and thereafter, when clinically indicated. LESCOL XL is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue LESCOL XL.

5.4 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including LESCOL XL. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.

### Drug-induced liver injury: recent advances in diagnosis and risk assessment [^764adf3d]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Standard of diagnosis: role of currently performed liver tests in assessing DILI

DILI most often presents as an acute viral hepatitis-like syndrome, without symptoms that specifically point to the drug aetiology unless rash or other cutaneous manifestationsreinforce the suspicion of drug toxicity. The clinical spectrum of DILI can mimic almost every other liver disorder. Accompanying blood eosinophilia is uncommon in large series of patients with DILI, but is clearly suggestive of drug allergy. Histopathological findings in DILI can resemble many other liver disorders, thereby limiting the value of liver biopsy in DILI diagnosis. However, biopsy can be of use to establish an alternative diagnosis when the underlying liver disease worsens (ie, alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH))(table 1).

Table 1
Examples of host and environmental variables influencing the diagnostic workup in patients assessed for suspected DILI

A diagnostic workflow for assessing cases of suspected DILI is shown in figure 3. Serum aminotransferases, that is, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (TB) levels, although not specific for DILI, remain the hallmark for detecting and classifying liver damage. Minor increases in aminotransferases that can result from adaptive and reversible liver responses to the drug (eg, statins) or from pre-existing liver disease (eg, fatty liver) should not be classified as DILI. An international expert groupproposed the following thresholds for a diagnosis of DILI: (a) ALT value ≥ 5× ULN, (b) ALP value ≥ 2× ULN or (c) ALT value ≥ 3× ULN and TB ≥ 2× ULN. The latter constellation defines 'Hy's Law', which anticipates a 10% risk of mortality/liver transplantation, as confirmed in large databases of DILI cases. The FDA guidance for DILI extends the interpretation of Hy's Law by stating that 'there should not be a prominent cholestatic component' in the hepatocellular nature of the liver injury, suggesting that a cholestatic component as defined by elevated ALP levels is associated with less risk of progression. However, a recent analysis from the Spanish DILI Registry showed that raised ALP > 2 ULN did not decrease the risk of acute liver failure in cases fulfilling Hy's Law. A marked increase of AST and an AST/ALT ratio > 1.5 at DILI recognition also predict a worse prognosis.

Guidance statements

51 Early detection of DILI is best achieved by educating patients to report untoward symptoms to their providers along with prospective clinical and laboratory monitoring with certain high-risk drugs like the ICIs, isoniazid, and methotrexate.
52 All practitioners are encouraged to voluntarily report instances of suspected DILI to the FDA via the MedWatch system at https://www.fda. gov/safet y/medwatch.
53 Transient elevations of serum liver enzymes can be seen with drugs such as isoniazid that are self-limited despite continued dosing, presumably because of metabolic and immunological adaptation.
54 The FDA and LiverTox websites are a rich resource for information about drug hepatotoxicity and provide informative relevant documents and recommendations for surveillance that may be accessed online, including drug labeling and package inserts.
55 Recommendations for hepatotoxicity monitoring vary in detail, according to the background information available. Often, common sense must be applied and/or experts consulted.
56 Recommended monitoring for isoniazid hepatotoxicity includes patient education to report new symptoms suggestive of hepatitis. Monthly laboratory monitoring has not been shown to reduce the incidence of clinically significant liver injury and can lead to premature discontinuation of therapy in many patients. However, many specialty societies advise baseline and on-treatment laboratory monitoring in high-risk individuals.
57 Annual measurement of liver elastography is recommended as a noninvasive means to monitor the hepatotoxicity of drugs like methotrexate that tend to cause silent fibrosis but is not likely applicable to most other drugs that cause DILI.
58 Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease.
59 Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated. However, use of statins in people with decompensated cirrhosis should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit.
60 Predosing and on-treatment laboratory monitoring is the standard of care for oncology patients receiving ICIs with a series of steps to withhold the drug, increase laboratory monitoring, and use corticosteroids based on the severity of liver injury.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^fdeaf458]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Statins and hepatic steatosis: perspectives from the Dallas heart study [^e4634461]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular disease are independently associated. Due to the efficacy of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, increasing interest has been shown in establishing the safety of these drugs in NAFLD. In this study, the relationship between statin use, hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC), and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels was examined in 2,264 Dallas Heart Study participants who were using no lipid-lowering agent (n = 2,124) or using only a statin for lipid management (n = 140). Statin use was not associated with a greater frequency of hepatic steatosis (38% vs. 34%) or elevated serum ALT (15% vs. 13%) by a pair-matched analysis. Statin use was also not associated with a greater prevalence of elevated serum ALT among subjects with hepatic steatosis (n = 638). This finding persisted when controlling for possible sample bias as a result of current prescribing practices for statins. Among subjects with serum lipid abnormalities who were not using a statin, hepatic steatosis was present in 60% of those with mixed hyperlipidemia and 83% of those with both mixed hyperlipidemia and an elevated serum ALT. In conclusion, statin use was not associated with a higher frequency of hepatic steatosis or serum ALT abnormalities, even among those with hepatic steatosis. Individuals meeting criteria for statin therapy are likely to have coexistent hepatic steatosis.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Metabolic syndrome is linked to a mild elevation in liver aminotransferases in diabetic patients with undetectable non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by ultrasound [^fa2bab25]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin insensitivity is a known cause of liver damage. Elevation of circulating liver enzymes including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is suggestive of hepatocellular injury. There is increasing evidence that ALT is significantly and independently associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, however not all of the studies support this finding.

In recent years, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as a novel component of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (MetS), has drawn the attention of many researchers. NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple benign steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. This condition which is associated with long-standing elevations in liver enzymes, is related to higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and MetS.

Despite ongoing findings on the relationship between NAFLD and MetS, the relationship between elevated liver enzymes and MetS in diabetic patients without a known cause for liver enzymes elevation other than diabetes, per se, remains unclear. In particular, while most of the studies describe the association between MetS and elevated liver aminotransferases via the NAFLD mechanism; it is not clear what extent of liver steatosis is sufficient to mediate the association between liver enzymes and MetS in diabetes. To best of our knowledge, no evidence is available regarding the association between MetS and serum aminotransferases in patients with mild stages of liver steatosis. To determine subjects with mild liver steatosis from those with advanced stages, ultrasonography is an appropriate screening tool. Ultrasonography with the sensitivity of 60–89 percent and specificity of 66–93 percent in detecting steatosis is proved as a good tool for detection of clinically significant fatty infiltrations, in epidemiologic studies. It is reported that individuals with negative fatty liver changes in ultrasonography have hepatic fat < 30%.

Of note, there is limited evidence regarding the pattern of abnormality in liver enzymes in diabetic patients with and without MetS. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between circulating liver enzymes and MetS in a relatively large sample of Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes, after excluding patients with ultrasonographic signs of NAFLD or any other known causes of hepatocellular injury.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

Biochemical Abnormalities

The median age of first recorded elevated transaminase was 8.2 years (supplemental Table 2). Mean ALT, AST, and GGT levels were elevated at the time of the first documented measurement (92.4, 87.8, and 52.2 U/L, respectively) and were abnormal in 91.7%, 76.2%, and 20.0% of patients, respectively. ALT and AST elevations (defined as > 43 U/L and > 59 U/L, respectively) were frequent (92% of available measurements for ALT and 59% for AST) and typically persistent with no evidence of any substantial and/or sustained change following the introduction of dietary modifications and/or LLM (Fig. 1 A; supplemental Fig. 1 [values, by patient and LLM use, for {A}AST, {B} TG, and {C} HDL-C]). Elevated GGT levels were seen less commonly, with 20% of patients having values > 40 U/L at baseline (supplemental Table 2). Among the 15 substudy patients with data available, mean direct bilirubin was 0.29 mg/dL, with a range of 0.05 to 0.51 mg/dL. Three (20%) patients had a direct bilirubin value above the upper limit of normal. The mean total bilirubin was 1.46 mg/dL (range 0.298–6.64 mg/dL). Mean LDL-C total cholesterol, and TG levels were elevated at the time of the first documented measurement (202.9, 269.5, and 184.4 mg/dL, respectively) and were abnormal in 64.4%, 62.5%, and 27.1% of patients, respectively. Mean HDL-C at the first measurement was 37.5 mg/day (girls 39.0 mg/dL, boys 36.4 mg/dL) and was abnormal in 43.5% of patients. Most of the available LDL-C values (88%; 270/306) were > 100 mg/dL, with many values in a range indicative of substantial dyslipidemia in the study population (Fig. 1 B). Overall, although reductions in LDL-C with LLM were seen, these reductions were typically small with substantial overlap in the range of elevated LDL-C levels seen in patients not receiving LLM.

### Lomitapide-induced fatty liver is a reversible condition: evidence from a case of familial chylomicronemia syndrome [^0bc2a186]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Hepatic monitoring under lomitapide — liver safety was tracked with laboratory tests and imaging, showing mostly stable enzymes, intermediate fibrosis risk by FIB-4, progressive steatosis, and normal-range stiffness. Monitoring included liver function tests, ultrasonography, FibroScan, and magnetic resonance imaging. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) fluctuated with transient elevations occasionally exceeding the upper limit of normal, but levels predominantly remained within or close to the reference range. Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) values were initially 2.3, finally 2.4, and averaged 2.44, placing the patient within the category of intermediate risk of fibrosis. Hepatic steatosis progressed from mild to moderate and eventually severe, while FibroScan liver stiffness values varied yet maintained a median within the normal range at 6 kPa.
