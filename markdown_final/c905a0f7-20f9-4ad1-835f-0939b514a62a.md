## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an evaluation for suspected borderline personality disorder based on their reported symptoms and history. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial, guideline-based psychiatric evaluation and history elements. Then, I should examine core BPD features and how to measure them. Next, I will differentiate BPD from look-alike conditions. After that, I will apply diagnostic criteria with quantitative tools, assess risk, review comorbidities, and finish with a formulation and initial treatment and safety considerations grounded in current guidelines [^115Kc9yr] [^111x454X].

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment scope per APA 2024: clarify the reason for evaluation and the patient's goals, conduct a comprehensive review of psychiatric symptoms including personality pathology and common co-occurring disorders, obtain prior treatment and medical histories, review psychosocial and cultural factors, perform a mental status exam, and complete a structured risk assessment; given the reported childhood stalking at age 8 despite a "healthy home", I need to check for trauma sequelae and carefully differentiate BPD from PTSD, which frequently co-occur and share affective dysregulation and interpersonal distrust, while keeping in mind gene–environment interplay in BPD etiology and avoiding premature causal attributions [^111x454X] [^1145FCEd] [^115u2mgQ].

> I will now examine affective instability, since the report of "rapid mood swings — from day to day, from second to second" suggests the short-lived, reactive mood shifts that are core to BPD; wait, let me verify the temporal pattern, because BPD affective changes typically occur over minutes to hours and are triggered by interpersonal stress, in contrast to the discrete multi-day episodes of bipolar spectrum disorders, and using experience sampling can help quantify these dynamics reliably [^114ys1FE] [^11418UrU].

> For interpersonal dysfunction, the statements about difficulty keeping friends and "having a hard time with people" cue me to probe for fears of abandonment and alternating idealization and devaluation; I should double-check for abandonment fears in particular, which function as an efficient inclusion criterion in adolescents, and I need to assess maladaptive interpersonal schemas such as disconnection and rejection that are sensitive and specific markers distinguishing BPD from mood disorders [^112FUAqw] [^1169rAZd].

> Let me consider identity disturbance next; the reported instability of self-image prompts me to clarify chronic feelings of emptiness and identity confusion, which, despite being phenomenologically underdefined, help distinguish BPD within the personality disorder spectrum, and I should confirm whether a dimensional assessment via the DSM-5 AMPD framework better captures severity and functional impact than a purely categorical approach [^1124qczY] [^111hQ8V2] [^115WB2No].

> The note about "not understanding social cues" makes me think about social-cognitive distortions and stress-related paranoid ideation that can occur in BPD; hold on, I should verify whether these reflect BPD-related interpersonal hypersensitivity with quasi-psychotic experiences under stress versus alternative explanations such as autism spectrum disorder, social anxiety, or trauma-related hypervigilance, since transient paranoia or dissociation under stress would support BPD criterion 9 [^1145FCEd] [^116PtQdF].

> In the differential with bipolar disorder, I initially wondered if the rapid shifts could point to cyclothymia or hypomania, but wait, that would be a mistake because bipolar disorders require distinct, sustained episodes with intervening euthymia and features like decreased need for sleep and increased goal-directed activity; I should confirm the absence of discrete manic or hypomanic episodes with a structured interview and weigh the chronic, interpersonal-triggered reactivity that favors BPD [^11418UrU] [^1157aZda].

> For BPD versus PTSD, the childhood stalking could meet Criterion A and explain some emotional dysregulation, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should use the CAPS-5 to anchor PTSD symptoms and then determine whether instability is pervasive across contexts with identity disturbance and emptiness that are not core to PTSD, and if both sets of criteria are met, I should diagnose both conditions rather than forcing an either–or decision [^111x454X] [^1145FCEd].

> I need to check other rule-outs as well: confirm childhood-onset inattention and hyperactivity for ADHD where emotional dysregulation is frustration-specific rather than pervasive, distinguish episodic major depression from chronic, stress-reactive mood lability, and consider overlap with other Cluster B conditions while avoiding diagnostic overshadowing by carefully parsing trait-level patterns versus state-dependent symptoms [^1127MiMh] [^113qYUJC].

> Applying diagnostic criteria, I will now examine all nine DSM-5 BPD criteria using a validated semi-structured interview such as the DIPD-IV or SCID-II, requiring five or more criteria and ensuring pervasiveness and impairment; next, I should review quantitative measures like the MSI-BPD or PAI-BOR to determine severity, and I will consider AMPD Criterion A/B to complement categorical diagnosis with dimensional severity and trait expression [^115Kc9yr] [^112yGCKH] [^111hQ8V2].

> Mapping the patient's report, likely positive criteria include affective instability, interpersonal instability with difficulty maintaining relationships, and identity disturbance; I should further probe for abandonment fears, impulsivity across domains, chronic emptiness, anger dyscontrol, and transient stress-related paranoia or dissociation, and I need to ensure each endorsed feature is present across time and contexts rather than limited to discrete crises [^1145FCEd].

> I should double-check risk comprehensively: assess current and past suicidal ideation, plans, intent, and means; clarify non-suicidal self-injury functions and triggers; and evaluate impulsive aggression, acknowledging that BPD carries an elevated lifetime suicide mortality approaching 10% and that impulsivity interacting with aggression heightens risk; I also need to establish and document a collaborative safety plan today [^115u2mgQ] [^115jjhtk] [^115ALHv2].

> Next, I should review comorbidities systematically because BPD has high co-occurrence with Axis I disorders and this shapes prognosis and treatment planning; I will screen for depressive disorders, PTSD given the stalking history, substance use disorders that are linked to poorer outcomes and slower remission, ADHD, and eating disorders, noting population-level associations between BPD features such as affective instability, impulsivity, emptiness, and ED diagnoses [^114n3k9W] [^1145FCEd] [^116VyRaf].

> Let me synthesize the formulation: the pattern of rapid, reactive mood shifts, pervasive interpersonal dysfunction, and identity disturbance, in the context of early trauma exposure, is consistent with BPD; however, I should confirm the diagnosis via a structured interview and dimensional measures to avoid premature closure and ensure that at least five DSM-5 criteria are met with functional impairment across settings [^113jjXJU] [^111x454X].

> I should counsel about course and prognosis, emphasizing that remission is common and often occurs within the first 2–4 years, with acute symptoms like self-harm and crisis-driven behaviors tending to remit earlier than temperamental features such as chronic anger and intolerance of aloneness, while acknowledging the potential for recurrence and the importance of sustained psychosocial support [^115rnBQ7] [^112u7uh4].

> For initial treatment planning, psychotherapy is first-line, with strongest support for dialectical behavior therapy and mentalization-based therapy; medications should be adjunctive, short-term, and targeted to specific, measurable symptoms after I review co-occurring disorders, prior psychotherapies, nonpharmacologic treatments, past medication trials, and current medications in a collaborative, psychoeducational discussion; I initially thought AAFP endorsed broad pharmacotherapy, wait, they actually emphasize psychotherapy first and note only low-quality evidence supporting second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, or omega-3s for targeted symptoms, so I need to be cautious and align with APA guidance on limited, goal-focused pharmacotherapy [^112Cn7CJ] [^117XSk8v] [^112MYdM4] [^116qV3M2] [^113ixViV] [^113hSxma].

> If an acute crisis emerges, I should verify immediate safety needs, implement brief crisis planning, and integrate safety planning into care; evidence for crisis-specific interventions remains limited, so collaborative plans alongside standard care and follow-up are prudent while monitoring risk closely [^116bR2mZ] [^115ALHv2].

> If the patient is an adolescent or young adult, I need to ensure multiple assessments as needed to improve reliability, educate about the diagnosis to mitigate stigma, involve caregivers when appropriate, and consider early, staged interventions given that BPD can be reliably diagnosed under 18 and early detection is associated with better functional outcomes [^113qYUJC] [^111fhKUM] [^113hSxma].

> Hold on, I should verify that no ancillary test is diagnostic for BPD; neuroimaging and machine learning approaches remain exploratory and are not suitable for individual diagnosis, so they should not replace careful clinical assessment and structured interviewing [^115ohn5Z].

> Actionably, I will administer a semi-structured personality interview, add a quantitative measure like MSI-BPD or PAI-BOR, complete CAPS-5 for PTSD, perform and document a thorough risk assessment with a safety plan, screen for comorbidities including substance use and eating disorders, and schedule a collaborative feedback session to review findings, confirm diagnosis, and agree on an evidence-based treatment plan with clear targets and monitoring metrics [^115Kc9yr] [^111x454X] [^111cSsz8].

---

The patient's symptoms — **rapid mood swings** [^114ys1FE], **unstable relationships** [^112Cn7CJ], **identity disturbance** [^112yGCKH], and **difficulty with social cues** [^1145FCEd] — are consistent with borderline personality disorder (BPD) [^112Cn7CJ]. The history of **childhood trauma** (stalking at age 8) is a known risk factor for BPD [^1145FCEd] [^1127MiMh]. However, a **comprehensive assessment** [^111x454X] is needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions such as bipolar disorder [^11418UrU], PTSD, and autism spectrum disorder. The recommended next steps are a structured clinical interview [^111x454X], standardized symptom measures [^115Kc9yr], and a detailed evaluation of mood patterns, trauma history, and social functioning. If BPD is confirmed, evidence-based psychotherapies such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) or mentalization-based therapy (MBT) should be offered [^112Cn7CJ], with medications used only for specific target symptoms [^117XSk8v].

---

## Clinical features consistent with BPD

The patient's reported symptoms closely align with the **diagnostic criteria for BPD** in the DSM-5 and recent literature:

- **Rapid mood swings**: Affective instability [^114ys1FE] characterized by marked mood reactivity is a core feature of BPD [^112Cn7CJ].

- **Difficulty with interpersonal relationships**: Unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, often alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, are characteristic of BPD [^1145FCEd] [^1127MiMh].

- **Instability of self-image**: Identity disturbance, characterized by markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self, is a hallmark of BPD [^112yGCKH] [^112Cn7CJ].

- **Difficulty understanding social cues**: Impaired social cognition and difficulty interpreting social cues are common in BPD, contributing to interpersonal dysfunction [^113BnYrY] [^1145FCEd].

---

## Role of childhood trauma in BPD

The patient's history of being stalked for a year at age eight constitutes **significant childhood trauma**, a well-established risk factor for BPD. Trauma, particularly chronic or repeated interpersonal trauma, is strongly associated with the onset and severity of BPD symptoms [^1145FCEd] [^1127MiMh]. Trauma exposure can lead to maladaptive coping, emotional dysregulation, and interpersonal difficulties — core elements of BPD pathology [^113hSxma] [^1145FCEd].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While the patient's symptoms are consistent with BPD, **other psychiatric conditions with similar features must also be considered**:

| **Condition** | **Key distinguishing features** | **Overlap with BPD** |
|-|-|-|
| Bipolar disorder | - Episodic mood swings with distinct manic/hypomanic episodes <br/> - Periods of euthymia [^11418UrU] | - Mood instability <br/> - Impulsivity [^1157aZda] |
| Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) | - Re-experiencing trauma <br/> - Hyperarousal <br/> - Avoidance behaviors | - Emotional dysregulation <br/> - Interpersonal difficulties [^1127MiMh] |
| Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) | - Persistent social communication deficits <br/> - Restricted interests <br/> - Repetitive behaviors | - Difficulty understanding social cues <br/> - Interpersonal difficulties |

---

A **comprehensive clinical assessment**, including structured diagnostic interviews and collateral information, is required to distinguish BPD from these conditions [^111x454X].

---

## Recommended diagnostic assessment

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines recommend a **thorough initial assessment** for suspected BPD that includes [^111x454X]:

- **Reason for evaluation**: Clarify the patient's goals and expectations for treatment [^111x454X].

- **Psychiatric symptom review**: Assess core BPD features and common co-occurring disorders [^111x454X].

- **Psychiatric treatment history**: Review prior treatments and responses [^112MYdM4].

- **Physical health assessment**: Evaluate medical conditions that may impact mental health [^111x454X].

- **Psychosocial and cultural factors**: Consider contextual influences on symptom expression [^111x454X].

- **Mental status examination**: Document current mental state and functioning [^111x454X].

- **Risk assessment** [^111x454X] [^115ALHv2]: Evaluate suicide risk, self-injury, and aggressive behaviors.

Quantitative measures, such as the **McLean Screening Instrument for BPD**, can help assess symptom severity and functional impairment [^115Kc9yr].

---

## Evidence-based treatment recommendations

If the diagnosis of BPD is confirmed, the following **evidence-based treatments** are recommended:

- **Psychotherapy**: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and mentalization-based therapy (MBT) are first-line treatments [^112Cn7CJ], demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing BPD symptoms, self-harm, and improving interpersonal functioning [^113BnYrY].

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Medications are not primary treatments for BPD [^117XSk8v] but may be considered adjunctively to target specific symptoms (e.g. mood stabilizers for affective instability, antipsychotics for impulsivity) [^113ixViV].

- **Collaborative treatment planning**: Engage the patient in shared decision-making, provide psychoeducation, and develop a comprehensive, person-centered treatment plan [^116qV3M2] [^111cSsz8].

---

## Prognosis and course of BPD

BPD has a **variable course** [^112u7uh4], with symptoms fluctuating over time; long-term studies indicate that many patients experience significant symptom remission, although interpersonal difficulties and functional impairments may persist [^115rnBQ7]. Prognosis is influenced by treatment engagement, social support, and comorbid conditions [^114n3k9W].

---

The patient's symptoms are consistent with BPD, but a **comprehensive assessment** is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. If confirmed, evidence-based psychotherapies such as DBT or MBT should be offered [^112Cn7CJ], with medications used adjunctively for specific symptoms [^117XSk8v].

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) was introduced in the DSM-III in 1980. From the DSM-III to the DSM-5, no major changes have occurred in its defining criteria. The disorder is characterized by instability of self-image, interpersonal relationships, and affects. Further symptoms include impulsivity, intense anger, feelings of emptiness, strong abandonment fears, suicidal or self-mutilation behavior, and transient stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms. There is evidence that BPD can be reliably diagnosed and differentiated from other mental disorders by semi-structured interviews.

The disorder is associated with considerable functional impairment, intensive treatment utilization, and high societal costs. The risk of self-mutilation and suicide is high. In the general adult population, the lifetime prevalence of BPD has been reported to be from 0.7 to 2.7%, while its prevalence is about 12% in outpatient and 22% in inpatient psychiatric services. BPD is significantly associated with other mental disorders, including depressive disorders, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, bulimia nervosa, and other personality disorders.

There is convincing evidence to suggest that the interaction between genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences plays a central role in the etiology of BPD. In spite of considerable research, the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder remain to be clarified. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for BPD. Various approaches have been developed to address the complexities of the disorder.

### Understanding the development of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder in young people: a meta-review of systematic reviews [^11418UrU]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) is often difficult due to the high frequency of comorbidity and overlap of symptoms between the two disorders. The prevalence of BD and BPD was 21.6% and 18.5%, respectively. There is an ongoing debate over whether BPD should be considered as part of the spectrum of BD disorders or not.

Although BD and BPD are defined as distinct psychopathologies in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), there are many common features between these disorders that contribute to diagnostic confusion. The common features frequently stated in the literature include affective instability (AI), impulsivity, troubled relationships, distractibility, irritability, suicidality, flight of thoughts, and childhood adversity. The clinical evidence against the existence of a 'bipolar-borderline continuum' argues that although there are common symptoms between the two, they present these traits differently. However, in practical terms, these distinctions are far from clear, particularly when there is no history of manic episodes.

### Affective instability in borderline personality disorder: Experience sampling findings [^114ys1FE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Affective instability, defined as repeated, rapid, and abrupt shifts in mood, is considered the core pathology in borderline personality disorder. The temporal pattern of affective instability can be best captured with the experience sampling method — longitudinal assessment of people's affective states as they occur in real time and in their natural environment.

A review of the experience sampling studies published at the time of writing for borderline personality disorder suggests the following mood variability pattern: intense negative mood, more frequent and abrupt mood changes than healthy controls and patients with major depression, and partial triggering of affect by external events. The method also has great potential to investigate the links between affective instability and other psychological and behavioral correlates of the disorder, such as suicide, lack of self-esteem, and erratic behaviors. However, the method requires systematic study to determine the best data collection designs and mathematical models of mood variability.

### Diagnostic profiles among suicide decedents with and without borderline personality disorder [^115u2mgQ]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating condition characterized by pervasive instability across multiple major domains of functioning. The majority of persons with BPD engage in self-injury, and up to 10% die by suicide, rendering individuals with this condition at an exceptionally elevated risk of comorbidity and premature mortality. Better characterization of clinical risk factors among persons with BPD who die by suicide is urgently needed.

- **Methods**: We examined patterns of medical and psychiatric diagnoses (1580 to 1700 Phecodes) among persons with BPD who died by suicide (n = 379) via a large suicide death data resource and biobank. In phenotype-based phenome-wide association tests, we compared these individuals to three other groups: (1) persons who died by suicide without a history of BPD (n = 9468), (2) persons still living with a history of BPD diagnosis (n = 280), and (3) persons who died by suicide with a different personality disorder (other PD, n = 589).

- **Results**: Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that persons with BPD who died by suicide were more likely to present with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses and have a documented history of self-harm in the medical system prior to death, relative to suicides without BPD. Posttraumatic stress disorder was more elevated among those with BPD who died by suicide relative to the other PD group.

- **Conclusions**: We found significant differences among persons with BPD who died by suicide and all other comparison groups. Such differences may be clinically informative for identifying high-risk individuals.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^113qYUJC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Personality disorders can and do occur in people under 18, and no diagnostic criteria state they cannot. Patients can find having an accurate diagnostic label helpful; the correct diagnosis assists clinicians in providing appropriate treatments and offers a more realistic prognosis. Making such a diagnosis is not straightforward, given the complexity of adolescence, and is often better conducted over multiple assessments. It is also easier if the adolescent is older. The majority of evidence on personality disorders focuses on emotionally unstable/borderline personality disorder (BPD).

There is no evidence that any medication is effective for the core symptoms of BPD in adults or adolescents. There is limited evidence that medication is effective for co-morbid mental illness in adults with BPD and no evidence for this in adolescents. Instead, the mainstay of BPD treatment (in all age groups) is complex and integrates psychological therapy programmes. Notably, dialectical behaviour therapy and mentalisation-based treatment have been found effective in adolescents with BPD, although studies were limited by including mainly girls and only the subset of patients with BPD willing to participate in a treatment trial. It is also essential to address social factors (e.g. abuse, educational issues, stability of placement) in helping these patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of borderline personality disorder in young people [^111fhKUM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020).

- **Purpose of review**: We review recent research concerning the diagnosis and treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in young people. We examine evidence for the need to define an appropriate age for detection and the suitability of classification methods and treatment.

- **Recent findings**: Evidence supports early detection and intervention for subsyndromal borderline pathology or categorical BPD across an extended developmental period. A range of structured treatments is effective for BPD in young people, although the role of treatment components in successful outcomes is unclear. Substantial evidence suggests that a stronger focus on functional outcomes, especially social and vocational outcomes, is warranted. Effective treatments for BPD are rarely available internationally. There is a need to assess whether less complex interventions might be developed that are scalable across health systems. A clinical staging model should be considered, addressing clinical distress and co-occurring psychopathology, as well as diagnosis.

### Understanding the development of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder in young people: A meta-review of systematic reviews [^1156cSa4]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Our review has strengths. We utilized systematic search procedures to reduce the risk of bias and ensure comprehensive coverage of the literature. Inter-rater reliability was consistent, with no requirement for arbitration regarding the inclusion of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs). However, several limitations of the findings should be considered when interpreting the results.

First, we only included relevant prospective studies from the SRs and excluded primary studies with any other designs. This exclusion inhibited synthesizing the articles as a whole and reporting the pooled results from eligible MAs. Second, the evidence was limited by the data that included SRs and MAs, and some relevant prospective studies were inevitably missed.

Third, there were many non-systematic literature reviews, including prospective studies that the reviews we included missed. For example, Hartmann, Nelson, Ratheesh, Treen, and McGorry's scoping review provided additional evidence for family history of bipolar disorder (BD), subthreshold depression and hypomania, sleep disturbance, mood lability, and later BD conversion. They also provided data on impulsivity and fun-seeking, which was not investigated by the reviews included here.

Fourth, we were not able to conduct a meta-analysis due to substantial methodological and clinical heterogeneity with respect to cohort characteristics, such as study design and sample size among primary studies included in the reviews. Further, not being able to pool the data precluded definitively clarifying the timing and duration of the precursors, notwithstanding the heterogeneity in at-

### Prenatal adversity: A risk factor in borderline personality disorder [^115XbYZ4]. Psychological Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show a high prevalence of early adversity, such as childhood trauma. It has also been reported that prenatal adverse conditions, such as prenatal maternal stress, drug taking, tobacco smoking, or medical complications, may be associated with an increased risk of mental disorders in the offspring. Prenatal adversity is investigated here for the first time as a potential risk factor in the diagnosis of BPD.

A total of 100 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BPD and 100 matched healthy controls underwent semi-structured interviews about the course of pregnancy, maternal stressors, birth complications, and childhood trauma. Further information was obtained from the participants' mothers and from prenatal medical records.

- **Results**: Borderline patients were significantly more often exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions, such as prenatal tobacco exposure (p = 0.004), medical complications (p = 0.008), prenatal maternal traumatic stress (p = 0.015), familial conflicts (p = 0.004), low social support (p = 0.004), and partnership problems during pregnancy (p = 0.014). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the reported prenatal risk factors accounted for 25.7% of the variance in BPD. Prenatal tobacco exposure [odds ratio (OR) 3.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49–7.65, p = 0.004] and medical complications (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29–6.38, p = 0.010) emerged as important predictors. After controlling for childhood adversity and parental socio-economic status (SES), prenatal risk factors predicted relevant borderline subdomains.

### Psychological therapies for people with borderline personality disorder [^111S94gu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a relatively common personality disorder with a major impact on health services as those affected often present in crisis, frequently engaging in self-harming behavior.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of psychological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted a systematic search of 26 specialist and general bibliographic databases (as of December 2002) and searched relevant reference lists for further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: All relevant clinical randomized controlled trials involving psychological treatments for people with BPD were considered. The definition of psychological treatments included behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and psychoanalytic approaches.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently selected, quality-assessed, and extracted data from the studies. For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI), and where possible, the number needed to help/harm (NNT/H). For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred over change data. Non-skewed data from valid scales were aggregated using a weighted mean difference (WMD).

- **Main results**: We identified seven studies involving 262 people and five separate comparisons. A comparison of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) with treatment as usual found no difference for the outcome of still meeting SCID-II criteria for the diagnosis of BPD by six months (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.38) or for admission to the hospital in the previous three months (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.14). Self-harm or pa…

### Understanding the development of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder in young people: a meta-review of systematic reviews [^111SuLeo]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

There is ongoing debate on the nosological position of bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Identifying the unique and shared risks, developmental pathways, and symptoms in emerging BD and BPD could help the field refine aetiological hypotheses and improve the prediction of the onset of these disorders. This study aimed to:

- **Systematically synthesise**: the available evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) concerning environmental, psychosocial, biological, and clinical factors leading to the emergence of BD and BPD.
- **Identify main differences and common features**: between the two disorders to characterise their complex interplay.
- **Highlight remaining evidence gaps**: to direct future research.

- **Methods**: Data sources were PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, Medline, ISI Web of Science. Overlap of included SRs/MAs was assessed using the corrected covered area process. The methodological quality of each included SR and MA was assessed using the AMSTAR.

- **Results**: A total of 22 SRs and MAs involving 249 prospective studies met eligibility criteria. Results demonstrated that family history of psychopathology, affective instability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, sleep disturbances, substance abuse, psychotic symptoms, suicidality, childhood adversity, and temperament were common predisposing factors across both disorders. There are also distinct factors specific to emerging BD or BPD.

- **Conclusions**: Prospective studies are required to increase our understanding of the development of BD and BPD.

### The influence of borderline personality traits on clinical outcomes in bipolar disorder [^115hPD2z]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews suggest that comorbid borderline personality disorder is present in approximately 20% of individuals with bipolar disorder. Diagnostic systems are moving towards dimensional rather than categorical approaches to classifying personality pathology. This study aimed to examine the presence and severity of borderline personality traits in bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, and explore associations between the presence and severity of these traits and clinical outcomes in bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: Borderline personality traits were measured in 1,447 individuals with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (1,008 with bipolar I disorder and 439 with bipolar II disorder) using the Borderline Evaluation of Severity over Time (BEST) questionnaire. Lifetime clinical outcomes were assessed via the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) semi-structured interview and clinical case notes.

- **Results**: Borderline personality traits were common in both bipolar disorder groups, with 86.2% of participants reporting at least one trait. These included traits that overlap with (e.g. mood instability) and those distinct from the symptoms of bipolar disorder (e.g. fear of abandonment). Borderline personality traits were significantly more frequent and severe in bipolar II disorder compared to bipolar I disorder. More severe borderline traits, and even the presence of a single borderline personality trait, were significantly associated with younger age of bipolar disorder onset and a higher prevalence of lifetime alcohol misuse in both bipolar disorder groups.

### Identity disturbance, feelings of emptiness, and the boundaries of the schizophrenia spectrum [^1124qczY]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) became an official diagnosis in 1980, and its prevalence among psychiatric inpatients is now reported to be about 20%. Concomitantly, there has been a decline in the use of the hebephrenia (disorganized schizophrenia) diagnosis. It is not clear whether such changes in incidence reflect new patterns of psychopathology or are simply consequences of different diagnostic "popularities".

In a review of historical and psychopathological evidence of BPD, we have claimed that it is nearly impossible to distinguish BPD from the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, especially schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). Two BPD criteria, i.e. identity disturbance and chronic feelings of emptiness, distinguish — together with self-mutilating behavior — BPD from all other personality disorders. Unfortunately, these criteria remain insufficiently defined. What is it like to have an "unstable self-image or sense of self" or to experience "chronic feelings of emptiness"? Importantly, these symptoms are consistently found in the classical and recent literature on schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

The aim of this article is to examine the phenomenological nature of the concept of identity disturbance and feelings of emptiness and to clarify their diagnostic significance with respect to the differential diagnosis between BPD and the schizophrenia spectrum. After a historical outline of the criteria, we present a phenomenological explication of the concepts of identity and self and introduce a distinction between "core" and "narrative" selfhood.

### Risk factors for suicide completion in borderline personality disorder: A case-control study of cluster B comorbidity and impulsive aggression [^115jjhtk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder is a major risk factor for suicidal behavior, yet predicting suicide completion remains unclear. It has been proposed that impulsivity and aggression interact to increase suicide risk. Death by suicide in borderline personality disorder may result from impulsivity, a core feature of the disorder, interacting with violent-aggressive tendencies. Using a case-control design, this study investigated clinical and behavioral risk factors for suicide completion in individuals with borderline personality disorder.

- **Method**: One hundred twenty subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder were examined, consisting of 50 controls and 70 who died by suicide between 2001 and 2005. This was conducted using proxy-based interviews, structured diagnostic instruments, and personality trait assessments.

- **Results**: Individuals with borderline personality disorder who died by suicide had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations and suicide attempts compared to controls. They were also more likely to meet the criteria for lifetime substance dependence disorders and exhibited higher levels of Axis I comorbidity, novelty seeking, impulsivity, hostility, and comorbid personality disorders. Conversely, they displayed lower levels of harm avoidance. Critically, borderline personality disorder suicides were more likely to have cluster B comorbidity. Impulsivity and aggression interacted to predict suicide, although this association diminished after controlling for cluster B comorbidity.

- **Conclusions**: The study underlines the complexity of predicting suicide in individuals with borderline personality disorder, with cluster B comorbidity emerging as a significant factor.

### Maladaptive interpersonal schemas as sensitive and specific markers of borderline personality disorder among psychiatric inpatients [^1169rAZd]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and mood and psychotic disorders characterized by major mood episodes (i.e. major depressive, bipolar, and schizoaffective disorder) share marked overlap in symptom presentation, complicating differential diagnosis. The study tests the hypothesis that maladaptive interpersonal schemas (MIS) are characteristic of BPD, but not of the major mood disorders.

One hundred psychiatric inpatients were assessed by SCID I, SCID II, and the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-S2). Logistic regression analyses tested the association between MIS (measured by the YSQ-S2) and BPD, bipolar, major depressive, and schizoaffective disorder. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses assessed the sensitivity and specificity of MIS as a marker of BPD. After covariation for comorbidity with each of the three mood disorders, BPD was robustly associated with four out of five schema domains. In contrast, only one of fifteen regression analyses demonstrated a significant association between any mood disorder and schema domain after covariation for comorbid BPD.

ROC analyses of the five schema domains suggested that disconnection/rejection had the greatest power for identification of BPD cases. These data support the specific role of maladaptive interpersonal schemas in BPD and potentially contribute to greater conceptual clarity about the distinction between BPD and the major mood disorders.

### Axis I comorbidity in patients with borderline personality disorder: 6-year follow-up and prediction of time to remission [^114n3k9W]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Axis I disorders among patients with borderline personality disorder over six years of prospective follow-up.

A semistructured interview of demonstrated reliability was used to assess the presence or absence of comorbid Axis I disorders in 290 patients who met Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines criteria and DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder, and 72 patients who did not meet these criteria but did meet DSM-III-R criteria for another Axis II disorder. Over 94% of surviving patients were reinterviewed about their Axis I disorders at 2-year, 4-year, and 6-year follow-up periods.

Although patients with borderline personality disorder experienced declining rates of many Axis I disorders over time, the rates of these disorders remained high, particularly the rates of mood and anxiety disorders. Patients whose borderline personality disorder remitted over time experienced substantial declines in all comorbid disorders assessed, but those whose borderline personality disorder did not remit over time reported stable rates of comorbid disorders. When the absence of comorbid Axis I disorders was used to predict the time to remission, the absence of substance use disorders was a far stronger predictor of remission from borderline personality disorder than the absence of posttraumatic stress disorder, mood disorders, other anxiety disorders, or eating disorders, respectively.

The results of this study suggest that Axis I disorders are less common over time in patients with remitted borderline personality disorder.

### Confirmatory factor analysis of DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder: Findings from the collaborative longitudinal personality disorders study [^112yGCKH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

This study tested the factor structure of the DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder using confirmatory methods for the analysis of covariance structures in a large group from a multisite study.

- **Method**: A total of 668 primarily treatment-seeking subjects were reliably assessed for personality disorders using the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders. Associations among criteria for borderline personality disorder were examined. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test diagnosis as a unitary construct and to test an earlier-reported three-factor model comprising disturbed relatedness, behavioral dysregulation, and affective dysregulation. The three-factor model was subsequently tested using a subset (N = 498) of the study group that was reassessed 2 years later by independent evaluators who were blind to original diagnoses.

- **Results**: Internal consistency of the borderline personality disorder diagnosis was adequate for both baseline and follow-up assessments. A confirmatory factor analysis model testing the borderline personality disorder diagnosis as a unitary construct provided a good fit, and the three-factor model offered a significantly better fit for the baseline assessment. The three-factor model was replicated with the 2-year follow-up data.

- **Conclusions**: The diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder appear to reflect a statistically coherent construct. Three homogeneous components were supported empirically, lending conceptual clarity to different classes of the criteria for borderline personality disorder.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^115Tw1qJ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug treatments for people with borderline personality disorder that reported clinical outcomes. We did not consider studies that concentrated on neurobiological outcomes or tested the immediate effects of a once-administered substance. In March 2020, we searched the CENTRAL database of the Cochrane Library for relevant publications from 2015 onward. We also traced back references of study trial register records cited as ongoing studies in our 2015 review to identify corresponding full publications. Finally, we searched trial registers, including the EudraCT register using the term "borderline personality disorder", the ISRCTN registry (studies with the inclusion criterion "borderline personality disorder" and "borderline personality disorder AND interventional studies"), and the WHO meta-register ICTRP ("borderline personality disorder").

If study results were posted on trial registries without statistical analysis, we statistically compared treatment groups by calculating either standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes or risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes from post-treatment values, data permitting.

### Prediction of the 10-year course of borderline personality disorder [^115rnBQ7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the most clinically relevant baseline predictors of time to remission for patients with borderline personality disorder.

- **Method**: A total of 290 inpatients meeting criteria for both the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-III-R for borderline personality disorder were assessed during their index admission with a series of semistructured interviews and self-report measures. Diagnostic status was reassessed at five contiguous 2-year time periods. Discrete survival analytic methods, which controlled for baseline severity of borderline psychopathology and time, were used to estimate hazard ratios.

- **Results**: Eighty-eight percent of the patients with borderline personality disorder studied achieved remission. In terms of time to remission, 39.3% of the 242 patients who experienced a remission of their disorder first remitted by their 2-year follow-up, an additional 22.3% first remitted by their 4-year follow-up, an additional 21.9% by their 6-year follow-up, an additional 12.8% by their 8-year follow-up, and another 3.7% by their 10-year follow-up. Sixteen variables were found to be significant bivariate predictors of earlier time to remission. Seven of these remained significant in multivariate analyses: younger age, absence of childhood sexual abuse, no family history of substance use disorder, good vocational record, absence of an anxious cluster personality disorder, low neuroticism, and high agreeableness.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this study suggest that prediction of time to remission from borderline personality disorder can be informed by several baseline variables.

### Toward integrated treatment for co-occurring borderline personality disorder and eating disorders: A clinician perspective [^116a4gJp]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental health condition causing significant functional impairment and frequent co-occurrence with other psychiatric conditions. Primary features of BPD include a pervasive pattern of emotional instability, impulsivity, and interpersonal difficulties, along with a high incidence of deliberate self-harm and death by suicide. BPD is highly relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders (ED). Prevalence varies by subtype, with BPD co-occurring in 25% of people with anorexia nervosa (AN) binge-eating purging type and in 24.8% of people with bulimia nervosa (BN). It is notable that BPD and ED share some diagnostic features, with impulsivity and affective instability thought to give rise to chronically disturbed eating behaviors and weight preoccupation. Bingeing and purging are particularly common in people with a borderline personality structure.

### Psychotic-like reasoning styles in patients with borderline personality disorder? An experimental investigation of the jumping to conclusions bias [^116PtQdF]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) was initially conceptualized as a psychological condition at the interface of neurosis and psychosis or even a rather mild form of schizophrenia. There is ongoing interest in the similarities and differences between patients with BPD and those who meet diagnostic criteria for psychosis in relation to psychotic symptoms. Almost half of patients with BPD report hallucinations, which are indistinguishable from hallucinations in schizophrenia. Patients with BPD frequently display paranoid ideation. For example, Kingdon et al. found that 29% of patients with BPD who did not meet criteria for schizophrenia reported paranoid delusions. They also exhibit schizotypal cognitions, such as marked superstitiousness or 'quasi‐psychotic' thoughts, which are defined as delusions present only transiently or circumscribed in content.

### Understanding the development of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder in young people: a meta-review of systematic reviews [^112HnuKT]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Overlapping data for BD and BPD studies

The 17 included systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) for BD comprised 250 overlapping individual studies, of which 145 were unique. Five included SRs and MAs for BPD comprised 74 overlapping individual studies, of which 64 were unique. A citation matrix presenting all the included SRs and MAs on BD and BPD in columns and index publications in rows, along with pairwise CCA tables, are provided in online Supplementary Tables S8, S9, Figs S1 and S2. As CCA is estimated at 0.03 for BD studies and 0.04 for BPD studies, the overlap is in the low range, reflecting a low risk of skewed reporting [Pieper et al.].

- **Assessment of methodological quality**: Based on the findings from AMSTAR ratings performed to evaluate the methodological quality of the included SRs/MAs, the majority of the reviews were deemed to be high quality. Details can be seen in online Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, with full assessments provided in online Supplementary Tables S6 and S7.

- **Synthesis of results**: Online Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 summarize the findings of SRs/MAs, respectively. A summary of the shared factors in emerging BD and BPD can be seen in Table 1. The evidence for developmental precursors that are prospectively related to BD and BPD outcomes is presented below; however, the vulnerability factors can be found in the online supplementary materials.

Similarities and differences in shared factors in emerging bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder

We define the precursors as including clinical symptoms, signs or syndromes, prodromes, and biomarkers, alongside vulnerability risk factors.

### Is dimensional scoring important only for subthreshold levels of severity in personality disorders other than borderline [^111hQ8V2]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Research assessing the utility of dimensional and categorical models of personality disorders (PDs) overwhelmingly supports the use of continuous over categorical models. Using borderline PD as an example, recent studies from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project suggested that continuous (criteria count) scoring of PDs is most informative for "subthreshold" levels of pathology but is less important once a patient meets the diagnostic threshold. Using PD criteria count, the study compared seven indices of psychosocial morbidity for patients above and below the diagnostic threshold for three additional PDs: paranoid, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive. Results showed that for all tested PDs, only the number of Axis I disorders was more correlated with PD criteria in the subthreshold group as compared to those who met criteria for the disorder. Results for the remaining six indices of psychosocial morbidity varied by PD tested.

### Diagnostic profiles among suicide decedents with and without borderline personality disorder [^114TUELJ]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating condition characterized by pervasive instability across multiple major domains of functioning. The majority of persons with BPD engage in self-injury, and up to 10% die by suicide, placing them at exceptionally elevated risk of comorbidity and premature mortality. Better characterization of clinical risk factors among persons with BPD who die by suicide is urgently needed.

- **Methods**: We examined patterns of medical and psychiatric diagnoses (1,580 to 1,700 Phecodes) among persons with BPD who died by suicide (n = 379) using a large suicide death data resource and biobank. In phenotype-based phenome-wide association tests, we compared these individuals to three other groups: (1) persons who died by suicide without a history of BPD (n = 9,468), (2) persons still living with a history of BPD diagnosis (n = 280), and (3) persons who died by suicide with a different personality disorder (other PD n = 589).

- **Results**: Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that persons with BPD who died by suicide were more likely to present with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses and to have a documented history of self-harm in the medical system prior to death, relative to suicides without BPD. Posttraumatic stress disorder was more elevated among those with BPD who died by suicide relative to the other PD group.

- **Conclusions**: We found significant differences among persons with BPD who died by suicide and all other comparison groups. Such differences may be clinically informative for identifying high-risk individuals.

### Borderline personality and psychotropic medication prescription in an outpatient psychiatry clinic [^1112HwcC]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Borderline personality is a complex disorder, and pharmacological intervention is typically focused on target symptoms. Previous studies indicate that patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are prescribed a greater number of psychotropic medications than those without BPD. However, these studies were self-reported in design and/or conducted before the use of newer psychotropic medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

In this study, we explored among 280 psychiatric outpatients the relationships between an axis II diagnosis of BPD and the number of axis I diagnoses, psychotropic medications, and psychotherapy sessions. Compared to those with other types of personality disorders (n = 128) or no personality disorder at all (n = 91), those with BPD (n = 61) were diagnosed with significantly more axis I disorders, prescribed significantly more psychotropic medications, and attended significantly more psychotherapy sessions.

These findings suggest that BPD patients will probably be prescribed more psychotropic medications than other psychiatric outpatients. In addition to psychotropic medication prescriptions, there may be additional variables, such as psychotherapy sessions, that make a meaningful contribution to the overall healthcare utilization among those with BPD.

### Differential diagnosis of bipolar II disorder and borderline personality disorder [^1157aZda]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Differentiating bipolar (BP) disorders, particularly BP II, from borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common diagnostic dilemma. This review critically examines recent studies that explore clinical differences between BP II and BPD, potentially advancing their delineation.

Recent studies have focused on differentiating biological parameters such as genetics, epigenetics, diurnal rhythms, and structural and functional neuroimaging. However, these indicative differences are not yet sufficient to guide diagnosis. Key differentiating factors include family history, developmental antecedents, illness course, phenomenological differences in mood states, personality style, and relationship factors. Less differentiating factors encompass impulsivity, neuropsychological profiles, gender distribution, comorbidity, and treatment response.

This review highlights parameters that offer differentiation between BP II and BPD, assisting in resolving a frequent diagnostic dilemma. Future studies should specifically examine the BP II subtype directly with BPD to aid in sharpening the distinction between the disorders.

### Borderline symptoms at age 12 signal risk for poor outcomes during the transition to adulthood: Findings from a genetically sensitive longitudinal cohort study [^113FB3RU]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by pervasive instability in a person's mood, sense of self, impulse control, and interpersonal relationships. In adults, borderline personality disorder is considered a valid diagnosis by most clinicians. In adolescents, the diagnosis is more controversial. Although diagnostic classification systems allow for a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in adolescence, clinicians are reluctant to assess and treat borderline symptoms prior to adulthood. Among the reasons cited for this reluctance are concerns that adolescents' borderline symptoms may be transient; that a diagnosis could be stigmatizing; that personality development is still in flux; and that some borderline symptoms, such as impulsivity and difficulty in establishing a sense of identity, are inseparable from what is thought to be a normative degree of storm and stress during adolescence. In this study, we addressed concerns about the validity of adolescent borderline pathology by testing the prognostic significance of borderline symptoms in 12-year-old adolescents for psychosocial adjustment during the transition to adulthood, at age 18 years.

### Toward integrated treatment for co-occurring borderline personality disorder and eating disorders: A clinician perspective [^111zuqUc]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). High credibility.

It is common practice in Australia for co-occurring borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorders (ED) to be treated separately. This research aims to review features shared by these disorders and evidence-based approaches used for treating these disorders in isolation. It also examines clinicians' experiences of delivering treatment for co-occurring BPD and ED, and explores integrated approaches to treating this dual diagnosis.

A qualitative approach was employed to examine interview transcripts of 10 clinicians working at specialist outpatient services for severe BPD or severe ED. These transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Shared features identified for BPD and ED were emotion dysregulation, impulsivity, and interpersonal difficulties. Clinicians supported various therapeutic approaches for this dual diagnosis patient group and advocated for an eclectic approach that combines treatment features. Most clinicians recommended an ideal program duration of 6–12 months, noting that group and individual therapies complement each other to address underlying behavioral drivers and bring lasting clinical benefits.

This study highlights the importance of adopting integrated treatments for individuals with this dual diagnosis to optimize treatment outcomes. Future research could involve gathering client perspectives on using an integrated treatment approach and conducting trials to assess its acceptability, feasibility, and longer-term outcomes.

### Crisis interventions for adults with borderline personality disorder [^116bR2mZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

People diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) frequently present to healthcare services in crisis, often with suicidal thoughts or actions. Despite this, little is known about what constitutes effective management of acute crises in this population and what type of interventions are helpful at times of crisis. In this review, we examine the efficacy of crisis interventions, defined as an immediate response by one or more individuals to the acute distress experienced by another individual, designed to ensure safety and recovery and lasting no longer than one month. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review examining the evidence for the effects of crisis interventions in adults diagnosed with BPD.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of crisis interventions in adults diagnosed with BPD in any setting.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and three trials registers up to January 2022. We also checked reference lists, handsearched relevant journal archives, and contacted experts in the field to identify any unpublished or ongoing studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing crisis interventions with usual care, no intervention, or waiting list in adults of any age diagnosed with BPD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included two studies with 213 participants. One study (88 participants) was a feasibility RCT conducted in the UK that examined the effects of joint crisis plans (JCPs) plus additional interventions.

### A life span perspective on borderline personality disorder [^116vapp8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The term "borderline" was first coined by Adolph Stern in 1938 when he identified a "border line group of patients" who "fit frankly neither into the psychotic nor into the psychoneurotic group, and are extremely difficult to handle by any psychotherapeutic method". The acceptance of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 3rd edition in 1980 has stimulated both clinical and scientific attention. BPD is characterized by impulsivity, self-harm, suicidality, and emotional and interpersonal instability. DSM-5, like DSM-IV, allows diagnosing BPD under the age of 18 if the symptoms are pervasive, persistent, not limited to a particular developmental stage or another mental disorder, and if the symptoms have been present for at least one year.

The categorical DSM concept of BPD, and personality disorders in general, has been criticized due to its heterogeneity, diagnostic overlap with other disorders, arbitrary threshold, low reliability, and poor empirical base. Factor analytic studies found support for one general factor of personality pathology underlying the nine criteria of BPD. Moreover, BPD presents with many comorbid disorders. Due to these limitations, a growing number of studies focus on dimensional models of personality disorders, such as the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD) in the DSM-5 and the new personality disorder concept of the International Classifications of Diseases 11th Edition (ICD-11). Both models combine a severity dimension.

### Fluidity of the subsyndromal phenomenology of borderline personality disorder over 16 years of prospective follow-up [^112u7uh4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the cumulative rates of 2- and 4-year remission and the recurrences that follow them, of 24 symptoms of borderline personality disorder over 16 years of prospective follow-up.

The method involved assessing a total of 290 inpatients meeting rigorous criteria for borderline personality disorder and 72 axis II comparison subjects during their index admission using a series of semistructured diagnostic interviews. The same instruments were readministered at eight contiguous 2-year time periods.

The results indicated that the 12 acute symptoms (e.g. self-mutilation, help-seeking suicide attempts) of borderline personality disorder were more likely to remit for a period of 2 years and for a period of 4 years than the 12 temperamental symptoms (e.g. chronic anger/frequent angry acts, intolerance of aloneness) of this disorder. They were also less likely to recur following a remission lasting 2 years or a remission lasting 4 years.

In conclusion, the symptoms of borderline personality disorder are quite fluid, with remissions and recurrences being common. However, the more clinically urgent acute symptoms of borderline personality disorder seem to have a better prognosis than the less turbulent temperamental symptoms of the disorder.

### What should be done with antisocial personality disorder in the new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) [^115xKvzo]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Overall, mental illness should primarily be diagnosed so that patients can obtain optimal treatment. A secondary aim should be to safeguard society against dangerous individuals. For a disorder such as antisocial personality disorder, both aims are highly relevant. If patients diagnosed as having antisocial personality disorder do not receive treatment, it may simply be because there is no way to help such patients, or because such patients are all 'treatment rejecting'.

Do we know for a fact that people with antisocial personality disorder cannot be treated? Experience with other types of psychiatric illness suggests that there are barriers to treatment, not all of which are intrinsic to the disorder itself. For example, the stigma attached to mental illness, the belief that available treatments will not be helpful, and the basic level of public awareness of the nature of mental illness may all impact the behavior of both the patients and their family members, and also the behavior of service providers.

Few treatments have been tested for antisocial or psychopathic personality disorder. A review of psychosocial treatments for antisocial personality disorder found 11 studies in total. However, only two of these studies can be considered to tailor specifically for antisocial personality disorder. Nevertheless, findings reviewed across a range of areas revealed that patients with antisocial personality disorder are able to respond to treatment options designed to target a number of the symptoms associated with this condition.

### Borderline personality disorder [^113hSxma]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental disorder with a high burden on patients, family members, and health-care systems. The condition was previously regarded as untreatable, but progress in understanding and management has resulted in earlier diagnosis and better treatment outcomes. A coherent syndrome of BPD typically onsets during adolescence (after age 12 years). BPD is often preceded by, or co-develops with, symptoms of internalizing disorders (depression and anxiety), externalizing disorders (conduct problems, hyperactivity, and substance use), or both. BPD is associated with various poor outcomes, including low occupational and educational attainment, lack of long-term relationships, increased partner conflict, sexual risk-taking, low levels of social support, low life satisfaction, and increased service use.

Psychotherapy is the main treatment for BPD; drug treatment is only indicated for comorbid conditions that require medication, or during a crisis if psychosocial interventions are insufficient. Awareness of BPD by non-specialists, as well as specialists, is key to appropriate early intervention.

### Mentalization-based therapy for borderline personality disorder: State-of-the-science and future directions [^113BnYrY]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Low credibility.

Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) is an evidence-based treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the second most studied psychotherapeutic intervention for this disorder. Despite its growing prominence, there is a lack of focused reviews summarizing the evidence base from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). This review aims to address this gap and highlight directions for future research.

- **Methods**: This narrative review synthesizes findings from RCTs evaluating MBT for BPD. Building on the seven studies identified in the Cochrane review by Storebø et al. (2020), we conducted an updated search to incorporate RCTs published up to 1st April 2025, expanding the evidence base to 14 trials. Eligible studies were assessed for effectiveness outcomes and methodological quality.

- **Results**: While some trials report improvements in BPD symptoms and interpersonal functioning, significant limitations exist. Research has largely focused on symptom reduction, despite concerns about the validity of categorical PD diagnoses. The trials were predominantly conducted in European settings, involving primarily female participants, and did not sufficiently account for BPD severity, comorbidities, or developmental stages. All identified RCTs were at high risk of bias, with significant issues involving attention, attrition, and allegiance bias.

- **Conclusions**: MBT shows promise, but methodological shortcomings and limited generalizability constrain its evidence base. Future research should prioritize rigorously designed trials with diverse samples and assess core personality dysfunction.

### Borderline personality disorder [^115hZNLw]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in affect regulation, impulse control, interpersonal relationships, and self-image. Clinical signs of the disorder include emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression, repeated self-injury, and chronic suicidal tendencies, which make these patients frequent users of mental-health resources. Causal factors are only partly known, but genetic factors and adverse events during childhood, such as physical and sexual abuse, contribute to the development of the disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy and psychodynamic partial hospital programs are effective treatments for out-of-control patients, and drug therapy can reduce depression, anxiety, and impulsive aggression. More research is needed for the understanding and management of this disabling clinical condition. Strategies are focusing on the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder and the development and dissemination of better and more cost-effective treatments to clinicians.

### Treatment of personality disorder [^111763oR]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

The evidence base for the effective treatment of personality disorders is insufficient. Most existing evidence pertains to the treatment of borderline personality disorder, yet it is limited by small sample sizes and short follow-ups in clinical trials, the wide range of core outcome measures used by studies, and poor control of coexisting psychopathology. Psychological or psychosocial intervention is recommended as the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder, while pharmacotherapy is only advised as an adjunctive treatment. Research on the underlying abnormal psychological or biological processes leading to the manifestation of a disordered personality is increasing. This research could lead to more effective interventions. The synergistic or antagonistic interaction of psychotherapies and drugs for treating personality disorder should be studied, particularly their mechanisms of change throughout the development of each.

### Understanding the development of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder in young people: A meta-review of systematic reviews [^113jjXJU]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Inclusion criteria were that systematic reviews (SRs) or meta-analyses (MAs) had to contain at least one relevant prospective study, with a minimum of two structured clinical assessments and a diagnostic outcome at the follow-up of bipolar disorder (BD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) onset, prodrome, features, or symptoms. It was also necessary to measure the precursor and/or vulnerability factor related to BD/BPD outcomes before the assessment of BD or BPD. The reviews had to include clinical, high-risk, or community populations and studies assessing BD or BPD through fully, semi-, or unstructured interviews conducted by mental health professionals, symptom checklists, self-reports, or self-reported questionnaires. These are based on standard classification systems such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) by the World Health Organization or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) by the American Psychiatric Association. Reviews also needed to report group comparisons between participants with BD or BPD and healthy or clinical controls on any factor related to the BD or BPD outcome.

	- **Exclusion criteria**: Reviews were excluded if they only included intervention, cross-sectional, or other studies where the exposure was collected retrospectively without any relevant prospective study. Dissertation papers, books, book chapters, editorials, letters, or conference proceedings were also excluded, as were reviews including studies that did not report precursors of transitions or symptoms/features. Genetic studies were excluded, as was any review where the full text of the manuscript was not available.

- **Study selection and data management**: A bespoke data extraction form was developed in Microsoft Excel before the manuscript review process. Two independent reviewers were involved in this process.

### Can neuroimaging be used as a support to diagnosis of borderline personality disorder? An approach based on computational neuroanatomy and machine learning [^115ohn5Z]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Several recent studies in the literature have identified brain morphological alterations associated with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) patients. These findings are reported by studies based on voxel-based morphometry analysis of structural MRI data, comparing mean gray matter concentration between groups of BPD patients and healthy controls. However, mean differences between groups are not informative about the discriminative value of neuroimaging data to predict the group of individual subjects.

In this paper, we aim to go beyond mean differences analyses and explore to what extent individual BPD patients can be differentiated from controls (25 subjects in each group), using a combination of automated morphometric tools for regional cortical thickness/volumetric estimation and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The approach included a feature selection step to identify the regions containing the most discriminative information. The accuracy of this classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-subject-out procedure.

The brain regions identified as containing relevant information to discriminate between groups were the orbitofrontal, rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and middle temporal cortices, among others. These areas, which are distinctively involved in the emotional and affective regulation of BPD patients, were the most informative regions for achieving both sensitivity and specificity values of 80% in SVM classification. The findings suggest that this new methodology can add clinical and potential diagnostic value to neuroimaging of psychiatric disorders.

### Diagnosis and treatment of borderline personality disorder in the college mental health setting [^112wcwK3]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The impact of borderline personality disorder (BPD) on college students is not well studied, and there is currently little data about its phenomenology or treatment in this population. We review the available literature regarding evidence-based treatment for BPD on college campuses, as well as best-practice guidelines for the treatment of mental illness in the college setting. Diagnostic disclosure and psychoeducation are proposed as practical first steps in improving the treatment landscape.

Preliminary studies of targeted treatment for BPD on college campuses are promising. They suggest that even pared-down interventions have the potential to help students feel better and function better. Experts in college mental health treatment emphasize the importance of gathering data, intervening early, communicating across treatment environments, appropriately marshaling resources, and providing psychoeducation. To bring the on-campus treatment of BPD in line with best-practice guidelines, improved diagnostic practices are needed. Disclosing the diagnosis of BPD and educating students about this disorder are simple yet powerful interventions that can set the stage for further treatment and provide symptom relief.

### A life span perspective on borderline personality disorder [^116xZarM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide an update on a life span perspective regarding borderline personality disorder (BPD). The life span course of BPD is addressed, with discussions on possible implications for assessment, treatment, and research.

Recent findings indicate that BPD first manifests in adolescence and can be reliably distinguished from normal adolescent development. The course of BPD from adolescence to late life is characterized by a symptomatic switch from affective dysregulation, impulsivity, and suicidality to maladaptive interpersonal functioning and enduring functional impairments, with subsequent remission and relapse. Dimensional models of BPD appear more age-neutral and more useful across the entire life span.

- **Age-specific interventions**: There is a need for age-specific interventions across the life span, as BPD symptoms and impairments tend to wax and wane from adolescence to old age, with presentation depending on contextual factors. Our understanding of the onset and early course of BPD is growing, but knowledge of BPD in late life is limited.

- **Diagnostic models**: Although the categorical criteria of DSM allow for reliable diagnosis of BPD in adolescence, dimensional models appear both more age-neutral and useful up to late life. To account for the fluctuating expression of BPD and to guide development and selection of treatment across the life span, a clinical staging model for BPD holds promise.

### A life span perspective on borderline personality disorder [^115X8stY]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

There is accumulating knowledge on the onset and course of BPD across the lifespan. Our understanding of the onset and early course of BPD is growing, but knowledge of BPD in late life is still very limited. BPD first manifests itself in adolescence and can be distinguished reliably from normative adolescent development. BPD symptoms and impairments continue to wax and wane up to old age, and their expression depends on contextual and developmental factors.

The course of BPD from adolescence to adulthood is characterized by a symptomatic switch from predominantly symptoms of affective instability and impulsivity to maladaptive interpersonal functioning and enduring functional impairments, with subsequent periods of remission and relapse of the full categorical BPD diagnosis. Although the categorical criteria of DSM allow for reliable diagnosis of BPD in adolescence, dimensional models appear both more age neutral and especially more useful in later life. To guide early intervention and better treatment selection across the lifespan, a clinical staging model for BPD holds promise.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^1156MK6j]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We are facing a manifest gap between evidence and practice. In order to enable people affected by BPD as well as clinicians to make informed decisions, more RCTs are needed. On the one hand, these should replicate previous research where positive findings were observed in single, small studies. On the other hand, under-researched areas need to be approached. Medication use, especially SSRIs, is often justified by the prevalence of comorbid disorders, particularly depression, but there is a clear lack of studies focusing on participants with distinct comorbidities.

In terms of interventions, we need more RCTs evaluating the highly used drugs like SSRIs and quetiapine. Fortunately, there are first new efforts from the industry to evaluate new substances in explanatory trials. As long as there is no definite conclusion about any substance being effective, trials should include a placebo comparison group. Outcome assessment should include BPD-specific pathology and pathology related to comorbid conditions if comorbid samples are in focus.

Psychosocial functioning has been found to be crucial for judging mid- and long-term effects and should also be assessed. Adverse events should be regularly monitored in a standardized way. Lastly, observation periods should last sufficiently long to reflect clinical practice and to allow for drawing conclusions about beneficial effects.

Our working group is currently working on an update of the 2010 Cochrane review. Based on comprehensive searches, we intend to review and statistically integrate the available evidence.

### Examining associations of borderline personality disorder symptoms and eating disorder diagnoses: Results from a US representative sample [^116VyRaf]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorders (EDs) are common comorbid diagnoses. Given the various combinations of borderline personality disorder symptoms (BPDS) that can comprise a diagnosis, understanding whether specific BPDS are more likely to be associated with an ED (anorexia nervosa [AN], bulimia nervosa [BN], and binge eating disorder [BED]) is important for the conceptualization and treatment of BPD-ED comorbidity.

This study used data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III) study, a nationally representative dataset of US adults (N = 36,309). The association of BPDS with EDs, compared with psychiatric and healthy control groups, was examined in two binomial and two multinomial (i.e. with all ED diagnoses) models.

Compared with the healthy control group, affect instability, emptiness, impulsivity, self-injurious behaviors, and unstable relationships were positively associated with any ED diagnosis (AN, BN, or BED). Compared with the psychiatric control group, impulsivity was positively associated with any ED diagnosis. In the multinomial model with the healthy control group, impulsivity and self-injurious behaviors were positively associated with AN, BN, and BED; emptiness was positively associated with AN and BED; and unstable relationships and affect instability were positively associated with BED. In the multinomial model with the psychiatric control group, self-injurious behaviors were positively associated with AN, and impulsivity and affect instability were positively associated with the others.

### Recent advances in the developmental aspects of borderline personality disorder [^117DHxqN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the paper was to review the most recent advances in the developmental aspects of borderline personality disorder (BPD) over the last three years to highlight the most significant trends in the field. In doing so, we identify and discuss two exciting new trends:

- **An emphasis on the biological basis of adolescent BPD**: Empirical evidence supports long-held theories of BPD development. These trends suggest that, for the first time, empirical findings are beginning to emerge supporting complex and reciprocal interactions between biology and environment over time in the development of BPD.

We discuss the emerging literature and highlight the translational impact of this work for the assessment and intervention of adolescent BPD.

### Diagnostic efficiency of borderline personality disorder criteria in hospitalized adolescents: comparison with hospitalized adults [^112FUAqw]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The authors explored the diagnostic efficiency of borderline personality disorder criteria in adolescent inpatients, comparing it to a group of concurrently recruited adult inpatients.

Adolescents (N = 123) and adults (N = 106) underwent reliable assessments with the Personality Disorder Examination, a semistructured diagnostic interview for DSM-III-R personality disorders. Sixty-five adolescents and 50 adults met the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder. Conditional probabilities were calculated to determine which borderline personality disorder criteria were most efficient as inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analyses of adolescents and adults were conducted separately, and the results were compared.

There were no significant differences between groups regarding the base rates of the borderline personality disorder diagnosis nor for any criterion. For adolescents, the best inclusion criterion was abandonment fears, while for adults, all symptoms were approximately equivalent in this aspect. The most efficient exclusion criterion was uncontrolled anger for adolescents and impulsiveness for adults.

In hospitalized patients, borderline personality disorder and its symptoms are as frequent in adolescents as in adults. Despite these surface similarities in symptom patterns, several differences were found at the level of diagnostic efficiency for individual criteria.

### Omega-3 fatty acid treatment of women with borderline personality disorder: A double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^111UHESx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) versus a placebo in treating female subjects with borderline personality disorder.

- **Method**: The authors conducted an 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of E-EPA in 30 female subjects who met the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder.

- **Results**: Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1 g of E-EPA, while 10 subjects received a placebo. Ninety percent of participants in both groups completed all 8 weeks of the trial. Analyses using random-effects regression modeling, which controlled for baseline severity, demonstrated that E-EPA was superior to placebo in reducing aggression and the severity of depressive symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: The results suggest that E-EPA may be a safe and effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe borderline personality disorder.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for borderline personality disorder, specifically in relation to safety planning for suicide, the 2022 guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend advising on safety planning to reduce suicide risk, as suicidality is higher in patients with borderline personality disorder than in the general population.

### Assessing the contribution of borderline personality disorder and features to suicide risk in psychiatric inpatients with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizoaffective disorder [^115r7P6s]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Suicidal behavior often accompanies both borderline personality disorder (BPD) and severe mood disorders, and comorbidity between the two appears to further increase suicide risk. The study aims to quantify the risk of suicidality conferred by comorbid BPD diagnosis or features in three affective disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP), and schizoaffective disorder.

One hundred forty-nine psychiatric inpatients were assessed using SCID I and II, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Logistic regression analyses investigated the associations between previous suicide attempts and BPD diagnosis or features in patients with MDD, BP, and schizoaffective disorder, as well as a history of manic or major depressive episodes and psychotic symptoms.

Comorbid BPD diagnosis significantly increased suicide risk in the whole sample, and in those with MDD, BP, and a history of depressive episodes or psychotic symptoms. Each additional borderline feature also increased the risk of past suicide attempts in these same groups (excepting BP) and in those with a previous manic episode. Of the BPD criteria, only unstable relationships and impulsivity independently predicted past suicide attempts. Overall, among patients with severe mood disorders, the presence of comorbid BPD features or disorder appears to substantially increase the risk of suicide attempts.

### Personality disorder coverage, prevalence, and convergence: Do the's two models of personality disorder identify the same patients [^115WB2No]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The AMPD advances understanding of personality disorders (PD) theoretically by distinguishing between function and form, specifically by separating personality dysfunction (Criterion A) – the core aspect of PD that is shared across all personality pathology – from the way personality dysfunction is expressed via personality traits (Criterion B). Although this theoretical distinction has some empirical support (e.g. Hopwood et al; Sharp et al.), most measures of Criterion A and B overlap considerably. Moreover, results are mixed regarding whether Criterion A has incremental predictive power over Criterion B, whereas Criterion B almost always shows incremental predictive power over Criterion A. Criterion A is also strongly correlated with clinical syndromes as well as PDs, indicating that measures of the construct are not specific to PD. Taken together, these data, along with considerable other data published since 2013, suggest that a shift to the AMPD is promising, although there remain areas for improvement, particularly in its assessment.

- **Practical considerations**: In the introduction, we noted that use of a semi-structured interview may be impractical in many clinical settings. However, given the importance of accurate diagnosis, it may be time for the field to determine how best to incorporate reliable and valid measures into standard clinical practice. This would provide a means for clinicians to use the AMPD to characterize all their PD patients' personality pathology, rather than just a subset.
