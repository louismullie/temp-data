## Question

Management of hypophosphatasia in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of hypophosphatasia in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing HPP from other hypophosphatemic disorders. Then, I should assess disease severity and complications to guide treatment decisions. Next, I will consider when to initiate enzyme replacement therapy versus supportive care, outline dosing and monitoring for asfotase alfa, and integrate multidisciplinary management. Finally, I will address special scenarios like pregnancy, surgery, and dental care, and close with a practical follow-up algorithm and key takeaways, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation, because misclassification is common and consequential. The biochemical hallmark is persistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase, and I need to ensure I am not applying adult reference ranges to younger patients or missing age-specific norms, as that leads to under-recognition of HPP [^116sUSJP] [^114sULVf]. Wait, let me verify the confirmatory tests: plasma pyridoxal-5′-phosphate and urinary phosphoethanolamine are typically elevated in HPP, and ALPL sequencing confirms the genetic diagnosis when available, which helps exclude other causes of low ALP and supports cascade testing in families [^114kkGr2] [^114sULVf]. I should also double-check that I am not conflating HPP with FGF23-mediated phosphate wasting; in HPP, serum phosphate is usually normal or high-normal, whereas XLH presents with hypophosphatemia due to renal phosphate wasting, so distinguishing these entities is critical to avoid inappropriate phosphate therapy in HPP [^114kkGr2].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype in adults to align treatment with burden. Adults with HPP commonly have musculoskeletal pain, recurrent metatarsal or femoral fractures, chondrocalcinosis, early tooth loss, and sometimes odontohypophosphatasia, and I need to check for these systematically because they shape goals of care and monitoring priorities [^114yATAb] [^114kkGr2]. Hold on, I should verify that radiographs can show osteopenia or osteomalacia but may be subtle in milder adult forms, so clinical correlation with low ALP and substrate accumulation remains essential to avoid anchoring on osteoporosis alone [^114kkGr2].

> I will now examine disease severity and complications to decide on therapy. Severe or life-threatening presentations in childhood warrant urgent enzyme replacement, but in adults I should weigh fracture burden, pain, mobility impairment, respiratory involvement, and dental disease, while also screening for ectopic calcifications and renal function given potential complications and the need for baseline surveillance before treatment [^116m3uLM] [^116qQEjv]. Let me consider that adults with recurrent fractures, pseudofractures, or significant functional limitation are appropriate candidates for asfotase alfa, whereas asymptomatic adults with isolated low ALP may be observed with close follow-up, recognizing that evidence in adults is more limited than in pediatric populations [^116m3uLM] [^114yATAb].

> Now, I need to ensure I am not overlooking a key contraindication: bisphosphonates and denosumab can worsen impaired mineralization in HPP and should be avoided, so I should confirm medication history and explicitly counsel against these agents before initiating any osteoporosis-directed therapy [^116m3uLM] [^114sULVf]. But wait, what if the patient was already on an antiresorptive? I should stop it and allow a washout period before starting asfotase alfa when feasible, documenting the rationale and monitoring for clinical deterioration during withdrawal [^114c1cKU].

> For asfotase alfa dosing, I should confirm the adult regimen. The standard dose is 0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously three times per week, with dose adjustments based on clinical response and tolerability, and I need to ensure injection technique and rotation sites are taught to minimize injection-site reactions [^116ah5Jz]. Hold on, I should verify that dose modifications are individualized to efficacy endpoints such as fracture healing, pain reduction, and functional gains rather than biochemical targets alone, since ALP may not fully normalize and clinical outcomes are paramount in adults [^116m3uLM].

> Next, I should review monitoring protocols, and I need to check that I am aligning with consensus guidance. Baseline and periodic assessments should include serum calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and PTH, with renal ultrasound to screen for nephrocalcinosis and ectopic calcifications, and ophthalmologic exams to assess for ocular calcifications, especially in patients at higher cardiovascular risk [^116qQEjv] [^113qm7NS]. I should double-check frequency: routine labs every 6 months and annual renal imaging are reasonable in stable adults, with closer intervals after initiation or dose changes, and I must tailor to clinical context and any emerging adverse effects [^113qm7NS] [^116qQEjv].

> I will now examine functional and skeletal monitoring, because clinical endpoints drive therapy. Annual skeletal surveys or targeted radiographs are appropriate when bone pain or new symptoms arise to detect fractures or pseudofractures, and I should track pain, mobility, and quality of life using validated tools where possible to quantify response and guide shared decision-making [^111zVcPi] [^116m3uLM]. Wait, let me verify that I am not overpromising radiographic improvement timelines; healing can be slow and variable in adults, so setting realistic expectations is important to maintain adherence and trust [^116m3uLM].

> Let me consider supportive and multidisciplinary care, because HPP is systemic. Physical therapy focused on load modification, fall risk reduction, and progressive strengthening can improve function and reduce fractures, and occupational therapy helps adapt activities of daily living; I should coordinate these early and adjust as enzyme therapy takes effect [^116JpFtk]. I need to ensure dental care is integrated, with semiannual visits for preventive care and prompt management of pulp infections, and I should coordinate with orthodontics or implantology when dental procedures are planned to optimize timing relative to medical therapy [^notfound].

> For special scenarios, I should confirm perioperative planning. If orthopedic surgery is needed, optimizing mineralization with asfotase alfa for several months preoperatively and continuing through healing improves outcomes, and I should communicate with surgeons about bone quality and fixation choices that accommodate osteomalacic bone [^notfound]. In pregnancy, data are limited; I should individualize decisions, generally favoring continuation of asfotase alfa if already on therapy given the maternal skeletal demands, with close maternal-fetal monitoring and coordination with obstetrics and endocrinology [^notfound].

> But wait, what if asfotase alfa is unavailable or contraindicated? Supportive care remains essential: calcium and vitamin D optimization to maintain normocalcemia, analgesia, and activity modification, with vigilant avoidance of bisphosphonates and careful consideration of any off-label alternatives only in expert centers [^116m3uLM] [^114sULVf]. I should double-check that I am not inadvertently recommending phosphate supplementation in HPP; unlike XLH, phosphate loading is not standard in HPP and may be counterproductive in some contexts, so I must avoid reflexively importing XLH protocols into HPP care [^notfound].

> Next, I should review a practical follow-up algorithm and make sure it is actionable. Every 3 to 6 months, I will assess pain, function, and new fractures; review calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, PTH, and renal function; and annually obtain renal imaging and consider skeletal imaging if symptomatic, adjusting asfotase alfa dose based on clinical response rather than ALP alone and documenting adverse events and injection-site tolerance [^113qm7NS] [^116m3uLM]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing anti-drug antibody testing; while not routinely required, if loss of efficacy or unusual reactions occur, I should consider ADA testing in collaboration with the manufacturer or registry when available [^113qm7NS].

> In summary, I need to ensure the care pathway remains diagnosis-first, complication-driven, and multidisciplinary. Confirm HPP with age-adjusted low ALP plus supportive biomarkers or genetics, avoid antiresorptives, initiate asfotase alfa for significant disease burden in adults, monitor comprehensively for efficacy and safety, and embed supportive therapies and surgical coordination to translate biochemical improvement into functional gains and fracture reduction over time [^114kkGr2] [^116m3uLM] [^115JK2Gk].

Management of adult hypophosphatasia centers on **enzyme replacement with asfotase alfa** [^116ah5Jz] for symptomatic patients with low ALP and clinical manifestations, as it improves bone mineralization, reduces fractures, and enhances mobility [^notfound]. Supportive care includes **calcium and vitamin D management** to prevent hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia, pain control, and dental care to address early tooth loss and periodontitis [^116m3uLM]. Avoid **bisphosphonates and denosumab**, which worsen mineralization defects [^116m3uLM]. Monitor renal function, ectopic calcifications, and anti-drug antibodies during therapy [^116qQEjv] [^113qm7NS]. Multidisciplinary care is essential, and treatment is individualized based on severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^112Shkvr] [^115JK2Gk].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and baseline assessment

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Persistently low age- and sex-adjusted ALP with elevated PLP and/or urinary phosphoethanolamine, and exclude other causes of low ALP (e.g. zinc deficiency, hypothyroidism, bisphosphonate use) [^116sUSJP] [^113NFMBn].

- **Genetic testing**: ALPL sequencing to confirm pathogenic variants and guide counseling [^114kkGr2].

- **Baseline assessment**: Document fractures, pseudofractures, bone pain, mobility, dental disease, and renal function; obtain skeletal radiographs and dental imaging as indicated [^116m3uLM].

---

## Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)

### Indications

Enzyme replacement therapy with asfotase alfa is indicated for **symptomatic adults** with low ALP and clinical manifestations such as fractures, pseudofractures, bone pain, or mobility impairment [^114yATAb]. It is also used for **odontohypophosphatasia** with significant dental disease [^notfound].

---

### Dosing and administration

The recommended dose is **0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously three times per week** [^notfound]. Dose adjustments are based on clinical response and tolerability [^notfound].

---

### Efficacy

ERT improves bone mineralization, reduces fracture risk, and enhances mobility and quality of life [^114MHind] [^116m3uLM].

---

## Supportive care

### Calcium and vitamin D management

- **Calcium**: Monitor closely; restrict if hypercalcemia occurs, supplement if hypocalcemia develops [^111J7Wzy].

- **Vitamin D**: Maintain 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL; monitor for hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria [^notfound].

---

### Pain management

Use **acetaminophen or NSAIDs** for mild to moderate pain; consider opioids for severe pain.

---

### Dental care

Dental care should include **regular dental visits** and preventive care, with restorative and prosthetic treatments as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Laboratory monitoring**: ALP, calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, PTH, renal function, and anti-asfotase alfa antibodies [^113qm7NS].

- **Imaging**: Periodic skeletal radiographs for fractures/pseudofractures; renal ultrasound for nephrocalcinosis; ophthalmologic exams for ectopic calcifications [^116qQEjv].

- **Clinical assessment**: Track pain, mobility, fractures, dental health, and quality of life at regular visits [^111zVcPi].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Avoid **bisphosphonates and denosumab**, which impair mineralization and increase fracture risk [^116m3uLM]. Use **caution with calcium and vitamin D** to prevent hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria [^112z3j4V].

---

## Special considerations

Multidisciplinary care involves **coordinated management** by endocrinology, orthopedics, dentistry, physical therapy, and pain specialists [^112Shkvr]. Treatment is individualized based on disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^115JK2Gk].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Asfotase alfa | First-line for symptomatic adults with low ALP and clinical manifestations |

### Approach to patients with hypophosphataemia [^117LCpxS]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Phosphate metabolism is an evolving area of basic and clinical research. In the past 15 years, knowledge on disturbances of phosphate homoeostasis has expanded, as has the discovery of new targeted therapies. Hypophosphataemia might be the biochemical finding in several diseases, and its clinical evaluation should initially focus on the assessment of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to low serum phosphate concentrations. Clinical consequences of hypophosphataemia can involve multiple organ systems and vary depending on several factors, the most important being the underlying disorder. This Review focuses on the approach to patients with hypophosphataemia and how underlying pathophysiological mechanisms should be understood in the evaluation of differential diagnosis. We define an algorithm for the assessment of hypophosphataemia and review the most up-to-date literature on specific therapies. Continuous research in this area will result in a better understanding and management of patients with hypophosphataemia.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^115JK2Gk]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) treated with asfotase alfa — conclusions emphasize that a coordinated, multidisciplinary, team-based and patient-focused approach is needed for managing patients receiving asfotase alfa therapy, and that the consensus recommendations are based on expert opinion and are intended to serve as a basic framework for monitoring patients with HPP for whom the decision to treat has been made. Monitoring assessments must be tailored to the individual patient, depending on medical history, specific clinical manifestations, and the clinician's professional judgment, and the disclaimer adds that ultimately the treatment and monitoring of patients with hypophosphatasia should be tailored to the patient. Adherence to these recommendations is completely voluntary, and clinicians are reminded that the recommendations provided may evolve as more scientific information becomes available.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^112j7aGa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

An international working group (IWG) consisting of experts in X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) developed global guidelines providing a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to XLH diagnosis, management, and monitoring.

Methods

The IWG, consisting of 43 members as well as methodologists and a patient partner, conducted 2 systematic reviews (SRs) and narrative reviews to address key areas. The SRs addressed the impact of burosumab compared to conventional therapy (phosphate and active vitamin D) or no therapy on patient-important outcomes in adults. They also evaluated conventional therapy compared to no therapy. GRADE methodology was applied to evaluate the certainty of evidence. Non-GRADED recommendations were made in the presence of insufficient evidence to conduct SRs. These guidelines have been reviewed and endorsed by several medical and patient societies and organizations.

Results

The diagnosis of XLH is based on integrating clinical evaluation, laboratory findings confirming renal phosphate wasting (following exclusion of conditions mimicking XLH), and skeletal imaging. Fibroblast growth factor 23 measurement and DNA analysis are of value in the diagnosis, if available. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the PHEX gene are confirmatory but not necessary for the diagnosis. Management requires a multidisciplinary team knowledgeable and experienced in XLH. Effective medical therapy with burosumab can improve fracture and pseudofracture healing.

Main Conclusion

In adults with XLH and fractures or pseudofractures, burosumab is recommended over no therapy (strong recommendation, GRADEd). Additionally, burosumab is suggested as the preferred treatment compared to conventional therapy (conditional recommendation, GRADEd) in the absence of fractures or pseudofractures. If burosumab is not available, symptomatic adults should be treated with conventional therapy (Non-GRADEd recommendation).

### Hypophosphatasia in adults: clinical assessment and treatment considerations [^114yATAb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inherited disorder of bone affecting approximately 500 to 600 known individuals in the United States. HPP is the result of mutations involving the gene for tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. Five clinical types of HPP are recognized. The clinical presentation of HPP varies from devastating prenatal intrauterine disease to mild manifestations in adulthood. In adults, main clinical involvement includes early loss of primary or secondary teeth, osteoporosis, bone pain, chondrocalcinosis, and fractures. Treatment for HPP is limited. Asfotase alfa is a subcutaneously administered synthetic human alkaline phosphatase that is approved for treatment of patients, including adults, with perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset HPP. However, guidelines for the treatment of adults with HPP are not available. This discussion addresses diagnostic and treatment considerations for adults with HPP. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Hypophosphatasia: clinical assessment and management in the adult patient-a narrative review [^112CTuk6]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review literature and present a schematic approach to hypophosphatasia (HPP) evaluation and management applicable to practicing physicians to ease its recognition and diagnosis.

Methods

Studies were obtained from online databases PubMed and MEDLINE using keyword 'hypophosphatasia'.
Results

HPP is a rare disease characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase along with diverse musculoskeletal symptoms that mimic different disorders. To date, the prevalence of HPP and its impact on adults has been unrecognized. There is lack of evidence from larger and long-term studies examining the adult type of this condition.

Conclusion

It is essential to increase awareness on the complexity of the pathophysiology and clinical features of HPP, which causes debilitating physical conditions that severely affects quality of life. A better comprehension of adult forms of HPP is essential to reduce a delay in diagnosis as well as ensure suitable management.

Abbreviations

ALP = alkaline phosphatase; HPP = hypophosphatasia; PEA = phosphorethanolamine; PLP = pyridoxal-5-phosphate; PPi = inorganic pyrophosphate; TNSALP/TNAP = tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase.

Methodology

The recommendations in these guidelines are based on 2 systematic reviews (SRs) and an expert panel practice survey, in addition to a narrative review of the literature. The guidelines employed a rigorous approach, including a comprehensive literature review conducted by a specialized healthcare librarian, and duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction. The evaluation of the quality of evidence from included studies utilized the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and the SRs were preregistered with PROSPERO.

The GRADEd treatment recommendations followed a structured approach, encompassing the formulation of questions in the patient/intervention/comparator/outcome (PICO) format, conducting SRs, and rating the quality of evidence in "summary of findings tables" addressing patient-important outcomes. The recommendations were classified as strong or weak with a description of the quality of evidence, patients' values and preferences were taken into consideration for all recommendations. In contrast, the non-GRADEd recommendations did not adhere to a structured approach but were based on narrative reviews of the literature and consensus among the panelists. The phrase " the panel proposes " was used when presenting non-graded recommendations.

The GRADEd monitoring recommendations are supported by very low-quality evidence and were derived from a detailed expert practice survey. A threshold of 80% agreement among the surveyed experts was chosen as the necessary level to recommend each clinical practice. More details are presented in an accompanying manuscript describing monitoring guidelines for XLH (citation pending publication).

KEY GUIDANCE

GRADEd Recommendations

Development: Developed following a structured approach Treatment Recommendations: Based on systematic reviews. Monitoring Recommendations: Based on an expert clinical practice survey (very low-quality evidence).
Expression of Recommendations: Strong Recommendations: expressed as " We recommend. " Strong: When the panel was confident that the desirable effects of the intervention outweighed the undesirable ones. Weak/Conditional Recommendations: Expressed as " We suggest". Weak: Attributed either to low certainty evidence or to a close balance between the desirable and undesirable effects. Conditional: When the panel concluded that the desirable effects of the intervention probably outweigh the undesirable effects, though there is some uncertainty.

Non-GRADEd Recommendations

Development: Based on a narrative review for questions where there was not sufficient evidence to conduct systematic reviews.
Expression of Recommendations: Expressed as " The panel proposes".

Consensus Development

All recommendations (GRADEd or non-GRADEd) were developed through a consensus reached among the international working group (IWG) members across several meetings.

X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH; OMIM 307800), is a rare genetic disorder caused by inactivating variants in the phosphate regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases (PHEX) gene. This results in excess synthesis and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which impairs proximal renal phosphate reabsorption causing renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia. Excess FGF23 also reduces the 1-α hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D) and increases catabolism of 1,25(OH)₂D by the upregulation of 24-hydroxylase. These effects lead to decreased absorption of phosphate from the bowel. Currently, there is limited data on the natural history of XLH as well as long-term outcomes; however, the burden of disease observed in the adult patient population suggests that late diagnosis and management are associated with adverse outcomes. Adults present with osteomalacia, experience chronic musculoskeletal pain, lower limb deformity, fractures, pseudofractures, dental complications, fatigue, and difficulties with mobility and impaired physical function. Medical management includes conventional therapy with phosphate and active vitamin D, and more recently, burosumab (recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody to FGF23) has become available.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^111zVcPi]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) treated with asfotase alfa — consensus monitoring guidance explains that after the decision to treat with asfotase alfa, recommendations focus on assessing and monitoring patients and do not include whom to treat; guidance includes recommendations for laboratory, efficacy, and safety assessments and the frequency with which these should be performed during the course of treatment. Recommended assessments are based on patient age and include regular monitoring of biochemistry, skeletal radiographs, respiratory function, growth, pain, mobility and motor function, and quality of life. Because of the systemic presentation of HPP, a coordinated, multidisciplinary, team-based, patient-focused approach is recommended in the management of patients receiving asfotase alfa, and monitoring of efficacy and safety outcomes must be tailored to the individual patient depending on medical history, clinical manifestations, availability of resources in the clinical setting, and the clinician's professional judgment. As context, asfotase alfa is described as a human, recombinant enzyme replacement therapy that is approved in many countries for the treatment of patients with HPP.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^112MJQnE]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to general principles, adults, XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to do not offer treatment routinely in asymptomatic patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia.
Obtain a careful clinical assessment to establish asymptomatic disease, as many patients adapt by minimizing their activities.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^114eZsd5]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is the most common cause of inherited phosphate wasting and is associated with severe complications such as rickets, lower limb deformities, pain, poor mineralization of the teeth and disproportionate short stature in children as well as hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, enthesopathies, osteoarthritis and pseudofractures in adults. The characteristics and severity of XLH vary between patients. Because of its rarity, the diagnosis and specific treatment of XLH are frequently delayed, which has a detrimental effect on patient outcomes. In this Evidence-Based Guideline, we recommend that the diagnosis of XLH is based on signs of rickets and/or osteomalacia in association with hypophosphataemia and renal phosphate wasting in the absence of vitamin D or calcium deficiency. Whenever possible, the diagnosis should be confirmed by molecular genetic analysis or measurement of levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) before treatment. Owing to the multisystemic nature of the disease, patients should be seen regularly by multidisciplinary teams organized by a metabolic bone disease expert. In this article, we summarize the current evidence and provide recommendations on features of the disease, including new treatment modalities, to improve knowledge and provide guidance for diagnosis and multidisciplinary care.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^115NBR2R]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, inherited, systemic, metabolic disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations or a single dominant-negative mutation in the gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). The disease is associated with a broad range of signs, symptoms, and complications, including impaired skeletal mineralization, altered calcium and phosphate metabolism, recurrent fractures, pain, respiratory problems, impaired growth and mobility, premature tooth loss, developmental delay, and seizures. Asfotase alfa is a human, recombinant enzyme replacement therapy that is approved in many countries for the treatment of patients with HPP. To address the unmet need for guidance in the monitoring of patients receiving asfotase alfa, an international panel of physicians with experience in diagnosing and managing HPP convened in May 2016 to discuss treatment monitoring parameters. The panel discussions focused on recommendations for assessing and monitoring patients after the decision to treat with asfotase alfa had been made and did not include recommendations for whom to treat. Based on the consensus of panel members, this review provides guidance on the monitoring of patients with HPP during treatment with asfotase alfa, including recommendations for laboratory, efficacy, and safety assessments and the frequency with which these should be performed during the course of treatment. Recommended assessments are based on patient age and include regular monitoring of biochemistry, skeletal radiographs, respiratory function, growth, pain, mobility and motor function, and quality of life. Because of the systemic presentation of HPP, a coordinated, multidisciplinary, team-based, patient-focused approach is recommended in the management of patients receiving asfotase alfa. Monitoring of efficacy and safety outcomes must be tailored to the individual patient, depending on medical history, clinical manifestations, availability of resources in the clinical setting, and the clinician's professional judgment.

Material and methods

Overview of the guideline project

We followed the RIGHT (Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare) Statement for Practice Guidelines. Two groups were assembled: a core leadership group and a voting panel. The core group comprised specialists from (paediatric) endocrinology (D.S. M.L.B. L.S. P.K. L.R. and A.L.), paediatric nephrology (D.H. F.E. J.B. D.B. F.S. and E.L.), paediatric orthopaedic surgery (D.E. and P.W.), rheumatology (K.B.), dentistry (M.B.D. and C.C.), neurosurgery (F.D.R.) and XLH patient organization representatives (P.H. and M.K.). The voting group included 41 members with expertise in paediatric and adult XLH, including members of the supporting societies and networks. Voting group members were asked by use of an e-questionnaire to provide a level of agreement on a five-point scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree/disagree, agree or strongly agree) (Delphi method). Failing a 70% level of consensus, recommendations were modified after discussion in the core group and reviewed again by the voting panel until a consensus level of at least 70% was achieved.

Developing the PICO questions

We developed PICO (patient (or population) covered, intervention, comparator and outcomes) questions. These PICO elements were arranged into the questions to be addressed in the literature searches. Each PICO question then formed the basis for a recommendation.

The population covered included children and adults with XLH. Recommendations have been developed on the basis of available studies investigating the clinical phenotype and management of XLH. For these recommendations, treatment benefits were evaluated using the no treatment option or patient status at baseline (that is, before therapy) as the comparator. With regard to outcomes, we provide recommendations for diagnosis, follow-up and treatment with respect to bone disease, growth, treatment-associated or disease-associated complications and comorbidities.

Box 7 Recommendations for burosumab treatment in adults

If available, we recommend considering burosumab treatment in adults with X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) with the following features: persistent bone and/or joint pain due to XLH and/or osteomalacia that limits daily activities; pseudofractures or osteomalacia-related fractures; and insufficient response or refractory to conventional therapy (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We also recommend considering burosumab treatment if patients experience complications related to conventional therapy (grade D, weak recommendation)
We recommend a starting dose of burosumab of 1.0 mg/kg body weight (maximum dose of 90 mg) given subcutaneously every 4 weeks (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We suggest initial monitoring of fasting serum phosphate levels between injections, ideally 7–11 days after the last injection to detect hyperphosphataemia; after achievement of a steady state, which can be assumed after 3 months of a stable dosage, serum levels of phosphate should be assessed during the last week before the next injection to detect underdosing (grade B, weak recommendation)
The dose should be discontinued if fasting serum phosphate level is above the upper limit of normal. Burosumab can be restarted at approximately half of the previous dose when serum phosphate concentration is below the normal range (grade C, moderate recommendation)
Burosumab must not be given together with conventional treatment, in patients with phosphate levels within the age-related normal reference range before initiation of treatment or in the presence of severe renal impairment (grade X, moderate recommendation)

Box 6 Recommendations for conventional treatment in adults

We recommend treatment in symptomatic adults with X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) by active vitamin D together with oral phosphorus (phosphate salts) to reduce osteomalacia and its consequences and to improve oral health (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We suggest treating pregnant and lactating women with active vitamin D in combination with phosphate supplements if needed (grade D, weak recommendation)

Expert Opinion: Practical Considerations for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Hypophosphatemia

A standardized definition for chronic hypophosphatemia

To help harmonize nomenclature, raise awareness, and guide clinical decision making for diseases characterized by chronic hypophosphatemia, it is important to establish a standard definition. Definitions of hypophosphatemia exist for children and adults, yet there is currently no universally accepted definition of chronic hypophosphatemia. This definition should consider age‐ and sex‐specific normal phosphate reference ranges, as well as the duration of low phosphate levels.

While we acknowledge the difficulties in defining chronic hypophosphatemia, we propose the following definition may be used in children and adults:

"At least three consecutive, morning fasting serum phosphate readings below the lower limit of normal (LLN) for healthy age‐ and sex‐matched reference ranges, taken at least 3 months apart (eg, 0, 3, and 6 months)".

However, we emphasize the importance of using clinical judgment when managing patients with hypophosphatemia. Further investigations and management should be considered without delay when there is suspicion of an underlying condition that may require earlier intervention, if severe hypophosphatemia is identified (eg, serum phosphate in adults < 0.3 mmol/L), if hypophosphatemia is associated with severe symptoms or in patients with a known genetic risk (eg, a mother with XLH) and causes of acute hypophosphatemia have been excluded. In children beyond perinatal age, the first measurement of low phosphate should prompt additional investigations. In such situations, serum phosphate measurement should be repeated as soon as possible, and treatment should be initiated promptly, without the need to formally define hypophosphatemia as a chronic condition. In all cases of chronic hypophosphatemia, it is crucial to determine the underlying cause because some disorders (eg, TIO) may require extensive diagnostic investigations and surgical treatment, whereas others may need lifelong therapy and follow‐up (eg, XLH).

Asfotase alfa therapy in hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a recombinant tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) replacement that replaces deficient TNSALP activity and reduces accumulation of extracellular substrates, with efficacy and safety assessed in 5 prospective, open-label, Phase 2, multinational clinical studies in infants and adolescents that reported improved bone mineralization, growth, respiratory function, and mobility. No published guidelines were available for monitoring patients with HPP treated with asfotase alfa, so an international physician panel was convened to discuss monitoring parameters specifically for patients already selected to receive asfotase alfa, while other therapeutic approaches and general HPP management were outside the report's scope.

### Approach to the hypophosphatemic patient [^114dQBKZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatemia is commonly missed due to nonspecific signs and symptoms, but it causes considerable morbidity and in some cases contributes to mortality. Three primary mechanisms of hypophosphatemia exist: increased renal excretion, decreased intestinal absorption, and shifts from the extracellular to intracellular compartments. Renal hypophosphatemia can be further divided into fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated or non-fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated causes. Proper diagnosis requires a thorough medication history, family history, physical examination, and assessment of renal tubular phosphate handling to identify the cause. During the past decade, our understanding of phosphate metabolism has grown greatly through the study of rare disorders of phosphate homeostasis. Treatment of hypophosphatemia depends on the underlying disorder and requires close biochemical monitoring. This article illustrates an approach to the hypophosphatemic patient and discusses normal phosphate metabolism.

Limitations

Our recommendations are limited in assessing patients' functional status, as we primarily considered the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) for evaluating mobility. Our survey did not address other important aspects of function, such as walking perimeter, use of assistive devices, or daily activity levels. Moreover, the use of the 6MWT did not achieve the consensus threshold in our survey, reflecting variability in clinical practice.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^113KLD3b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Given the physiologic importance of phosphate for optimal health, phosphate homeostasis control is necessary throughout life. Chronic hypophosphatemic diseases are rare, often underrecognized, and may be suboptimally managed. Moreover, serum phosphate is not always routinely measured in primary care practice and may be misinterpreted if not compared against age‐ and sex‐specific normal phosphate reference ranges. These diseases have a multisystem impact that impair quality of life. In some genetic forms of these diseases, inadequate management during childhood or adolescence leads to further complications in adulthood.

Given the considerable clinical impact of chronic hypophosphatemic diseases, we emphasize the need to identify these as early as possible. A universally well‐accepted definition of chronic hypophosphatemia will help raise awareness of these diseases, aid in the identification and management of affected individuals, and facilitate further clinical studies. We propose a definition for chronic hypophosphatemia in this article, although we note that further investigations should be performed in patients without delay if necessary. Finally, we provide our recommendations for assessing renal phosphate wasting and highlight the urgency to restore phosphate homeostasis with the aim to improve patient outcomes.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^112DqLBA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Management

The treatment goals for hypophosphatemic rickets in children are to improve growth, rickets, skeletal deformity, bone pain, muscle strength, and ambulation. Treatment during growth can improve height and lower limb deformities. However, many children still require corrective surgeries for lower limb deformities. In adults, treatment goals are to decrease bone pain, heal or prevent fractures, and improve mobility. Treatment must be balanced against the complications of therapy.

Phosphate Salts and Active Vitamin D

Conventional therapy for XLH (and other FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia) has involved high doses of active vitamin D (calcitriol, alfacalcidol, etc.) and oral phosphate. Oral phosphate doses typically range from 20 to 60 mg/kg per day of elemental phosphorus divided into 3 to 5 doses. However, treating XLH with phosphate salts alone (without active vitamin D) is inappropriate and ineffective, and can cause severe hyperparathyroidism. Calcitriol (or other forms of active vitamin D) stimulate intestinal phosphate absorption, and is necessary to heal rickets and osteomalacia. Calcitriol dosing is typically 20 to 30 ng/kg per day divided into 2 to 3 doses, while alfacalcidol dosing is 40 to 60 ng/kg per day. Some patients require higher (or lower) doses of phosphate or active vitamin D.

Conclusion

Hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia represent a set of rare disorders with many genetic and acquired causes and potential in long-term complications for children and adults, and diminishing physical function and quality of life. Therapy for hypophosphatemic rickets is directed by the underlying cause and management is complex requiring careful monitoring. Treatment for the most common cause of hypophosphatemic rickets, XLH, has expanded to include the option of anti-FGF23 therapy with burosumab. Many questions remain regarding the long-term effects of burosumab on several outcomes of interest to patients.

### A clinician's guide to X-linked hypophosphatemia [^116UsG3t]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the prototypic disorder of renal phosphate wasting, and the most common form of heritable rickets. Physicians, patients, and support groups have all expressed concerns about the dearth of information about this disease and the lack of treatment guidelines, which frequently lead to missed diagnoses or mismanagement. This perspective addresses the recommendation by conferees for the dissemination of concise and accessible treatment guidelines for clinicians arising from the Advances in Rare Bone Diseases Scientific Conference held at the NIH in October 2008. We briefly review the clinical and pathophysiologic features of the disorder and offer this guide in response to the conference recommendation, based on our collective accumulated experience in the management of this complex disorder.

### Hypophosphatemia: a practical guide to evaluation and management [^113LptRr]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Phosphate plays a critical and diverse role in human physiology. In addition to its importance in skeletal mineralization, it is essential for energy homeostasis, enzyme function, and cell membrane integrity. These diverse functions of phosphate provide an explanation for the range of symptoms and clinical manifestations observed in patients with both acute and chronic causes of hypophosphatemia. Normal phosphate homeostasis involves several major systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, bones, and kidneys. Phosphate balance is maintained directly and indirectly by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃, parathyroid hormone, and the osteocyte-derived phosphatonin fibroblast growth factor 23. This review discusses normal phosphate homeostasis, the clinical manifestations and causes of hypophosphatemia, and an approach to establish a diagnosis and appropriate management.

Achieving a normal fasting serum phosphorus throughout the dose cycle with burosumab is challenging and not all adults achieve normal fasting serum phosphorus with doses of up to 90 mg of burosumab every 4 weeks. In order to achieve consistently normal fasting serum phosphorus with burosumab therapy, some patients may require more frequent dosing than every 4 weeks and may require dosing every 2 weeks. The total monthly dose may be more than 90 mg in a 4-week period. These are currently off-label regimens. In contrast, some patients may require very low burosumab doses in order to normalize fasting serum phosphorus, highlighting the broad individual variation in response.

Complications of hyperparathyroidism in adults may be less likely to occur with burosumab. In a recent clinical trial reductions in PTH levels were noted with burosumab in comparison to placebo. Injection site reactions occur in adults less commonly than in children and are typically brief and usually do not require discontinuation. Occasionally patients have reported transient generalized bone pain at the onset of therapy. About 8% (or more) of patients with XLH have restless legs syndrome in the absence of burosumab therapy. Restless leg syndrome has been noted as an adverse event of burosumab therapy.

Orthopedic and Related Surgical Procedures

Orthopedic intervention for XLH is predominately devoted to fracture care and osteotomies performed to correct limb alignment. Fractures and deformity occur primarily in the lower extremities and are attributed to progressive osteomalacia and the impact of prolonged weight bearing on poorly mineralized bones and misaligned joints. Reports of surgical treatment of bone deformity in skeletally mature adults with XLH include small numbers of patients with no control groups. The few articles specific to surgical treatment in adults with XLH promote intramedullary fixation (rods) for realignment osteotomies to span the full length of the bone; this approach allows for long healing time and prevents recurrence of deformity over the long term. In general, however, surgical management should be coordinated between the surgical team and the metabolic bone disease specialists. For most skeletal surgeries, surgical healing of the bone is likely to be improved with antecedent medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D). Improved healing of active fractures after starting burosumab therapy was noted in the RCT study evaluating burosumab in comparison to placebo (before which many participants were receiving conventional therapy), supporting the use of burosumab for postoperative skeletal healing.

### Physical therapy management of infants and children with hypophosphatasia [^112cx5w8]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting in undermineralization of bone and subsequent skeletal abnormalities. The natural history of HPP is characterized by rickets and osteomalacia, increased propensity for bone fracture, early loss of teeth in childhood, and muscle weakness. There is a wide heterogeneity in disease presentation, and the functional impact of the disease can vary from perinatal death to gait abnormalities. Recent clinical trials of enzyme replacement therapy have begun to offer an opportunity for improvement in survival and function. The role of physical therapy in the treatment of the underlying musculoskeletal dysfunction in HPP is underrecognized. It is important for physical therapists to understand the disease characteristics of the natural history of a rare disease like HPP and how the impairment and activity limitations may change in response to medical interventions. An understanding of when and how to intervene is also important in order to optimally impact body function, lessen structural impairment, and facilitate increased functional independence in mobility and activities of daily living. Individualizing treatment to the child's needs, medical fragility, and setting (home/school/hospital), while educating parents, caregivers, and school staff regarding approved activities and therapy frequency, may improve function and development in children with HPP.

### Interdisciplinary management of FGF23-related phosphate wasting syndromes: a consensus statement on the evaluation, diagnosis and care of patients with X-linked hypophosphataemia [^112NYhDv]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is the most frequent cause of hypophosphataemia-associated rickets of genetic origin and is associated with high levels of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). In addition to rickets and osteomalacia, patients with XLH have a heavy disease burden with enthesopathies, osteoarthritis, pseudofractures and dental complications, all of which contribute to reduced quality of life. This Consensus Statement presents the outcomes of a working group of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases, and provides robust clinical evidence on management in XLH, with an emphasis on patients' experiences and needs. During growth, conventional treatment with phosphate supplements and active vitamin D metabolites (such as calcitriol) improves growth, ameliorates leg deformities and dental manifestations, and reduces pain. The continuation of conventional treatment in symptom-free adults is still debated. A novel therapeutic approach is the monoclonal anti-FGF23 antibody burosumab. Although promising, further studies are required to clarify its long-term efficacy, particularly in adults. Given the diversity of symptoms and complications, an interdisciplinary approach to management is of paramount importance. The focus of treatment should be not only on the physical manifestations and challenges associated with XLH and other FGF23-mediated hypophosphataemia syndromes, but also on the major psychological and social impact of the disease.

Box 10 Recommendations for management of dental health

In children and adults with ongoing oral manifestations, we recommend treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate supplementation to improve dentin mineralization, reduce the number of dental abscesses and reduce the severity of periodontitis (grade B, moderate recommendation)
In children, in addition to standard preventive care, we recommend dental visits every 6 months and suggest sealing pits and fissures with flowable resin composite on both temporary and permanent teeth as soon and as frequently as required (grade C, weak recommendation)
We suggest a thorough clinical investigation searching for pulp necrosis (colour changes, fistula, swelling, abscess, cellulitis or pain) and performing retrocoronal and/or periapical radiographs or orthopantomogram to search for enlarged pulp chambers and periapical bone loss depending on findings from a clinical examination (grade B, weak recommendation)
We suggest optimizing conventional medical treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia before initiation of orthodontic treatment (grade C, moderate recommendation)
In adults, we recommend twice-yearly visits to perform conventional supportive periodontal therapy, which should include periodontal risk assessment and supragingival and subgingival debridement if necessary (grade B, moderate recommendation)
In adults, we suggest that dental implant surgery should be performed after 3–6 months of medical treatment, which should be continued for 6 months following implant surgery; healing time should be extended up to 6 months (grade D, weak recommendation)

Orthodontic and implant treatments

Children with XLH often present with delayed dental development, abnormal eruption patterns, increased frequency of specific malocclusions (including maxillary retrognathism) and impacted or dystopic maxillary canines –. Orthodontic treatment triggers movement of the teeth and extensive remodelling of the alveolar bone. Without conventional treatment, the outcomes of orthodontic treatment are unpredictable. The high rate of tooth loss secondary to endodontic infections and periodontitis often leads to the need for dental implants in adults with XLH. Standard dental surgical protocols in adults with XLH who are not receiving conventional treatment result in decreased success rates compared with healthy control individuals.

Diagnosis considerations for hypophosphatasia — Diagnosis in patients of any age can be established based on characteristic signs, symptoms, and complications together with consistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after excluding other causes of low ALP and skeletal diseases with similar presentations. Because the lower limit of normal for ALP varies by age and sex, measured activity must be compared with the lower limit and range appropriate for the patient. Physicians should be aware that many institutions do not routinely flag low ALP and may incorrectly apply adult ALP reference ranges to all ages, and the report emphasizes that age- and sex-adjusted ALP reference intervals are critical to an accurate diagnosis of HPP.

### Treatment of hypophosphatemia in the intensive care unit: a review [^116mjnME]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Currently no evidence-based guideline exists for the approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients.

Methods

We performed a narrative review of the medical literature to identify the incidence, symptoms, and treatment of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients. Specifically, we searched for answers to the questions whether correction of hypophosphatemia is associated with improved outcome, and whether a certain treatment strategy is superior.

Results

Incidence: hypophosphatemia is frequently encountered in the intensive care unit; and critically ill patients are at increased risk for developing hypophosphatemia due to the presence of multiple causal factors.

Symptoms

hypophosphatemia may lead to a multitude of symptoms, including cardiac and respiratory failure.

Treatment

hypophosphatemia is generally corrected when it is symptomatic or severe. However, although multiple studies confirm the efficacy and safety of intravenous phosphate administration, it remains uncertain when and how to correct hypophosphatemia.

Outcome

in some studies, hypophosphatemia was associated with higher mortality; a paucity of randomized controlled evidence exists for whether correction of hypophosphatemia improves the outcome in critically ill patients.

Conclusions

Additional studies addressing the current approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients are required. Studies should focus on the association between hypophosphatemia and morbidity and/or mortality, as well as the effect of correction of this electrolyte disorder.

Prophylaxis

Conventional treatment improves dentin mineralization, reduces the number of dental abscesses and decreases the frequency and severity of periodontitis, (Box 10). Reducing the size of the pulp chambers, as demonstrated by dental radiographs, is a useful sign of successful treatment. Continued supplementation through adulthood may be beneficial, as the number of dental abscesses and severity of periodontitis vary according to the percentage of adult life with treatment.

To prevent bacterial invasion of the dentin and pulp via enamel microcracks, we suggest sealing the occlusal surfaces of both deciduous and permanent teeth in children with XLH. This approach can be achieved with flowable resin composite placed in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface and should be performed regularly as soon as the eruption of the tooth allows acceptable isolation of the occlusal surface.

Acute abscesses might require antibiotic treatment depending on the extent and severity of the infection. For deciduous teeth, the decision to extract or treat endodontically will depend on the extent of the infection, recurrence and the expected timing of normal exfoliation of the permanent tooth. For permanent teeth, endodontic treatment or re-treatment of the tooth are the preferred options, although healing after endodontic treatment might not be as favourable as in healthy patients.

Prevention, treatment and supportive care of periodontitis in adult patients should follow standard management, as in the general population. Treatment of periodontitis should aim to decrease gingival inflammation and suppress periodontal pockets. The opportunity to resume or start conventional medical treatment should be discussed in the presence of periodontitis.

Because of their rarity, diseases characterized by chronic hypophosphatemia can be underrecognized and suboptimally managed, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, serum phosphate may not be measured routinely in primary care practice. Authors participated in several working sessions to advance the understanding of phosphate homeostasis and the causes, consequences, and clinical implications of chronic hypophosphatemia. Phosphate levels are regulated from birth to adulthood. Dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis can result in hypophosphatemia, which becomes chronic if phosphate levels cannot be normalized. Chronic hypophosphatemia may be underrecognized as serum phosphate measurement is not always part of routine analysis in the primary care setting and results might be misinterpreted, for instance, due to age-specific differences not being accounted for and circadian variations. Clinical consequences of chronic hypophosphatemia involve disordered endocrine regulation, affect multiple organ systems, and vary depending on patient age and the underlying disorder. Signs and symptoms of chronic hypophosphatemic diseases that manifest during childhood or adolescence persist into adulthood if the disease is inadequately managed, resulting in an accumulation of clinical deficits and a progressive, debilitating impact on quality of life. Early identification and diagnosis of patients with chronic hypophosphatemia is crucial, and clinical management should be started as soon as possible to maximize the likelihood of improving health outcomes.

Introduction

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare metabolic bone disease, caused by inactivating mutations in the ALPL gene, which encodes for the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP or ALP), a key enzyme in bone mineralization. Low ALP activity may be associated with impaired bone mineralization which may result in skeletal fragility and stress fractures. Based on clinical, radiological, biochemical, and histopathological characteristics, HPP has an extraordinary range of severity, from stillbirth to forms with only dental complications. Milder forms of HPP, especially in adults, are frequently misdiagnosed as other more common bone disorders, such as osteoporosis. This diagnostic error could be harmful in patients with HPP as it could result in the use of antiresorptive drugs that can further impair bone mineralization, increasing the risk of fractures. The hallmark of HPP is low serum ALP. However, low ALP activity can be observed in many other conditions, such as endocrine disorders (hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, hypercortisolism or glucocorticoid therapy), gastrointestinal and liver disorders (coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, Wilson's disease), zinc or magnesium deficiency, malnutrition, and anorexia nervosa. Furthermore, in the context of bone fragility, low ALP activity levels are frequently observed in patients treated with potent antiresorptive drugs (ie, i.v. bisphosphonates and denosumab), which decrease bone turnover. To improve the diagnostic workup of HPP patients, many diagnostic algorithms for the classification of adult patients with low ALP have been proposed. These imply the use of ALPL gene analysis or the assay of additional biochemical markers, such as serum pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP, a biologically active form of vitamin B6) or urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEA), both of which are metabolites that can accumulate in HPP. These approaches appear to be effective in increasing the detection rate of HPP among patients with low ALP activity, but assays can be expensive and not readily available in many laboratories. In contrast, there is no evidence regarding the use of the bone turnover markers (BTMs), commonly employed in the clinical management of osteoporosis. Those most frequently used are either the product of osteoblasts, released during bone formation (eg, the aforementioned ALP and its skeletal isoform or bone ALP, and the N-terminal propeptide pro-collagen I or P1NP) or product of osteoclast-induced bone degradation, released during bone resorption (eg, CTX).

### Hypophosphatasia [^114kkGr2]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a group of inherited disorders characterised by the impaired mineralisation of bones and/or teeth and low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. It is caused by a mutation in the ALPL gene encoding the tissue-non-specific isoenzyme of ALP (TNSALP) resulting in a loss of function. The disease is highly heterogenous in its clinical expression ranging from stillbirth without mineralised bone to the mild form of late adult onset with symptoms and signs such as musculoskeletal pain, arthropathy, lower-extremity fractures, premature loss of teeth or an incidental finding of reduced serum ALP activity. A classification based on the age at diagnosis and the presence or absence of bone symptoms was historically used: perinatal, prenatal benign, infantile, childhood, adult and odontohypophosphatasia. These subtypes are known to have overlapping signs and complications. Three forms of HPP distinguishable by their genetic characteristics have been described: severe, moderate and mild. Severe forms of HPP (perinatal and infantile severe) are recessively inherited, whereas moderate HPP may be dominantly or recessively inherited. The biochemical hallmark of HPP is persistently low serum ALP for age and increase in natural substrates of TNSALP, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and phosphoethanolamine supported by radiological findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by ALPL sequencing. A multidisciplinary team of experts is essential for the effective management. Calcium restriction is recommended in infants/children to manage hypercalcaemia. A targeted enzyme replacement therapy for HPP has become available and correct diagnosis is crucial to allow early treatment.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^116oi6Qw]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a rare metabolic bone disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the PHEX gene, which is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts, osteocytes and odontoblasts. XLH is characterized by increased synthesis of the bone-derived phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which results in renal phosphate wasting with consecutive hypophosphataemia, rickets, osteomalacia, disproportionate short stature, oral manifestations, pseudofractures, craniosynostosis, enthesopathies and osteoarthritis. Patients with XLH should be provided with multidisciplinary care organized by a metabolic bone expert. Historically, these patients were treated with frequent doses of oral phosphate supplements and active vitamin D, which was of limited efficiency and associated with adverse effects. However, the management of XLH has evolved in the past few years owing to the availability of burosumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes circulating FGF23. Here, we provide updated clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of XLH to improve outcomes and quality of life in these patients.

Methodology

The recommendations in these guidelines are based on two systematic literature reviews; in addition, the monitoring recommendations are based on an expert clinical practice survey, along with a narrative review of the literature, given the limited published evidence on pediatric XLH diagnosis and management. The initial assessment and monitoring recommendations were based on experts' clinical practice survey and included only practices performed by at least 80% of experts in 80% or more of their initial evaluations of patients referred for XLH assessment and management. For follow-up assessments, the threshold was set to practices used by at least 80% of experts at least 80% of the time during specific intervals for their existing patients.

These guidelines employed rigorous approaches, including a comprehensive literature review conducted by a specialized healthcare librarian, and duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction. The evaluation of the quality of evidence from included studies utilized the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and the systematic reviews were preregistered with PROSPERO.

The GRADEd treatment recommendations followed a structured approach, encompassing the formulation of questions in patient/intervention/comparator/outcome (PICO) format, conducting systematic literature reviews, and rating the quality of evidence in tables addressing patient-important outcomes. The recommendations were classified as strong or weak with a description of the quality of evidence. The phrase " we recommend " was used for strong recommendations and the phrase " we suggest " was used for weak or conditional recommendations. In contrast, the non-GRADEd recommendations did not adhere to a structured approach but were based on narrative reviews of the literature and consensus among the International Working Group (IWG) panelists. Patients' values and preferences were taken into consideration regarding recommendations. The phrase " the panel proposes " was used when presenting the non-GRADEd recommendations.

Monitoring recommendations, GRADEd as a very low-quality evidence, were derived from a survey of experts' practices, as there were no published studies that compared the impact of different monitoring approaches. The panel members designed a detailed survey to capture clinical practice among experts in the field. An agreement of at least 80% of panel members was required for a clinical practice to become a recommendation. More details are presented in an accompanying manuscript on XLH monitoring.

Literature search

The PubMed database was searched until 26 June 2018; all articles and reports were considered, including prospective randomized controlled trials, uncontrolled or observational studies, registries, summaries and case reports, restricted to human studies in English. The following key MeSH terms were used to identify suitable studies: "X-linked hypophosphatemia", "X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets", "hypophosphatemic rickets", "familial hypophosphatemic rickets", "PHEX" and "osteomalacia". The search retrieved 8,903 results and 196 articles were referenced here.

Grading system

We followed the grading system from the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop the recommendations (Fig. 1; refs). The quality of evidence is graded high (A), moderate (B), low (C), very low (D) or not applicable (X). The latter refers to exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed and benefit or harm clearly predominates. This letter was used to grade contraindications for burosumab and safety recommendations for cinacalcet. The strength of a recommendation is graded strong, moderate, weak or discretionary (when no recommendation can be made).

Calcium and endocrine monitoring with asfotase alfa — management guidance states that calcium restriction is often recommended in infants/children with HPP to manage hypercalcemia; once treatment with asfotase alfa has been initiated, restrictions may be lifted and supplementation with additional calcium may be required to maintain PTH within the normal range. Accordingly, serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and PTH levels should be monitored very closely after initiating asfotase alfa, and in perinatal and infantile patients, ionized calcium should be measured; if ionized calcium testing is not available, albumin levels are needed to interpret calcium findings.

DENTAL and ORAL COMPLICATIONS

DENTAL RECOMMENDATIONS (NON-GRADEd)

The Panel Proposes

Dental visits at least once a year to screen for infections, and periodontal supportive care with recall intervals based on each individual condition.
In the presence of active oral manifestations, treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate salts, or burosumab is advised to reduce the risk of dental infections and the severity of periodontitis.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DENTAL PROFESSIONALS (NON-GRADEd)

The Panel Proposes

A thorough clinical and radiological assessment searching for spontaneous pulp infection (tooth color changes, fistula, swelling, abscess, cellulitis, pain, periapical bone loss), and periodontitis.
Performing a dental orthopantomogram (radiograph of the upper and lower jaw and teeth), potentially complimented or replaced with cone-beam computed tomography imaging, in patients with recent oral manifestations, which can be repeated based on individual needs.
Implant surgery may be performed after 3 to 6 months of medical treatment (conventional therapy or burosumab), which should be continued for 6 months following implant surgery; healing time should be extended up to 6 months.

Dental complications are common in patients with XLH and significantly alter QoL. Mineralization of dentin is impaired, resulting in greater susceptibility to pulp infections. Periodontal tissues are compromised resulting in relatively frequent and severe periodontal diseases in affected adults of all ages, premature loss of teeth, as well as an increased risk of dental implant loss.

Prevention and Management of Dental Complications of XLH

Multidisciplinary teams caring for patients with XLH must include dental services. In adults, twice-yearly visits are indicated to perform conventional supportive periodontal therapy. Dental implant placement should not be performed in the absence of medical treatment. It is suggested that implant surgery be performed after 3 to 6 months of medical treatment (expert recommendation), with continuation for at least 6 months following the implant surgery. For all patients, bitewings and/or periapical radiographs, orthopantomogram or cone-beam computed tomography may be performed based on clinical needs; malocclusions may be present. Medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) should be started prior to initiation of any required orthodontic treatment.

Comparison of the Effect of Therapies (Burosumab and Active Vitamin D/Phosphate Salts) on Dental Complications of XLH

Early conventional treatment with good compliance improves dentin and potentially cementum mineralization, reduces dental infections in children and adults, and decreases the severity of periodontitis in adults. Limited studies have compared the effects of burosumab with those of conventional therapy on dental manifestations of XLH in adults. In a recent RCT in adults, burosumab was not found to reduce the number of dental abscesses compared to placebo, However, dental outcomes were not included as a study endpoint measure in the study design and ascertainment was questionable. In this 24-week study, 9 of the 68 adult patients (13.2%) treated with burosumab developed an abscess compared to 5 of the 66 patients (7.6%) in the placebo arm. Further long-term data is being obtained.

Musculoskeletal Manifestations

Osteomalacia may result in bone and muscle pain as well as pseudofractures. Fractures and early osteoarthritis are also commonly observed. An analysis study of clinical trial and survey data (n = 336) has shown that approximately 43% to 47% of adults with XLH had a history of fracture, with the proportions increasing with age. Joint damage occurs early and can be seen as early as the third decade. Bone pain, muscle pain, and muscle stiffness also contribute to decreased mobility. Enthesopathies initially manifest as calcification at the insertion sites of tendons and ligaments, eventually progressing to osteophyte formation. Enthesopathies often develop bilaterally, involving weight-bearing joints and the spine and result in significant pain and impaired mobility. Currently, medical therapy has not been shown to prevent or effectively treat enthesopathies. Healing of pseudofractures and improvement in histomorphometric indices occur with burosumab therapy compared to placebo. Musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, and mobility particularly respond to therapy.

### Transformative therapy in hypophosphatasia [^114sULVf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical findings of the most common manifestations are shown in figure 1; note that presentation can be multisystemic. Low ALP activity level is the hallmark of HPP and should be assessed when HPP is suspected. Measurement of ALP is easy to perform, readily available and can lead to rapid diagnosis. However, its interpretation requires some care. The normal range for ALP is age- and gender-specific, emphasising the need for appropriate laboratory reference ranges. Some laboratories only have one broad reference range for all ages; physicians should be wary because ALP levels that are normal for adults could represent pathological levels for children. Furthermore, there is often a focus upon elevated ALP for the diagnosis of rickets/osteomalacia, rather than low ALP levels.

Together with low ALP levels, typical radiological features of perinatal, infantile and childhood HPP can confirm the diagnosis. However, the radiological features in mild childhood, adult and odonto-HPP are not always diagnostic. Where the diagnosis is in doubt, confirmatory laboratory testing can include PLP, PPi or urinary phosphoethanolamine levels, which are usually above the reference range in patients with HPP, as well as ALPL mutational analyses.

The presence of any clinical findings shown in figure 1 with a combination of low ALP activity level should result in a working diagnosis of HPP until proven otherwise. Timely access to care and treatment options is dependent on the critical period between symptom onset and diagnosis. This is especially important for patients with perinatal and infantile HPP, where delays may have fatal consequences, or in older patients where treatment with bisphosphonates may worsen the bone phenotype. Improving awareness will increase the likelihood of a correct diagnosis and minimise the period between symptom onset and initiating the newly available, potentially life-saving therapy.

We hope that despite the inconvenience of frequent injections and the high cost of the treatment, this transformative therapy will be implemented for those in whom HPP is currently life-limiting.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^116JpFtk]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) multidisciplinary monitoring is depicted as multidisciplinary care team considerations for monitoring across two age groups: (A) perinatal/infantile and younger childhood and (B) older children and adults with HPP. Core team members are represented by oval shapes in the inner two circles. Some core team members may change as the patient ages from young child to older child and adult, and the complement of specialists can vary depending on patient needs. Abbreviations are defined: ENT as ear, nose and throat specialist; GI as gastroenterologist; PT as physical therapy; and OT as occupational therapy.

### Enzyme replacement therapy for hypophosphatasia-the current paradigm [^116ah5Jz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, inherited, and systemic disorder characterized by impaired skeletal mineralization and low tissue nonspecific serum alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) activity. It is caused by either autosomal recessive or dominant-negative mutations in the gene that encodes TNSALP. The phenotype of HPP is very broad including abnormal bone mineralization, disturbances of calcium and phosphate metabolism, pain, recurrent fracture, short stature, respiratory impairment, developmental delay, tooth loss, seizures, and premature death. Other than supportive care, there has been no disease-specific treatment available for those with HPP. Asfotase alfa is a fully humanized, recombinant enzyme replacement therapy for the management of HPP. It is available in several countries for the treatment of the more severe forms of HPP, namely perinatal and infantile HPP. This review will summarize the preclinical data on asfotase alfa and highlight the data from clinical trials and case reports. These data show the transformative nature of asfotase alfa when administered as part of an interdisciplinary treatment model.

### Contemporary medical and surgical management of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets [^116xNvuS]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

X-linked hypophosphatemia is an inheritable disorder of renal phosphate wasting that clinically manifests with rachitic bone pathology. X-linked hypophosphatemia is frequently misdiagnosed and mismanaged. Optimized medical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment. Even with ideal medical management, progressive bony deformity may develop in some children and adults. Medical treatment is paramount to the success of orthopaedic surgical procedures in both children and adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia. Successful correction of complex, multiapical bone deformities found in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia is possible with careful surgical planning and exacting surgical technique. Multiple methods of deformity correction are used, including acute and gradual correction. Treatment of some pediatric bony deformity with guided growth techniques may be possible.

Pseudofractures

Pseudofractures are areas of weakened bone that appear as transverse radiolucent lines on imaging studies, varying in width from less than a millimeter to over a centimeter. They often indicate underlying skeletal weakness or dysfunction due to metabolic bone diseases such as osteomalacia. These lesions have been referred to as Looser's zones, insufficiency fractures, and osteomalacia-related fractures. The aims of therapy are to heal fractures and to prevent complications. If a pseudofracture is at high risk of progressing to a full-thickness fracture or worsening deformity, initiating burosumab therapy is advised. If burosumab is not available, conventional therapy should be considered, despite insufficient data on its impact on fracture healing. Strong evidence supporting the use of burosumab to enhance fracture or pseudofracture healing is available. Consider referral for surgery if there is evidence of deformity or severe pain that is not responding to medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D). Complete fractures or pseudofractures may still require prolonged healing time, even with conventional therapy or burosumab, as noted in the RCT in which only 63% of the active fractures at baseline were completely healed at 48 weeks of therapy.

Complete fragility fracture

The goal of treatment is to fix the fracture, optimize the anatomy and function and promote recovery. The bone is likely to be soft in the presence of a mineralization defect, and therefore nailing may be preferable to plating. A specialized orthopedic team should be consulted in the presence of significant deformity that may be multi-planar. In the RCT improved radiographic healing of active fractures and pseudofractures was observed in the burosumab arm in comparison to placebo in adults over 24 weeks. In our accompanying systematic review, there was a 35% improvement in fracture and pseudofracture healing with a narrow CI (95% CI, 22 more to 49 more) with burosumab in comparison to placebo.
