## Question

What was the impact of an automatic quality control system (AQCS) on adenoma detection rate (ADR) during routine colonoscopy compared with standard colonoscopy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the impact of an automatic quality control system (AQCS) on adenoma detection rate (ADR) during routine colonoscopy compared with standard colonoscopy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and whether it can answer the causal question. Then, I should verify the primary outcome and analytic approach. Next, I will examine the magnitude and statistical significance of the ADR effect, followed by subgroup and secondary outcomes. After that, I need to check for potential biases and limitations that could alter interpretation. Finally, I will contextualize the findings within the broader CADe literature and consider clinical implications and generalizability.

> Let me first confirm the study design and setting, because that frames internal validity. This was a multicenter, single-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at six centers in China, enrolling 1254 adults aged 18–80 years undergoing routine colonoscopy, with stratified block randomization and intention-to-treat analysis, which supports causal inference for the primary outcome [^1174QWeQ] [^115M53e2].

> I need to verify the intervention and comparator. The AQCS provided real-time feedback on withdrawal time, bowel preparation quality, and polyp detection with visual alerts, and was compared against standard high-definition colonoscopy without AQCS assistance; importantly, colonoscopists were aware of the allocation, so I should keep performance and Hawthorne effects in mind as I interpret results [^1146ahn1] [^115M53e2].

> Next, I should review the primary outcome and analytic plan. The primary outcome was ADR, defined as the proportion of colonoscopies with at least one histologically confirmed adenoma, analyzed by intention-to-treat with mixed-effects models adjusting for patient and colonoscopist factors; sessile serrated lesions were excluded from ADR to reduce variability, which I should note when comparing with other studies that include serrated lesions [^1174QWeQ] [^113eqt7D].

> Now, let me examine the main result. In the ITT analysis, ADR was 32.7% with AQCS versus 22.6% with standard colonoscopy, yielding a relative risk of 1.60 with a 95% CI of 1.23–2.09 and P < .001; this corresponds to a 10.1 percentage-point absolute increase in ADR, which is both statistically significant and clinically meaningful given the established inverse relationship between ADR and interval colorectal cancer risk [^1174QWeQ] [^115Nnpdr] [^114j6q2L].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability without checking subgroup effects. The benefit persisted across lower- and medium-level detectors, with larger relative gains among lower-level detectors, and was observed in both academic and nonacademic centers; notably, the proportional ADR increase was consistent across subgroups, supporting external validity within the studied population and endoscopist spectrum [^1174QWeQ] [^115Nnpdr].

> I should confirm secondary outcomes that corroborate the primary finding. The number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) increased from 0.48 to 0.86 with AQCS, and the relative increase was significant; withdrawal time without intervention was modestly longer with AQCS (6.78 vs 6.46 minutes), and bowel preparation quality was slightly better, which plausibly contributes to improved detection; importantly, no serious adverse events were reported, which reassures me about safety signals in this trial [^1174QWeQ] [^1174QWeQ] [^112AvLqb].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude in context. A 10.1 percentage-point ADR increase is substantial; meta-analytic data suggest each 1% ADR increase associates with about a 3% reduction in interval CRC risk, so a 10% ADR gain could translate into a roughly 30% reduction in interval CRC risk, although I should be cautious because this is an extrapolation from observational associations rather than a direct outcome of this RCT [^114j6q2L] [^112CbmKT].

> I need to check for limitations that could inflate the effect. The colonoscopists were not blinded, which introduces potential performance and Hawthorne effects; the baseline ADR in the control arm was 22.6%, lower than many Western cohorts, so there may be more room for improvement; and sessile serrated lesions were excluded from ADR, which could mask or alter the apparent impact on serrated pathway lesions; finally, long-term CRC outcomes and cost-effectiveness were not assessed, so clinical impact remains to be proven [^115M53e2] [^114NgRXB] [^113eqt7D] [^113Vbt1Q].

> Let me consider how this fits with the broader CADe literature. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show CADe increases ADR and reduces miss rates, but effects on advanced adenomas are smaller and inconsistent; AQCS in this trial improved overall ADR and APC with a modest withdrawal time increase, aligning with CADe data while also emphasizing quality-process elements like prep and withdrawal, which may be particularly helpful for lower-performing endoscopists [^115EeQA4] [^111zk9Yz] [^112jF9t2].

> But wait, what if the benefit is just from longer withdrawal time rather than the AI prompts themselves. The trial shows a small increase in withdrawal time with AQCS, and improved prep may also contribute; however, the magnitude of ADR gain exceeds what is typically seen with withdrawal time alone in observational quality-improvement studies, suggesting the AQCS prompts and workflow cues likely add independent value, though I should acknowledge residual confounding remains possible in an unblinded design [^1174QWeQ] [^113K4Gdg].

> I should double-check the clinical implications. For endoscopists with ADR below 35%, incorporating AQCS appears to be a reasonable quality-improvement strategy to raise ADR toward benchmark levels, with the caveat that units should monitor for overtreatment of diminutive polyps and ensure appropriate surveillance recommendations; guideline bodies emphasize routine ADR measurement and feedback, and AQCS could operationalize that feedback loop in real time [^114MapKr] [^1174QWeQ].

> In summary, AQCS increased ADR by 10.1 percentage points versus standard colonoscopy in a multicenter RCT of routine colonoscopy, with consistent benefits across lower- and medium-level detectors and both academic and nonacademic settings; the effect size is clinically meaningful, supported by increased APC and modestly longer withdrawal time, and no serious adverse events were observed, though unblinded colonoscopists and a lower baseline ADR limit certainty and generalizability pending replication and long-term outcome data [^1174QWeQ] [^115Nnpdr] [^115M53e2].

The automatic quality control system (AQCS) **increased the adenoma detection rate (ADR)** to 32.7% vs 22.6% with standard colonoscopy (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.23–2.09; P < .001) in a multicenter RCT of 1,254 patients [^1174QWeQ]. This 10.1% absolute increase was driven by more nonadvanced and flat/sessile adenomas, with a modest increase in withdrawal time (6.78 vs 6.46 min) and no rise in adverse events [^1174QWeQ]. Benefits were consistent across low- and medium-level detectors and in academic and nonacademic centers, supporting AQCS as a tool to improve colonoscopy quality [^115Nnpdr].

## Subgroup analyses

Benefits were consistent across subgroups: **low-level detectors** (ADR 30.0% vs 20.0%; RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24–2.35; P = 0.001) and **medium-level detectors** (ADR 38.1% vs 27.7%; RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07–2.43; P = 0.02) [^115Nnpdr]. Gains were also seen in both **academic centers** (ADR 29.3% vs 20.8%; RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10–2.29; P = 0.01) and **nonacademic centers** (ADR 36.1% vs 24.5%; RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.23–2.46; P = 0.002) [^115Nnpdr].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Quality improvement**: AQCS meaningfully improves ADR, a key colonoscopy quality metric linked to lower interval colorectal cancer risk [^1137Ti3V].
- **Operator variability**: Benefits occur across detector skill levels, suggesting AQCS mitigates operator-dependent variability [^113BupFh].
- **Safety**: No increase in adverse events supports routine use [^1174QWeQ].

---

## Limitations

- **Blinding**: Endoscopists were not blinded, risking performance bias [^115M53e2].
- **Generalizability**: Lower baseline ADR in this cohort may limit applicability to higher-baseline settings [^114NgRXB].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Impact on interval CRC and cost-effectiveness remains to be proven [^113Vbt1Q].

---

The AQCS **increased ADR by 10.1%** versus standard colonoscopy, with consistent benefits across detectors and settings, modestly longer withdrawal time, and no safety signal, indicating a valuable quality-improvement tool for routine colonoscopy [^1174QWeQ].

Importance

High-quality colonoscopy reduces the risks of colorectal cancer by increasing the adenoma detection rate. Routine use of an automatic quality control system (AQCS) to assist in colorectal adenoma detection should be considered.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of an AQCS on the adenoma detection rate among colonoscopists who were moderate- and low-level detectors during routine colonoscopy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 6 centers in China from August 1, 2021, to September 30, 2022. Data were analyzed from March 1 to June 30, 2023. Individuals aged 18 to 80 years were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were a history of inflammatory bowel disease, advanced colorectal cancer, and polyposis syndromes; known colorectal polyps without complete removal previously; a history of colorectal surgery; known stenosis or obstruction with contraindication for biopsy or prior failed colonoscopy; pregnancy or lactation; and refusal to participate. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis was used.

Interventions

Standard colonoscopy or AQCS-assisted colonoscopy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Adenoma detection rate.

Results

A total of 1254 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.21 [12.10] years; 674 [53.7%] male) were randomized (627 standard colonoscopy, 627 AQCS-assisted colonoscopy). Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significantly higher adenoma detection rate in the AQCS-assisted group vs standard colonoscopy group (32.7% vs 22.6%; relative risk[RR], 1.60; 95% CI, 1.23–2.09; P < .001). The adenoma detection rates were significantly higher in the AQCS group when considering pathology (nonadvanced adenomas, 30.1% vs 21.2%; RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16–1.99; P = 0.002), and morphology (flat or sessile, 29.3% vs 20.4%, RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16–2.00; P = 0.003). Use of AQCS significantly increased the adenoma detection rate of both the lower-level detectors (30.0% vs 20.0%; RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.24–2.35; P = 0.001) and the medium-level detectors (38.1% vs 27.7%; RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07–2.43; P = 0.02). Similar increases were found for adenoma detection rates in the academic and nonacademic centers (academic: 29.3% vs 20.8%; RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.10–2.29; P = 0.01; nonacademic: 36.1% vs 24.5%; RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.23–2.46; P = 0.002). The number of adenomas per colonoscopy was significantly higher in the AQCS-assisted group (0.86 vs 0.48; RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.17–1.91; P = 0.001). The mean withdrawal time without intervention was slightly increased with AQCS assistance (6.78 vs 6.46 minutes; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.26–1.52; P < .001). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, AQCS assistance during routine colonoscopy increased adenoma detection rates and several related polyp parameters compared with standard colonoscopy in the lower- and medium-level detectors in academic and nonacademic settings. Routine use of AQCS to assist in colorectal adenoma detection and quality improvement should be considered.

Discussion

In this multicenter randomized clinical trial, a multifaceted quality improvement intervention using AQCS effectively improved the adenoma detection rate of moderate- and low-level detectors during routine colonoscopy in both academic and nonacademic settings. The mixed-effects regression model identified that AQCS-assisted colonoscopy significantly improved the adenoma detection rate, polyp detection rate, and APC for routine procedures after adjustment for possible confounders, including the variability between patients and colonoscopists. The positive results were accompanied by a slightly prolonged withdrawal time (6.65 vs 6.41 minutes. difference, 0.24minutes) for negative colonoscopy. The AQCS-assisted colonoscopy offered benefits for both moderate- and low-level detectors in both the academic and nonacademic settings and could even attenuate the influence of suboptimal colonoscopy (unqualified bowel preparation, withdrawal time < 6 minutes, or incomplete colonoscopy) on the adenoma detection rate.

The role of CADe assistance in colonoscopy for colonoscopists with varying proficiency levels remains unclear. In a recent study, while the difference was not significant, the lower detectors (basal adenoma detection rate < 25%) might achieve higher improvement in the adenoma detection rate (6.2%) with CADe assistance, compared with the medium-level detectors (3.7%). Another study reported that experts (≥ 5000 colonoscopies) benefit more from artificial intelligence–assisted colonoscopy, while an Italian study showed similar benefits across colonoscopists with varying experience levels. Such inconsistencies may result from adenoma detection rate variability among colonoscopists and patient-dependent factors. In our study, AQCS improved adenoma detection rates similarly across both medium-level (10.4%) and lower-level (10.0%) detectors, suggesting that experience may not be essential for adenoma detection rate improvement with AQCS. This is probably because of AQCS supervision of bowel cleanliness and withdrawal time improving mucosal visibility and reducing inattentional blindness. Even with the assistance of AQCS, the adenoma detection rate in low-level detectors (30.0%) was still lower than that in medium-level detectors (38.1%), indicating that other objective withdrawal techniques focused on behind-fold inspection and distension are warranted for higher adenoma detection rates.

Conclusions

In our multicenter randomized clinical trial, AQCS assistance during routine colonoscopy improved the adenoma detection rate, APC, and adenoma detection rate of both low- and medium-level examiners in academic and nonacademic settings. A possible association between adenoma findings by AQCS and long-term data, including CRC and cost-effectiveness, needs further investigation.

Key Points

Question

Does use of the automatic quality control system (AQCS) affect adenoma detection rates among colonoscopists who were moderate- and low-level detectors during routine colonoscopy?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial that included 1254 adults, the AQCS-assisted group achieved a significantly higher adenoma detection rate vs the standard colonoscopy group (32.7% vs 22.6%). Adenoma detection rates for nonadvanced adenomas, flat or sessile adenomas, and number of adenomas per colonoscopy were also significantly improved in the AQCS-assisted group.

Meaning

The findings of this study support the application of AQCS to increase the adenoma detection rate of moderate- and low-level detectors in routine colonoscopy practice.

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^115tSq6j]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The relatively higher improvement in the adenoma detection rate at nonacademic settings observed in our trial (11.6%) could be partly attributed to the lower baseline adenoma detection rate of 22.6% among routine colonoscopies, compared with aforementioned studies (ranging from 33.7% to 43.9%), which were limited to European and US populations and found much smaller benefits, and even negative outcomes, of CADe. Also noteworthy is the participating colonoscopists with low to moderate performance (adenoma detection rate < 35%), leaving room for more improvement in adenoma detection.

Our findings also support the efficacy of AQCS on APC and polyp detection rate, which corresponded to available evidence. The APC clinical improvement is important in identifying high- and low-quality procedures and is recognized as a more granular measure to discriminate colonoscopists with similar adenoma detection rates. The discriminatory benefit of APC was observed among low-level detectors in our study, but not medium-level detectors. When stratified by the indication of colonoscopy, the APC was not significantly different between screening and surveillance procedures, but differences were noted only in diagnostic procedures. This suggests that relevant factors beyond AQCS may influence the APC and that its added values might be restricted in a subset of indications. Unlike other published data, there was no significant difference in the overall adenoma detection rate in this study, probably because most advanced adenomas are large, which is not the strength of AQCS. By contrast, the adenoma detection rate improvement by AQCS is met with an increased proportion of patients requiring intensive postpolypectomy surveillance, with absolute increases of 3.7% (US Multi-Society Task Force guideline) and 3.9% (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline). The patients with AQCS-upshifted high-risk adenoma were more common among low-level detectors by the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society guideline. Surveillance strategies are warranted to offset the risk of overdiagnosis and CRC prevention effect.

The number of polyps per colonoscopy were 1.39 the AQCS group and 0.96 in the standard colonoscopy group (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01–1.51) (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). The APC in the AQCS group was higher than that in the standard colonoscopy group (0.86 vs 0.48; RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.17–1.91; P = 0.001) (Table 2). The APC in the AQCS group was higher than that in the standard colonoscopy group among the lower-level detectors (0.82 vs 0.34; RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.24–2.35; P = 0.001), but not among the medium-level detectors (0.94 vs 0.73; RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.79–1.71). The AQCS offered the benefit of APC for the nonacademic centers (1.09 vs 0.57; RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.12–2.20), but not for the academic centers (0.62 vs 0.38; RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.90–1.86). Use of AQCS improved the APC for diagnostic colonoscopy (0.81 vs 0.46; RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.18–2.32). A statistically significant increase in the APC with use of AQCS was found for flat or sessile lesions, proximal colonic lesions, lesions less than 10 mm, and nonadvanced adenomas, but not for the mean number of advanced adenomas or nonneoplastic polyps (eTable 3 in Supplement 1).

### CAD-aided colonoscopy and advanced adenomas-NCI… [^11316bXH]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Their study was published August 29 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. A different study in the same issue reported similar results from an analysis of 21 previous clinical trials that had tested the addition of CAD to standard colonoscopy. Overall, the addition of AI increased the rate of polyp detection, but again, this was driven by an increase in detection of small polyps, not larger, more threatening growths. Studies of these systems to date have provided conflicting evidence about whether they improve endoscopists' performance. And previous clinical trials haven't been large enough to determine if they make a meaningful difference in detecting advanced adenomas. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a standard colonoscopy or colonoscopy with CAD. A total of 64 endoscopists from the six centers participated in the study. Overall, advanced adenomas or colorectal cancers were found in about 34% of participants in both groups.

These results differ from those of some earlier, smaller studies that found that adding CAD to the procedure increased the detection of advanced adenomas and colorectal cancers. This difference may be, at least in part, because of the extensive experience of the participating endoscopists and the correspondingly high detection rate of advanced adenomas in the control group, the study team wrote. "It is possible that in contexts of lower or in groups of endoscopists considered… "low detectors" there may be more effect of computer-aided detection systems, " they wrote. Computer-aided detection did increase the number of small — less than 5 millimeters in diameter — polyps removed, even by experienced doctors. Similar results were seen in the second study, carried out by a European research team, which analyzed the results of 21 previous randomized clinical trials testing CAD added to colonoscopy.

The study, called a meta-analysis, included data on more than 18, 000 people who had participated in the earlier trials. As in the CADILLAC study, the meta-analysis showed that adding CAD increased the detection of small polyps — in this case, by more than 50% — but not of advanced adenomas. Any polyp found on colonoscopy will be taken out during the procedure. So with increased detection of small polyps "we might be removing too many things that don't necessarily need to be removed, " explained Dr. Umar. This is a phenomenon called overtreatment.

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^115Nnpdr]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The adenoma detection rate was 32.7% (205 of 627) in the AQCS group and 22.6% (142 of 627) in the standard colonoscopy group (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.23–2.09; P < .001; intracluster correlation coefficient, < 0.001) (Table 2). AQCS implementation resulted in a 10.1–percentage point increase in the adenoma detection rate compared to with the standard colonoscopy group (22.6%). Per-protocol analysis results were consistent with the ITT analysis results. In addition, the adenoma detection rate of suboptimal colonoscopy was significantly higher in the AQCS than in the standard colonoscopy group (26.3% vs 12.0%; P = 0.02). Significant differences were found only in the histologic evaluation subgroups with nonadvanced adenomas (Figure 2). The detection rate of nonneoplastic polyps was similar between groups. Of these, patients with no pathologically proven adenoma, CRCs, or sessile serrated lesions after polypectomy accounted for 11.8% (74 of 627) in the AQCS group and 13.7% (86 of 627) in the standard colonoscopy group (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.67–1.36; P = 0.78). The detection rate of adenomas was significantly higher in the AQCS group when considering shape (flat or sessile), size (diminutive and large), and location (ascending and transverse colon). The proportional effect of AQCS assistance on the adenoma detection rate was consistent across all 8 subgroups (all P < .05 for interaction) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1), including by center characteristics and colonoscopist performance. Compared with standard colonoscopy group, use of AQCS significantly increased the adenoma detection rate of both the lower-level detectors (30.0% vs 20.0%; RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.24–2.35; P = 0.001) and the medium-level detectors (38.1% vs 27.7%; RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07–2.43; P = 0.02). Similar increases were found for adenoma detection rates in the academic and nonacademic centers (academic: 29.3% vs 20.8%; RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.10–2.29; P = 0.01; nonacademic: 36.1% vs 24.5%; RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.23–2.46; P = 0.002). The adenoma detection rate increase with AQCS was 8.5% in academic centers and 11.6% in nonacademic centers.

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^112a8dAq]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The adenoma detection rate was significantly increased with the assistance of AQCS (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.23–2.09; P < .001) (Table 3). Factors contributing to a higher adenoma detection rate included surveillance colonoscopy, increased withdrawal time without intervention, qualified BBPS score, advanced age, and male sex. Additionally, advanced age, longer withdrawal time without intervention, and smoking history increased the adenoma detection rate, whereas AQCS, qualified BBPS score, and colonoscopist performance did not have a notable influence on the adenoma detection rate.

Table 3.
Multivariate Regression Analysis of Predictors of Adenoma and Advanced Adenoma Detection Rate a

Abbreviations: AQCS, automatic quality control system; BBPS, Boston Bowel Preparation Scale; RR, relative risk.

According to the 2020 US Multi-Society Task Force guideline on colonoscopy surveillance, the proportion of patients who are recommended to have 1- and 3-year surveillance intervals increased from 5.5% in the standard colonoscopy group to 9.2% in the AQCS group (absolute difference, 3.7 percentage points) (Table 2). With use of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society guideline, AQCS significantly increased the proportion of patients recommended to use a 1- or 3-year surveillance interval within the lower-level detector groups (eTable 4 in Supplement 1).

A total of 809 false-positive detections were registered across the 623 videos of the AQCS group, corresponding to a mean of 1.3 false-positive detections per colonoscopy. Among them, 0.9 false-positive detections (72.6%) per colonoscopy were due to folds and other artifacts from the bowel wall. Conversely, 0.4 false-positive detections (27.4%) were caused by artifacts from bowel content. In detail, 515 false-positive detections (63.7%) were classified as being of no clinical relevance (0 seconds), 255 as mild clinical relevance (≤ 1 second) (31.5%), 36 as moderate clinical relevance (1–3 seconds) (4.4%), and 3 as severe clinical relevance (> 3 seconds) (0.4%). No false-positive detections triggered biopsy or polypectomy.

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^114NgRXB]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In our study, AQCS implementation resulted in a 10.1% increase in the adenoma detection rate compared with the standard colonoscopy group (22.6%), similar to a 10.3% increase reported in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized clinical trials in China. The adenoma detection rate increase with AQCS was 8.5% in academic centers and 11.6% in nonacademic centers in our study. While artificial intelligence–assisted colonoscopy has shown benefits in university-affiliated or military endoscopy centers, evidence from nonacademic centers is limited and inconsistent. In a French study with 2039 patients, CADe increased the adenoma detection rate from 33.7% to 37.5% (P = 0.05) during routine colonoscopy in a nonacademic center. A US study in nonacademic centers found a small, but nonsignificant, benefit in the adenoma detection rate of 3.9% from a baseline rate of 43.9% and APC of 0.22 from a baseline mean of 0.83 (P = 0.002) in a relatively lower risk population (screening and surveillance only) by high-performing colonoscopists (baseline adenoma detection rate, 43.9%). Another US study in 4 community-based centers found that CADe was not superior to standard colonoscopy for the adenoma detection rate (35.9% vs 37.2%; P = 0.77). The adenoma detection rate in our study is lower than reported in studies from European countries and the US. This may be largely due to the relatively lower CRC risk population recruited in our study. Nevertheless, this low adenoma detection rate may limit the generalizability of our findings.

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^111xzGfY]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Based on the mean adenoma detection rate (24%) among patients undergoing colonoscopies at 6 of the participating centers over the past 12 months, a sample size of 501 individuals per group was warranted to yield an 8% increasein the adenoma detection rate with 80% power (5% α level; 2-sided test) in the AQCS group. Thus, the estimated sample size was 1254 patients in total with a 20% dropout rate.

All data were analyzed according to the ITT population, which included all randomly assigned patients, without imputation or weighting for missing data. Continuous variables are reported as mean (SD) or median (range). Numbers and percentages were used for categorical variables. Baseline clinical and colonoscopy features were compared using the χ² test or Fisher exact test for the categorical variables and the 2-tailed t test for the continuous variables. The primary and secondary outcomes were compared by mixed-effects logistic regression or negative binomial regression with the colonoscopist's level as the random effects, and patient characteristics including indication for colonoscopy (screening, surveillance, and diagnosis), age, sex, smoking history, withdrawal time without intervention, bowel cleanliness, and basal adenoma detection rate levels (< 25% and 25%-35%)as fixed effects. According to the recommendation of American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice, lower-level detectors were defined as colonoscopists with a basal adenoma detection rate less than 25% and medium-level detectors as those with an adenoma detection rate of 25% to 35%. Accordingly, we fit additional 2-level models without covariates to calculate the intracluster correlation coefficient, which serves as an indicator of the colonoscopist's correlation with the outcome. With 2-sided testing, P < .05 was judged as the statistically significant threshold. All data were analyzed with R, version 3.6.0 or higher.

Data Collection

Data collected included baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, body mass index, family CRC history, alcohol and tobacco use, and medical history), the procedure details (indication for colonoscopy, sedation, intubation time, withdrawal time without intervention, BBPS score, and basal adenoma detection rate of enrolled colonoscopists), and polyp characteristics (number, size, morphologic characteristics, and location). Basal adenoma detection rate was calculated from 100 consecutive colonoscopies performed by the colonoscopist before study entry. The BBPS score after cleaning was evaluated by experts during the procedure and used as the outcome. The experts were independent and distinct from the colonoscopy operators. All alarm boxes that appeared during the withdrawal phase were recorded and analyzed to see whether they were ultimately false-positive, and colonoscopists were required to carefully check each alarm box (even if only 1 frame was displayed). The number and clinical relevance of false-positive results were also documented.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome, adenoma detection rate, was defined as the proportion of individuals with 1 or more adenomas confirmed by histopathologic examination. Sessile serrated lesions were excluded from adenoma detection rate calculation due to variability in pathologist reporting.

Secondary outcomes included advanced adenoma detection rate, proximal colonic adenoma detection rate, adenoma detection rate in academic and nonacademic settings, adenoma detection rate of suboptimal colonoscopy, number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC), adverse events, and withdrawal time without intervention. The primary analysis was prespecified to be assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.

Results

Between August 1, 2021, and September 30, 2022, a total of 1254 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.21 [12.10] years; 580 [46.3%] female; 674 [53.7%] male) were randomly assigned to either standard colonoscopy (n = 627) or AQCS-assisted colonoscopy (n = 627), completed the measures, and were included in ITT analysis (Figure 1). After excluding individuals with incomplete colonoscopy and unqualified bowel preparation, 571 participants in the AQCS-assisted group and 567 in the standard colonoscopy group were included in the per-protocol analysis. Demographic and adenoma risk factors were similar between the groups (Table 1).

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^113Pz299]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The study AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy was published by Jing Liu and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Colonoscopy and Colorectal polyps. In the AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy study, the trial question was: what is the effect of an automatic quality control system on adenoma detection rate during routine colonoscopy? In the AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy study, the population was: 1254 patients (580 female, 674 male). The inclusion criteria were adults aged 18–80 years undergoing routine colonoscopy. The key exclusion criteria were history of IBD, advanced CRC, or polyposis syndrome; colorectal polyps without complete removal previously; history of colorectal surgery; stenosis or obstruction with contraindication for biopsy or prior failed colonoscopy; pregnancy or lactation. In the AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy study, the interventions were: n = 627 AQCS-assisted colonoscopy (colonoscopy examination with the assistance of automatic quality control system) n = 627 standard colonoscopy (conventional standard colonoscopy without the assistance of automatic quality control system). In the AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in detection of adenoma (32.7% vs. 22.6%; RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.09). In the AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in detection of adenuma during suboptimal colonoscopy (26.3% vs. 12%; RR 2.97, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.13) Significant increase in adenomas per colonoscopy (0.86 adenomas vs. 0.48 adenomas; RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.91) Significant increase in mean withdrawal time without intervention (6.78 minutes vs. 6.46 minutes; RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.52). In the AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the AQCS-Assisted Colonoscopy study, the conclusion was: in adults aged 18–80 years undergoing routine colonoscopy, AQCS-assisted colonoscopy was superior to standard colonoscopy with respect to detection of adenoma.

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^112AvLqb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In addition, the adenoma detection rate of suboptimal colonoscopy was significantly higher in the AQCS than in the standard colonoscopy group (26.3% vs 12.0%; P = 0.02). This finding indicated the AQCS might improve mucosal visibility by reminding the detectors of cleansing maneuvers. However, although the difference between the BBPS in the AQCS and standard colonoscopy groups was statistically significant, it may not be clinically relevant. The time used to reach a slight improvement in the BBPS may not impact colonoscopy performance but only the withdrawal time, which was slightly longer in the AQCS group.

Regarding harms, mean nonneoplastic lesions per colonoscopy were similar between the AQCS and standard colonoscopy groups. This suggests that colonoscopists may have visually diagnosed and subsequently disregarded nonneoplastic polyps. A slightly prolonged withdrawal time without intervention was identified in the AQCS group, most likely owing to more time to clean the mucosa or suction liquid pools when an inadequate score was given by the AQCS. In addition, false-positive detections may hamper the effectiveness of AQCS by prolonging mucosal examination time and frustrating colonoscopists to use this tool. In this study, only about 5% of false alarms lasted for more than 1 second, which may have some clinical relevance. Furthermore, no immediate or delayed adverse events were observed.

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^1146ahn1]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Colonoscopy efficacy to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) is widely variable due to the discrepancy of patient-, colonoscopist-, and procedure-related characteristics. In addition, innovation tools for increasing mucosal exposure, enhancing imaging, and providing a wider viewing angle, are highly dependent on colonoscopist observation. Therefore, quality indicators were introduced, including withdrawal time, cecal intubation, bowel preparation, and photodocumentation of key landmarks to improve colonoscopy quality control. However, these indicators are often not followed well during routine colonoscopies due to colonoscopists' workload, insufficient immediate supervision, and lack of practical tools.

An automatic quality control system (AQCS) has been developed for the timing of the colonoscopy intubation and withdrawal phase, monitoring withdrawal stability, evaluating bowel preparation, and detecting polyps during high-definition white-light colonoscopy procedures (Video; eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). The AQCS increased the adenoma detection rate in a randomized clinical trial of 659 participants. Several studies have shown computer-aided detection (CADe) devices improve the adenoma detection rate using randomized parallel or tandem methods, mainly among Western hemisphere high-performing colonoscopists. This study aimed to evaluate AQCS effectiveness in increasing colorectal adenoma detection rates among colonoscopists who were moderate- and low-level detectors within a Chinese population.

### Automatic quality control system and adenoma detection rates during routine colonoscopy: a randomized clinical trial [^115M53e2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of our study include multiple academic and nonacademic settings, stratified block randomization, the adaptability of equipment (Olympus and Pentax), and lower- and medium-level detectors. All of these factors reflect current routine clinical practice.

This study has certain limitations. First, potential Hawthorne bias might exist due to the inability to blind the colonoscopists to the patient assignment. The exact benefit of the AQCS may be overrated because detectors may be more attentive when under observation. Second, the association between adenoma findings by AQCS and long-term data, including CRC and cost-effectiveness, is unclear. A recent study using a Markov microsimulation model suggests that the adoption of artificial intelligence in screening scenarios is a cost-saving strategy to additionally prevent 7194 CRC cases and 2089 related deaths per year. Third, AQCS does not implement blind spot recognition and reminders. Fourth, the absence of a third control arm that includes only the CADe limits the ability to draw conclusions about the real advantage of AQCS over CADe. However, previous studies have evaluated the use of CADe in improving the adenoma detection rate, and the effect of colonoscopy quality control on adenoma detection rate is well established. Fifth, the synergistic effect of interventions, including mucosal exposure devices, image-enhanced technologies, and short-retraining courses, may be reasonably considered and further investigated.

### Impact of a real-time automatic quality control system on colorectal polyp and adenoma detection: a prospective randomized controlled study (with videos) [^113eNkPW]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Quality control can decrease variations in the performance of colonoscopists and improve the effectiveness of colonoscopy to prevent colorectal cancers. Unfortunately, routine quality control is difficult to carry out because a practical method is lacking. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic quality control system (AQCS) and assess whether it could improve polyp and adenoma detection in clinical practice.

Methods

First, we developed AQCS based on deep convolutional neural network models for timing of the withdrawal phase, supervising withdrawal stability, evaluating bowel preparation, and detecting colorectal polyps. Next, consecutive patients were prospectively randomized to undergo routine colonoscopies with or without the assistance of AQCS. The primary outcome of the study was the adenoma detection rate (ADR) in the AQCS and control groups.

Results

A total of 659 patients were enrolled and randomized. A total of 308 and 315 patients were analyzed in the AQCS and control groups, respectively. AQCS significantly increased the ADR (0.289 vs 0.165, P < .001) and the mean number of adenomas per procedure (0.367 vs 0.178, P < .001) compared with the control group. A significant increase was also observed in the polyp detection rate (0.383 vs 0.254, P = 0.001) and the mean number of polyps detected per procedure (0.575 vs 0.305, P < .001). In addition, the withdrawal time (7.03 minutes vs 5.68 minutes, P < .001) and adequate bowel preparation rate (87.34% vs 80.63%, P = 0.023) were superior for the AQCS group.

Conclusions

AQCS could effectively improve the performance of colonoscopists during the withdrawal phase and significantly increase polyp and adenoma detection. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT03622281.).

### Real-time automatic detection system increases colonoscopic polyp and adenoma detection rates: a prospective randomised controlled study [^1129DhEm]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The effect of colonoscopy on colorectal cancer mortality is limited by several factors, among them a certain miss rate, leading to limited adenoma detection rates (ADRs). We investigated the effect of an automatic polyp detection system based on deep learning on polyp detection rate and ADR.

Design

In an open, non-blinded trial, consecutive patients were prospectively randomised to undergo diagnostic colonoscopy with or without assistance of a real-time automatic polyp detection system providing a simultaneous visual notice and sound alarm on polyp detection. The primary outcome was ADR.

Results

Of 1058 patients included, 536 were randomised to standard colonoscopy, and 522 were randomised to colonoscopy with computer-aided diagnosis. The artificial intelligence (AI) system significantly increased ADR (29.1%vs20.3%, p < 0.001) and the mean number of adenomas per patient (0.53vs0.31, p < 0.001). This was due to a higher number of diminutive adenomas found (185vs102; p < 0.001), while there was no statistical difference in larger adenomas (77vs58, p = 0.075). In addition, the number of hyperplastic polyps was also significantly increased (114vs52, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In a low prevalent ADR population, an automatic polyp detection system during colonoscopy resulted in a significant increase in the number of diminutive adenomas detected, as well as an increase in the rate of hyperplastic polyps. The cost–benefit ratio of such effects has to be determined further.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy improves adenoma detection rates in routine colonoscopy practice: a single-center, retrospective, propensity score-matched study with concurrent controls [^117EJMYc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Since most CRCs originate from precursor adenomas, colonoscopy and polypectomy can prevent CRC and related deaths. Additionally, the adenoma detection rate (ADR) has long been considered a key quality indicator for screening colonoscopy, as a higher ADR is associated with a reduced risk of CRC. However, ADRs vary widely among endoscopists, with over 20% of adenomas missed during colonoscopy. In addition, even the same examiner can experience variations in the ADR of over 10% owing to factors such as time pressure, patient characteristics, sedation status, and examiner's fatigue.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the introduction of computer-aided detection (CADe) in colonoscopy practice to enhance quality and address operator-dependent limitations. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that AI-assisted colonoscopy significantly increases ADRs compared with standard colonoscopy. However, several real-world clinical studies failed to demonstrate an increase in ADRs with AI-assisted colonoscopy, suggesting that the benefits reported in RCTs may not be reproducible. Moreover, two recent meta-analyses of real-world AI-assisted colonoscopy studies showed mixed results regarding increased ADRs. Therefore, more evidence is required to evaluate the impact of AI-assisted colonoscopy in real-world settings. This study aimed to determine whether AI-assisted colonoscopy can improve ADRs in uncontrolled, real-world clinical practice using a retrospective observational study design with concurrent controls.

The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is our current best colonoscopy quality indicator, but it is not without limitations. In this issue of the Journal, novel ADR benchmarks are proposed based on historical local colonoscopy results. These minimally acceptable, standard of care, and aspirational benchmarks may encourage continuous quality improvement through the explicit determination of notably higher but proven achievable ADR targets, although validation in clinical practice is needed. Ultimately, we must transition from ADR measurement to the implementation of robust quality improvement processes that assure the best outcomes for our patients.

### Real-time automatic detection system increases colonoscopic polyp and adenoma detection rates: a prospective randomised controlled study [^117AXzRg]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CRC is a major public health issue given its high incidence and mortality rate. Furthermore, a recently published study reported a marked increase in the annual percentage change in the incidence of CRC among young adults. The mortality rate and incidence of CRC in adults have drastically decreased (by 51% and 32%, respectively) in the last half century, mainly as a result of CRC screening and the removal of adenomatous polyps. Screening colonoscopies have also allowed for an increase in 5-year survival rate in CRC, a consequence of early detection as well as removal of precancerous adenomas. Given the impact of colonoscopy on CRC incidence and mortality, technological advances such as full spectrum colonoscopy, retrograde viewing accessories, balloon colonoscope and endocuff-assisted colonoscopy have been introduced to improve the ADR by expanding the visual field. Methods aimed at improving the quality of colonoscopies such as minimal withdrawal time, split-dose bowel preparation and retroflexion in the right colon have also increased the ADR. Despite these advancements, polyps can still be missed. Studies have also reported that some polyps are missed by the endoscopist despite being within the visual field. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism by which polyps may be missed. These include differences in endoscopist skill level, differences in endoscopist tracking patterns, 'inattentional blindness', wherein an observer fails to process an image on the screen due to distraction, and 'change blindness', wherein changes are missed during interruptions in visual scanning or during eye movements13. Distraction caused by fatigue or emotional factors may also contribute. A second party such as a nurse or a trainee observing may improve PDR. While several studies have shown that this increases PDR, controversy remains regarding ADR. It is likely that adding additional human observers beyond one would not completely overcome these limitations.

### Artificial intelligence for colorectal neoplasia detection during colonoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114LgDy1]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer globally, representing a significant cause of cancer-related deaths. The pivotal approach to reducing CRC incidence and mortality involves the detection and removal of adenomatous polyps during colonoscopy. Every 1% increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR), the primary quality indicator of colonoscopy, correlated with a 3% decrease in the risk of interval CRC. Nevertheless, wide variability exists in ADR Among different endoscopy services, with up to 27% of adenomatous polyps potentially being overlooked due to technical and cognitive limitations associated with the standard colonoscope.

Several artificial intelligence (AI)-aided systems have been developed to standardize polyp detection among endoscopists and mitigate human error. However, the impact of these AI tools on colonoscopy outcomes has been shown inconsistent across studies. Concerns include the potential negative effects on endoscopic training, endoscopist distraction, and the risk of polyp overdiagnosis, which could lead to increased cost and patient burden without significant additional benefits. Thus, more reliable evidence is essential for supporting the clinical application of AI-aided colonoscopy.

Recent meta-analyses have highlighted significantly improved detection rates using AI-aided systems. However, certain limitations undercut the strength of their conclusions. Many meta-analyses encompassed only a few small RCTs, and some studies even incorporated non-RCTs, leading to underpowered and unreliable pooled estimates. Moreover, the pooled outcomes reported in previous studies exhibit substantial and unexplained heterogeneity. Notably, while meta-analysis aims to provide pooled estimates, understanding variance amidst considerable heterogeneity is equally critical, with the summary effect becoming less significant. Furthermore, most published studies disregarded other important colonoscopy quality indicators, such as the adenoma miss rate (AMR), which better reflects the clinical utility of this emerging technology.

To address the limitations of previous studies and extend our knowledge of AI-aided colonoscopy on colorectal neoplasia, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of AI-aided systems during colonoscopy compared to standard colonoscopy. This comprehensive meta-analysis aims to increase statistical power, reduce bias, explore potential heterogeneity sources, and facilitate exploratory analyses to formulate hypotheses for future research.

### Use of artificial intelligence improves colonoscopy performance in adenoma detection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cb7i1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to improve adenoma detection during colonoscopy. This meta-analysis aimed to provide an updated evaluation of computer-aided detection (CADe) systems and their impact on key colonoscopy quality indicators.

Methods

We searched the EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases from inception until February 15, 2024, for randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the performance of CADe systems with routine unassisted colonoscopy in the detection of colorectal adenomas.

Results

Twenty-eight RCTs were selected for inclusion involving 23,861 participants. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated a 20% increase in adenoma detection rate (risk ratio [RR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–1.27; P < .01) and 55% decrease in adenoma miss rate (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37–0.54; P < .01) with AI-assisted colonoscopy. Subgroup analyses involving only expert endoscopists demonstrated a similar effect size (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11–1.27; P < .001), with similar findings seen in analysis of differing CADe systems and healthcare settings. CADe use also significantly increased adenomas per colonoscopy (weighted mean difference, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.14–0.29; P < .01), primarily because of increased diminutive lesion detection, with no significant difference seen in detection of advanced adenomas. Sessile serrated lesion detection (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93–1.30; P = 0.27) and miss rates (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.16–1.19; P = 0.11) were similar. There was an average 0.15-minute prolongation of withdrawal time with AI-assisted colonoscopy (weighted mean difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04–0.25; P = 0.01) and a 39% increase in the rate of non-neoplastic resection (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.23–1.57; P < .001).

Conclusions

AI-assisted colonoscopy significantly improved adenoma detection but not sessile serrated lesion detection irrespective of endoscopist experience, system type, or healthcare setting.

### Real-time automatic detection system increases colonoscopic polyp and adenoma detection rates: a prospective randomised controlled study [^113T42jW]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Adenoma characteristics, mean number of adenomas per case and ADR

A total of 422 adenomas were detected (table 2). The mean number of adenomas detected per colonoscopy in the control and CADe group were 0.31 and 0.53, respectively (p < 0.001). There was a 1.72-fold increase in the mean number of adenomas detected between the experimental and control groups (95% CI 1.419 to 2.084, p < 0.001) (table 3). The ADR of the control and the CADe groups were 0.20 and 0.29, respectively (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.213 to 2.135, p < 0.001) (table 3).

The number of detected polyps was significantly higher in the CADe group as compared with the control group when considering non-pedunculated polyps, polyps ranging in size from 0 cm to 1 cm and polyps in all segments of the colon. The number of detected adenomas was also significantly higher in CADe group when considering non-pedunculated polyps, polyps smaller than 0.5 cm and polyps in all segments of the colon with the exception of the caecum and the ascending colon (table 3).

Outcomes in excellent bowel preparation (BBPS ≥ 7)

In the situation of excellent bowel preparation, ADR in the CADe group showed a trend of 6% increase superior to that of the routine group. However, due to the inadequate sample size of the subgroup analysis, it failed to show a statistically significant difference. Other outcomes, including the mean number of detected adenomas, mean number of detected polyps and PDR were all significantly increased in the CADe group (table 4).

### A computer-aided detection system in the everyday setting of diagnostic, screening, and surveillance colonoscopy: an international, randomized trial [^1145yU9c]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for the detection and removal of premalignant colorectal lesions. Despite its effectiveness, a notable number of lesions are still missed during colonoscopy, increasing the risk of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer (CRC). This risk is inversely correlated with the adenoma detection rate (ADR), which is widely considered the main quality parameter in colonoscopy.

Recently, artificial intelligence systems, such as computer-aided detection (CADe) systems, have emerged to assist in the detection of colorectal polyps during colonoscopy. A recent systematic review of 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing CADe vs. conventional colonoscopy in over 18 000 patients demonstrated an approximate 24% relative increase in ADR due to CADe. Despite this significant benefit in overall ADR, there were no significant differences between CADe and conventional colonoscopy in the detection of advanced adenomas or sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), raising concerns regarding the efficacy of CADe in these lesions with a higher risk of CRC. Furthermore, despite reports of high efficacy in RCTs, there has been an increasing recognition of the variability in the performance of CADe systems across different colonoscopy indications and pragmatic trials.

The aim of this study was to compare ADR and other quality indicators in CADe-assisted colonoscopy vs. conventional colonoscopy in patients with diagnostic, non-immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) screening, or surveillance indications for colonoscopy.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is consistently revolutionizing the medical field. The potential applications of AI in endoscopy have not yet been fully recognized and represent a dynamic area of research and development. Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden and the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both the United States and worldwide. Colonoscopy is the gold standard for CRC screening, which is essential in detecting and removing preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. Specific performance measures were developed which are addressed in quality improvement initiatives and remain the main target of technological improvement. The variability in detecting preneoplastic lesions remains a significant limitation of cancer prevention.

Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is an independent predictor of the risk of interval or post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer (PC-CRC). In the control groups of randomized controlled trials, the heterogeneity of ADR ranged from 8.2% to 68.1%. Approximately 26% of colorectal adenomas and 9% of advanced adenomas are missed on a single colonoscopy. Missed polyps might be in areas not visible on-screen due to bowel anatomy or appear on-screen but remain unrecognized by the endoscopist. Both reasons are addressed by novel technologies.

Recent advances in AI technology have highlighted its valuable role in improving colonoscopy procedures, leading to its growing use in clinical practice. Computer-aided detection (CADe) based on AI may improve the colonoscopy quality. Several studies have shown that CADe significantly lowered miss rates and increased ADR. The improvement in ADR was noted for both expert and non-expert attending endoscopists. Although the improved detection of benign adenomas does not extend to advanced adenomas, the implementation of CADe in screening colonoscopy was proven to be a cost-saving strategy to prevent colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. On the other hand, Nehme et al. reported that, when the activation of the system in daily practice was at the discretion of the endoscopist, it was activated in 52.1% of cases and did not improve ADR. Also, Levy et al. compared ADRs before and after the implementation of CADe in a high-volume center. Surprisingly, both ADR and polyp detection rate remarkably decreased with CADe. Nevertheless, AI tools are suggested as feasible performance enhancements in detecting and characterizing gastrointestinal lesions, standardization of reporting quality metrics, optimization of workflows, and aiding in predictive modeling and diagnosis.

### Artificial intelligence for colorectal neoplasia detection during colonoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114f9As4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

AMR, ADR, and APC

Individuals who intervened with the AI-aided systems experience a 50.5% decrease (17.5% risk difference) in AMR (RR, 0.495; 95% CI, 0.390–0.627; Figure S6), a 24.2% increase (7.4% risk difference) in ADR (RR, 1.242; 95% CI, 1.159–1.332; Figure S7), a 39% increase (19.9% rate difference) in APC rate (IRR, 1.390; 95% CI, 1.277–1.513; Figure S8), and 0.202 more number of APC (95% CI, 0.144–0.259; Figure S9) compared to standard colonoscopy (Table 2).

Substantial heterogeneity was observed for ADR and APC. Moreover, the 95% prediction intervals crossed the no-effect line for ADR (RR, 0.886–1.742) and APC (IRR, 0.909–2.126), indicating that AI-aided colonoscopy may not benefit adenoma detection in certain populations. Publication bias was identified for ADR (Figure S10) and APC (Figure S11 for rate ratio and Figure S12 for mean difference), yet it did not affect the overall conclusions.

### Evaluation efficacy and accuracy of a real-time computer-aided polyp detection system during colonoscopy: a prospective, multicentric, randomized, parallel-controlled study trial [^115tXBnH]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomization

The clinical trial center screened eligible subjects and randomly assigned them to either the experimental or control group before their colonoscopy. In the experimental group, colonoscopies were performed with software assistance, while the control group underwent routine procedures. Block randomization was used, with random numbers generated by SAS ®9.4 software to ensure a 1:1 ratio between groups. Individuals not involved in the trial prepared the random grouping cards, and neither researchers nor subjects were informed of group assignments to prevent selection bias. Due to the software-assisted intervention, blinding was not possible for patients and researchers. No control medical devices were used in the study.

The trial will be conducted across multiple clinical institutions, aiming for an even distribution of centers to ensure central representation. However, enrollment will depend on feasibility and selection progress, with adjustments made to maintain balance. No single center will exceed 50% of the total cases.

### Polyp detection with colonoscopy assisted by the GI genius artificial intelligence endoscopy module compared with standard colonoscopy in routine colonoscopy practice (COLO-DETECT): a multicentre, open-label, parallel-arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^116dVsEJ]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Increased polyp detection during colonoscopy is associated with decreased post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. The COLO-DETECT trial aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of the GI Genius intelligent endoscopy module for polyp detection, comparing colonoscopy assisted by GI Genius (computer-aided detection [CADe]-assisted colonoscopy) with standard colonoscopy in routine practice.

Methods

We did a multicentre, open-label, parallel-arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial in 12 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals (ten NHS Trusts) in England, among adults (aged ≥ 18 years) undergoing planned colonoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms or for surveillance due to personal or family history (ie, symptomatic indications), or colorectal cancer screening. Randomisation (1:1) to CADe-assisted colonoscopy or standard colonoscopy was done with a web-based dynamic adaptive algorithm, immediately before colonoscopy, with stratification by age group, sex, colonoscopy indication (screening or symptomatic), and NHS Trust. Recruiting staff, participants, and colonoscopists were unmasked to trial allocation; histopathologists, co-chief investigators, and trial statisticians were masked. CADe-assisted colonoscopy consisted of standard colonoscopy plus the GI Genius module active for at least the entire inspection phase of colonoscope withdrawal. The primary outcome was mean adenomas per procedure (total number of adenomas detected divided by total number of procedures); the key secondary outcome was adenoma detection rate (proportion of colonoscopies with at least one adenoma). Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT), with outcomes compared between groups by mixed-effects regression modelling, in which effect estimates were adjusted for randomisation stratification variables. Data were imputed for outcome measures with more than 5% missing values. All participants who underwent colonoscopy were assessed for safety. The trial is registered on ISRCTN (ISRCTN10451355) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04723758), and is complete.

Findings

Between March 29, 2021, and April 6, 2023, 2032 participants (1132 [55.7%] male, 900 [44.3%] female; mean age 62.4 years [SD 10.8]) were recruited and randomly assigned: 1015 to CADe-assisted colonoscopy and 1017 to standard colonoscopy. 1231 (60.6%) participants were undergoing screening and 801 (39.4%) had symptomatic indications. Mean adenomas per procedure was 1.56 (SD 2.82; n = 1001 participants with available data) in the CADe-assisted colonoscopy group versus 1.21 (1.91; n = 1009) in the standard colonoscopy group, representing an adjusted mean difference of 0.36 (95% CI 0.14–0.57; adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.30 [95% CI 1.15–1.47], p < 0.0001). Adenomas were detected in 555 (56.6%) of 980 participants in the CADe-assisted colonoscopy group versus 477 (48.4%) of 986 in the standard colonoscopy group, representing a proportion difference of 8.3% (95% CI 3.9–12.7; adjusted odds ratio 1.47 [95% CI 1.21–1.78], p < 0.0001). Numbers of adverse events were similar between the CADe-assisted colonoscopy and standard colonoscopy groups (adverse events: 25 vs 19; serious adverse events: four vs six), and no adverse events in the CADe-assisted colonoscopy group were deemed to be related to GI Genius use on independent review.

Interpretation

Results of the COLO-DETECT trial support the use of GI Genius to increase detection of premalignant colorectal polyps in routine colonoscopy practice.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy and colorectal cancer screening: where are we going? [^113cdrm5]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a significant global health concern, necessitating effective screening strategies to reduce its incidence and mortality rates. Colonoscopy plays a crucial role in the detection and removal of colorectal neoplastic precursors. However, there are limitations and variations in the performance of endoscopists, leading to missed lesions and suboptimal outcomes. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in endoscopy offers promising opportunities to improve the quality and efficacy of screening colonoscopies. In particular, AI applications, including computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided characterization (CADx), have demonstrated the potential to enhance adenoma detection and optical diagnosis accuracy. Additionally, AI-assisted quality control systems aim to standardize the endoscopic examination process. This narrative review provides an overview of AI principles and discusses the current knowledge on AI-assisted endoscopy in the context of screening colonoscopies. It highlights the significant role of AI in improving lesion detection, characterization, and quality assurance during colonoscopy. However, further well-designed studies are needed to validate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted colonoscopy before its widespread implementation.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy improves adenoma detection rates in routine colonoscopy practice: a single-center, retrospective, propensity score-matched study with concurrent controls [^112keDN8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-assisted colonoscopy in a real-world setting. AI-assisted colonoscopy resulted in significantly higher ADRs and APCs compared to standard colonoscopy (ADR, 35.9% vs. 26.4%; APC, 0.69 vs. 0.43). However, the detection rates of advanced adenomas and SSLs did not significantly differ between the two groups.

Multiple RCTs have evaluated the effectiveness of AI-assisted colonoscopy, and a recent meta-analysis of 21 RCTs confirmed that AI-assisted colonoscopy increases the ADR. However, two main issues limit the applicability of these findings in real-world clinical practice. First, the lack of blinding may have introduced a bias favoring the AI group. Although one double-blind RCT using a sham control showed increased ADR, there remains a lack of sufficient blinded studies. Second, these RCTs were conducted under strict conditions that may not reflect real-world factors affecting colonoscopy quality, such as examiner fatigue or time pressure. To address this, non-RCT observational studies have been conducted in real-world clinical practice settings. A meta-analysis by Patel et al. found no significant improvement in polyp detection using AI in real-world settings, while another systematic review reported a small but statistically significant improvement in ADR (36.3% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.04). Considering the inconsistent outcomes of previous non-RCTs, this study provides substantial evidence supporting the role of AI in clinical practice, demonstrating an increase in ADR in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group. Several other studies using AI-assisted colonoscopy support our findings. For instance, a single-center retrospective study showed a significant improvement in ADR with AI assistance compared to conventional methods (47.9% vs. 38.5%, p = 0.03). Similarly, a study from Korea found a significantly higher ADR in the AI-assisted group compared to the standard colonoscopy group (45.1% vs. 38.8%, p = 0.010). An additional finding in our study was that the overall SSLDR increased from 3.0 to 5.5%, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.076), likely due to the limited sample size. However, considering that the SSLDR in studies without CADe systems typically ranges from 2 to 2.5%, our finding is noteworthy. Similar to our results, a recent study using the CADe system reported an increase in the SSLDR from 2.5 to 5.7% (p = 0.001), although another study did not show significant changes, indicating ongoing controversy. Unlike ADR, there are no universally accepted benchmarks for SSLDR, despite SSLs accounting for 15–30% of CRC cases. Due to their flat morphology, SSLs are particularly challenging to detect, highlighting the need for further investigation into the role of AI in improving SSLDR.

### AGA clinical practice update on strategies to improve quality of screening and surveillance colonoscopy: expert review [^1126b9zF]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Best practice advice 8 — Adenoma detection rate (ADR) measurement and feedback — endoscopy units should measure and provide feedback on ADR at both the endoscopist and unit level on a routine basis, at a minimum annually or when endoscopists have accrued 250 screening colonoscopies. ADR varies up to 5-fold among colonoscopists; the standard denominator is all screening colonoscopies performed in patients aged 50–75 years with surveillance and diagnostic colonoscopies excluded, the numerator is colonoscopies with confirmed adenomas with serrated polyps excluded, and units should consider calculating at intervals of at least 250 screening colonoscopies, which in most units translates to semi-annually (if high volume) or annually (if lower volume).

### Real-time automatic detection system increases colonoscopic polyp and adenoma detection rates: a prospective randomised controlled study [^114kt3sc]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Prospective comparative study

The prospective study was designed as a randomised controlled trial to investigate the impact of an automatic polyp detection system acting as an assistant to the endoscopist on PDR and ADR. This study was conducted in the Endoscopy Center of the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, China. Consecutive patients who underwent a colonoscopy from September 2017 to February 2018 were eligible for enrolment (figure 2). Routine bowel preparation consisted of 4 L of polyethylene glycol, given in split doses. Colonoscopies were performed with high definition colonoscopes (Olympus CF-Q260, CF-H260) and high-definition monitors. We excluded patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), CRC, colorectal surgery and patients with a contraindication for biopsy. Patients with prior failed colonoscopy and high suspicion of polyposis syndromes, IBD and typical advanced CRC were also excluded. Basic demographic characteristics including gender, age, indication for colonoscopy, procedure time (morning/afternoon), type of sedation, risk factors of colon polyps including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, body mass index, family history of colon adenoma or cancer, use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, metformin, folic acid, calcium or hormone replacement therapy and alcohol and tobacco use were recorded before colonoscopy. Any complication during the procedure or recovery were also recorded by the staff assistant. Eight physicians from the division of gastroenterology participated in the study, including two senior endoscopists (> 20 000 colonoscopies), two midlevel endoscopists (between 3000 and 10 000 colonoscopies) and four junior endoscopists (between 100 and 500 colonoscopies). Each patient was prospectively randomised into two groups by the staff assistant using a digital random number generator before the colonoscopy procedure. In the control group, a routine colonoscopy was performed. In the research group (computer-aided detection (CADe) group), the real-time automatic polyp detection system was used to assist the endoscopist. The system was connected to the endoscopy generator, and the video stream was captured synchronously. Furthermore, the system processed each frame and displayed the detected polyp location with a hollow blue tracing box on an adjacent monitor with a simultaneous sound alarm (figure 1) (see online supplementary file 1). The system was turned on during withdrawal only. The endoscopist focused mainly on the main monitor during the procedure and was prompted to look at the system monitor by the sound alarm. The endoscopist was required to check every polyp location detected by the system. This was performed without the assistance of nurses, trainees or staff assistants. In both groups, the staff assistant recorded the type of colonoscope used (CF-H260/CF-Q260), the insertion time, withdrawal time and Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) as described by the endoscopist. When a polyp was detected, the nurse assisted in performing cold forceps biopsy for histology and the staff-assistant recorded the location, size and morphological features according to the Paris classification. In the CADe group, missed polyps by the system and system false alarms were also recorded. A missed polyp was defined as a polyp confirmed by the endoscopist but undetected by the system. A false alarm was defined as a detected lesion, which was continuously traced by the system, deemed by the endoscopist not to be a polyp. It was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.

### Evaluation efficacy and accuracy of a real-time computer-aided polyp detection system during colonoscopy: a prospective, multicentric, randomized, parallel-controlled study trial [^111szYD6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

In this prospective trial, we analyze and compare the adenoma detection rate (ADR) and polyp detection rate (PDR) between standard colonoscopy and computer-aided colonoscopy to evaluate the efficacy and monitor the safety of the system during the procedure. The study aims to assess the accuracy and safety of the computer-assisted diagnostic software for detecting intestinal polyps via gastrointestinal endoscopy, building upon previous research involving colonoscopy screening with fecal occult blood tests. Our study employs the polyp per colonoscopy (PPC) as the primary outcome measure, a metric routinely recorded during gastrointestinal polyp endoscopy, thereby enhancing the feasibility of data collection. Preliminary data indicate that software-assisted gastrointestinal polyp endoscopy can significantly increase PPC. This trial is informed by prior exploratory clinical research, providing valuable experience in project design, training, implementation, and statistical analysis, which enhances the probability of success.

Researchers have employed various approaches to investigate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing the detection of adenomas and polyps, which holds significant implications for the prevention of colorectal cancer. The methodology of our study parallels that of a randomized trial, which prospectively assessed the use of a computer-aided detection device across five academic and community centers by gastroenterologists certified by the US board. In both studies, participants were randomly assigned to two groups to evaluate whether AI assistance could improve the detection rates of adenomas and polyps. However, while the previous study assessed safety based on the severity of adverse events and their relationship to the intervention, our study evaluated safety by examining the rates of bleeding and perforation. In addition, we drew insights from a prior trial that explored AI-assisted adenoma detection.

While the results align with the hypothesis, the study has several flaws, notably the lack of a double-blind design. This trial examines PPC differences between experimental and control groups, primarily influenced by the number of polyps and endoscopists' detection abilities. Extremely low or high polyp numbers or a very low missed diagnosis rate could lead to negative outcomes. However, the study's population, individuals consecutively needing endoscopy, should have a moderate polyp count. In addition, previous research indicates even experienced physicians have some missed diagnoses, reducing the likelihood of trial failure.

### Adenoma detection rate and colorectal cancer prevention by colonoscopy… [^114j6q2L]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Colonoscopy has played a pivotal role in the declining US incidence of colorectal cancer in persons older than 50 years observed over the past 2 decades. 1 However, outside the gastroenterology community, physicians may not understand that colonoscopy performance is highly operator dependent. On a per-lesion basis, colonoscopists with the worst performance miss more than 90% of precancerous colorectal lesions. 2 A report in this issue of JAMA suggests that on a per-patient basis, colonoscopists with the worst performance, in terms of their adenoma detection rate, diagnose more than half of patients who harbor precancerous colorectal lesions as normal.

### Evaluation efficacy and accuracy of a real-time computer-aided polyp detection system during colonoscopy: a prospective, multicentric, randomized, parallel-controlled study trial [^111up2or]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary endpoint analyzed was the sensitivity and specificity of polyp recognition between the test and control groups. Secondary endpoints included the average number of polyps per colonoscopy (PPC), adenomas per colonoscopy (APC), adenoma detection rate (ADR), and polyp detection rate (PDR), compared between the experimental and control groups. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of polyp recognition were evaluated as secondary endpoints in both the software-aided group and the control group, in comparison to the gold standard.

We evaluated polyp detection sensitivity in both experimental and control groups using the gold standard. We recorded lesion locations, total polyp count, and size, aligning these to assess consistency between groups and the gold standard. A positive result was when both groups and the gold standard identified a polyp at a lesion. Sensitivity was the ratio of true positives to total positives. A negative result meant no polyps per the gold standard, with true negatives when all agreed on non-polyps. Specificity was the ratio of true negatives to total negatives. PPC indicated the average polyps per patient during colonoscopies. APC was the number of colonoscopies confirming adenomas via histopathology. ADR was APC divided by total colonoscopies. PDR measures the rate of colonoscopies that detect at least one polyp, excluding post-polypectomy monitoring, relative to the total number of colonoscopies, to evaluate efficacy. We compare these metrics between a control group and software diagnosis. A positive result matches the gold standard at the lesion level, with TP when both the control/software and gold standard identify a polyp. Sensitivity is calculated as TP divided by positives. A negative result means no polyps, with TN when both the control/software and gold standard agree. Specificity is TN divided by negatives. We also evaluate software safety by comparing bleeding and perforation rates between experimental and control groups.

### The single-monitor trial: an embedded CADe system increased adenoma detection during colonoscopy: a prospective randomized study [^113awMdm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background:

Computer-aided detection (CADe) of colon polyps has been demonstrated to improve colon polyp and adenoma detection during colonoscopy by indicating the location of a given polyp on a parallel monitor. The aim of this study was to investigate whether embedding the CADe system into the primary colonoscopy monitor may serve to increase polyp and adenoma detection, without increasing physician fatigue level.

Methods:

Consecutive patients presenting for colonoscopies were prospectively randomized to undergo routine colonoscopy with or without the assistance of a real-time polyp detection CADe system. Fatigue level was evaluated from score 0 to 10 by the performing endoscopists after each colonoscopy procedure. The main outcome was adenoma detection rate (ADR).

Results:

Out of 790 patients analyzed, 397 were randomized to routine colonoscopy (control group), and 393 to a colonoscopy with computer-aided diagnosis (CADe group). The ADRs were 20.91% and 29.01%, respectively (OR = 1.546, 95% CI 1.116–2.141, p = 0.009). The average number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) was 0.29 and 0.48, respectively (Change Folds = 1.64, 95% CI 1.299–2.063, p < 0.001). The improvement in polyp detection was mainly due to increased detection of non-advanced diminutive adenomas, serrated adenoma and hyperplastic polyps. The fatigue score for each procedure was 3.28 versus 3.40 for routine and CADe group, p = 0.357.

Conclusions:

A real-time CADe system employed on the primary endoscopy monitor may lead to improvements in ADR and polyp detection rate without increasing fatigue level during colonoscopy. The integration of a low-latency and high-performance CADe systems may serve as an effective quality assurance tool during colonoscopy.number, ChiCTR1800018058.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy improves adenoma detection rates in routine colonoscopy practice: a single-center, retrospective, propensity score-matched study with concurrent controls [^117AHhBq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Aims

This study aimed to investigate whether a real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted polyp detection system can improve adenoma detection rates (ADRs) in real-world colonoscopy practice.

Methods

This single-center, retrospective, propensity score-matched study collected data from consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy — either AI-assisted or standard colonoscopy — between March 2023 and February 2024. Propensity score matching was conducted to adjust for baseline characteristics across the groups.

Results

During the study period, 1,085 patients who underwent colonoscopy were eligible for inclusion. After propensity score matching, 474 patients who underwent AI-assisted colonoscopy and 474 who underwent standard colonoscopy were included in the primary analysis. The ADR was significantly higher in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group than in the standard colonoscopy group (35.9% vs. 26.4%; p = 0.002). Additionally, the number of adenomas detected per colonoscopy was significantly higher in the AI-assisted group than in the standard group (0.69 ± 1.22 vs. 0.43 ± 0.91; p < 0.001). However, the detection rates of advanced adenomas and sessile serrated lesions did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusion

AI-assisted colonoscopy significantly improves ADRs in real-world colonoscopy practice.

### Evaluation efficacy and accuracy of a real-time computer-aided polyp detection system during colonoscopy: a prospective, multicentric, randomized, parallel-controlled study trial [^116gKQAD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The study revealed that the integration of a real-time computer-aided polyp detection system during colonoscopy substantially improves efficacy by increasing adenoma and polyp detection rates, as well as enhancing accuracy in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Recent research has further established that artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy (AIC) serves as a safe and efficient screening tool, improving the detection rates of colorectal cancer adenomas and polyps in adults and facilitating early diagnosis of colorectal cancer when compared to conventional colonoscopy.

Colorectal cancer screening methods are effective but have limitations, and many eligible individuals are unscreened. This paper reviews current and new screening techniques and suggests ways to overcome these limitations. While new strategies could revolutionize prevention, significant improvements can be made by optimizing current colonoscopy methods. Colonoscopy diagnostics have a rich history.

Over the past decades, alternative methods such as CT colonography, colon capsule endoscopy, and AI-assisted detection have been explored to address the limitations of traditional gastrointestinal endoscopy. While auxiliary inspection techniques can enhance detection rates, the sensitivity of white light colonoscopy often fails to identify invasive flat or depressed lesions, which may progress to larger, advanced tumors. Fluorescence molecular imaging addresses this shortcoming by significantly improving the detection rate of precancerous lesions. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that AI-assisted colonoscopy enhanced overall ADR, advanced ADR, and ADR among both expert and non-expert endoscopists. In addition, the implementation of a novel AI detection system resulted in a significantly higher number of adenomas detected per colonoscopy compared to conventional high-definition colonoscopy, without extending the colonoscopy withdrawal time. This finding supports the use of AI-assisted colonoscopy to enhance the quality of colonoscopy in a large, prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.

### No effect of computer-aided diagnosis on colonoscopic adenoma detection in a large pragmatic multicenter randomized study [^1164ygWz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple randomized studies have demonstrated that computer-assisted detection (CADe) improves the colonoscopic adenoma detection rate (ADR); however, these improvements have not been consistently reproduced in some more recent studies.

Methods

Patients aged 50 years and older undergoing outpatient colonoscopy in 12 German institutions were randomized to either the CADe group or the control group. The primary outcome parameter was the ADR, while secondary outcomes included the adenomas per colonoscopy rate, detection rates of different histologic subgroups, and adverse events. The median examiner-specific observed rates and examiner-adjusted rates were compared between treatment groups.

Results

One thousand six hundred twenty-seven patients were included (mean age 63.1 years, 39.8% female; 71% screening indications). The observed median examiner ADR was 40.0% (interquartile range 20.0%-57.1%) in the study vs 37.5% (inter-quartile range 20.0%-50.0%) in the control group. Similarly, adjusted overall ADR was 40.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35.8%, 45.5%) in the study and 38.3% (95% CI: 33.5%, 43.1%) in the control group. No differences were observed in adenomas per colonoscopy or any of the adenoma subgroups with regard to size, morphology, location, and histology as well as colonoscopy indication. The examiner had a large influence on ADR (adjusted median odds ratio [OR] 1.32), similar to patient age (OR per 10-year increase 1.40, 95% CI: 1.23–1.59) and sex (OR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.30–2.04). On the other hand, more hyperplastic polyps were found by CADe (OR for adjusted hyperplastic polyp detection rate = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.02–1.63; P = 0.033).

Discussion

In patients older than 50 years with mixed colonoscopy indications, CADe did not increase the ADR. Further studies should define the requirements for selective CADe use in routine clinical practice, particularly in relation to the examiner's baseline ADR.

### Real-time automatic detection system increases colonoscopic polyp and adenoma detection rates: a prospective randomised controlled study [^11274gVJ]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Third, though false-positives rates were low, some false positives were unexpected by the designers of the system and occurred due to detection of medication capsules, of local sites of bleeding or of undigested debris, causing potential distraction during the procedure. This might be corrected by adding sufficient training data to the current system.

Fourth, this study did not control the fatigue level of participating endoscopists, which could be an independent factor that affects ADR. Future studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of this CADe system on different fatigue levels.

Fifth, because of the inadequate sample size of colonoscopies performed by junior endoscopists, further studies are needed to show the role and effectiveness of this CADe system in different levels of training.

Lastly, the study was conducted using Olympus colonoscopy equipment. Thus, the adaptability of the system on equipment manufactured by other companies should also be explored.

In conclusion, this study shows that a real-time CADe system based on deep learning led to significant increases in both colorectal polyp and adenoma detection rates in a low prevalent ADR region. Given its high accuracy, fidelity and stability, the current CADe system is potentially applicable in current clinical practice for better detection of colon polyps.

### Increased adenoma detection rate with system-wide implementation of a split-dose preparation for colonoscopy [^113d1mpH]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies using split-dose preparations (SDPs) suggest a significant improvement in the quality of preparation and patient compliance. However, the effects of SDP on other quality indicators of colonoscopy, such as cecal intubation and adenoma detection rates, have not been previously reported, to our knowledge.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to compare polyp detection rates (PDRs) and adenoma detection rates (ADRs) before and after the implementation of an SDP as the preferred bowel preparation. The secondary objectives were to compare the quality of the preparation and colonoscopy completion rates before and after implementation of the SDP.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Tertiary care medical center.

Patients

Patients undergoing colonoscopy for screening and surveillance of colon polyps and cancer.

Interventions

System-wide implementation of SDP.

Results

A total of 3560 patients in the pre-SDP group and 1615 patients in the post-SDP group were included in the study. SDP use increased significantly from 9% to 74% after implementation. In comparison with the pre-SDP group, both PDRs (44.1%-49.5%; P < .001) and ADRs (26.7%-31.8%; P < .001) significantly improved in the post-SDP group. The colonoscopy completion rate significantly increased from 93.6% to 95.5% in the post-SDP group (P = 0.008). Bowel preparation quality also improved significantly (P < .001) in the post-SDP group.

Limitations

Retrospective design; not all endoscopists were the same in both periods.

Conclusions

System-wide implementation of an SDP as the primary choice for colonoscopy significantly improved both PDRs and ADRs, overall quality of the preparation, and colonoscopy completion rates.

PMR, PDR, and PPC

An AI-aided colonoscopy showed a 52.5% decrease (19% risk difference) in the PMR (RR, 0.475; 95% CI, 0.294–0.768; Figure S1), a 23.8% increase (9.9% risk difference) in the PDR (RR, 1.238; 95% CI, 1.158–1.323; Figure S2), a 38.8% increase (37.1% rate difference) in PPC rate (IRR, 1.388; 95% CI, 1.270–1.517; Figure S3), and 0.271 more number of PPC (95% CI, 0.144–0.398; Figure S4) compared to standard colonoscopy (Table 2).

Substantial heterogeneity was observed for most polyp-related outcomes. The 95% prediction intervals crossed the no-effect line for PMR (0.135–1.679), PDR (0.922–1.662) and PPC rate (0.892–2.160), indicating the potential for negative intervention effects in future studies. Additionally, potential publication bias was identified for PDR (Figure S5). However, correcting for the possibility of publication bias would not change the conclusion.

Materials and methods

Study design

This study was conducted from January to December 2022 at Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital in Chiayi, Taiwan. In January 2022, we implemented a Business Intelligence system (Power BI, Microsoft) to monitor colonoscopy quality. Power BI was used to identify adenomas in pathology reports and calculate the adenoma detection rate. This system automatically generates a visual interface to assess metrics like polyp detection rate, adenoma detection rate, bowel preparation quality, and withdrawal time from colonoscopic reports. Real-time data were displayed on screens in the endoscopy room, allowing endoscopists to view and compare performance metrics with their peers (Fig. 1). Throughout 2022, Power BI was consistently employed to display colonoscopy quality data on screens within the endoscopy room. The Power BI visual report is available online upon individual login.

To evaluate the effectiveness of Power BI, data from 2021 served as the control group. The intervention data collected in 2022 were gathered prospectively following the implementation of Power BI, whereas the comparative control group data from 2021 were historical and collected retrospectively from electronic health records. A comparative analysis was performed, comparing the data from 2022 (With Power BI group) with the data from 2021 (Without Power BI group). This study encompassed outpatient elective colonoscopy procedures utilizing standard bowel preparation. Exclusions included patients younger than 40 years old, inpatient or emergency colonoscopy procedures, procedures conducted without standard bowel preparation, and those performed by physicians who had not signed the consent form (Fig. 2).

This study adhered to the ethical principles of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital (approval number B11101008). Ten out of 13 board-certified colonoscopists at our hospital agreed to participate in performance monitoring, with informed consent obtained. Five senior endoscopists have extensive expertise, having performed 5,000 to 6,000 colonoscopy procedures over 20 to 25 years of practice. In contrast, the other five novice endoscopists have completed around 1,000 to 2,000 procedures, with 10 to 15 years of experience.

### A prospective comparison of two computer aided detection systems with different false positive rates in colonoscopy [^114y6DTy]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer globally and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The endoscopic detection and resection of precancerous polyp including adenomas are vital for reducing CRC risk, making colonoscopy the gold standard for both diagnosing and preventing CRC. Despite its efficacy, 24–27% of adenomas may be missed during the procedure, significantly contributing to the occurrence of interval CRC. Although advancements in colonoscopy techniques, such as improved bowel preparation, enhanced imaging, and additional endoscopic devices, have been made, there remains considerable variability in adenoma detection rates (ADR) among endoscopists. Given the technical and cognitive limitations associated with standard colonoscopy, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into colonoscopy procedures holds great promise.

Computer-aided detection (CADe) have been shown to increase the ADR and reduce the adenoma miss rate in many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) –. A meta-analysis, encompassing 33 RCTs, revealed that CADe-assisted colonoscopy enhances the relative ADR by 24% and the mean adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) by 39% when compared to standard colonoscopy. However, recent studies examining the practical application of CADe systems in clinical practice have raised concerns about the discrepancy between the expected benefits of CADe demonstrated in previous RCTs and the actual outcomes observed in real-world settings. Those real-world studies have not shown an improved ADR in CADe-assisted colonoscopy compared to the standard colonoscopy. This observation raises a question for the expectation that endoscopist-CADe collaboration invariably leads to better performance.

Several factors can contribute to the variability in the effectiveness of CADe-assisted colonoscopy, including differences in study design, patient population, the proportion of subtle lesions such as ultra-flat lesions, and the specific CADe device used. Among these multifactorial causes, the frequent occurrence of false positives (FPs) from CADe systems may significantly impact the collaboration between endoscopists and CADe. In a study investigating the performance and attitudes of physicians after using real-time CADe in clinical practice, most physicians expressed concerns regarding the number of FPs, a high level of distraction, and prolonged withdrawal time. An excess number of FPs may reduce the motivation to use CADe, potentially lead to unnecessary polypectomies, and ultimately hinder the widespread implementation of CADe in practice. Currently, addressing FPs is ranked third in importance among future research questions related to CADe.

### Use of a novel artificial intelligence system leads to the detection of significantly higher number of adenomas during screening and surveillance colonoscopy: results from a large, prospective, US multicenter, randomized clinical trial [^1117X8FM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adenoma per colonoscopy (APC) has recently been proposed as a quality measure for colonoscopy. We evaluated the impact of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system, compared with standard high-definition colonoscopy, for APC measurement.

Methods

This was a US-based, multicenter, prospective randomized trial examining a novel AI detection system (EW10-EC02) that enables a real-time colorectal polyp detection enabled with the colonoscope (CAD-EYE). Eligible average-risk subjects (45 years or older) undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy were randomized to undergo either CAD-EYE-assisted colonoscopy (CAC) or conventional colonoscopy (CC). Modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed for all patients who completed colonoscopy with the primary outcome of APC. Secondary outcomes included positive predictive value (total number of adenomas divided by total polyps removed) and adenoma detection rate.

Results

In modified intention-to-treat analysis, of 1,031 subjects (age: 59.1 ± 9.8 years; 49.9% male), 510 underwent CAC vs 523 underwent CC with no significant differences in age, gender, ethnicity, or colonoscopy indication between the 2 groups. CAC led to a significantly higher APC compared with CC: 0.99 ± 1.6 vs 0.85 ± 1.5, P = 0.02, incidence rate ratio 1.17 (1.03–1.33, P = 0.02) with no significant difference in the withdrawal time: 11.28 ± 4.59 minutes vs 10.8 ± 4.81 minutes; P = 0.11 between the 2 groups. Difference in positive predictive value of a polyp being an adenoma among CAC and CC was less than 10% threshold established: 48.6% vs 54%, 95% CI -9.56% to -1.48%. There were no significant differences in adenoma detection rate (46.9% vs 42.8%), advanced adenoma (6.5% vs 6.3%), sessile serrated lesion detection rate (12.9% vs 10.1%), and polyp detection rate (63.9% vs 59.3%) between the 2 groups. There was a higher polyp per colonoscopy with CAC compared with CC: 1.68 ± 2.1 vs 1.33 ± 1.8 (incidence rate ratio 1.27; 1.15–1.4; P < 0.01).

Discussion

Use of a novel AI detection system showed to a significantly higher number of adenomas per colonoscopy compared with conventional high-definition colonoscopy without any increase in colonoscopy withdrawal time, thus supporting the use of AI-assisted colonoscopy to improve colonoscopy quality (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04979962).

### Real-time computer-aided detection of colorectal neoplasia during colonoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zk9Yz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Artificial intelligence computer-aided detection (CADe) of colorectal neoplasia during colonoscopy may increase adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and reduce adenoma miss rates, but it may increase overdiagnosis and overtreatment of nonneoplastic polyps.

Purpose

To quantify the benefits and harms of CADe in randomized trials.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis. (PROSPERO: CRD42022293181).

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases through February 2023.

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing CADe-assisted with standard colonoscopy for polyp and cancer detection.

Data Extraction

Adenoma detection rate (proportion of patients with ≥ 1 adenoma), number of adenomas detected per colonoscopy, advanced adenoma (≥ 10 mm with high-grade dysplasia and villous histology), number of serrated lesions per colonoscopy, and adenoma miss rate were extracted as benefit outcomes. Number of polypectomies for nonneoplastic lesions and withdrawal time were extracted as harm outcomes. For each outcome, studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-one randomized trials on 18232 patients were included. The ADR was higher in the CADe group than in the standard colonoscopy group (44.0% vs. 35.9%; relative risk, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.33]; low-certainty evidence), corresponding to a 55% (risk ratio, 0.45 [CI, 0.35 to 0.58]) relative reduction in miss rate (moderate-certainty evidence). More nonneoplastic polyps were removed in the CADe than the standard group (0.52 vs. 0.34 per colonoscopy; mean difference [MD], 0.18 polypectomy [CI, 0.11 to 0.26 polypectomy]; low-certainty evidence). Mean inspection time increased only marginally with CADe (MD, 0.47 minute [CI, 0.23 to 0.72 minute]; moderate-certainty evidence).

Limitations

This review focused on surrogates of patient-important outcomes. Most patients, however, may consider cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality important outcomes. The effect of CADe on such patient-important outcomes remains unclear.

Conclusion

The use of CADe for polyp detection during colonoscopy results in increased detection of adenomas but not advanced adenomas and in higher rates of unnecessary removal of nonneoplastic polyps.

### The single-monitor trial: an embedded CADe system increased adenoma detection during colonoscopy: a prospective randomized study [^111dnuJV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Computer-aided detection (CADe) of colon polyps has been demonstrated to improve colon polyp and adenoma detection during colonoscopy by indicating the location of a given polyp on a parallel monitor. The aim of this study was to investigate whether embedding the CADe system into the primary colonoscopy monitor may serve to increase polyp and adenoma detection, without increasing physician fatigue level.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting for colonoscopies were prospectively randomized to undergo routine colonoscopy with or without the assistance of a real-time polyp detection CADe system. Fatigue level was evaluated from score 0 to 10 by the performing endoscopists after each colonoscopy procedure. The main outcome was adenoma detection rate (ADR).

Results

Out of 790 patients analyzed, 397 were randomized to routine colonoscopy (control group), and 393 to a colonoscopy with computer-aided diagnosis (CADe group). The ADRs were 20.91% and 29.01%, respectively (OR = 1.546, 95% CI 1.116–2.141, p = 0.009). The average number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) was 0.29 and 0.48, respectively (Change Folds = 1.64, 95% CI 1.299–2.063, p < 0.001). The improvement in polyp detection was mainly due to increased detection of non-advanced diminutive adenomas, serrated adenoma and hyperplastic polyps. The fatigue score for each procedure was 3.28 versus 3.40 for routine and CADe group, p = 0.357.

Conclusions

A real-time CADe system employed on the primary endoscopy monitor may lead to improvements in ADR and polyp detection rate without increasing fatigue level during colonoscopy. The integration of a low-latency and high-performance CADe systems may serve as an effective quality assurance tool during colonoscopy. www.chictr.org.cn number, ChiCTR1800018058.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy improves adenoma detection rates in routine colonoscopy practice: a single-center, retrospective, propensity score-matched study with concurrent controls [^113PYTik]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, other studies have reported that AI-assisted colonoscopy does not significantly improve ADR in real-world settings. Although our study showed a positive effect of AI-assisted colonoscopy on ADR, this result may have been influenced by the fact that the endoscopists were aware that their colonoscopy performance was being monitored, potentially leading to changes in their behavior. Moreover, more than two-thirds of the detected lesions were < 5 mm in size. Therefore, the increased ADR associated with AI-assisted colonoscopy may result from the increased detection of diminutive adenomas. Considering that a long-term prospective study showed that most diminutive polyps exhibit slow growth and typically follow a benign course, this raises questions regarding their clinical relevance. This finding emphasizes the need for a long-term follow-up study to clarify the effect of AI-assisted colonoscopy on the prevention of CRC. Moreover, there was no significant difference in advanced adenoma detection between the AI-assisted colonoscopy and standard colonoscopy groups, likely because these lesions are easier to detect without AI assistance. Another limitation of CADe is the frequent occurrence of false positives due to mucosal folds or residuals, which can lead to unnecessary resections, longer procedure times, and increased costs.

### Comparison of adenoma detection rate between three-dimensional and standard colonoscopy: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^111VmW2K]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Our exploratory analysis confirmed that 3D colonoscopy has a short learning curve and consistently confers an improvement in ADR even during the learning phase. The findings suggested a learning curve of between 10 and 20 procedures for 3D colonoscopy, with interendoscopist variation. Taken together, the consistent benefit in ADR and short learning curve suggest that 3D colonoscopy could be easily adopted by endoscopists in routine colonoscopy practice.

A recent crossover RCT including patients younger than 40 years compared 2D then 3D vs. 3D then 2D colonoscopy (i.e. tandem colonoscopy) and showed that ADR in the first examination was comparable between 3D and 2D colonoscopy (24.7% vs. 23.8%), whereas in the second examination ADR was significantly higher with 3D compared with 2D (13.8% vs. 9.9%). However, the tandem colonoscopy design could introduce bias, because the diagnostic performance of the second examination is influenced by the findings of the first one. In contrast, the parallel design of the current study minimized bias, better reflected clinical reality, and used ADR, the surrogate for PCCRC, as the primary outcome. Notably, the ADR of the first colonoscopy in the previous study did not differ between 2D and 3D and seemed lower than that in the current study, probably due to the shorter withdrawal time (< 6 minutes) and the inclusion of younger patients (aged 18–40 years) in that study. In contrast, the current study enrolled individuals aged over 40 years, and thus the results should be more generalizable to the examinees of clinical colonoscopy practice, and the ability to further improve ADR where colonoscopy quality assurance measures were rigorously implemented highlighted the benefit of 3D colonoscopy in enhancing adenoma detection. The use of different 3D endoscopy systems could have also contributed to the differences between the two studies, as the vividness of 3D visualization might differ between systems, depending on the image reprocessing algorithms employed.

### Case-mix-adjusted mean number of polyps per 100 procedures: a new candidate gold standard colonoscopy key performance indicator [^114nLPo1]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed in half a million people each year in Europe and is the fourth most common cancer in the UK. These cancers arise from polyps, and polyp detection and resection at colonoscopy is pivotal in their prevention. Detection key performance indicators (KPIs) are important: colonoscopists with low polyp detection rates have higher postcolonoscopy CRC (PCCRC) incidence and mortality rates.

The current standard detection indicator in colonoscopy is adenoma detection rate (ADR), defined as the proportion of colonoscopies where at least one adenoma is detected. ADR has three main criticisms. First, it takes no account of serrated polyps, which account for up to 30% of CRCs. Serrated polyps usually occur in the proximal colon and are easier to miss as they are often subtle, blending into the background mucosa. Second, as a binary measure at the procedure level, ADR and polyp detection rate (PDR) risk creating a 'one-and-done' phenomenon through not incentivising the detection of polyps beyond the first, hence deviating from cancer biology where every adenoma increases the risk of CRC incidence and mortality. Third, ADR and sessile detection measures are dependent on histological data. This is a substantial logistical disadvantage in quality assurance: in the UK, endoscopy reporting systems (ERSs) and histology reports are not linked, therefore endoscopy leaders must make considerable effort to combine datasets to generate an ADR for their centre and endoscopists.

UK reporting systems now send non-identifiable endoscopy data to the National Endoscopy Database (NED), a novel registry that captures patient-level data automatically, allowing real-time analysis and presentation of polyp detection KPIs. This allows individual endoscopists and endoscopy unit leads to access and review their data easily.

A detection KPI that overcomes these criticisms would be advantageous. Randomised control trials in lower GI endoscopy have recommended using outcome measures considering the total number of adenomas, as reducing total numbers of adenomas is clinically meaningful in tackling the long-term CRC risk of an individual. These metrics align to the principle that the second and third polyps are as valuable as the first. Recent Polish screening data demonstrated ADR, PDR and adenomas per colonoscopy had comparable inverse associations with PCCRC. Top performance quintiles of PDR and adenomas per colonoscopy had the lowest HR for PCCRC, suggesting the potential role of a mean polyp KPI.

### Impact of AI-aided colonoscopy in clinical practice: a prospective randomised controlled trial [^1123Fyd3]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Efficacious colonoscopy coupled with adenoma removal has demonstrated a reduction in CRC incidence and mortality. The adenoma detection rate (ADR) and the detection of sessile serrated lesions (SSL) exhibits a direct correlation with reducing postcolonoscopy CRC occurrences. However, the suboptimal quality of numerous colonoscopies has led to the oversight of a substantial number of polyps, underscoring the significance of enhanced visualisation.

The introduction of key performance indicators, innovative imaging methodologies and novel endoscopic technologies has been pursued in recent years to improve ADR. Moreover, the improvements in machine learning and deep learning have facilitated the development of numerous artificial intelligence (AI) softwares, aimed at further refining polyp detection, as concisely summarised by Hoerter et al. Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems, using AI algorithms, have been validated for their efficacy in polyp detection during colonoscopy. These CADe systems are now commercially accessible and have seamlessly integrated into routine endoscopy procedures across multiple centres.

However, the impact of AI on polyp detection in real-world scenarios is yet to be fully established. Some studies show an augmentation in polyp and ADRs during colonoscopy, particularly for smaller polyps, when CADe is used as opposed to conventional colonoscopy (CC) techniques. Nevertheless, a recent real-world investigation demonstrated a notable decrease in ADR and polyp detection rate (PDRs) following the implementation of an AI system. Remarkably, the Danish Health Technology Council has recently released a directive cautioning against the adoption of AI in Colonoscopy, attributing potential complications and overtreatment arising from the polypectomy of minute polyps.

The current data available is limited regarding the influence of CADe on colonoscopy performance based on the endoscopist's expertise. The future role of AI in routine colonoscopy remains somewhat uncertain. Notably, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has recently disseminated a position statement delineating the anticipated value of AI in endoscopy, stipulating that AI should be used to elevate the ADR of less experienced endoscopists to the calibre of their proficient counterparts.

This study seeks to investigate the potential improvement of ADR and PDR through the implementation of two distinct AI systems, namely GI Genius by Medtronic and Fujifilm CADEYE. This study was conducted in a real-world clinical setting at two hospitals in Sweden.

Lesion detection outcomes

Table 2 summarizes the outcomes of lesion detection by the colonoscopy group. The overall ADR was significantly higher in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group than in the standard colonoscopy group (35.9% vs. 26.4%; p = 0.002). The number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) was 0.69 ± 1.22 in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group and 0.43 ± 0.91 in the standard colonoscopy group, showing a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). In addition, polyp detection rates (PDRs) and the number of polyps per colonoscopy were significantly higher in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group compared to the standard colonoscopy group (PDR: 53.2% vs. 46.2%, respectively, p = 0.038; the number of polyps per colonoscopy: 1.23 ± 1.65 vs. 0.93 ± 1.39, respectively, p = 0.002). However, the detection rates and numbers of advanced adenomas, SSLs, and non-neoplastic lesions did not differ significantly between the two groups.

### An accurate and automated method for adenoma detection rate and report card generation utilizing common electronic health records [^112CbmKT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy is a validated screening tool for colorectal cancer (CRC). It is particularly useful for CRC prevention, as it can detect precancerous polyps, and allow for removal without the need for surgical intervention. The effectiveness of a colonoscopy surveillance program for CRC prevention is often measured by its impact on interval CRC and mortality. Interval CRC is the incidence of new CRCs that develop before subsequent CRC screening occurs. Several factors have been shown to influence the effectiveness of a colonoscopy screening program. Among these the adenoma detection rate (ADR), defined as the proportion of screening colonoscopies in which adenomas are detected, has been identified as most critical. Although ADR varies widely among endoscopists, it is inversely associated with both interval CRC incidence and CRC-related mortality. Consequently, ADR has emerged as the most widely accepted quality measure for screening colonoscopy, and regular measurement and feedback of ADR is recommended by national society expert review. Previous studies suggest that even a modest improvement in ADR is associated with significant decreases in interval colon cancer and death from colorectal cancer. There is a 3% decrease in the risk of interval colon cancer with each 1% increase in ADR. Consequently, ADR is used by many health organizations and payers to assess endoscopist quality. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) includes the regular calculation of ADR in its list of "best practices" for screening colonoscopy quality. ADR report cards have been shown to improve endoscopist ADR. – However, calculation of ADR and generation of ADR report cards is often done manually, which is cumbersome and labor intensive. In addition, many institutions use multiple and independent electronic health records (EHRs) that hold the various data required for ADR calculation (endoscopy reporting systems, pathology reporting systems, and an overarching electronic health record). Previous studies have suggested the potential for natural language processing (NLP) to assist in colonoscopy quality. – However, these studies have either not addressed ADR directly, have shown variable accuracy, or have used less common EHRs. We hypothesized that ADR calculation could be automated within a multiple hospital network by using NLP to link colonoscopy and pathology reports, seamlessly extracted from the EHR. As a first step, we sought to test the accuracy and efficiency of the automated ADR calculation algorithm with respect to generation of ADR report cards at a single academic center, which uses EHR reporting platforms common to those of other hospitals in the network.

### A novel colonoscopy reporting system enabling quality assurance [^1115nPrc]. Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

The quality of colonoscopy can only be measured if colonoscopy reports include all key quality indicators. In daily practice, reporting is often incomplete and not standardized. This study describes a novel, structured colonoscopy reporting system, which aims to generate standardized and complete reports and to facilitate the automatic analysis of colonoscopy quality indicators.

Methods

A new colonoscopy reporting system (EndoALPHA) was developed. The system reports all colonoscopy quality indicators, as well as pathological findings, in a systematic manner using structured terminology. All essential items carry specific codes, which enables statistical analysis and the automatic generation of reports of all quality indicators. The EndoALPHA reporting system was tested with regard to completeness of reporting and evaluation of quality indicators both for individual endoscopists and the endoscopy unit.

Results

In 2012, all 810 colonoscopies performed at one colonoscopy center were documented using EndoALPHA. Overall, 94% of performed colonoscopies were reported completely using the encoded terminology. Individual unadjusted cecal intubation rates were above 90% for all endoscopists (mean 96.7%), and the adenoma detection rate was above 20% for all endoscopists (35.4% for the unit).

Conclusion

The novel EndoALPHA reporting system enables automatic quality assessment on two levels: the completeness of reporting can be evaluated, and if this is adequate, the quality of the colonoscopies can also be assessed. Integrated with feedback, benchmarking and training, the reporting system may facilitate quality improvement for colonoscopy services.

### Effect of AI-assisted diagnosis on adenomas of different sizes: a meta-analysis with evidence from RCTs and trial sequential analysis [^111swEyy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study also found that, among lesions measuring ≤ 5 mm, the AMR in the AI-assisted group was significantly lower than in the conventional group. AI-assisted technologies effectively reduced the AMR for small adenomas by optimizing image recognition and enabling real-time intervention, demonstrating particularly strong performance in anatomically complex regions such as the rectum and cecum. Since the detection of small adenomas often depends on the operator's experience, the integration of AI holds promise for improving diagnostic consistency and standardization, especially in primary care hospitals, among less experienced physicians, or during large-scale screening programs. Therefore, AI-assisted technologies can serve as important tools for endoscopy quality control and may be incorporated into future clinical practice guidelines. However, their long-term clinical benefits still require further validation — particularly whether they can sustainably reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer remains uncertain due to a lack of prospective studies. It should also be recognized that not all diminutive adenomas carry clinical significance. A considerable proportion of ≤ 5 mm lesions are non-neoplastic with low risk of progression. Consequently, while AI can enhance ADR, it may also lead to an increase in the number of pathological examinations and polypectomies, thereby escalating resource consumption and raising concerns of over-intervention. Against this backdrop, there is an urgent need to systematically evaluate variations in AI system performance and their economic feasibility. Existing research suggests that the widespread adoption of AI involves additional costs, including equipment acquisition, maintenance, extended procedure time, and training, which may increase the average cost of colonoscopy. This issue is particularly critical for resource-limited medical institutions and healthcare systems. Future research should therefore integrate economic modeling with multicenter practical data, focusing on the precise identification of diminutive lesions with clinical progression potential. A systematic evaluation of AI's cost-effectiveness and policy applicability is also needed to provide evidence-based guidance for its rational implementation in clinical and healthcare systems. For adenomas 6–9 mm and ≥ 10 mm, there was no statistically significant difference in AMR between the AI-assisted and conventional groups. A possible explanation is that larger adenomas are relatively easier to detect with conventional endoscopy, reducing the additional advantage of AI in minimizing AMR. However, the AMR analysis for lesions by size was limited by the inclusion of only three studies per subgroup, which may compromise the stability and reliability of the results. Moreover, substantial heterogeneity across studies further weakens the clinical interpretability and external validity of the findings. In addition, a significant publication bias observed in the ADR data for lesions measuring 6–9 mm may have led to an overestimation of the AI-assisted detection effect due to the preferential reporting of positive outcomes.

### Effect of an artificial intelligence-based quality improvement system on efficacy of a computer-aided detection system in colonoscopy: a four-group parallel study [^113rNNhD]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tandem colonoscopy studies have found that about one in five adenomas are missed at colonoscopy. It remains debatable whether the combination of a computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) system with a computer-aided quality improvement (CAQ) system for real-time monitoring of withdrawal speed results in additional benefits in adenoma detection or if the synergetic effect may be harmed due to excessive visual burden resulting from information overload. This study aimed to evaluate the interaction effect on improving the adenoma detection rate (ADR).

Methods

This single-center, randomized, four-group, parallel, controlled study was performed at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Between 1 July and 15 October 2020, 1076 patients were randomly allocated into four treatment groups: control 271, CADe 268, CAQ 269, and CADe plus CAQ (COMBO) 268. The primary outcome was ADR.

The ADR in the control, CADe, CAQ, and COMBO groups was 14.76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.54 to 18.98), 21.27% (95%CI 16.37 to 26.17), 24.54% (95%CI 19.39 to 29.68), and 30.60% (95%CI 25.08 to 36.11), respectively. The ADR was higher in the COMBO group compared with the CADe group (21.27% vs. 30.6%, P = 0.024, odds ratio [OR] 1.284, 95%CI 1.033 to 1.596) but not compared with the CAQ group (24.54% vs. 30.6%, P = 0.213, OR 1.309, 95%CI 0.857 to 2.000, respectively).

Conclusions

CAQ significantly improved the efficacy of CADe in a four-group, parallel, controlled study. No significant difference in the ADR or polyp detection rate was found between CAQ and COMBO.

### Evaluation efficacy and accuracy of a real-time computer-aided polyp detection system during colonoscopy: a prospective, multicentric, randomized, parallel-controlled study trial [^113jDu39]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

These findings suggest a promising avenue for the prevention of colorectal cancer by emphasizing the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies. AI holds substantial potential in the creation of innovative screening strategies designed to enhance the detection of adenomas and polyps, thereby contributing to an improved quality of life. The application of AI across diverse medical domains has yielded favorable outcomes, significantly enhancing diagnostic and detection rates, and consequently improving overall quality of life.

Future research should consider employing double-blind designs to more accurately evaluate the specific role of the system in enhancing adenoma detection rates, as the observed behavior may influence these rates in the experimental group. Given that baseline adenoma and polyp detection rates may be affected by regional characteristics, the study's findings may not be applicable to regions with higher baseline adenoma detection rates globally. Further investigation is required to assess the system's adaptability and effectiveness in such regions. Research should focus on directions such as improving processing speed while maintaining high accuracy to meet the demands of real-time examinations. In addition, large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence systems in clinical settings. Customizing models based on the specific characteristics of different hospitals and equipment could enhance treatment outcomes.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated the efficacy and accuracy of the software in real-time colonoscopy and identified the sensitivity and specificity of the system.

### Effect of a novel artificial intelligence-based cecum recognition system on adenoma detection metrics in a screening colonoscopy setting [^114eJNCq]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Cecal intubation in colonoscopy relies on self-reporting. We developed an artificial intelligence-based cecum recognition system (AI-CRS) for post-hoc verification of cecal intubation and explored its impact on adenoma metrics.

Methods

Quality metrics, including cecal intubation rate (CIR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), and other ADR-related metrics, were compared both before (2015–2018) and after (2019–2022) the implementation of the AI-CRS.

Results

Although the CIR did not change significantly after the implementation of the AI-CRS, the ADR and advanced ADR significantly increased. Although the ADR significantly increased in all segments, the most significant increase in advanced ADR was observed in the proximal colon. Implementation of the AI-CRS was associated with a higher likelihood of detecting adenoma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–1.45) and advanced adenoma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.41), respectively.

Conclusions

Implementation of a post-hoc verification of cecal intubation using an AI-CRS significantly improved various adenoma metrics in screening colonoscopy.

### A prospective comparison of two computer aided detection systems with different false positive rates in colonoscopy [^1148QMiL]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study include a large sample size, the inclusion of all consecutive patients during the study period, an average-risk patient population, all of which reflect real-world practice. In RCTs, a very controlled selection of patients, procedures, and examiners is implemented to optimize the trial's ability to test the intervention under ideal circumstances. However, in real-world trials, such optimization is not feasible, and the performance of the intervention is tested as it would be in routine clinical practice. Consequently, the adverse effects of FPs, such as the "crying wolf" effect, may not demonstrate significant clinical importance in previous RCTs with optimal sample sizes and non-consecutive design. However, their impact becomes more pronounced in real-world studies involving high clinical workloads. This discrepancy may explain the differences in the effectiveness of CADe observed between controlled trials and real-world applications.

However, this study also has several limitations. Firstly, the non-randomized nature of the study and the absence of blinding among participating endoscopists to the CADe intervention could potentially introduce bias. Such bias may manifest in behaviors that promote enhanced mucosal visualization or more meticulous lesion evaluation during AI-assisted colonoscopy. This form of researcher bias has been previously suggested as a cause for discrepancies between RCTs and real-world studies. To address this limitation, our study implemented blinding regarding the hypotheses. Intriguingly, despite the full integration of new technology by the participants, our study revealed no significant improvement in both ADR and APC in the CADe group with a high FP rate as compared to the control group. This finding underscores the clinical significance of the impact of FPs. Secondly, given the non-randomized nature of the study, there may be a potential for selection bias in this study. In the baseline characteristics of the study population, there were no significant differences among the three groups except for withdrawal and inspection time. To overcome the confounding effect of inspection time, we adjusted this variable in the multivariable analysis for all major outcomes.

### Can I improve my adenoma detection rate? [^113K4Gdg]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Adenoma detection rate (ADR) has emerged as a key quality metric for colonoscopy. Despite limitations, its major strength is based on its proven correlation with interval colorectal cancer. This has prompted extensive efforts to identify factors and interventions that improve ADR. Potentially modifiable factors that may influence ADR can be patient related (eg, bowel preparation), endoscopist related (eg, withdrawal time, quality of mucosal inspection, additional observers), or procedure related (eg, water infusion, additional examination of right colon, change in position, antispasmodics, colonoscopic equipment, and accessories). Providing endoscopists with educational material and/or feedback also seems to improve ADR.

### Cap-assisted colonoscopy versus standard colonoscopy: is the cap beneficial? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114m2Pej]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

According to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is one of the three most common neoplasms for both men and women in the United States. Colonoscopy has been widely used as a diagnostic and preventative tool for colon cancer for many years. About 3.3 million colonoscopies are performed every year in the United States. Over half of them are done for the purposes of screening and surveillance. Properly performed colonoscopies are considered safe and effective for the screening and surveillance of colorectal cancer.

At present, colonoscopy is the first-line screening choice for the prevention and diagnosis of colorectal cancer, because of its ability to detect polyps and adenomas as well as facilitate their removal. However, colonoscopy is not perfect. Cancer, described as interval cancer, may develop after negative screening colonoscopy because of missed lesions. In an effort to decrease these interval cancers, many quality parameters have been used to determine the quality of the endoscopist; one of these is the adenoma detection rate (ADR).

The ADR for any endoscopist has an inverse correlation with the development of interval cancers. If the ADR is high, then the development of interval cancers will likely be low in the endoscopist's patient population. With every 1% increase in ADR, a 3% decline in interval colon cancer development may be observed. Therefore, the quality of screening colonoscopy is very important. Numerous other quality indicators for colonoscopy have been established, including bowel preparation scoring systems, cecal intubation time, cecal intubation rate, polyp detection rate (PDR), and withdrawal time.

Recently, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the American College of Gastroenterology came forward with guidelines recommending that endoscopists performing screening colonoscopies should have a 90% cecal intubation rate. This is the same criterion proposed by the United States Multi-Society Task Force on colon cancer. A good quality screening colonoscopy is a prerequisite for optimal patient care and many of the quality indicators described need to be fulfilled for reimbursement.

### Trial protocol for COLO-DETECT: a randomized controlled trial of lesion detection comparing colonoscopy assisted by the GI genius ™ artificial intelligence endoscopy module with standard colonoscopy [^116gTLmx]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

Colorectal cancer is the second commonest cause of cancer death worldwide. Colonoscopy plays a key role in the control of colorectal cancer and, in that regard, maximizing detection (and removal) of pre-cancerous adenomas at colonoscopy is imperative. GI Genius™ (Medtronic Ltd) is a computer-aided detection system that integrates with existing endoscopy systems and improves adenoma detection during colonoscopy. COLO-DETECT aims to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of GI Genius™ in UK routine colonoscopy practice.

Methods and Analysis

Participants will be recruited from patients attending for colonoscopy at National Health Service sites in England, for clinical symptoms, surveillance or within the national Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. Randomization will involve a 1:1 allocation ratio (GI Genius™-assisted colonoscopy:standard colonoscopy) and will be stratified by age category (< 60years, 60- < 74years, ≥ 74years), sex, hospital site and indication for colonoscopy. Demographic data, procedural data, histology and post-procedure patient experience and quality of life will be recorded. COLO-DETECT is designed and powered to detect clinically meaningful differences in mean adenomas per procedure and adenoma detection rate between GI Genius™-assisted colonoscopy and standard colonoscopy groups. The study will close when 1828 participants have had a complete colonoscopy. An economic evaluation will be conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service. A patient and public representative is contributing to all stages of the trial. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04723758) and ISRCTN (10451355). WHAT WILL THIS TRIAL ADD TO THE LITERATURE? COLO-DETECT will be the first multi-centre randomized controlled trial evaluating GI Genius™ in real world colonoscopy practice and will, uniquely, evaluate both clinical and cost effectiveness.

### Real-time computer aided colonoscopy versus standard colonoscopy for improving adenoma detection rate: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^111MXNVi]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The efficient detection of a precancerous lesion on colonoscopy depends on various factors including adequate bowel preparation and endoscopist's experience. Physician fatigue and examination time are factors that can potentially lead to a missed lesion. A deep CNN based CADe aid can help circumvent this problem. Other advantages are the monitoring of withdrawal time, which is a quality parameter of paramount importance, and the assisted view of blurred images captured during rapid movement of colonoscope. Still, the output results of a machine algorithm are only as good as its input training. Therefore, great impetus must to given to the learning curve of the machine learning software with new training images and/ or videos.

Although the results of ADR improvement seemed to be modest with AI, a previous large network meta-analysis comparing different techniques to improve ADR found that low-cost optimization of existing resources, such as water-aided colonoscopy or addition of a second observer, represents the most cost-effective strategy in this setting and performs even better than newer expensive scopes. Based on our findings, a combination approach with newer technologies based on deep CNNs could potentially enhance the overall ADR, although further trials are needed to confirm these assumptions.

### Bowel preparation quality and computer-aided detection of adenomas during colonoscopy [^1114FPA4]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems improve adenoma detection during colonoscopy, but the influence of bowel preparation quality on CADe performance is unclear. This study assessed whether different levels of adequate bowel preparation affect CADe effectiveness.

Methods

A post-hoc pooled analysis was conducted using individual patient data from three randomized controlled trials comparing CADe-assisted colonoscopy to standard colonoscopy (SC). Adenoma detection rate (ADR) and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) were analyzed by bowel preparation quality, categorized as good (BBPS 6–7) or excellent (BBPS 8–9). Interaction analysis assessed whether bowel prep quality modified CADe effectiveness.

Results

Among 2,103 patients, 43.1% had good and 56.9% excellent bowel preparation. CADe improved ADR over SC by +8.4% (95%CI: 1.9–14.9) in patients with good preparation and by +10.6% (95%CI: 5.0–16.2) in those with excellent preparation, with no statistically significant interaction between preparation quality levels (Δ = + 2.2%, 95%CI: -6.4 to 10.8; interaction p = 0.612). APC also increased by +0.28 (95%CI: 0.06–0.50) and +0.20 (95%CI: 0.03–0.36), respectively (Δ = -0.08%, 95% CI: -0.22 to +0.06, interaction p = 0.261). Similar effects were observed for right sided and diminutive adenomas.

Conclusion

CADe performances in enhancing adenoma detection, are not influenced by cleansing quality grades.

### Role of artificial intelligence in the association between time of day and colonoscopy quality… [^117RxMwy]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study including 1780 colonoscopy procedures, in the unassisted group, the adenoma detection rate at late sessions was significantly higher compared with that of early sessions, while with the assistance of AI systems, no such statistically significant difference was found. Meaning These findings suggest AI systems may be a potential tool for minimizing time-related degradation of colonoscopy quality. Importance Time of day was associated with a decline in adenoma detection during colonoscopy. Artificial intelligence systems are effective in improving the adenoma detection rate, but the performance of AI during different times of the day remains unknown. Objective To validate whether the assistance of an AI system could overcome the time-related decline in ADR during colonoscopy. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide.

1 Prevention strategies — especially screening colonoscopy — can substantially reduce CRC incidence and mortality via detection and removal of precancerous polyps. 2, 3 Adenoma detection rate is a critical quality measure of screening colonoscopy and each 1. 0% increase in ADR is associated with a
3. 0% decrease in the risk of interval CRC. 4 Ensuring high ADR is hence paramount in the prevention of CRC. The assistance capability of AI systems was compared through OR values. 17 For adenoma detection, the ADR was significantly improved after the assistance of AI systems in both early sessions and late sessions. With the assistance of the CADe system, more diminutive adenomas were detected during late sessions compared with early sessions, while more small adenomas were detected by the CAQ system.

### Can polyp detection rate be used prospectively as a marker of adenoma detection rate? [^114uHnGK]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a quality indicator for screening colonoscopy, but its calculation is time-consuming. Polyp detection rate (PDR) has been found to correlate with ADR; however, its use as a quality indicator has been criticized out of concern for endoscopists artificially inflating the PDR. We aim to evaluate whether active monitoring affects PDR.

Methods

In March 2015, 14 endoscopists were made aware that their personal PDRs would be tracked monthly as a quality improvement project. Endoscopists received a report of their individual monthly and cumulative PDR, departmental averages, and a benchmark PDR. Following the intervention, data were collected for consecutive patients undergoing average risk screening colonoscopy for six months. PDR, ADR, and adenoma to polyp detection ratio quotient (APDRQ) were compared to a six-month pre-intervention period.

Results

2203 patients were included in the study. There was no statistically significant difference in PDR when comparing pre- and post-intervention (44 vs. 45%, OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.77–1.36). No statistically significant difference in ADR was observed when comparing pre- and post-intervention (29 vs. 30%, OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.64–1.52). There was no statistically significant difference in APDRQ when comparing pre- and post-intervention (0.67 vs. 0.66, OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.69–1.33).

Conclusions

Monthly report cards did not result in a change in PDR or APDRQ. In some environments, PDR can be used as a surrogate marker of ADR, despite endoscopist awareness that PDR is being measured.

### Impact of AI-aided colonoscopy in clinical practice: a prospective randomised controlled trial [^1139Hwj5]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective randomised study, AI-C did not lead to significant improvement in ADR, ADR or the number of APC and PPC, when compared with CC. However, we observed a higher detection rate of SSL in the AI-C group. Concerning small polyps < 5 mm and right-sided polyps, there was no significant benefit from AI.

Adenoma detection rate

The impact of AI on ADR in our study does not align perfectly with previous studies and meta-analyses. In an Italian multicentre study with a similar design to ours, the authors noted an ADR improvement with CADe from 40% to 54%. The improvement was primarily due to a higher detection rate of small polyps measuring < 9 mm. Similar findings have been demonstrated by other authors. The ADR of 42% in our study surpasses the internationally recommended standard for high-quality endoscopy, with an ADR over 25%, and it even exceeds the average ADR in our country as reported by the Swedish National Sweden Registry for Colonoscopies, which indicated an ADR of 37% for the year 2021. The relatively high ADR, which remained high even in the CC group, might help explain the lack of additional benefits observed from the implementation of AI. Additionally, our study predominantly used a different AI system compared with the Italian study.

The withdrawal time of 12.3 min in the CC group and 13.9 min in the AI-C group, was markedly prolonged significantly surpassing the recommended minimum duration of > 6 min, for a diagnostic high-quality endoscopy. The possibility that participating endoscopists were influenced cannot be disregarded, leading to a heightened level of scrutiny compared with their usual practice, given the awareness of their involvement in a scientific study. Furthermore, the withdrawal time did not significantly differ between the two groups after adjusting for therapeutic interventions. This contrasts with findings from previous studies. Several additional factors might account for the elevated ADR observed in both groups. Bowel cleanliness met the quality criteria for all patients, as those with BBPS < 6 were excluded from the study. A majority of the endoscopists were experienced in these procedures. Routine utilisation of high-definition instruments, coupled with the frequent application of technical and optical enhancement tools like LC and the use of a cap. These circumstances imply that conditions were well-optimised for polyp detection, even within the group not using AI.

### Artificial intelligence for polyp detection during colonoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FJ9ad]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based polyp detection systems are used during colonoscopy with the aim of increasing lesion detection and improving colonoscopy quality.

Patients and Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective trials to determine the value of AI-based polyp detection systems for detection of polyps and colorectal cancer. We performed systematic searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Independent reviewers screened studies and assessed eligibility, certainty of evidence, and risk of bias. We compared colonoscopy with and without AI by calculating relative and absolute risks and mean differences for detection of polyps, adenomas, and colorectal cancer.

Results

Five randomized trials were eligible for analysis. Colonoscopy with AI increased adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and polyp detection rates (PDRs) compared to colonoscopy without AI (values given with 95%CI). ADR with AI was 29.6% (22.2%-37.0%) versus 19.3% (12.7%-25.9%) without AI; relative risk (RR] 1.52 (1.31–1.77), with high certainty. PDR was 45.4% (41.1%-49.8%) with AI versus 30.6% (26.5%-34.6%) without AI; RR 1.48 (1.37–1.60), with high certainty. There was no difference in detection of advanced adenomas (mean advanced adenomas per colonoscopy 0.03 for each group, high certainty). Mean adenomas detected per colonoscopy was higher for small adenomas (≤ 5mm) for AI versus non-AI (mean difference 0.15 [0.12–0.18]), but not for larger adenomas (> 5- ≤ 10mm, mean difference 0.03 [0.01–0.05]; > 10mm, mean difference 0.01 [0.00–0.02]; high certainty). Data on cancer are unavailable.

Conclusions

AI-based polyp detection systems during colonoscopy increase detection of small nonadvanced adenomas and polyps, but not of advanced adenomas.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on computer-aided detection-assisted colonoscopy [^115EeQA4]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Computer-aided detection (CADe)–assisted colonoscopy — systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials — was associated with higher polyp detection and ADR and reduced adenoma miss rates versus standard colonoscopy, with increased non-neoplastic polyp resection and slightly longer withdrawal and inspection times. This SR and meta-analysis included 44 RCTs with more than 30,000 participants. Based on data from 32,108 participants in 41 RCTs, polyp detection rate was 56.1% vs 47.9% (relative risk [RR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15–1.28) and ADR 44.8% vs 37.4% (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.16–1.29). Across 6 tandem-design studies (total patients, n = 2769), missed adenomas were 154/957 (16.1%) with CADe vs 374/1061 (35.3%) with standard colonoscopy (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.36–0.60). Advanced colorectal neoplasia detection rate was 12.7% vs 11.5% (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02–1.32). There was an 11% increase in the likelihood of resected polyps being non-neoplastic (34.0% vs 28.8%; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04–1.19). Pooled data from 30,276 procedures showed total withdrawal time 9.17 vs 8.60 minutes (mean difference, 0.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.31–0.83 minutes) and inspection time 8.34 vs 7.95 minutes (mean difference, 0.31 minutes; 95% CI, 0.14–0.48 minutes).

### Computer-aided quality assessment of endoscopist competence during colonoscopy: a systematic review [^1155n9gM]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Endoscopists' competence can vary widely, as shown in the variation in the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Computer-aided quality assessment (CAQ) can automatically assess performance during individual procedures. In this review we identified and described different CAQ systems for colonoscopy.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was done using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus based on 3 blocks of terms according to the inclusion criteria: colonoscopy, competence assessment, and automatic evaluation. Articles were systematically reviewed by 2 reviewers, first by abstract and then in full text. The methodological quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI).

Results

Of 12,575 identified studies, 6831 remained after removal of duplicates and 6806 did not pass the eligibility criteria and were excluded, leaving 25 studies, of which 13 studies were included in the final analysis. Five categories of CAQ systems were identified: withdrawal speedometer (7 studies), endoscope movement analysis (3 studies), effective withdrawal time (1 study), fold examination quality (1 study), and visual gaze pattern (1 study). The withdrawal speedometer was the only CAQ system that tested its feedback by examining changes in ADR. Three studies observed an improvement in ADR, and 2 studies did not. The methodological quality of the studies was high (mean MERSQI, 15.2 points; maximum, 18 points).

Conclusions

Thirteen studies developed or tested CAQ systems, most frequently by correlating it to the ADR. Only 5 studies tested feedback by implementing the CAQ system. A meta-analysis was impossible because of the heterogeneous study designs, and more studies are warranted.

### A computer-aided detection system in the everyday setting of diagnostic, screening, and surveillance colonoscopy: an international, randomized trial [^113EJ2jg]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been developed to improve detection during colonoscopy. After initial reports of high efficacy, there has been an increasing recognition of variability in the effectiveness of CADe systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate a CADe system in a varied colonoscopy population.

Methods

A multicenter, randomized trial was conducted at seven hospitals (both university and non-university) in Europe and Canada. Participants referred for diagnostic, non-immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) screening, or surveillance colonoscopy were randomized (1:1) to undergo CADe-assisted or conventional colonoscopy by experienced endoscopists. Participants with insufficient bowel preparation were excluded from the analysis. The primary outcome was adenoma detection rate (ADR). Secondary outcomes included adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) and sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) per colonoscopy.

Results

581 participants were enrolled, of whom 497 were included in the final analysis: 250 in the CADe arm and 247 in the conventional colonoscopy arm. The indication was surveillance in 202/497 colonoscopies (40.6%), diagnostic in 199/497 (40.0%), and non-iFOBT screening in 96/497 (19.3%). Overall, ADR (38.4% vs. 37.7%; P = 0.43) and APC (0.66 vs. 0.66; P = 0.97) were similar between CADe and conventional colonoscopy. SSLs per colonoscopy was increased (0.30 vs. 0.19; P = 0.049) in the CADe arm vs. the conventional colonoscopy arm.

Conclusions

In this study conducted by experienced endoscopists, CADe did not result in a statistically significant increase in ADR. However, the ADR of our control group substantially surpassed our sample size assumptions, increasing the risk of an underpowered trial.

### The impact of video recording colonoscopy on adenoma detection rates [^1135nUFA]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a quality benchmark for colonoscopy, influenced by several factors including bowel preparation, withdrawal time, and withdrawal technique.

Objective

To assess the impact of video recording of all colonoscopies on the ADR.

Design

Comparison of two cohorts of patients undergoing colonoscopy before and after implementation of video recording.

Setting

Academic outpatient endoscopy facility.

Patients

This study involved asymptomatic, average-risk adults undergoing screening colonoscopy.

Intervention

Video recording of all colonoscopy procedures. Polyp findings and withdrawal times were recorded for 208 consecutive screening colonoscopies. A policy of video recording all colonoscopies was implemented and announced to the staff. Data on another 213 screening colonoscopies were subsequently collected.

Main Outcome Measurements

Adenoma detection rate, withdrawal time, advanced polyp detection rate, hyperplastic polyp detection rate.

Results

At least one adenoma was found in 38.5% of patients after video recording versus 33.7% before video recording (P = 0.31). There was a significant increase in the hyperplastic polyp detection rate (44.1% vs 34.6%; P = 0.046). Most endoscopists had a numerical increase in their ADRs, but only one was significant (57.7% vs 22.6%; P < .01). There were trends toward higher detection of adenomas of < 5 mm (59.1% vs 52%; P = 0.23) and right-sided adenomas (40.2% vs 30.4%; P = 0.11) in the video recorded group.

Limitations

No randomization, confounding of intervention effects, and sample size limitations.

Conclusion

Video recording of colonoscopies is associated with a nonsignificant increase in the ADR and a significant increase in the hyperplastic polyp detection rate. There may be a benefit of video recording for endoscopists with low ADRs.

### AI support for colonoscopy quality control using CNN and transformer architectures [^111MYJ1y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This disease may begin with non-cancerous polyps in the colon, which, if not treated in time, can develop into cancer. Typically, CRC progresses through the "adenoma-carcinoma" sequence, with polyps undergoing malignant transformation over several years, during which they can be detected and treated. Therefore, early screening, detection, and timely removal of polyps are crucial in reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer.

With the continuous advancement of gastrointestinal endoscopy technology, colonoscopy has become the preferred method for early CRC screening and the diagnosis of colonic lesions. Identifying and promptly removing adenomatous polyps can significantly reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. However, the cleanliness of the bowel is crucial for accurate examination results, as poor bowel preparation can lead to missed lesions. Complete cecal intubation is also a key factor in the quality of colonoscopy. Slowing the withdrawal speed has been shown to significantly increase the adenoma detection rate (ADR)and reduce the risk of interval colorectal cancer. In recent years, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the Digestive Endoscopy Society of the Chinese Medical Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy have issued quality control statements on colonoscopy screening, highlighting polyp detection rate, bowel preparation quality, withdrawal speed, and cecal intubation rate as critical indicators for colonoscopy quality control.

### Impact of study design on adenoma detection in the evaluation of artificial intelligence-aided colonoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115srPgW]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported that artificial intelligence (AI) improves endoscopic polyp detection. Different methodologies-namely, parallel and tandem designs-have been used to evaluate the efficacy of AI-assisted colonoscopy in RCTs. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported a pooled effect that includes both study designs. However, it is unclear whether there are inconsistencies in the reported results of these 2 designs. Here, we aimed to determine whether study characteristics moderate between-trial differences in outcomes when evaluating the effectiveness of AI-assisted polyp detection.

Methods

A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore was performed through March 1, 2023, for RCTs comparing AI-assisted colonoscopy with routine high-definition colonoscopy in polyp detection. The primary outcome of interest was the impact of study type on the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Secondary outcomes included the impact of the study type on adenomas per colonoscopy and withdrawal time, as well as the impact of geographic location, AI system, and endoscopist experience on ADR. Pooled event analysis was performed using a random-effects model.

Results

Twenty-four RCTs involving 17,413 colonoscopies (AI assisted: 8680; non-AI assisted: 8733) were included. AI-assisted colonoscopy improved overall ADR (risk ratio [RR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17–1.31; I² = 53%; P < .001). Tandem studies collectively demonstrated improved ADR in AI-aided colonoscopies (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08–1.30; I² = 0%; P < .001), as did parallel studies (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17–1.35; I² = 62%; P < .001), with no statistical subgroup difference between study design. Both tandem and parallel study designs revealed improvement in adenomas per colonoscopy in AI-aided colonoscopies, but this improvement was more marked among tandem studies (P < .001). AI assistance significantly increased withdrawal times for parallel (P = 0.002), but not tandem, studies. ADR improvement was more marked among studies conducted in Asia compared to Europe and North America in a subgroup analysis (P = 0.007). Type of AI system used or endoscopist experience did not affect overall improvement in ADR.

Conclusions

Either parallel or tandem study design can capture the improvement in ADR resulting from the use of AI-assisted polyp detection systems. Tandem studies powered to detect differences in endoscopic performance through paired comparison may be a resource-efficient method of evaluating new AI-assisted technologies.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on computer-aided detection-assisted colonoscopy [^111rC26y]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Computer-aided detection (CADe)-assisted colonoscopy in adults undergoing colonoscopy for screening, surveillance, or follow-up of positive fecal immunochemical test is evaluated against a comparator of routine or standard colonoscopy. For serrated sessile polyp detection rate, RR, 1.21 (95% CI, 1.04–1.42), and the narrative states CADe-assisted colonoscopy may increase serrated sessile polyp detection rate; for non-neoplastic polyps, RR, 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04–1.19) and the narrative states CADe-assisted colonoscopy probably increases detection of non-neoplastic polyps. For withdrawal time measured in minutes, MD, 0.57 more (95% CI, 0.31 more to 0.83 more), and the narrative states CADe-assisted colonoscopy probably has little or no difference on withdrawal time.

### Diagnostic accuracy of a novel artificial intelligence system for adenoma detection in daily practice: a prospective nonrandomized comparative study [^114yX51x]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Adenoma detection rate (ADR) varies significantly between endoscopists, with adenoma miss rates (AMRs) up to 26%. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems may improve endoscopy quality and reduce the rate of interval cancer. We evaluated the efficacy of an AI system in real-time colonoscopy and its influence on AMR and ADR.

Methods

This prospective, nonrandomized, comparative study analyzed patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy at a single endoscopy center in Germany from June to October 2020. Every patient was examined concurrently by an endoscopist and AI using two opposing screens. The AI system, overseen by a second observer, was not visible to the endoscopist. AMR was the primary outcome. Both methods were compared using McNemar test.

Results

150 patients were included (mean age 65 years [standard deviation 14]; 69 women). There was no significant or clinically relevant difference (P = 0.75) in AMR between the AI system (6/197, 3.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–6.5) and routine colonoscopy (4/197, 2.0%; 95%CI 0.6–5.1). The polyp miss rate of the AI system (14/311, 4.5%; 95%CI 2.5–7.4) was not significantly different (P = 0.72) from routine colonoscopy (17/311, 5.5%; 95%CI 3.2–8.6). There was no significant difference (P = 0.50) in ADR between routine colonoscopy (78/150, 52.0%; 95%CI 43.7–60.2) and the AI system (76/150, 50.7%; 95%CI 42.4–58.9). Routine colonoscopy detected adenomas in two patients that were missed by the AI system.

Conclusion

The AI system performance was comparable to that of experienced endoscopists during real-time colonoscopy with similar high ADR (> 50%).

### Artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy improves adenoma detection rates in routine colonoscopy practice: a single-center, retrospective, propensity score-matched study with concurrent controls [^116HxRFB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

A limitation of AI-assisted colonoscopy is its inability to detect lesions in areas that are not fully exposed. Various mucosal exposure devices, such as transparent caps and Endocuff Vision, have been extensively studied for their efficacy. The Endocuff, a device designed to flatten colon folds and improve mucosal visibility, has demonstrated efficacy in several RCTs, significantly improving ADR compared to standard colonoscopy. A study comparing colonoscopy with the combination of CADe and Endocuff to CADe alone found that the ADR was significantly higher in the Endocuff combination group. Additionally, a recent three-arm RCT demonstrated that combining Endocuff with CADe significantly improved the ADR (58.7%) compared with CADe alone (53.8%) or standard colonoscopy (46.3%). However, the effectiveness of transparent caps in improving ADR remains controversial, with some studies showing benefits and others showing no significant effect. In our study, the use of transparent caps was based on the endoscopists' preferences, making it challenging to assess the specific effects of their combination with CADe. Further research is needed to determine the optimal combination of mucosal exposure devices and CADe to enhance the polyp detection outcomes.

### Evaluation efficacy and accuracy of a real-time computer-aided polyp detection system during colonoscopy: a prospective, multicentric, randomized, parallel-controlled study trial [^112Dechw]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the second deadliest cancer globally, impacting patients' quality of life. Colonoscopy is the primary screening method for detecting adenomas and polyps, crucial for reducing long-term CRC risk, but it misses about 30% of cases. Efforts to improve detection rates include using AI to enhance colonoscopy. This study assesses the effectiveness and accuracy of a real-time AI-assisted polyp detection system during colonoscopy.

Materials and methods

The study included 390 patients aged 40 to 75 undergoing colonoscopies for either colorectal cancer screening (risk score ≥ 4) or clinical diagnosis. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group using software-assisted diagnosis or a control group with physician diagnosis. The software, a medical image processing tool with B/S and MVC architecture, operates on Windows 10 (64-bit) and supports real-time image handling and lesion identification via HDMI, SDI, AV, and DVI outputs from endoscopy devices. Expert evaluations of retrospective video lesions served as the gold standard. Efficacy was assessed by polyp per colonoscopy (PPC), adenoma per colonoscopy (APC), adenoma detection rate (ADR), and polyp detection rate (PDR), while accuracy was measured using sensitivity and specificity against the gold standard.

Results

In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, computer-aided detection (CADe) significantly improved polyp detection rates (PDR), achieving 67.18% in the CADe group versus 56.92% in the control group. The CADe group identified more polyps, especially those 5 mm or smaller (61.03% vs. 56.92%). In addition, the CADe group demonstrated higher specificity (98.44%) and sensitivity (95.19%) in the FAS dataset, and improved sensitivity (95.82% vs. 77.53%) in the PPS dataset, with both groups maintaining 100% specificity. These results suggest that the AI-assisted system enhances PDR accuracy.

Conclusion

This real-time computer-aided polyp detection system enhances efficacy by boosting adenoma and polyp detection rates, while also achieving high accuracy with excellent sensitivity and specificity.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy for polyp detection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jF9t2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of computer-aided detection (CADe) system-enhanced colonoscopy compared with conventional colonoscopy suggest increased adenoma detection rate (ADR) and decreased adenoma miss rate (AMR), but the effect on detection of advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) is unclear.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review to compare performance of CADe-enhanced and conventional colonoscopy.

Data Sources

Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched through February 2024.

Study Selection

Published RCTs comparing CADe-enhanced and conventional colonoscopy.

Data Extraction

Average adenoma per colonoscopy (APC) and ACN per colonoscopy were primary outcomes. Adenoma detection rate, AMR, and ACN detection rate (ACN DR) were secondary outcomes. Balancing outcomes included withdrawal time and resection of nonneoplastic polyps (NNPs). Subgroup analyses were done by neural network architecture.

Data Synthesis

Forty-four RCTs with 36201 cases were included. Computer-aided detection-enhanced colonoscopies have higher average APC (12090 of 12279 [0.98] vs. 9690 of 12292 [0.78], incidence rate difference [IRD] = 0.22 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.28]) and higher ADR (7098 of 16253 [44.7%] vs. 5825 of 15855 [36.7%], rate ratio [RR] = 1.21 [CI, 1.15 to 1.28]). Average ACN per colonoscopy was similar (1512 of 9296 [0.16] vs. 1392 of 9121 [0.15], IRD = 0.01 [CI, -0.01 to 0.02]), but ACN DR was higher with CADe system use (1260 of 9899 [12.7%] vs. 1119 of 9746 [11.5%], RR = 1.16 [CI, 1.02 to 1.32]). Using CADe systems resulted in resection of almost 2 extra NNPs per 10 colonoscopies and longer total withdrawal time (0.53 minutes [CI, 0.30 to 0.77]).

Limitation

Statistically significant heterogeneity in quality and sample size and inability to blind endoscopists to the intervention in included studies may affect the performance estimates.

Conclusion

Computer-aided detection-enhanced colonoscopies have increased APC and detection rate but no difference in ACN per colonoscopy and a small increase in ACN DR. There is minimal increase in procedure time and no difference in performance across neural network architectures.

Primary Funding Source

None. (PROSPERO: CRD42023422835).

Subgroup analysis categorized by endoscopists

The ADRs of the four experienced endoscopists were 19.0%, 40.7%, 21.4%, and 45.7%, respectively. Based on their ADRs, endoscopists were categorized as high detectors if their ADR was ≥ 25% and low detectors if it was < 25%. Additionally, five endoscopy trainees performed 114 colonoscopies (33 AI-assisted and 81 standard), achieving an overall ADR of 34.2%.

Table 4 presents lesion detection rates categorized by the endoscopists. In endoscopy trainees, ADRs were significantly higher in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group compared to the standard colonoscopy group (51.5% vs. 27.2%, p = 0.023). Any polyps and SSLs were detected more frequently in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group, although the difference was not statistically significant. Among the high-detectors, SSL detection rates (SSLDR) were significantly higher in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group compared to the standard colonoscopy group (8.0% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.043). The detection rates of any polyps, adenomas, and advanced adenomas were numerically higher in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group, although the differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, detection rates of any lesions did not differ significantly between the two colonoscopy groups among the low-detectors.

### AGA clinical practice update on the role of artificial intelligence in colon polyp diagnosis and management: commentary [^114MjdoJ]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Artificial intelligence detection during screening colonoscopy — cost-effectiveness modeling indicates that compared with no screening, the relative reduction of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence with screening colonoscopy without AI tools was 44.2% and with AI tools was 48.9% (4.8% incremental gain); AI detection tools decreased the discounted costs per screened individual from $3400 to $3343 (a savings of $57 per individual), and at the US population level this implementation resulted in yearly additional prevention of 7194 CRC cases and 2089 related deaths, and a yearly saving of $290 million, while the cost-effectiveness relies on assumptions that adenoma detection rate (ADR) will increase from baseline and still needs corroboration in further studies.

### A computer-aided detection system in the everyday setting of diagnostic, screening, and surveillance colonoscopy: an international, randomized trial [^114zahxd]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Study procedures

In the CADe arm, the device was switched on at the beginning of the CADe colonoscopy, and the use of CADe was mandatory during the withdrawal phase. Endoscopists were advised to primarily use the CADe monitor; however, the use of a dual monitor setup, with separate displays for the conventional image and the CADe overlay, was not explicitly prohibited.

Each study site used local bowel preparation protocols and sedation administration. All participants randomized to conventional colonoscopy underwent colonoscopy as per standard of care. During the study, conventional PENTAX high-definition colonoscopes were used for both arms. To ensure adequate bowel inspection, all participating endoscopists were instructed to aim for a minimum withdrawal time of 6 minutes (excluding time spent on polypectomies or other interventions) following societal guidelines. In addition, an upper withdrawal time of 10 minutes was recommended to reflect everyday procedural scheduling and reduce observation-related bias.

All lesions were collected for histopathologic examination in separate containers for each polyp. Diminutive (1–5 mm) polyps located in the rectum and considered to be hyperplastic by the performing endoscopist could be left in place according to endoscopists' individual judgment and standard of care. Experienced pathologists, who were blinded to the endoscopic diagnosis, determined the histopathologic diagnosis according to the Vienna classification.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome was ADR, calculated as the proportion of colonoscopies with at least one histologically confirmed detected adenoma. Additionally, ADR was evaluated across various variables, including colonoscopy indication and in a per-endoscopist analysis. Secondary outcomes were mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC; total number of histologically confirmed adenomas divided by the total number of colonoscopies), polyp detection rate (proportion of colonoscopies with at least one histologically confirmed detected polyp), sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) per colonoscopy (total number of histologically confirmed SSLs divided by the total number of colonoscopies), and SSL detection rate (proportion of colonoscopies with at least one histologically confirmed detected SSL). Other secondary outcomes included withdrawal time without interventions and the number of false positives during CADe-assisted colonoscopy (defined as a non-neoplastic, non-hyperplastic area highlighted by CADe for > 3 consecutive seconds). The reasons for false positives were reported and were calculated as the number of CADe colonoscopies with at least one subcategory of the reason for false positives.

### Impact of AI-aided colonoscopy in clinical practice: a prospective randomised controlled trial [^116ZoRyH]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Objective

Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a significant role in cancer-related mortality. Colonoscopy, combined with adenoma removal, has proven effective in reducing CRC incidence. However, suboptimal colonoscopy quality often leads to missed polyps. The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on adenoma and polyp detection rate (ADR, PDR) is yet to be established.

Design

We conducted a randomised controlled trial at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden. Patients underwent colonoscopy with or without the assistance of AI (AI-C or conventional colonoscopy (CC)). Examinations were performed with two different AI systems, that is, Fujifilm CADEye and Medtronic GI Genius. The primary outcome was ADR.

Results

Among 286 patients, 240 underwent analysis (average age: 66 years). The ADR was 42% for all patients, and no significant difference emerged between AI-C and CC groups (41% vs 43%). The overall PDR was 61%, with a trend towards higher PDR in the AI-C group. Subgroup analysis revealed higher detection rates for sessile serrated lesions (SSL) with AI assistance (AI-C 22%, CC 11%, p = 0.004). No difference was noticed in the detection of polyps or adenomas per colonoscopy. Examinations were most often performed by experienced endoscopists, 78% (n = 86 AI-C, 100 CC).

Conclusion

Amidst the ongoing AI integration, ADR did not improve with AI. Particularly noteworthy is the enhanced detection rates for SSL by AI assistance, especially since they pose a risk for postcolonoscopy CRC. The integration of AI into standard colonoscopy practice warrants further investigation and the development of improved software might be necessary before enforcing its mandatory implementation.

### AGA clinical practice update on strategies to improve quality of screening and surveillance colonoscopy: expert review [^111NUMtf]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for colonoscopy, more specifically with respect to requirements for operator performance, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to endoscopy units should measure and provide feedback on serrated lesion detection rates on an endoscopist and unit level. The goal serrated lesion detection rates for an individual endoscopist should be ≥ 7% (aspirational target ≥ 10%). If rates are low, improvement efforts should be oriented toward both colonoscopists and pathologists.
