## Question

A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, presents at 22 weeks' gestation for a routine anatomy ultrasound. The scan reveals a fetal lumbar myelomeningocele. She is otherwise healthy, and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. The patient expresses interest in learning about all possible treatment options, including fetal surgery. You are practicing in a community hospital with standard obstetric services but no specialized fetal therapy program.

According to current guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient who is interested in fetal myelomeningocele repair?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most appropriate next step is for a 28-year-old G2P1 at 22 weeks with a fetal lumbar myelomeningocele who is interested in fetal surgery, given that the local hospital lacks fetal therapy capabilities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing candidacy for fetal surgery. Then, I should verify the evidence-based benefits and risks to frame counseling. Next, I will review guideline-directed management pathways and the requirement for referral to a fetal therapy center. After that, I need to check the timing constraints and logistical steps for urgent referral. Finally, I will consider alternatives if fetal surgery is not feasible and outline documentation and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and eligibility framework. A lumbar myelomeningocele at 22 weeks meets the anatomic and gestational window for consideration of open maternal-fetal surgery, but I need to ensure the full MOMS criteria are met before proceeding, including singleton gestation, lesion level T1–S1, hindbrain herniation on MRI, normal karyotype, and gestational age 19 0/7 to 25 6/7 weeks at intervention, while excluding contraindications such as BMI ≥ 35, short cervix, prior preterm birth, or significant maternal comorbidities [^116nP4Vc] [^114Lp7fu] [^11621bK5].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base so I can counsel accurately. The MOMS randomized trial showed that prenatal repair reduced the composite of fetal or neonatal death or shunt placement by 12 months (68% vs 98%; RR 0.70), decreased actual shunt placement (40% vs 82%; RR 0.48), and improved independent ambulation at 30 months (42% vs 24%), but at the cost of higher preterm delivery, membrane rupture, oligohydramnios, and uterine dehiscence, with implications for future pregnancies including mandatory cesarean delivery and risks of uterine rupture or dehiscence [^112FgZ57] [^116nP4Vc] [^117UXShP] [^114Lp7fu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about where this can be done. I need to ensure we follow guideline-directed care: ACOG and SMFM recommend that interested candidates be referred to a fetal therapy center with the expertise, multidisciplinary team, and facilities to perform open maternal-fetal surgery and provide the intensive perioperative and obstetric care required, and that counseling be nondirective across all options including termination, postnatal repair, and in utero repair for appropriate candidates [^111NqLv3] [^116tNbYx] [^112Pps7G] [^1131jbbf].

> I should double-check timing because the window is narrow. At 22 weeks, she has approximately 3–4 weeks to complete referral, confirm candidacy, and undergo surgery by 25 6/7 weeks if proceeding, so this is an urgent referral; delays risk missing the gestational window and may push management toward postnatal repair by default, which still remains an appropriate standard option with established outcomes [^116nP4Vc] [^114Lp7fu].

> Next, I should review what needs to happen now in a community setting. The most appropriate next step is immediate referral to a recognized fetal therapy center for comprehensive evaluation and counseling; concurrently, I need to arrange genetic counseling and diagnostic testing, typically amniocentesis with chromosomal microarray to confirm normal karyotype and exclude additional anomalies, because abnormal genetics would change candidacy and counseling, and this should be coordinated through the receiving fetal center to avoid delays [^111NqLv3] [^111eCC3D] [^117GzZxs].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot travel or the referral is delayed? I need to ensure we still provide nondirective counseling on all three evidence-based options: pregnancy termination, expectant management with postnatal repair, and in utero repair for eligible candidates, emphasizing that postnatal repair remains standard care and is appropriate if prenatal repair is not pursued or not feasible, with planned delivery at a tertiary center equipped for neonatal neurosurgical management [^112Pps7G] [^117GzZxs] [^115oFExt].

> I will now examine maternal and reproductive implications that must be disclosed during counseling. Open maternal-fetal surgery carries risks of preterm birth, chorioamniotic separation, membrane rupture, oligohydramnios, placental abruption, pulmonary edema, transfusion, and uterine dehiscence or rupture, and it mandates cesarean delivery for the index and all future pregnancies with an estimated uterine rupture risk of roughly 11–14% in subsequent pregnancies, which should be discussed explicitly in shared decision-making [^116nP4Vc] [^114Lp7fu] [^1124Pcyx].

> Let me consider evolving alternatives briefly, but I should confirm their status. Fetoscopic repair is promising and may reduce maternal morbidity compared with open surgery, yet it remains investigational outside of trials and should not be offered as standard care; patients may be directed to centers with IRB-approved fetoscopic protocols if interested, while recognizing that long-term comparative data are still maturing [^113DPnea] [^113LwUbV] [^116Ku7mV].

> I need to ensure documentation is complete and actionable. I should record the diagnosis, gestational age, lesion level, current counseling on all options with balanced risks and benefits, the urgency of referral given the gestational window, and the plan for genetic testing and coordination with the fetal center, and I should communicate directly with the receiving center to expedite scheduling and avoid missed opportunities for candidacy [^117GzZxs].

> In summary, the most appropriate next step is urgent referral to a fetal therapy center for comprehensive evaluation and nondirective counseling regarding fetal surgery candidacy, with concurrent arrangement of genetic testing and coordination of care, because at 22 weeks she remains within the evidence-based window for open maternal-fetal repair and community hospitals should not attempt fetal surgery outside of specialized centers [^111NqLv3] [^116nP4Vc] [^114Lp7fu].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **urgently refer the patient to a fetal therapy center** for evaluation and counseling on prenatal repair options, as she meets gestational age criteria and expressed interest in fetal surgery [^111NqLv3] [^116tNbYx]. Prenatal repair is offered to carefully selected patients at experienced centers and requires **multidisciplinary assessment** to confirm candidacy and discuss maternal and fetal risks and benefits [^112xcc9o] [^116nP4Vc]. If referral is delayed beyond 25 6/7 weeks, postnatal repair remains the standard of care [^116nP4Vc].

---

## Evidence-based benefits and risks of prenatal repair

The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) demonstrated that prenatal repair offers **significant benefits** compared with postnatal repair, including:

- **Reduced need for shunting**: 40% vs 82% with postnatal repair (RR 0.48; 97.7% CI 0.36–0.64) [^116nP4Vc] [^112yz2xV].
- **Improved motor function**: Higher likelihood of independent ambulation at 30 months (42% vs 21%; RR 2.01) [^116nP4Vc] [^117UXShP].
- **Reduced hindbrain herniation**: Lower incidence at 12 months (64% vs 96%; RR 0.67) [^116nP4Vc] [^112yz2xV].

However, prenatal repair also carries **significant maternal and fetal risks**, including:

- **Preterm delivery**: Higher risk of preterm birth and spontaneous rupture of membranes [^116nP4Vc] [^112yz2xV].
- **Maternal complications**: Increased risk of uterine dehiscence, pulmonary edema, and transfusion at delivery [^116nP4Vc] [^112yz2xV].
- **Future pregnancy implications**: Requirement for cesarean delivery in all future pregnancies due to uterine rupture risk [^114XAvh4] [^1124Pcyx].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACOG and SMFM recommend that women with pregnancies complicated by fetal myelomeningocele who meet established criteria be counseled in a **nondirective manner** regarding all management options, including open maternal-fetal surgery [^114T95v3] [^1131jbbf]. Interested candidates should be referred to fetal therapy centers with the expertise, multidisciplinary teams, and facilities to provide comprehensive care and counseling [^111NqLv3] [^116tNbYx].

---

## Criteria for candidacy for prenatal repair

Candidates for prenatal repair must meet **specific maternal and fetal criteria**, including:

- **Gestational age**: 19 0/7 to 25 6/7 weeks at the time of surgery [^116nP4Vc] [^114Lp7fu].
- **Fetal criteria**: Singleton gestation, lesion level between T1 and S1, evidence of hindbrain herniation on MRI, and normal karyotype [^116nP4Vc] [^114Lp7fu].
- **Maternal criteria**: Absence of significant maternal medical conditions, BMI less than 35, and adequate cervical length [^116nP4Vc] [^114Lp7fu].

---

## Alternative management options

If prenatal repair is not feasible or declined, **alternative options** include:

- **Postnatal repair**: Standard surgical closure within 24–72 hours after birth [^116ErR1M].
- **Expectant management**: Continued pregnancy with close surveillance and planned delivery at a tertiary center [^117GzZxs].
- **Pregnancy termination**: Considered in cases of severe anomalies or when consistent with patient values and local regulations [^117S9of2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's gestational age and expressed interest in fetal surgery, the most appropriate next step is to **urgently refer her to a fetal therapy center** for comprehensive evaluation and counseling. This ensures timely assessment of candidacy, balanced discussion of risks and benefits, and coordination of care if prenatal repair is pursued [^111NqLv3] [^116tNbYx]. If referral is delayed beyond 25 6/7 weeks, postnatal repair remains the standard of care [^116nP4Vc].

### Position statement on fetal myelomeningocele repair [^114gpmW6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Following the promising multicenter randomized trial results of in utero fetal myelomeningocele repair; we anticipate that an increasing number of tertiary care centers may want to offer this therapy. It is essential to establish minimum criteria for centers providing open fetal myelomeningocele repair to ensure optimal maternal and fetal/pediatric outcomes, as well as patient safety both short- and long-term; and to advance our knowledge of the role and benefit of fetal surgery in the management of fetal myelomeningocele. The fetal myelomeningocele Maternal-Fetal Management Task Force was initially convened by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to discuss the implementation of maternal fetal surgery for myelomeningocele. The decision was made to develop the optimal practice criteria presented in this document for the purpose of medical and surgical leadership. These criteria are not intended to be used for legal or regulatory purposes.

### Evidence-based medicine and fetal treatment: how to get involved [^116kY5vQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The Management of Myelomeningocele Study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial of in utero compared with postnatal repair of isolated spina bifida. Referral of potential patients to the Management of Myelomeningocele Study trial will provide the pregnant woman with substantial information about the fetal condition as well as the trial. The referral rate has been very slow. Possible reasons for this are physicians' and the public's belief that in utero surgery has already been proven to be better than postnatal repair or conversely to offer no benefit over standard therapy; that the trial does not address fundamental issues of maternal and fetal outcomes and safety; and that trial is not well designed. These beliefs are ill-founded. The practicing obstetrician has a fundamental role to inform potential patients about this and other research trials.

### Committee opinion no. 720: maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^1168AKSL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Maternal–fetal surgery for myelomeningocele — epidemiology, risk–benefit framing, and use criteria are summarized as follows: Myelomeningocele occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 live births in the United States, and the extent of disability generally is related to the level of the myelomeningocele defect, with a higher upper level of lesion generally corresponding to greater deficits. Although there is demonstrated potential for fetal and pediatric benefit, there are significant maternal implications and complications that may occur acutely, postoperatively, for the duration of the pregnancy, and in subsequent pregnancies. Women with pregnancies complicated by fetal myelomeningocele who meet established criteria for in utero repair should be counseled in a nondirective fashion regarding all management options, including the possibility of open maternal–fetal surgery, and maternal–fetal surgery for myelomeningocele repair should be offered only on carefully selected patients at facilities with an appropriate level of personnel and resources.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 550: maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^1143u15V]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Myelomeningocele, the most severe form of spina bifida, occurs in approximately 1 in 1,500 births in the United States. Fetuses in whom myelomeningocele is diagnosed typically are delivered at term and are treated in the early neonatal period. A recent randomized controlled trial found that fetal surgery for myelomeningocele improved a number of important outcomes, but also was associated with maternal and fetal risks. Maternal-fetal surgery is a major procedure for the woman and her fetus, and it has significant implications and complications that occur acutely, postoperatively, for the duration of the pregnancy, and in subsequent pregnancies. Therefore, it should only be offered at facilities with the expertise, multidisciplinary teams, services, and facilities to provide the intensive care required for these patients.

### Committee opinion no. 720: maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^115YHM6d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Myelomeningocele, a severe form of spina bifida, occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 live births in the United States. The extent of disability is generally related to the level of the myelomeningocele defect, with a higher upper level of lesion generally corresponding to greater deficits. Open maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele repair is a major procedure for the woman and her affected fetus. Although there is demonstrated potential for fetal and pediatric benefit, there are significant maternal implications and complications that may occur acutely, postoperatively, for the duration of the pregnancy, and in subsequent pregnancies.

### Committee opinion no. 720: maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^114XAvh4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Practice implications — counseling and delivery planning for pregnancies with fetal myelomeningocele are as follows: Based upon the results of the randomized trial, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine recommend that women with pregnancies complicated by fetal myelomeningocele who meet established criteria for in utero repair should be counseled in a nondirective fashion regarding all management options, including the possibility of open maternal–fetal surgery. This consultation should include a discussion of risks and benefits to the woman and her fetus, including limited data regarding potential implications for long-term maternal reproductive health and future pregnancies after open maternal–fetal surgery. In addition to the need for cesarean delivery with the index pregnancy after open maternal–fetal surgery, counseling should address the need for cesarean delivery with all future pregnancies similar to that recommended for patients with a prior classical hysterotomy.

### Fetal surgical intervention for myelomeningocele: lessons learned, outcomes, and future implications [^115wjHFN]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fetal myelomeningocele (fMMC) closure (spina bifida aperta) has become a care option for patients that meet inclusion criteria, but it is clear that fetal intervention, while improving outcomes, is not a cure. This review will: (1) focus on the rationale for fMMC surgery based on preclinical studies and observations that laid the foundation for human pilot studies and a randomized controlled trial; (2) summarize important clinical outcomes; (3) discuss the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of recent developments in fetal surgical techniques and approaches; and (4) highlight future research directions. Given the increased risk of maternal and fetal morbidity associated with prenatal intervention, accompanied by the increasing number of centres performing interventions worldwide, teams involved in the care of these patients need to proceed with caution to maintain technical expertise, competency, and patient safety. Ongoing assessment of durability of the benefits of fMMC surgery, as well as additional refinement of patient selection criteria and counselling, is needed to further improve outcomes and reduce the risks to the mother and fetus. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: High-quality prospective studies are needed to broaden the indication for fetal surgery in the general myelomeningocele population. Innovative minimally invasive approaches have had promising results, yet lack comprehensive and robust experimental or clinical evaluation. Important information to help families make informed decisions regarding fetal surgery for myelomeningocele is provided.

### Open fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^112Ms3Fz]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

In a recently completed randomized, prospective clinical trial, fetal repair for myelomeningocele was shown to result in reduced rates of hydrocephalus requiring placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, improvement in Chiari malformation Type II, and improvement in neurological function compared with standard postnatal repair. Successful fetal surgery requires the active participation and interaction of several clinical teams. Each group has a specific role, and overlap is often required at different points of the treatment plan. Extensive multispecialty discussions with the patient and family are necessary before informed consent can be obtained. Fetal surgery carries significant risks to the mother and fetus and these must be carefully considered prior to a final treatment decision. This review will summarize the evaluation and treatment of patients undergoing fetal repair for myelomeningocele at one institution.

### Fetoscopic myelomeningocoele closure: is the scientific evidence enough to challenge the gold standard for prenatal surgery? [^115uSCX5]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the completion of the Management of Myelomeningocoele Study, maternal-fetal surgery for spina bifida has become a valid option for expecting parents. More recently, multiple groups are exploring a minimally invasive approach and recent outcomes have addressed many of the initial concerns with this approach. Based on a previously published framework, we attempt to delineate the developmental stage of the surgical techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the barriers of performing randomized controlled trials comparing two surgical interventions and suggest that data collection through registries is an alternative method to gather high-grade evidence.

### Practice bulletin no. 187: neural tube defects [^116nP4Vc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) — fetal surgery outcomes, eligibility, and risks are detailed. This prospective randomized clinical trial compared standard postnatal repair of myelomeningocele to intrauterine repair and included fetuses between 19 0/7 weeks and 25 6/7 weeks at randomization with a normal karyotype and an upper border of the spina bifida between T1 and S1; a total of 158 patients were randomized and evaluated at 12 months after delivery. In utero spina bifida closure resulted in a lower incidence of the composite outcome of fetal or neonatal death or need for shunt placement by 12 months (68% versus 98%, RR, 0.70; 97.7% CI, 0.58–0.84) and a lower incidence of hindbrain herniation at 12 months (64% versus 96%, RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56–0.81); children who had prenatal surgery were more likely to have a level of function that was two or more levels better than expected and were more likely to be able to walk without devices or orthotics, with no differences between the groups in cognitive test scores. Maternal and obstetric risks include two hysterotomies in the affected pregnancy and, because of uterine rupture risk, that all future pregnancies require cesarean delivery before labor; in the MOMS trial, one half of women who had fetal surgery gave birth before 35 weeks, 11% delivered before 30 weeks, 44% had spontaneous rupture of membranes, 20% had oligohydramnios, more than 11% had partial or complete dehiscence of their hysterotomies, 9% required transfusion at delivery, and 5% developed pulmonary edema. Counseling should be nondirective and include all options with full disclosure of potential benefits and risks, and fetal repair of myelomeningocele should be performed only in an established fetal therapy center with the required expertise, multidisciplinary team, facilities, services, and adequate volume, and should follow standard procedures derived from the MOMS trial.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for myelomeningocele, more specifically with respect to subsequent pregnancy planning, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to ensure the following in subsequent pregnancy planning after prenatal surgical repair of myelomeningocele:

- pre-conception counseling

- appropriate daily oral supplementation with 4.0–5.0 mg folic acid daily starting 3 months before conception and continuing until 12 weeks gestation

- sharing with the parents the risk of uterine rupture, estimated at 11–14% and the associated risk of fetal death of 2–4%

- first-trimester ultrasound neural tube defect screening

- detailed second-trimester ultrasound fetal, uterine, and placental location evaluation because of increased risk of placenta accreta

- counseling that delivery will be by repeat Cesarean delivery because of the risk of uterine rupture (either scheduled at 36 weeks gestation or on an emergency basis between 26 and 37 weeks gestation).

### Fetal surgery [^115hJDzM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Fetal medicine is a super-specialty enterprise and a technology-driven field. The growth and interest in fetal surgery can be largely attributed to advances in fetal imaging and bespoke instruments for in utero intervention. Previously fatal fetal conditions are now being treated using open surgery, minimally invasive procedures, and percutaneous fetal technologies. Several fetal conditions, including myelomeningocele and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, have been tested rigorously in RCTs. However, as the specialty of fetal surgery grows, a robust evidence base with long-term follow-up is obligatory for every procedure. This article offers an overview of fetal surgery and antenatal intervention. As more cutting edge therapies come into clinical practice, growing public opinion and medical ethics will play a significant role in the future of this multidisciplinary specialty.

Maternal-fetal interventions-such as prenatal fetal myelomeningocele (MMC) repair-are at the forefront of clinical innovation within maternal-fetal medicine, pediatric surgery, and neonatology. Many centers determine eligibility for innovative procedures using pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria based on seminal studies, for example, the "Management of Myelomeningocele Study" for prenatal MMC repair. What if a person's clinical presentation does not conform to predetermined criteria for maternal-fetal intervention? Does changing criteria on a case-by-case basis (i.e., ad hoc) constitute an innovation in practice and flexible personalized care or transgression of commonly held standards with potential negative consequences? We outline principle-based, bioethically justified answers to these questions using fetal MMC repair as an example. We pay special attention to the historical origins of inclusion and exclusion criteria, risks and benefits to the pregnant person and the fetus, and team dynamics. We include recommendations for maternal-fetal centers facing these questions.

### Cellular therapy for in utero repair of myelomeningocele-the CuRe trial (CuRe) [^11621bK5]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Therapy for In Utero Repair of Myelomeningocele
- The CuRe Trial ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Spina bifida, or myelomeningocele, is a birth defect that results in paralysis, excess fluid on the brain, and impaired ability to urinate and have bowel movements normally. In a previous study, surgery before birth was shown to reduce the need for shunting for hydrocephalus. There was also some improvement in ambulation, but 58% of the children still could not walk unassisted. This study is testing living stem cells from placenta added to the fetal repair in an effort to improve the ability to walk. Previous animal studies have shown dramatic improvement in walking and bowel and bladder function when placental stem cells are added to MMC repair.

Use of these "living" cells may protect the developing spinal cord, prevent further injury, and may even reverse existing damage to the nerves that control movement. This study is assessing the safety and efficacy of adding stem cells to open fetal surgery for MMC in humans. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies. Inclusion Criteria: Eligibility for fetal surgery per the MOMS trial, which are:

### Fetal myelomeningocele surgery: only treating the tip of the iceberg [^113pk15Y]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Fetal myelomeningocele (fMMC) surgery improves infant outcomes when compared with postnatal surgery. Surgical selection criteria and the option of pregnancy termination, however, limit the number of cases that are eligible for prenatal surgery. We aimed to quantify what proportion of cases could ultimately benefit from fetal therapy.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all cases of fMMC referred to a large tertiary care center over a 10-year period and assessed their eligibility for fetal surgery, pregnancy termination rates, and actual uptake of the surgery.

Results

Of 158 cases, 67 (42%) were ineligible for fetal surgery based on surgical exclusion criteria. Eleven fetuses (7%) had chromosomal anomalies, 10 of which (91%) had other anomalies on ultrasound. Thirty-four patients had a combination of maternal and fetal contraindications. Of the remaining 91 eligible cases (58%), 45 (49%) pregnancies were terminated, leaving only 46 (29% of initial 158 cases) as potential candidates for fetal repair. Actual uptake of fetal surgery was 15% (n = 14 of 91), but this increased after a national program was started.

Conclusion

Only a minority of fMMC cases will ultimately undergo fetal surgery. These numbers support the centralization of care in expert centers.

### Practice bulletin no. 187: neural tube defects [^117GzZxs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) — screening, diagnostic ultrasound, and care planning (Level B) are summarized as follows: Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B), ultrasonography in the second trimester is recommended for all pregnant women; the optimal time for a single ultrasound examination is 18–22 weeks, allowing for confirmation of gestational age and screening for anomalies, including NTDs. Although it is possible to detect some NTDs in the first trimester, the detection rate appears to be much lower than with second-trimester ultrasonography; therefore, a normal first-trimester ultrasound examination should not be substituted for a screening ultrasonography at 18–22 weeks. A patient with a fetus with an NTD should be offered the management options of pregnancy termination, expectant management with neonatal surgical repair, and in utero fetal repair for appropriate candidates. For the patient who elects to continue the pregnancy, genetic evaluation by amniocentesis for chromosomal microarray should be recommended to inform prognosis, management, and candidacy for in utero NTD repair. Pregnant women with an ongoing, nonlethal fetal NTD should be referred to a tertiary center for full spectrum care, including maternal–fetal medicine in collaboration with neonatology, pediatric neurosurgery, and genetics. Delivery of a fetus with nonlethal spina bifida should be planned to occur in a hospital that provides tertiary neonatal care and has personnel capable of managing the spinal defect and any immediate complications.

### Prenatal counseling for myelomeningocele in the era of fetal surgery: a shared decision-making approach [^113kz1YS]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Management of Myelomeningocele Study demonstrated that fetal surgery, as compared to postnatal repair, decreases the rate of hydrocephalus and improves expected motor function. However, fetal surgery is associated with significant maternal and neonatal risks including uterine wall dehiscence, prematurity, and fetal or neonatal death. The goal of this study was to provide information about counseling expectant mothers regarding myelomeningocele in the era of fetal surgery.

Methods

The authors conducted an extensive review of topics pertinent to counseling in the setting of myelomeningocele and introduce a new model for shared decision-making to aid practitioners during counseling.

Results

Expectant mothers must decide in a timely manner among several potential options, namely termination of pregnancy, postnatal surgery, or fetal surgery. Multiple factors influence the decision, including maternal health, fetal heath, financial resources, social support, risk aversion, access to care, family planning, and values. In many cases, it is a difficult decision that benefits from the guidance of a pediatric neurosurgeon.

Conclusions

The authors review critical issues of prenatal counseling for myelomeningocele and discuss the process of shared decision-making as a framework to aid expectant mothers in choosing the treatment option best for them.

### Committee opinion no. 720: maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^114Lp7fu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evidence supporting fetal myelomeningocele repair — randomized trial eligibility, outcomes, risks, and evidence limitations are summarized as follows: Inclusion required a singleton gestation with an upper boundary located between T1 and S1, evidence of hindbrain herniation on fetal magnetic resonance imaging, gestational age between 19 0/7 weeks and 25 6/7 weeks at randomization, and a normal karyotype, and major exclusions included a maternal body mass index of 35 or more. Compared with standard postnatal repair, prenatal surgery reduced the rate of death or cerebrospinal shunt requirement at 12 months of age, decreased the rate of hindbrain herniation at 12 months of age, doubled the rate of independent ambulation at 30 months of age, improved 30-month neuromotor outcomes, and produced a level of function that was more often better than expected according to anatomical levels, but it was associated with higher rates of obstetric and maternal complications including preterm birth, chorion–amnion separation, spontaneous membrane rupture, oligohydramnios, placental abruption, pulmonary edema, maternal transfusion at delivery, and an increased incidence of uterine thinning or dehiscence of the uterine scar at delivery. Long-term follow-up from the trial of children ages 5–8 years is ongoing; a Cochrane review concluded that high-quality data are limited to this single small trial, while a single-center posttrial experience involving 100 cases reported short-term outcomes comparable with the original trial.

### Open fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^114ixT37]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

Despite efforts at prevention through the use of preconception folic acid, spina bifida remains one of the most common congenital anomalies of the central nervous system that is compatible with life. It is, however, associated with a significant degree of lifelong morbidity. The development of open fetal surgery for myelomeningocele (MMC) has been a long process but one that serves as a model for how new procedures and technologies need to be properly evaluated before being brought into mainstream medical practice. Even so, risks and benefits need to be evaluated for each patient. The currently available studies have been carried out on a highly selected patient population where the fetal findings provided the maximum opportunity for benefit from prenatal closure of the MMC defect. There is the potential that as the surgery becomes more widely available, pressure will be brought to bear to perform surgery in cases where the likelihood for benefit is decreased and yet the risks are not. The only way to duplicate the results of the current studies is to follow the methodology and criteria that were used in the studies. This will mean that not every fetus with an MMC will be a candidate for in utero surgery. The balance of risk to benefit will continue to evolve as further technological advances are evaluated and more follow-up information is obtained.

### Lethal pulmonary hypoplasia after in-utero myelomeningocele repair [^112b1aL8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

In-utero surgical repair of fetal myelomeningocele has been performed as a means to improve the postnatal condition of affected infants.

Case

A nulliparous woman underwent in-utero surgical repair of a fetal lumbosacral myelomeningocele at 24 weeks' gestation. Her postoperative convalescence was complicated by pulmonary edema, abdominal pain, chronic oligohydramnios, and preterm labor. The infant was delivered by cesarean at 33 weeks' gestation, but expired from respiratory distress caused by pulmonary hypoplasia at 9 hours of age.

Conclusion

Until the benefits of in-utero repair of fetal myelomeningoceles are determined by well-controlled clinical trials, this technique remains investigational. Physicians and their patients who are considering this procedure must be fully aware of the potential risks that can occur.

### Myelomeningocele including fetal prescription [^116ErR1M]. Pediatrics in Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Myelomeningocele (MMC) is one of the most common birth defects, affecting 0.2 to 0.4 per 1,000 live births in the United States. The most strongly associated risk factor is low folate level in pregnancy. For this reason, 0.4- to 1.0-mg supplementation with folic acid is recommended in all pregnancies, and high-risk pregnancies are recommended to supplement with 4.0 mg of folic acid daily. The mechanism behind the development of MMC is believed to be failure of the caudal end of the neural tube to close during primary neurulation. Screening for MMC is achieved by using α-fetoprotein levels in maternal serum or amniocentesis in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Ultrasonography and fetal magnetic resonance imaging are used to confirm the presence of MMC as well as the location and size of the defect. Based on the results of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study, fetal repair is performed between 23 weeks and 25 weeks and 6 days of gestational age for appropriate candidates. Postnatal repair is more common and is performed 24 to 72 hours after birth. In general, patients with lesions at lower anatomical levels have a better prognosis. Most children with MMC will have neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction that affect the patient's and the caregiver's quality of life. Patients with higher levels of mobility, better familial support, and higher economic status report improved quality of life compared with other patients with MMC.

Abstract

Since the completion of the Management of Myelomeningocoele Study, maternal‐fetal surgery for spina bifida has become a valid option for expecting parents. More recently, multiple groups are exploring a minimally invasive approach and recent outcomes have addressed many of the initial concerns with this approach. Based on a previously published framework, we attempt to delineate the developmental stage of the surgical techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the barriers of performing randomized controlled trials comparing two surgical interventions and suggest that data collection through registries is an alternative method to gather high‐grade evidence.

### Preclinical stem cell therapy in fetuses with myelomeningocele: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115LBLTX]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Myelomeningocele (MMC) is a severe congenital malformation of the central nervous system resulting from an incomplete closure of the neural tube during the third–fourth week of embryonic development. The prevalence of MMC varies greatly among geographical areas ranging from 0.3 to 59.0 cases per 10,000 births.MMC is characterised by the protrusion of the neural placode and its meninges through a malformed vertebral arch and skin defect. The condition can be detected by prenatal ultrasound scan as early as the first trimester; however, the majority of cases are diagnosed during the second trimester (anomaly) ultrasound scan. Apart from preventive therapy using periconceptual vitamins such as folic acid, current management following prenatal diagnosis may include termination of pregnancy, postnatal or more recently fetal surgery. The rationale for fetal repair before birth is that MMC is a 'progressive' condition with cumulative spinal cord functional loss throughout gestation, as demonstrated in clinical and animal studies. Fetal surgery can arrest this deterioration and improve the patients' ability to walk unaided at 30‐month old. However, the benefit of the surgery to bladder function is still under review. Despite these improvements, there are several shortcomings of fetal surgery. Although the number of centres offering fetal surgery for MMC has been increasing, global availability is still limited. Furthermore, fetal surgery is usually performed in the late second trimester, between 23 and 26 weeks' gestation, to reduce the risk of chorioamniotic membrane separation and associated preterm birth. Moreover, fetal surgery is not a cure. When considering patient outcomes at 30‐month‐old age; for example, approximately half of the fetal treated patients have to rely on clean intermittent catheterization to pass urine and more than half cannot walk without the aid of orthosis.

### In utero therapy for spinal muscular atrophy: closer to clinical translation [^116WC2yo]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding maternal-fetal surgical interventions, which have become relatively common in prenatal care, particularly in neural tube defects or diaphragmatic hernia, there might be uncertainty in predicting the seriousness of disease severity and its consequences; this makes discussions around treatment choices difficult and complex. Gene therapy and genome editing carry the additional risk of the therapeutic vector crossing the placental barrier and causing maternal genotoxic damage or an immune response, or even maternal genome editing. Potential risks to the mother from gene therapy thus include insertional mutagenesis. Studies in mice have shown no evidence of maternal genome editing after in utero CRISPR nuclease delivery. Germline modification following genetic therapy to the fetus would be an additional risk to future generations, and it would have to be assessed in suitable animal models.

Maternal–fetal surgery, gene therapy or pharmacological intervention can save the life of a fetus that would otherwise die but may result in a child with severe disabilities. One could argue against investing medical and financial resources for sub-optimal treatment. IUT can also raise ethical issues regarding the role of healthcare professionals in relation to maternal decision-making and the fetus' life. In a case of prenatal diagnosis of myelomeningocele, the parents decided to refuse resuscitation measures of a 25-week fetus if emergency delivery was necessary during the open uterine procedure. The pressure to intervene, for instance in the case of SMA, could be increased by the rapid evolution of disease. If IUT were to be carried out in SMA fetuses, it would be imperative for healthcare professionals to carefully navigate this delicate environment by engaging in meaningful discussions with parents, weighing the potential risks and benefits of various treatment options, respecting parental autonomy while safeguarding the best interests of the fetus/child and clinical obligations. Prenatal decision-making is therefore complex, emphasizing the need for early engagement and counselling, and it is crucial that informed decisions be made in a supportive environment. In the US, the FDA has special requirements for investigational testing of drugs in a pregnant woman, whether directed to the mother or the fetus as referred to in FDA 45 CFR 46: 'subpart B — additional protections for pregnant women, human fetuses and neonates involved in research'. The European Medicines Agency also has a policy for investigational drugs in pregnant women. In all cases, surveillance should follow, and efficacy and safety information from studies with predefined outcomes should be collected. Adverse outcome data of fetal exposure comprise both structural malformations that may be detected at birth or in early childhood, and non-structural or long-term functional effects that can be potentially important but also difficult to detect or define. Most of these guidelines were developed in relation to classic pharmacological compounds. However, the recent booming of advanced therapies has created a thin red line between experimental research success and the possibility of application in a translational way to clinical use.

### Fetal surgery for myelomeningocele: progress and perspectives [^114JXyPM]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Myelomeningocele (MMC), one of the most common congenital malformations, can result in severe lifelong disabilities, including paraplegia, hydrocephalus, Chiari II malformation, bowel and bladder dysfunction, skeletal deformations, and neurocognitive impairment. Experimental studies provide compelling evidence that the neurological deficits associated with MMC are not simply caused by incomplete neurulation but rather by the prolonged exposure of the vulnerable neural elements to the intrauterine environment. MMC is the first non-lethal anomaly considered for fetal surgical intervention, necessitating a careful analysis of risks and benefits. Retrospective and prospective randomized studies suggest that fetal surgery of MMC before 26 weeks of gestation may preserve neuromotor function, reverse hindbrain herniation, and reduce the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting. However, these studies also demonstrate that fetal surgery is associated with significant maternal and fetal risks. Consequently, additional research is necessary to further elucidate the pathophysiology of MMC, to define the ideal timing and technique of fetal closure, and to evaluate the long-term implications of prenatal intervention.

### A study to assess global availability of fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^116QWEgK]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To establish the provision of fetal surgery for myelomeningocele (MMC) worldwide.

Methods

Through the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD) Fetal Therapy Special Interest Group and the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet), fetal therapy centres were surveyed (September 2017-June 2018) regarding availability of fetal MMC surgical repair, patient inclusion criteria, repair techniques, number of cases, and outcome reporting. Responses were summarised on an interactive map on the ISPD website.

Results

Forty-four of 59 centres responded (74.6%) of which 34 centres (77.1%) currently offered fetal surgery for MMC and seven centres (15.9%) were awaiting a first case after service set up. Patient inclusion criteria were similar and based on the Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) trial. Five centres (14.7%) operated beyond 26 weeks' gestational age, outside the MOMS criteria. Open fetal surgery was provided in 23 centres (67.6%), fetoscopic surgery only in five (14.7%), and six centres offered both types (17.6%). Neurosurgical closure was similar for open surgery but highly variable in fetoscopy surgery. The median number of cases per centre was 21 (range 1–253).

Conclusions

Fetal surgery for MMC is now offered globally. Two thirds of centres offer open repair via hysterotomy using criteria based on the MOMS trial.

### Anesthesia for in utero repair of myelomeningocele [^1156iEQ2]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Recently published results suggest that prenatal repair of fetal myelomeningocele is a potentially preferable alternative when compared to postnatal repair. In this article, the pathology of myelomeningocele, unique physiologic considerations, perioperative anesthetic management, and ethical considerations of open fetal surgery for prenatal myelomeningocele repair are discussed. Open fetal surgeries have many unique anesthetic issues such as inducing profound uterine relaxation, vigilance for maternal or fetal blood loss, fetal monitoring, and possible fetal resuscitation. Postoperative management, including the requirement for postoperative tocolysis and maternal analgesia, are also reviewed. The success of intrauterine myelomeningocele repair relies on a well-coordinated multidisciplinary approach. Fetal surgery is an important topic for anesthesiologists to understand, as the number of fetal procedures is likely to increase as new fetal treatment centers are opened across the United States.

### A comprehensive ethical framework for fetal research and its application to fetal surgery for spina bifida [^114Z8nmD]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The transition from innovation to standard of care for fetal surgery should be guided by ethical considerations. We provide an ethical framework that identifies criteria for the investigation of fetal surgery. This framework addresses the initiation and assessment of clinical trials to determine whether they establish a standard of care, describes an appropriate informed consent process, considers whether selection criteria should include the abortion preferences of the pregnant woman, and considers whether physicians have an obligation to offer referral to such investigation. This ethical framework, in a clinically comprehensive fashion, takes account of the physician's obligations to the fetal patient, the pregnant woman, and future fetal and pregnant patients. We apply this framework to clinical investigations of fetal surgery for spina bifida.

### The history of fetal therapy [^1148MHpe]. American Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

The Fetal Treatment Center founded by Michael Harrison is credited as the birthplace of fetal surgery. His trainees in pediatric surgery subsequently founded fetal centers throughout the United States. In Europe, the advent of minimally invasive fetal surgical techniques led to the establishment of treatment centers led predominantly by perinatologists. More recently, perinatologists in North America have begun to play a greater role in the field of fetal intervention. Intrauterine transfusion for the treatment of hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn was the first successful fetal intervention. Although not subjected to the rigors of clinical trials, this treatment has withstood the test of time. Interventions for other fetal disease states such as twin-twin transfusion and repair of fetal myelomeningocele were investigated in animal models followed by randomized clinical trials before widespread adoption. Tracheal occlusion for diaphragmatic hernia is still currently being investigated as the next promising step in fetal intervention.

### The management of myelomeningocele study: full cohort 30-month pediatric outcomes [^117UXShP]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports from the Management of Myelomeningocele Study demonstrated that prenatal repair of myelomeningocele reduces hindbrain herniation and the need for cerebrospinal fluid shunting, and improves motor function in children with myelomeningocele. The trial was stopped for efficacy after 183 patients were randomized, but 30-month outcomes were only available at the time of initial publication in 134 mother-child dyads. Data from the complete cohort for the 30-month outcomes are presented here. Maternal and 12-month neurodevelopmental outcomes for the full cohort were reported previously.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to report the 30-month outcomes for the full cohort of patients randomized to either prenatal or postnatal repair of myelomeningocele in the original Management of Myelomeningocele Study.

Study Design

Eligible women were randomly assigned to undergo standard postnatal repair or prenatal repair < 26 weeks gestation. We evaluated a composite of mental development and motor function outcome at 30 months for all enrolled patients as well as independent ambulation and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition. We assessed whether there was a differential effect of prenatal surgery in subgroups defined by: fetal leg movements, ventricle size, presence of hindbrain herniation, gender, and location of the myelomeningocele lesion. Within the prenatal surgery group only, we evaluated these and other baseline parameters as predictors of 30-month motor and cognitive outcomes. We evaluated whether presence or absence of a shunt at 1 year was associated with 30-month motor outcomes.

Results

The data for the full cohort of 183 patients corroborate the original findings of Management of Myelomeningocele Study, confirming that prenatal repair improves the primary outcome composite score of mental development and motor function (199.4 ± 80.5 vs 166.7 ± 76.7, P = 0.004). Prenatal surgery also resulted in improvement in the secondary outcomes of independent ambulation (44.8% vs 23.9%, P = 0.004), WeeFIM self-care score (20.8 vs 19.0, P = 0.006), functional level at least 2 better than anatomic level (26.4% vs 11.4%, P = 0.02), and mean Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition, psychomotor development index (17.3% vs 15.1%, P = 0.03), but does not affect cognitive development at 30 months. On subgroup analysis, there was a nominally significant interaction between gender and surgery, with boys demonstrating better improvement in functional level and psychomotor development index. For patients receiving prenatal surgery, the presence of in utero ankle, knee, and hip movement, absence of a sac over the lesion and a myelomeningocele lesion of ≤ L3 were significantly associated with independent ambulation. Postnatal motor function showed no correlation with either prenatal ventricular size or postnatal shunt placement.

Conclusion

The full cohort data of 30-month cognitive development and motor function outcomes validate in utero surgical repair as an effective treatment for fetuses with myelomeningocele. Current data suggest that outcomes related to the need for shunting should be counseled separately from the outcomes related to distal neurologic functioning.

### NCT02230072 | Fetoscopic meningomyelocele repair study… [^116hRZXD]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

- Whether the minimally invasive technique results in an acceptable fetal outcome as defined by reversal of the Chiari II malformation, a reduced need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting or other procedures to avoid or treat hydrocephalus, and complete closure of the spinal defect with protection of the placode. In addition the procedure will be assessed as to whether it prevents loss of neurological level during intra-uterine life. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the maternal and fetal outcomes of a new technique for the fetoscopic repair of fetal MMC at Texas Children's Hospital Pavilion for Women. The investigators hypothesis is that this minimally invasive technique is feasible, and that this approach will have the same efficacy as open fetal surgery for MMC, but with significantly less maternal-fetal risk. Both mother and baby will benefit from the surgery. The fetus will have a repaired MMC defect, and the mother will not have a uterine incision.

A hysterotomy increases the risk of uterine rupture and requires that all subsequent deliveries are by cesarean section. There may also be a decreased risk of Pre-term Premature Rupture Of Membranes and prematurity when compared with the current open operation. Finally, a vaginal delivery is possible following the fetoscopic fetal surgery if the baby is shown to have a skin covered repair. Detailed Description.
- The majority of MMCs can be diagnosed between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation. MMC is associated with Chiari II malformation, which includes a constellation of anomalies such as hindbrain herniation, brainstem abnormalities, low-lying venous sinuses and a small posterior fossa. The Chiari II malformation can have deleterious effects on motor, cranial nerve and cognitive functions. Postnatally most MMC patients develop hydrocephalus and require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

Shunts require lifelong monitoring and have a high failure rate due to infection, obstruction, and fracture. Based on this hypothesis, open fetal surgical repair of MMC was proposed, and the recent publication of the NICHD sponsored randomized controlled trial demonstrated clear neonatal benefit of open in-utero fetal surgical repair of MMC. The study showed a reduction in the incidence of hydrocephalus and in the radiographic severity of hindbrain herniation. The reason for the increased incidence of these complications is related to the nature of the open fetal procedure, which involves a multi-faceted invasive approach including maternal laparotomy, large hysterotomy with uterine edge stapling, and open fetal repair of the spina bifida defect that may involve manipulation and exposure of the fetus for a significant amount of time.

Fetoscopy offers a less invasive therapeutic option that could reduce a number of the morbidities related to open fetal procedures. This fetoscopy technique has evolved over time to a 2-port technique developed by our team in Houston, Texas and its feasibility and applicability to the human uterus and fetus have been demonstrated and published and demonstrate an improved degree of flexibility in terms of access to the fetus regardless of placental location. The technique is designed to decrease the maternal risks of open uterus fetal surgery while maintaining a similar level of fetal benefit as seen in the MOMS trial. In addition, our technique allows improved access to the fetus in anterior placentation, ability to manipulate and maintain the fetus in the required position, and optimal port placement resulting from the exteriorized maternal uterus.

### Toward the ethical evaluation and use of maternal-fetal surgery [^112RaHUr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Important clinical, social, and ethical questions are associated with the evaluation and use of surgical approaches aimed at correcting fetal anatomic abnormalities. In particular, the expansion of maternal-fetal surgery to ameliorate nonlethal fetal conditions has intensified the need to address issues about the adequacy of technology assessment and the safety of those who undergo these novel procedures.

Approach

After discussions at a multidisciplinary conference, we reviewed the development and current practices of maternal-fetal surgery and analyzed the relevant ethical issues concerning the use of maternal-fetal surgery for nonlethal conditions, focusing on the correction of myelomeningocele.

Findings

Characterizing nonvalidated maternal-fetal surgery procedures as "innovative therapy" blurs the boundaries between research and therapy and creates uncertainty about the obligations of clinicians and researchers. Further, maternal-fetal surgery raises ethical issues related to maternal risks and benefits, informed consent, distinguishing lethal from nonlethal conditions, withholding unproven treatments, entrepreneurship, and prioritization.

Recommendations

To help ensure that maternal-fetal surgery will be studied and eventually applied in a scientifically and ethically sound manner, we offer several recommendations. First, innovation in maternal-fetal surgery should be conducted and evaluated as research. Second, women must be considered research subjects in these trials. Third, the informed consent process must ensure adequate comprehension and genuine voluntariness in those considering participation. Fourth, discriminatory and fearful attitudes toward individuals with disabilities should be addressed explicitly prior to making a decision to proceed with maternal-fetal surgery in an attempt to correct such disabilities. Fifth, maternal-fetal surgery should not be performed for cosmetic indications unless and until there is reliable evidence that maternal-fetal surgery can be performed safely and that long-term side effects on women and their offspring are minimal. Sixth, centers of excellence should be established for conducting research and providing maternal-fetal surgery. Seventh, funding for research on maternal-fetal surgery should be considered in the context of societal needs.

### Committee opinion no. 720: maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^112yz2xV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Management of myelomeningocele study trial outcomes — prenatal versus postnatal surgery — report the following: ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement was 31/78 (40%) after prenatal surgery versus 66/80 (82%) after postnatal surgery, relative risk 0.48 (0.36–0.64), P < .001; death or ventriculoperitoneal shunt (12 months of age) occurred in 53/78 (68%) versus 78/80 (98%), relative risk 0.70 (0.58–0.84), P < .001; hindbrain herniation (12 months) was 45/70 (64%) versus 66/69 (96%), relative risk 0.67 (0.56–0.81), P < .001; walking independently (30 months) was 26/62 (42%) versus 14/67 (21%), relative risk 2.01 (1.16–3.48), P .01; preterm birth (< 37 weeks) occurred in 62/78 (80%) versus 12/80 (15%), P < .001; pulmonary edema occurred in 5/78 (6.4%) versus 0/80, P .03; oligohydramnios occurred in 16/78 (20.5%) versus 3/80 (3.8%), relative risk 5.47 (1.66–18.04), P .001; spontaneous membrane rupture was 36/78 (46%) versus 6/80 (8%), relative risk 6.15 (2.75–13.78), P < .001; and transfusion at delivery occurred in 7/78 (9.0%) versus 1/80 (1.3%), relative risk 7.18 (0.90–57.01), P .03. A footnote specifies that a total of 183 women were randomized and that the primary outcome was reported on 158 children at 12 months of age and 134 children at 30 months of age.

### Global policy and practice for intrauterine fetal resuscitation during fetal surgery for open spina bifida repair [^114k4mvE]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Globally accepted evidence-based practice for fetal closure of open spina bifida recommends that a woman should be between 19 weeks and 25 weeks plus 6 days of pregnancy to be eligible for fetal surgery, with only a few centers performing surgery beyond this date and up to 31 weeks of gestation. A fetus requiring emergency delivery during surgery is therefore considered viable and thus eligible for resuscitation; however, clinical practice is apparently geographically dependent and may vary according to legal definitions in the relevant country. In the UK and US, guidelines recommend that active resuscitation is considered from 22 weeks of gestation if the neonate displays signs of life. There is wide variation across Europe, and prior to 26 weeks of gestation, treatment may be active, minimal interventions only, palliative, or requiring parental consent. It is unclear whether neonatal resuscitation guidelines in each country apply to infants with a serious congenital anomaly, who, in addition, experience serious fetal distress and eventually are delivered alive after a decision by the clinical team to expedite delivery during fetal surgery. It is also unknown how this scenario is addressed by parents who travel across country borders for fetal surgery. This study therefore aims to assess current policy and practice for both fetal resuscitation during fetal surgery and neonatal resuscitation after emergency delivery during fetal surgery, in fetal centers undertaking this surgery across the world.

### A randomized trial of prenatal versus postnatal repair of myelomeningocele [^112FgZ57]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Prenatal repair of myelomeningocele, the most common form of spina bifida, may result in better neurologic function than repair deferred until after delivery. We compared outcomes of in utero repair with standard postnatal repair.

Methods

We randomly assigned eligible women to undergo either prenatal surgery before 26 weeks of gestation or standard postnatal repair. One primary outcome was a composite of fetal or neonatal death or the need for placement of a cerebrospinal fluid shunt by the age of 12 months. Another primary outcome at 30 months was a composite of mental development and motor function.

Results

The trial was stopped for efficacy of prenatal surgery after the recruitment of 183 of a planned 200 patients. This report is based on results in 158 patients whose children were evaluated at 12 months. The first primary outcome occurred in 68% of the infants in the prenatal-surgery group and in 98% of those in the postnatal-surgery group (relative risk, 0.70; 97.7% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.84; P < 0.001). Actual rates of shunt placement were 40% in the prenatal-surgery group and 82% in the postnatal-surgery group (relative risk, 0.48; 97.7% CI, 0.36 to 0.64; P < 0.001). Prenatal surgery also resulted in improvement in the composite score for mental development and motor function at 30 months (P = 0.007) and in improvement in several secondary outcomes, including hindbrain herniation by 12 months and ambulation by 30 months. However, prenatal surgery was associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and uterine dehiscence at delivery.

Conclusions

Prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele reduced the need for shunting and improved motor outcomes at 30 months but was associated with maternal and fetal risks. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00060606.).

### Reproductive outcomes following open maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele closure: analysis of MOMS trial participants [^116CEAMV]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In utero closure of myelomeningocele has become an accepted alternative in the management of prenatally diagnosed spina bifida. Maternal reproductive risk has been previously described based on registry data and institutional outcomes. Here we aim to provide maternal reproductive outcomes from participants in the Management of Myelomeningocele Study.

Objective

Open maternal fetal surgery (OMFS) for in utero closure of myelomeningocele (MMC) is associated with childhood benefit through school age, however obstetric and maternal reproductive risk are also factors to consider. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate reproductive outcomes after OMFS compared to standard postnatal MMC closure.

Study Design

The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) was a randomized trial comparing prenatal versus postnatal closure of MMC. Women in the prenatal closure arm underwent OMFS at 21–26 weeks and were delivered by cesarean at 37 weeks if not delivered prior to that. In the postnatal closure arm, cesarean delivery was performed at 37 weeks and neonates underwent surgical closure soon after birth. Families returned for follow-up at 30 months and again at school age between 6–10 years. Maternal reproductive questionnaires were administered at the time of the follow-up visits to assess menstruation, fertility, gynecologic issues, and subsequent pregnancy outcomes. We compared continuous variables using the Wilcoxon test and categorical variables using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.

Results

174 randomized women (86 in the prenatal closure group and 88 in the postnatal closure group) completed reproductive questionnaires with 91 women reporting no subsequent pregnancies since MOMS. 36 women in the prenatal closure group reported 60 subsequent, of which 45 (75%) progressed ≥ 20 weeks. 43 women in the postnatal closure group reported 71 pregnancies, of which 50 (70%) progressed ≥ 20 weeks. The prenatal closure group was more likely to deliver < 37 weeks (p < 0.001). One uterine rupture (2.2%) and two uterine dehiscence cases (4.4%) were reported among the prenatal closure group; none in the postnatal closure group (p < 0.001). Use of fertility treatments or gynecologic surgeries were not different between the groups.

Conclusions

Preterm delivery was more common in subsequent pregnancies after OMFS. The risk for uterine rupture and dehiscence in the prenatal group was higher than the postnatal group, but lower than what has been previously reported with OMFS. Reproductive outcomes were otherwise similar between women undergoing OMFS for MMC closure compared to the postnatal closure group in the MOMS trial.

### Prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele and the need for cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement [^116DvYkq]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Object

The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) was a multicenter randomized trial comparing the safety and efficacy of prenatal and postnatal closure of myelomeningocele. The trial was stopped early because of the demonstrated efficacy of prenatal surgery, and outcomes on 158 of 183 pregnancies were reported. Here, the authors update the 1-year outcomes for the complete trial, analyze the primary and related outcomes, and evaluate whether specific prerandomization risk factors are associated with prenatal surgery benefit.

Methods

The primary outcome was a composite of fetal loss or any of the following: infant death, CSF shunt placement, or meeting the prespecified criteria for shunt placement. Primary outcome, actual shunt placement, and shunt revision rates for prenatal versus postnatal repair were compared. The shunt criteria were reassessed to determine which were most concordant with practice, and a new composite outcome was created from the primary outcome by replacing the original criteria for CSF shunt placement with the revised criteria. The authors used logistic regression to estimate whether there were interactions between the type of surgery and known prenatal risk factors (lesion level, gestational age, degree of hindbrain herniation, and ventricle size) for shunt placement, and to determine which factors were associated with shunting among those infants who underwent prenatal surgery.

Results

Ninety-one women were randomized to prenatal surgery and 92 to postnatal repair. The primary outcome occurred in 73% of infants in the prenatal surgery group and in 98% in the postnatal group (p < 0.0001). Actual rates of shunt placement were only 44% and 84% in the 2 groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). The authors revised the most commonly met criterion to require overt clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure, defined as split sutures, bulging fontanelle, or sunsetting eyes, in addition to increasing head circumference or hydrocephalus. Using these modified criteria, only 3 patients in each group met criteria but did not receive a shunt. For the revised composite outcome, there was a difference between the prenatal and postnatal surgery groups: 49.5% versus 87.0% (p < 0.0001). There was also a significant reduction in the number of children who had a shunt placed and then required a revision by 1 year of age in the prenatal group (15.4% vs 40.2%, relative risk 0.38 [95% CI 0.22–0.66]). In the prenatal surgery group, 20% of those with ventricle size < 10 mm at initial screening, 45.2% with ventricle size of 10 up to 15 mm, and 79.0% with ventricle size ≥ 15 mm received a shunt, whereas in the postnatal group, 79.4%, 86.0%, and 87.5%, respectively, received a shunt (p = 0.02). Lesion level and degree of hindbrain herniation appeared to have no effect on the eventual need for shunting (p = 0.19 and p = 0.13, respectively). Similar results were obtained for the revised outcome.

Conclusions

Larger ventricles at initial screening are associated with an increased need for shunting among those undergoing fetal surgery for myelomeningocele. During prenatal counseling, care should be exercised in recommending prenatal surgery when the ventricles are 15 mm or larger because prenatal surgery does not appear to improve outcome in this group. The revised criteria may be useful as guidelines for treating hydrocephalus in this group.

### In utero repair of spina bifida [^1112nXvp]. American Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Open spina bifida or myelomeningocele (MMC) is the most common congenital malformation of the central nervous system compatible with long-term survival and is associated with significant lifelong disabilities. Postnatal care of MMC involves covering the exposed spinal cord, infection prevention, and ventricular shunting for hydrocephalus. The aim of postnatal MMC surgery is not to reverse or prevent the neurologic injury seen in MMC, but to palliate. The neurologic defects result from primary incomplete neurulation and secondary chronic in utero damage to the exposed neural elements through mechanical and chemical trauma-the two-hit hypothesis. With the ability to accurately diagnose spina bifida prenatally and the concept of the two-hit hypothesis, in utero repair to decrease exposure and alter the antenatal course of neurologic destruction was conceived. Through animal models and human pilot studies, the feasibility of fetal spina bifida repair was demonstrated. Subsequently, the prospective randomized multicenter Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS trial) revealed a decreased need for shunting, reversal of hindbrain herniation, and preservation of neurologic function, making in utero repair an accepted care alternative for select women carrying a fetus with spina bifida. This article will highlight the background and rationale for in utero repair, and the progression to becoming an alternative standard of care. The future directions of fetal spina bifida repair will also be addressed.

### Fetal myelomeningocele repair: urologic aspects [^114Tf78j]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The notion that earlier surgical correction of congenital anomalies will lead to improved outcomes permeates throughout surgical literature. This review critically assesses some of the urologic evaluations in patients who have undergone fetal repair of their myelomeningoceles.

Recent Findings

Thus far, there are limited data to determine the effects of such a repair with respect to urologic outcome. Early data, though, have suggested that improvements are being noted in a cohort of patients who have undergone fetal repair of their myelomeningocele with respect to neurodevelopmental outcome and lower extremity neuromotor function.

Summary

What remains to be seen is whether fetal surgery and the noted changes translate into long-term improvement. The efforts being put forth to critically assess the outcomes of such surgery are laudable and yet the end analysis may still leave the question unanswered.

### Attitudes of maternal-fetal specialists concerning maternal-fetal surgery [^112R3gMh]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

We examined the attitudes of members of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine regarding the clinical, scientific, ethical, and policy issues in maternal-fetal surgery.

Study Design

A 43-question survey was distributed to all members of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Two mailings and one electronic mail reminder were sent, each with instructions to submit the survey either via US mail or the Internet. The survey included questions in six categories: physician demographic data, experience with maternal-fetal surgery, views on innovative therapies, scientific validation of currently used and proposed procedures, ethical issues, and future directions in public policy.

Results

Of the 1639 United States members sent questionnaires, 943 replied (response rate = 59%). Forty-seven percent had referred patients for open fetal surgery for nonlethal conditions, and 69% believed physicians were obligated to inform patients of this option. Seventy-eight percent believed that innovative therapies should be performed only under institutional review board-approved protocols. Although the majority of respondents believed that certain proposed benefits of open fetal surgery for myelomeningocele could offset the risks, the majority (56%) also indicated that the procedure has not been validated. Fifty-seven percent believed that a moratorium should be imposed on open fetal surgery for nonlethal conditions, such as myelomeningocele, until a multicenter-controlled clinical trial is completed.

Conclusions

The use of maternal-fetal surgery for nonlethal conditions is highly controversial. The majority of maternal-fetal specialists we surveyed support further research before such procedures are integrated into clinical practice.

### Fetoscopic myelomeningocoele closure: is the scientific evidence enough to challenge the gold standard for prenatal surgery? [^113LwUbV]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSION

Maternal‐fetal surgery has become a widespread treatment option for fetuses with a spina bifida. In pursuit of minimizing maternal risks, fetoscopic techniques are being explored. We have discussed that these inventions have progressed from an experimental to an innovative stage, albeit that the optimal fetoscopic approach has not been determined. Nevertheless, the promising results created an expansion of centers offering such interventions, resulting in fragmentation of surgical experience and the publication of outcomes. Although an RCT is generally considered the highest level of evidence to evaluate the effects of any treatment, we foresee major difficulties organizing such a study for this indication. We propose that gathering data from high‐quality international registries with standardized outcomes and long‐term follow‐up could be a valuable alternative. Yet, until we are able to establish superiority of a fetoscopic approach, we cannot entirely discard the necessity of an RCT. In the absence of high‐quality evidence, we emphasize the importance of careful and balanced in‐depth counselling taking in consideration individual risks and benefits for every patient.

### Fetal myelomeningocele repair: short-term clinical outcomes [^112UAb1J]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The study was undertaken to evaluate short-term clinical outcomes with antenatal myelomeningocele (MMC) repair.

Study Design

Retrospective review of 50 fetuses that underwent open fetal MMC closure was performed. Inclusion criteria included less than 26 weeks' gestation, thoracic to S1 level defect, absent clubfoot deformity, Arnold-Chiari malformation, ventriculomegaly less than 17 mm, normal karyotype, and no other anomalies.

Results

Perinatal survival was 94% (47/50 fetuses). Mean age at delivery was 34 weeks 3 days. All fetuses demonstrated reversal of hindbrain herniation. Forty-three percent of the 50 fetuses have required ventriculoperitoneal shunting compared with 100% thoracic, 88% lumbar, and 68% sacral (85% overall) in 297 historic controls. Better-than-predicted leg function was seen in 57% of thoracic and lumbar level lesion patients.

Conclusion

Early experience with fetal MMC repair suggests a decreased need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting, arrest or slowing of progressive ventriculomegaly, and consistent resolution of hindbrain herniation. However, further long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate neurodevelopment and bladder and bowel function.

Myelomeningocele (MM) clinical care needs and practice variation — Children with MM require surgical intervention at birth to close the spinal defect, yet many infants born in third world countries lack access to appropriate medical care, and most infants with MM have hydrocephalus and require surgical treatment. There is currently little agreement among leading practitioners about the optimal timing of closure, with differences in team approach, closure techniques, administration of antibiotics, and whether to amputate or preserve the neural placode; in utero closure has been advocated by many experts, but its long-term positive and negative effects have not been well studied.

### Contemporary management and outcome of myelomeningocele: the rotterdam experience [^114UcX7c]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Myelomeningocele (MMC) is the most common form of spina bifida, with a lifelong impact on the quality of life for infants born with this condition. In recent decades, fetal surgery has evolved from an experimental therapy to standard of care for many centers in the world. In this study, the authors aimed to provide an overview of the current management and outcomes for infants with MMC managed at their institution. This then provides a center-specific historical cohort for comparison with future antenatal-treated MMC cases.

Methods

This is a retrospective, single-institution cohort study including all consecutive MMC cases between January 1, 2000, and June 1, 2018, at Erasmus MC. Outcome data included closure of the defect (location, timing, and surgical parameters), hydrocephalus management, Chiari malformation type II (CMTII) management, incidence of spinal cord tethering and outcome, motor outcomes, and continence.

Results

A total of 93 patients were included with predominantly lumbosacral lesions. Two patients died during follow-up. Hydrocephalus was present in 84%, with a 71% ventriculoperitoneal shunt reoperation rate. Surgery was performed in 12% for a tethered spinal cord at a mean age of 8 years. Decompression surgery was performed in 3 patients for CMTII. Special education in 63% was significantly associated with hydrocephalus (p < 0.015). Nineteen percent of patients were able to walk independently, and 47% were nonambulators. Social continence for urine was obtained in 75% of patients, 4% had fecal incontinence.

Conclusions

This study provides an overview of current MMC outcomes at the authors' center and will serve as a historical cohort for comparison with future fetal surgery cases operated on at the center in the coming years. Apart from a relatively low surgical untethering rate, the authors' outcome data are comparable to those in the literature. Hydrocephalus is highly prevalent in postnatally treated MMC patients; in this study as in much of the literature, hydrocephalus is correlated with a low cognitive function. Fetal surgery for MMC halves the need for shunt treatment in a select group of MMC pregnancies, constituting a major indication for us to undergo the transition to a fetal surgery center. The fetal benefits of open antenatal surgery for MMC are well established, yet long-term data on especially tethered spinal cord are eagerly awaited.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) — delivery planning and fetal surgery counseling (Level C) emphasize that, based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C), because it is not clear whether or how significantly the neurologic outcome is affected by the method of delivery, decisions about the timing and route of delivery should be made individually in consultation with personnel with experience and knowledge of NTDs. Despite maternal and obstetric risks, in utero repair is an option for women who meet appropriate criteria; counseling should be nondirective and include all options, with full disclosure of all potential benefits and risks for the fetus and woman, including implications for future pregnancies.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on the incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus in infants with myelomeningocele after prenatal versus postnatal repair [^115MivsT]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Myelomeningocele (MM) is a condition that is responsible for considerable morbidity in the pediatric population. A significant proportion of the morbidity related to MM is attributable to hydrocephalus and the surgical management thereof. Postnatal repair remains the most common form of treatment; however, increased rates of prenatal diagnosis, advances in fetal surgery, and a hypothesis that neural injury continues in utero until the MM defect is repaired have led to the development and evaluation of prenatal surgery as a means to improve outcomes in afflicted infants.

Objective

The objective of this guideline is to systematically evaluate the literature to determine whether there is a difference in the proportion of patients who develop shunt-dependent hydrocephalus in infants who underwent prenatal MM repair compared to infants who had postnatal repair.

Methods

The Guidelines Task Force developed search terms and strategies used to search PubMed and Embase for relevant literature published between 1966 and September 2016. Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to screen abstracts and to develop a list of relevant articles for full-text review. Full-text articles were then reviewed, and when appropriate, included as evidence.

Results

A total of 87 abstracts were identified and reviewed by 3 independent reviewers. Thirty-nine full-text articles were selected for analysis. Three studies met selection criteria and were included in the evidence table.

Conclusion

Class I evidence from 1 study and class III evidence from 2 studies suggest that, in comparison to postnatal repair, prenatal surgery for MM reduces the risk of developing shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. Therefore, prenatal repair of MM is recommended for those fetuses who meet specific criteria for prenatal surgery to reduce the risk of developing shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (level I). Differences between prenatal and postnatal repair with respect to the requirement for permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion should be considered alongside other relevant maternal and fetal factors when deciding upon a preferred method of MM closure.

Randomization

According to the included literature, achieving randomization can be especially challenging in MFS trials for the following reasons.

The biggest challenge to randomization identified by the literature is difficulties in recruitment. Randomized controlled trials require a large number of participants, whereas achieving a sizable sample has been proven challenging for MFS trials. For example, the MOMS trial and the TOTAL trial took longer than expected due to slow recruitment, and the PLUTO trial was interrupted due to lack of participants. Difficulties in recruitment are themselves a result of several factors. Included publications noted that these conditions are rare,– and often diagnosed only after birth.MFS trials have strict inclusion criteria, necessary to protect participants, but that further reduce the number of potential participants. On top of that, many parents choose termination of pregnancy. Another issue is that physicians and patients have their own personal conviction on whether prenatal or postnatal treatment is best. For example, Morris et al. found that women were reluctant to participate in the PLUTO trial either because they were pessimistic about the benefit of the surgery or because they wanted the prenatal surgery and they were unwilling to accept randomization, i.e. the possibility of being placed in the standard treatment group. Further, Chescheir and D'Alton reported that many clinicians did not refer eligible participants for prenatal closure of myelomeningocele because they were unaware of the MOMS trial.

A second challenge to randomization reported in the literature are difficulties in standardization. Standardization is necessary but also challenging because each patient's anatomy, physiology, and intraoperative course is unique, and because different countries have different standards of treatment. Another problem is the complexity of the conditions targeted by MFS trials. As Lally and Skarsgard explained "For a complex condition like CDH, which requires highly integrated multidisciplinary care (including surgery), the RCT, which generally targets one intervention at a time, is poorly suited to the creation of generalizable evidence which can be widely and safely implemented outside of the constrained trial environment". p.130] This means that MFS requires specialized multidisciplinary care that is not available in all hospitals. Finally, practical issues, such as the high costs of randomized controlled trials, or lack of support for international collaborations, might also hinder randomization.

### Minimally invasive fetal surgery for myelomeningocele: preliminary report from a single center [^113dtknD]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent trials have shown the safety and benefits of fetoscopic treatment of myelomeningocele (MMC). The authors' aim was to report their preliminary results of prenatal fetoscopic treatment of MMC using a biocellulose patch, focusing on neurological outcomes, fetal and maternal complications, neonatal CSF leakage, postnatal hydrocephalus, and radiological outcomes.

Methods

Preoperative assessment included clinical examination, ultrasound imaging, and MRI of the fetus. Patients underwent purely fetoscopic in utero MMC repair, followed by postoperative in utero and postnatal MRI. All participants received multidisciplinary follow-up.

Results

Five pregnant women carrying fetuses affected by MMC signed informed consent for the fetoscopic treatment of the defect. The mean MMC size was 30.4 mm (range 19–49 mm). Defect locations were L1 (2 cases), L5 (2 cases), and L4 (1 case). Hindbrain herniation and ventriculomegaly were documented in all cases. The mean gestational age at surgery was 28.2 weeks (range 27.8–28.8 weeks). Fetoscopic repair was performed in all cases. The mean gestational age at delivery was 33.9 weeks (range 29.3–37.4 weeks). After surgery, reversal of hindbrain herniation was documented in all cases. Three newborns developed signs of hydrocephalus requiring CSF diversion. Neurological outcomes in terms of motor level were favorable in all cases, but a premature newborn died due to CSF infection and sepsis.

Conclusions

The authors' preliminary results suggest that fetoscopic treatment of MMC is feasible, reproducible, and safe for mothers and their babies. Neurological outcomes were favorable and similar to those in the available literature. As known, prematurity was the greatest complication.

### Laparotomy-assisted, two-port fetoscopic myelomeningocele repair: infant to preschool outcomes [^116Ku7mV]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study reports the infant to preschool outcomes of a laparotomy-assisted, two-port fetoscopic myelomeningocele (MMC) repair and compares the results with those of a contemporary, same-center cohort that underwent either fetal MMC surgery via hysterotomy or postnatal MMC repair.

Methods

All MMC closures between December 2011 and July 2021 were screened. Singleton pregnancies with hindbrain herniation and MMC between T1 and S1 were included. Fetuses were excluded for genetic abnormalities, severe kyphosis, and other congenital anomalies. The pregnant woman determined the method of MMC repair (fetoscopic, hysterotomy, or postnatal repair).

Results

Two hundred MMC closures met the study criteria (100 fetoscopic, 41 hysterotomy, and 59 postnatal). The median length of follow-up was beyond 46 months for all groups. The median gestational age at delivery was 38.1 weeks (IQR 35.1, 39.1 weeks) for the fetoscopic group, 35.7 weeks (IQR 33.6, 37.0 weeks) for the hysterotomy group, and 38.6 weeks (IQR 37.7, 39.0 weeks) for the postnatal group. Vaginal delivery occurred in 51% of the fetoscopic cases, and there were no instances of uterine dehiscence or rupture. Treatment for hydrocephalus in the 1st year occurred in 35% (95% CI 27%-50%) of fetoscopic, 33% (95% CI 20%-50%) of hysterotomy, and 81% (95% CI 70%-90%) of postnatal repair cases. At 30 months, patients who underwent fetal intervention were twice as likely to be community ambulators (with or without devices) as those who underwent postnatal repair (52% [95% CI 42%-62%] of fetoscopic, 54% [95% CI 39%-68%] of hysterotomy, and 24% [95% CI 14%-36%] of postnatal cases). Surgery for symptomatic tethered cord occurred in 12% (95% CI 7%-19%) of fetoscopic, 17% (95% CI 8%-31%) of hysterotomy, and 2% (95% CI 1%-8%) of postnatal repair cases. Surgery for symptomatic spinal inclusion cysts was required in 4% (95% CI 1%-9%) of fetoscopic, 7% (95% CI 2%-18%) of hysterotomy, and none (95% CI 0%-8%) of the postnatal cases.

Conclusions

Laparotomy-assisted, two-port fetoscopic repair provides significant benefits for maternal health. It negates the risk of uterine rupture for the index pregnancy and subsequent pregnancies and allows for vaginal delivery. The benefits to the fetus are the same as those of hysterotomy repairs, with a lower risk of prematurity. There was no difference in the rate of surgery for tethered cord or spinal inclusion cysts between fetoscopic and hysterotomy procedures. Overall, laparotomy-assisted, two-port fetoscopic repair is safer for the fetus and the mother than fetal MMC surgery via hysterotomy.

### Ethical challenges in conducting maternal-fetal surgery trials. A systematic review [^115ABwdk]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, some explained that equipoise might still be uncertain at the end of the trial. For example, Fisk et al.found that the Eurofetus trial demonstrated that laser treatment is the best treatment for (almost) all stages of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, but equipoise is uncertain for the early treatment due to the high number of laser-related fetal losses. Vergote et al. found that a significant percentage of clinicians are still unsure of the risk-benefit ratio of FETO surgery for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and Lyerly et al. found that many clinicians did not believe that in-utero repair of myelomeningocele was sufficiently validated. Similarly, two publications explained that MFS trials reduce but do not completely remove uncertainty. For example, although the MOMS trial was successful, some infants did not benefit from it. Meaning that individual parents and doctors are still confronted with the difficult question of whether the surgery is the best for this individual infant.

To solve the uncertainties related to equipoise Chervenak and McCullough proposed three criteria to determine whether equipoise is reached. First, when the initial pre-trial data indicate that the experimental fetal intervention is reliably expected either to be lifesaving or to prevent serious harm. Second, that the experimental intervention involves the least amount of risks for the fetus among the possible interventions. Third, that the risks for the pregnant woman are reliably expected to be low or manageable.

### Study details | Open spina bifida fetoscopic repair project… [^114HuiPG]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Open Spina Bifida Fetoscopic Repair ProjectClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Spina bifida can be a devastating neurological congenital anomaly. It results from incomplete middleline closure of the neural tube between 22 and 28 embryological days. Its incidence is approximately 1 per 1, 000 / 2, 000 births. It is considered the most common congenital anomaly of the central nervous system that is compatible with life, 90% of the defects are lumbar and sacral.
- The majority of MMCs can be diagnosed between before 20 weeks. MMC is associated with Chiari II malformation, which includes a constellation of anomalies such as hindbrain herniation, brainstem abnormalities, low-lying venous sinuses and a small posterior fossa. The Chiari II malformation can have deleterious effects on motor, cranial nerve and cognitive functions. Postnatally most MMC patients develop hydrocephalus and require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

Shunts require lifelong monitoring and have a high failure rate due to infection, obstruction, and fracture. Based on this hypothesis, open fetal surgical repair of MMC was proposed, and the recent publication of the NICHD sponsored randomized controlled trial demonstrated clear neonatal benefit of open in-utero fetal surgical repair of MMC. The study showed a reduction in the incidence of hydrocephalus and in the radiographic severity of hindbrain herniation. Open in-utero fetal surgery is not without risk and the NICHD study showed an elevation in maternal-fetal morbidity/risk when compared to the postnatally treated group, including higher risk for chorioamniotic separation, maternal pulmonary edema.

Fetoscopy offers a less invasive therapeutic option that could reduce a number of the morbidities related to open fetal procedures. This fetoscopy technique has now been employed by a group of investigators, in human fetal surgery cases in Houston, Texas, Monterrey México and in Shiraz, Iran showing its feasibility and applicability to the human uterus and fetus, and demonstrating an improved degree of flexibility in terms of access to the fetus regardless of placental location. The technique is designed to decrease the maternal risks of open uterus fetal surgery while maintaining a similar level of fetal benefit as seen in the MOMS trial. The neurosurgical repair proposed in this protocol will involves release of the placode, dissection of the surrounding skin and attempted primary closure of the defect using available skin.

### Fetoscopic myelomeningocoele closure: is the scientific evidence enough to challenge the gold standard for prenatal surgery? [^1152Cvoz]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Scoring tool for distinguishing between treatments (modified for maternal‐fetal therapy, based on Provoost et al.)

Within this framework, open fetal spina bifida closure is categorized as an established therapy (Figure 1). Both fetoscopic approaches would rank as innovative treatments, however based on the most recent series effectiveness could be scored as acceptable (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Adapted from Provoost et al. Assessment tool for the transition from an experimental treatment to an innovative treatment and to an established treatment

The following recommendations were suggested for interventions that fall in the innovative treatment category: (1) treatment should only be offered by expert centers; (2) there should be a commitment to closely monitor their practice conducting thorough follow‐up studies with the purpose of publishing the (positive and negative) results in peer‐reviewed journals; (3) patients should be adequately informed about all relevant aspects of the procedure (including surgical expertise) and about the status of the treatment (lack of long‐term outcomes should be emphasized) and (4) centers should always be prepared to stop treatment when there are signs of serious concerns based on their own studies or on published reports. This also implies that all patients should also be asked for their consent for any innovative treatment and also to be contacted in the future for follow‐up studies. Therefore, requiring formal approval of a medical research ethics committee is essential.

The difficulty of maternal‐fetal therapy is that the status of the treatment should be balanced between the benefits and risks for the fetus and the maternal risks, and this is evidently not incorporated in the framework of Provoost et al.

### Maternal and obstetric complications in fetal surgery for prenatal myelomeningocele repair: a systematic review [^112jhKWT]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Comparing prenatal and postnatal surgical repair techniques for myelomeningocele (MMC), in utero fetal surgery has increasingly gained acceptance and is considered by many specialized centers the first choice of treatment. Despite its benefits, as demonstrated in the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS), including reduced need for CSF shunting in neonates and improved motor outcomes at 30 months, there is still an ongoing debate on fetal and maternal risks associated with the procedure. Prenatal open hysterotomy, fetoscopic MMC repair techniques, and subsequent delivery by cesarean section are associated with maternal complications. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the available literature on maternal and obstetric complication rates and perinatal maternal outcomes related to fetal MMC repair.

Methods

The authors identified references for inclusion in this review by searching PubMed and MEDLINE, with restrictions to English language, case series, case reports, clinical trials, controlled clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, reviews, and systematic reviews. The rate of maternal and obstetric complications was analyzed based on studies focusing on this issue and presenting clear results on the matter.

Results

Of 1264 articles screened, 36 were included in this systemic review, whereof 11 were eligible for data analysis and comparison. The average overall rate of maternal and obstetric complications corresponds to 78.6%. The majority of the described events are obstetric complications, varying from chorioamniotic membrane separation in 65.6% of cases, oligohydramnios in 13.0% of cases, placental abruption in 5.0% of cases, spontaneous or preterm premature membrane rupture in 42.0% of cases, and early preterm delivery in 11.3% of cases due to uterine dehiscence, occurring in 0.9% of cases. The most common medical complications are development of pulmonary edema occurring in 2.8%, gestational diabetes in 3.7%, gestational hypertension/preeclampsia in 3.7%, and need for blood transfusions in 3.2% of cases. Limitations of the review arise from the lack of data in the current literature, with maternal and obstetric complications being underreported.

Conclusions

Although the efforts of further advancement of intrauterine prenatal MMC repair aim to increase neonatal outcomes, maternal health hazard will continue to be an issue of crucial importance and further studies are required.

### Resuscitation decisions in fetal myelomeningocele repair should center on parents' values: a counter analysis [^114VH3Jf]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

In our response to, "Parental request for non-resuscitation in fetal myelomeningocele repair: an analysis of the novel ethical tensions in fetal intervention" by Wolfe and co-authors, we argue that parental authority should guide resuscitation decision-making for a fetus at risk for preterm delivery as a complication of fetal myelomeningocele (fMMC) repair. Due to the elevated morbidity and mortality risks of combined myelomeningocele, extreme prematurity, and fetal hypoxia, parents' values regarding the acceptability of possible outcomes should be elicited and their preferences honored. Ethical decision-making in these situations must also consider the broader context of the fetal-maternal dyad. Innovations in fetoscopic approaches to fMMC repair may pose additional complexity to these resuscitation decisions.

### Global policy and practice for intrauterine fetal resuscitation during fetal surgery for open spina bifida repair [^114Lc1LM]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Globally accepted recommendations suggest that a woman should be between 19 weeks and 25 weeks plus 6 days of pregnancy to be considered eligible for fetal closure of open spina bifida. A fetus requiring emergency delivery during surgery is therefore potentially considered viable and thus eligible for resuscitation. There is little evidence, however, to support how this scenario is addressed in clinical practice.

Objective

To explore current policy and practice for fetal resuscitation during fetal surgery for open spina bifida in centers undertaking fetal surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

An online survey was designed to identify current policies and practices in place to support fetal surgery for open spina bifida, exploring experiences and management of emergency fetal delivery and fetal death during surgery. The survey was emailed to 47 fetal surgery centers in 11 countries where fetal spina bifida repair is currently performed. These centers were identified through the literature, the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis center repository, and an internet search. Centers were contacted between January 15 and May 31, 2021. Individuals volunteered participation through choosing to complete the survey.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The survey comprised 33 questions of mixed multiple choice, option selection, and open-ended formats. Questions explored policy and practice supporting fetal and neonatal resuscitation during fetal surgery for open spina bifida.

Results

Responses were obtained from 28 of 47 centers (60%) in 11 countries. Twenty cases of fetal resuscitation during fetal surgery during the last 5 years were reported across 10 centers. Four cases of emergency delivery during fetal surgery after maternal and/or fetal complications during the last 5 years were reported across 3 centers. Fewer than half the 28 centers (n = 12 [43%]) had policies in place to support practice in the event of either imminent fetal death (during or after fetal surgery) or the need for emergency fetal delivery during fetal surgery. Twenty of 24 centers (83%) reported preoperative parental counseling on the potential need for fetal resuscitation prior to fetal surgery. The gestational age at which centers would attempt neonatal resuscitation after emergency delivery varied from 22 weeks and 0 days to more than 28 weeks.

Conclusions

In this global survey study of 28 fetal surgical centers, there was no standard practice about how fetal resuscitation or subsequent neonatal resuscitation was managed during open spina bifida repair. Further collaboration between professionals and parents is required to ensure sharing of information to support knowledge development in this area.

### Neurosurgeons' opinions on the prenatal management of myelomeningocele [^115KEpqo]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Improvements in imaging and surgical technological innovations have led to the increasing implementation of fetal surgical techniques. Open fetal surgery has demonstrated more favorable clinical outcomes in children born with open myelomeningocele (MMC) than those following postnatal repair. However, primarily because of maternal risks but also because of fetal risks, fetal surgery for MMC remains controversial. Here, the authors evaluated the contemporary management of MMC in the hope of identifying barriers and facilitators for neurosurgeons in providing fetal surgery for MMC.

Methods

An online survey was emailed to members of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery (ISPN) in March 2019. The survey focused on 1) characteristics of the respondents, 2) the practice of counseling on and managing prenatally diagnosed MMC, and 3) barriers, facilitators, and expectations of fetal surgery for MMC. Reminders were sent to improve the response rate.

Results

A total of 446 respondents filled out the survey, most (59.2%) of whom specialized in pediatric neurosurgery. The respondents repaired an average of 9.6 MMC defects per year, regardless of technique. Regardless of the departments in which respondents were employed, 91.0% provided postnatal repair of MMC, 13.0% open fetal repair, and 4.9% fetoscopic repair. According to the surgeons, the most important objections to performing open fetal surgery were a lack of cases available to become proficient in the technique (33.8%), the risk of maternal complications (23.6%), and concern for fetal complications (15.2%). The most important facilitators according to advocates of prenatal closure are a decreased rate of shunt dependency (37.8%), a decreased rate of hindbrain herniation (27.0%), and an improved rate of motor function (18.9%). Of the respondents, only 16.9% agreed that open fetal surgery should be the standard of care.

Conclusions

The survey results showed diversity in the management of patients with MMC. In addition, significant diversity remains regarding fetal surgery for MMC closure. Despite the apparent benefits of open fetal surgery in selected pregnancies, only a minority of centers and providers offer this technique. As a more technically demanding technique that requires multidisciplinary effort with less well-established long-term outcomes, fetoscopic surgery may face similar limited implementation, although the surgery may pose fewer maternal risks than open fetal surgery. Centralization of prenatal treatment to tertiary care referral centers, as well as the use of sophisticated training models, may help to augment the most commonly cited objection to the implementation of prenatal closure, which is the overall limited caseload.

### Bladder function after fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^114qZJWx]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A substudy of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study evaluating urological outcomes was conducted.

Methods

Pregnant women diagnosed with fetal myelomeningocele were randomly assigned to either prenatal or standard postnatal surgical repair. The substudy included patients randomly assigned after April 18, 2005. The primary outcome was defined in their children as death or the need for clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) by 30 months of age characterized by prespecified criteria. Secondary outcomes included bladder and kidney abnormalities observed by urodynamics and renal/bladder ultrasound at 12 and 30 months, which were analyzed as repeated measures.

Results

Of the 115 women enrolled in the substudy, the primary outcome occurred in 52% of children in the prenatal surgery group and 66% in the postnatal surgery group (relative risk [RR]: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57–1.07). Actual rates of CIC use were 38% and 51% in the prenatal and postnatal surgery groups, respectively (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.48–1.12). Prenatal surgery resulted in less trabeculation (RR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.19–0.79) and fewer cases of open bladder neck on urodynamics (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40–0.92) after adjustment by child's gender and lesion level. The difference in trabeculation was confirmed by ultrasound.

Conclusions

Prenatal surgery did not significantly reduce the need for CIC by 30 months of age but was associated with less bladder trabeculation and open bladder neck. The implications of these findings are unclear now, but support the need for long-term urologic follow-up of patients with myelomeningocele regardless of type of surgical repair.

### Reducing perinatal complications and preterm delivery for patients undergoing in utero closure of fetal myelomeningocele: further modifications to the multidisciplinary surgical technique [^116uJBtN]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBJECT.: As more pediatric neurosurgeons become involved with fetal myelomeningocele closure efforts, examining refined techniques in the overall surgical approach that could maximize beneficial outcomes becomes critical. The authors compared outcomes for patients who had undergone a modified technique with those for patients who had undergone fetal repair as part of the earlier Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS).

Methods

Demographic and outcomes data were collected for a series of 43 delivered patients who had undergone in utero myelomeningocele closure at the Fetal Center at Vanderbilt from March 2011 through January 2013 (the study cohort) and were compared with data for 78 patients who had undergone fetal repair as part of MOMS (the MOMS cohort). For the study cohort, no uterine trocar was used, and uterine entry, manipulation, and closure were modified to minimize separation of the amniotic membrane. Weekly ultrasound reports were obtained from primary maternal-fetal medicine providers and reviewed. A test for normality revealed that distribution for the study cohort was normal; therefore, parametric statistics were used for comparisons.

Results

The incidence of premature rupture of membranes (22% vs 46%, p = 0.011) and chorioamnion separation (0% vs 26%, p < 0.001) were lower for the study cohort than for the MOMS cohort. Incidence of oligohydramnios did not differ between the cohorts. The mean (± SD) gestational age of 34.4 (± 6.6) weeks for the study cohort was similar to that for the MOMS cohort (34.1 ± 3.1 weeks). However, the proportion of infants born at term (37 weeks or greater) was significantly higher for the study cohort (16 of 41; 39%) than for the MOMS cohort (16 of 78; 21%) (p = 0.030). Compared with 10 (13%) of 78 patients in the MOMS cohort, only 2 (4%) of 41 infants in the study cohort were delivered earlier than 30 weeks of gestation (p = 0.084, approaching significance). For the study cohort, 2 fetal deaths were attributed to the intervention, and both were believed to be associated with placental disruption; one of these mothers had previously unidentified thrombophilia. Mortality rates did not statistically differ between the cohorts.

Conclusions

These early results suggest that careful attention to uterine entry, manipulation, and closure by the surgical team can result in a decreased rate of premature rupture of membranes and chorioamnion separation and can reduce early preterm delivery. Although these results are promising, their confirmation will require further study of a larger series of patients.

### Recent advances in fetal surgery [^1158R42B]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Fetal surgery is now an accepted modality for treatment of a variety of lethal and non-lethal congenital conditions. It represents a new, fast-moving frontier of medicine in which cooperative mulitdisciplinary effort and input are required to assure both fetal and maternal welfare. A wide range of therapeutic strategies from percutaneous to open invasive techniques has led to a complex list of different procedures for different diseases. This review identifies the most common disease entities managed by fetal intervention, examines the evolution in development of techniques to those currently used, and describes the prospective, randomized trials presently underway that are designed to establish the safety and determine true efficacy of treatment. Fetal surgery as a (multi)discipline continues to strive to minimize maternal and fetal risk. Undoubtedly, as tocolytic therapy and neonatal intensive efforts improve, fetal therapy will expand.

### Contemporary outcomes of a national fetal spina bifida surgery service [^111ydY1N]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Despite the availability of preventative interventions, open spina bifida still occurs in approximately 4.63 per 10,000 births globally and the condition is diagnosed in about 150 fetuses annually in Canada. In open spina bifida, the absence of a protective skin layer covering the spinal cord leaves the neural placode exposed to the uterine environment, rendering it vulnerable to progressive injury during pregnancy. Additionally, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the lesion results in hindbrain herniation and secondary hydrocephalus. Fetal intervention for spina bifida was proposed as secondary prevention to mitigate damage to the neural placode and reduce the incidence of hydrocephalus. The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) confirmed the benefits of prenatal intervention, with lower rates of ventriculo‐peritoneal shunting and better motor function being observed in fetuses operated on before birth. To many parents, the benefits of in‐utero surgery outweigh the risks of preterm birth and maternal morbidity. As such, the uptake of fetal spina bifida surgery has increased worldwide, with now more than 40 centers offering this treatment.

Our center started offering fetal spina bifida closure to Canadian patients in 2017, and our surgical protocol and early outcomes have been published previously. We demonstrated that fetal spina bifida treatment could be replicated in experienced fetal therapy centers that had not participated in the seminal MOMS trial, with very comparable short‐term results. However, more than short‐term outcomes, prospective parents want information beyond the neonatal period. We have therefore been collecting medium‐term follow‐up on our patients and here describe outcomes of infants that have reached the age of at least 1 year.

### Minimally invasive fetal surgery and the next frontier [^1173J5fn]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients with congenital anomalies do not require prenatal intervention. Furthermore, many congenital anomalies requiring surgical intervention are treated adequately after birth. However, there is a subset of patients with congenital anomalies who will die before birth, shortly after birth, or experience severe postnatal complications without fetal surgery. Fetal surgery is unique in that an operation is performed on the fetus as well as the pregnant woman who does not receive any direct benefit from the surgery but rather lends herself to risks, such as hemorrhage, abruption, and preterm labor. The maternal risks involved with fetal surgery have limited the extent to which fetal interventions may be performed but have, in turn, led to technical innovations that have significantly advanced the field. This review will examine congenital abnormalities that can be treated with minimally invasive fetal surgery and introduce the next frontier of prenatal management of fetal surgical pathology.

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Office of Rare Diseases convened a multidisciplinary group of experts on August 16–17, 2004, for a workshop entitled "Fetal Treatment: Needs Assessment and Future Directions". The purpose of the workshop was to develop a plan for the surgical, obstetric, neonatal, and maternal-fetal fields for the evaluation and dissemination of maternal-fetal surgical innovations and to further the scientific evaluation of maternal-fetal surgery. This article highlights the discussions and outlines recommendations for the future. An overarching recommendation was for the formation of a cooperative group of investigators and clinicians to help set a national agenda for research and clinical progress, as well as emphasize ethical issues.

### Fetoscopic myelomeningocoele closure: is the scientific evidence enough to challenge the gold standard for prenatal surgery? [^117U1dAc]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Medium credibility.

5 THE CONTINUUM OF RESEARCH

Most regulatory bodies depart from a dichotomous approach labelling treatments as either experimental or established. However, there is no clear consensus of the extent of this research phase and thus it remains unclear when available evidence is convincing enough to decide that a new technology or treatment is no longer to be labelled as "experimental". To evaluate the implementation of new technologies in the field of reproductive medicine, a conceptual framework and a scoring tool were developed. We propose that with some minor adaptations, this framework can be used as a general tool for evaluating new treatments in other medical specialties, such as maternal‐fetal surgical interventions (Table 2). This framework describes that the development of novel techniques ideally follows a continuum that distinguishes three categories: experimental, innovative and established treatments. Experimental therapies should only be offered in a research setting, aiming at showing efficacy and safety in animals and case reports in humans ("proof of concept"), with approval of a medical research ethical committee. Innovative treatments have progressed from this initial phase and there is albeit limited evidence of efficacy and short‐term safety in humans. The label "innovative treatment" entails an intermediate phase of research in a novel treatment to provide generalizable knowledge, comparable to a phase III drug research study. Obviously, this should be done with continuous oversight of regulatory bodies. The scoring tool provides a means to determine the status of a novel treatment within this continuum rating the therapy in four criteria: efficacy, safety, procedural reliability and effectiveness.

### Maternal complications following open and fetoscopic fetal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aBHGt]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The maternal risks of fetal surgery are accepted by many patients and health care professionals for the possible benefit to the fetus. 191, 192 This systematic review finds that studies of fetal surgery focus on the fetal outcomes of the procedure, and many fail to describe maternal complications. Fetal surgery comes at a risk to the mother, which may be underestimated by fetal therapists because of under‐reporting and variable reporting quality. In order to properly quantify maternal risks, outcomes should be reported consistently across all studies of fetal surgery, preferentially in prospective registries.

4 LIMITATIONS OF AN RCT

Despite RCTs being often rated as the gold standard, this may not be applicable to every type of research. First, there are some concerns when it comes to RCTs evaluating surgical interventions in general. For example, all surgical RCTs are complicated by the fact that for every case there is a countless number of confounders (such as pathological findings, surgeon's expertise and surgical approach as well as shift in the management for the condition over time) which may have an effect on the standardization the investigated treatment and these are not controlled for by randomization. A second concern is the discrepancy between the time to gather evidence from an RCT and the pace of developing novel techniques. For all the RCTs in maternal‐fetal surgery mentioned above, slow recruitment made it challenging to complete enrollment of sufficient patients. The MOMS trial took nearly 10 years to complete and likewise the TOTAL trial evaluating the effect of fetoscopic tracheal occlusion for infants with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia has only recently finished recruitment after more than a decade. This could be explained partially by the rarity of these conditions but at least as much by the hesitancy of parents to undergo investigational procedures in pregnancy and physician's bias. On the other hand, most procedures will go through an experimental preclinical and clinical phase prior to the initiation of clinical trials, and this often inspires other centers to start clinical programs, who later on find it difficult to question that intervention. This so‐called "back‐door" phenomenon, that is, offering interventions outside of clinical trials, is common and weighs on recruitment rates. The powerful "technological imperative" — the idea that if something can be done it should be done — is an important aspect for both physician and patient and increases the urge to offer a not always thoroughly studied treatment. During the MOMS trial, a moratorium was imposed by the US maternal‐fetal surgical centers except for the three trial centers, but repeating a study like this to objectively assess the benefit of a fetoscopic repair seems difficult. Fetal therapy in general often generates (social) media attention and not uncommonly this could be a driving factor.

### Ethical challenges in conducting maternal-fetal surgery trials. A systematic review [^1119Ffvz]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

When it comes to the pregnant person, Hendriks et al. explained that MFS trials generally do not produce direct medical benefit for the pregnant person. Chervenak and McCullough maintained that it can be ethically acceptable to conduct a MFS trial for fetal benefit if risks for the pregnant person are reasonable. Regardless, seven publications emphasized that maternal risks should be minimized.

Seven publications advised to include psychosocial factors in the risks-benefits assessment. For example, Hendriks et al. (2020) maintained that if a condition is associated with psychosocial harm, such as being less likely to achieve higher education, alleviating it is a benefit. The biggest discussion, however, is related to psychosocial risk-benefit assessments for the pregnant person. According to included publications MFS trials can produce psychosocial benefits for the pregnant person. In particular, they say, having a healthy child would benefit parents and children alike. Hendriks et al. reported that fetal repair of myelomeningocele results in less personal strain and lower family and social impact than the postnatal repair. One publication elicited that there exist psychosocial benefits related to the decision itself, including pregnant persons' recognition that they did everything possible for their child, relief from the stress and anxiety of waiting until after birth, and/or preventing the burden of pregnancy termination. However, few authors emphasized that these evaluations are subjective and should be done by pregnant people themselves. To this regard, Hendriks et al. warned that excluding psychosocial factors from risk-benefits assessment in research protocols might lead to ethics committees rejecting MFS trials because there is no benefit for the woman.
