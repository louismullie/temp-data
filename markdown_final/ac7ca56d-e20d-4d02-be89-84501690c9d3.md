## Question

Is warfarin indicated for the treatment of vitamin K deficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether warfarin is indicated for the treatment of vitamin K deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about warfarin's mechanism of action and intended therapeutic indications. Then, I should clarify what constitutes vitamin K deficiency and its standard treatment. Next, I will check regulatory labeling for any indication or cautions. After that, I'll review clinical reversal protocols and evidence to ensure I'm not missing edge cases. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical answer based on pharmacology, labeling, and guidelines, noting that warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and vitamin K deficiency bleeding is corrected by vitamin K, which already hints at an inverse relationship.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology so I don't jump to conclusions. Warfarin inhibits the C1 subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), blocking the recycling of vitamin K and thereby decreasing the hepatic synthesis of the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X (and proteins C and S); functionally, that produces a vitamin K–deficient state in the coagulation pathway as its mechanism of action, not as a treatment for deficiency [^116795fd] [^111nwPXz].

> Wait, let me verify what we mean by vitamin K deficiency and how we treat it. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding is defined by insufficient activity of vitamin K–dependent factors and is promptly corrected by vitamin K supplementation; the treatment is exogenous vitamin K (oral or IV), not an anticoagulant that further antagonizes vitamin K physiology [^1173JdSX]. I should also note that patients on vitamin K antagonists are considered susceptible to vitamin K deficiency in drug-interaction contexts (for example with bile acid sequestrants), underscoring that warfarin use is associated with, not a remedy for, low vitamin K activity [^116PdaRT].

> I should confirm the regulatory position to be certain. FDA labeling lists the clinical use of warfarin for anticoagulation in conditions like venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation, with dosing to a target INR; it does not list vitamin K deficiency as an indication, and it explicitly advises caution in patients with vitamin K deficiency, which would argue against using warfarin to treat such a state [^116Z36Ej] [^111UNPPr]. Hold on, I should verify if any exception is noted — none is provided in the labeling for correcting vitamin K deficiency with warfarin [^111UNPPr].

> Next, I should review reversal paradigms to ensure I'm not missing a niche scenario. Clinical guidelines and trials consistently use vitamin K (with PCC or plasma when rapid reversal is needed) to reverse warfarin's anticoagulation; vitamin K lowers the INR and restores vitamin K–dependent factor activity, which again shows vitamin K treats the functional deficiency caused by warfarin, not the other way around [^115syHSH] [^116Ucp6f] [^116URsgW]. Let me double-check early pharmacodynamic evidence: oral or IV vitamin K reliably corrects warfarin-associated coagulopathy within 24 hours in many patients, reinforcing that vitamin K is the therapeutic antidote to warfarin, not vice versa [^114qmvf4] [^116a9jAH].

> But wait, what if there were a theoretical reason to add warfarin in vitamin K deficiency to modulate thrombosis risk? Let me think about that; mechanistically, giving a vitamin K antagonist would further suppress vitamin K–dependent factor gamma-carboxylation and worsen coagulopathy, thereby increasing bleeding risk rather than treating the deficiency, which is why reversal strategies add vitamin K and factor concentrates instead of warfarin in bleeding states [^116795fd] [^116D7o8K]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — are there any case-based exceptions? I need to check again, but the guideline and labeling landscape consistently point away from any such practice [^115syHSH] [^111UNPPr].

> In conclusion, I should be explicit: warfarin is not indicated for the treatment of vitamin K deficiency; in fact, it induces a functional vitamin K deficiency in the coagulation cascade, vitamin K deficiency is treated with vitamin K supplementation, and labeling cautions against use in patients with vitamin K deficiency, while clinical protocols use vitamin K to reverse warfarin, not vice versa [^116795fd] [^1173JdSX] [^111UNPPr] [^115syHSH].

Warfarin should never be used to treat vitamin K deficiency; as a vitamin K antagonist [^116795fd], it **worsens deficiency** and increases bleeding risk. The appropriate treatment is **vitamin K supplementation** to restore clotting factor synthesis and correct coagulopathy [^115syHSH]. Warfarin is indicated only for thromboembolic prevention and is **contraindicated in vitamin K deficiency** due to the risk of severe bleeding and complications, such as warfarin-induced skin necrosis [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of warfarin

Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) [^116795fd], blocking regeneration of reduced vitamin K and thereby **reducing synthesis** of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S [^111nwPXz] [^111yRvVd]. This impairs γ-carboxylation, producing inactive clotting factors and resulting in anticoagulation [^113LnQvj].

---

## Clinical indications for warfarin

Warfarin is **indicated** for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders [^1156yJMb], including:

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Stroke prevention.
- **Venous thromboembolism**: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- **Mechanical heart valves**: Prevention of thromboembolism.

Warfarin is **not indicated** for vitamin K deficiency or related coagulopathies.

---

## Vitamin K deficiency: pathophysiology and clinical manifestations

Vitamin K deficiency impairs γ-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, resulting in **coagulopathy** and bleeding [^1155Vy2p]. Clinical manifestations include:

- **Easy bruising** and bleeding.
- **Mucosal bleeding** and gastrointestinal hemorrhage [^1173JdSX].
- **Prolonged PT/INR** and bleeding tendency.

Treatment requires **vitamin K supplementation** to restore clotting factor synthesis and correct coagulopathy [^114qmvf4].

---

## Risks and complications of warfarin in vitamin K deficiency

Warfarin use in vitamin K deficiency is contraindicated because it **exacerbates deficiency** and increases bleeding risk. Potential complications include:

- **Severe bleeding** and hemorrhage [^116URsgW].
- **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis**: particularly in protein C or S deficiency [^111tyfxh] [^111UNPPr].
- **Increased fracture risk**: due to impaired bone mineralization [^115yprsH] [^115AaiME].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines explicitly advise against using warfarin to treat vitamin K deficiency; instead, **vitamin K supplementation is recommended** to correct coagulopathy and restore normal clotting factor synthesis.

---

## Alternative treatments for vitamin K deficiency

The primary treatment for vitamin K deficiency is **vitamin K supplementation**, administered orally or intravenously depending on severity and urgency [^116a9jAH]. This approach effectively restores clotting factor synthesis and corrects coagulopathy [^115YLxsj].

---

## Monitoring and management of warfarin therapy

Warfarin therapy requires **careful INR monitoring** [^115i1QmN] to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation and minimize bleeding risk. Regular INR checks and dose adjustments are essential to ensure safe and effective anticoagulation therapy [^116Z36Ej].

---

## Conclusion

Warfarin should **not be used** to treat vitamin K deficiency because it **worsens deficiency** and increases bleeding risk. The appropriate treatment is **vitamin K supplementation** to restore clotting factor synthesis and correct coagulopathy. Warfarin is indicated only for thromboembolic prevention and is contraindicated in vitamin K deficiency due to the risk of severe bleeding and complications, such as warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

Patients with protein C deficiency are at increased risk for thromboembolic diseases. Non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant options should be considered in patients with warfarin-induced skin necrosis (WISN) in the setting of protein C deficiency. We report a case of a 41-year-old African American male patient with WISN and protein C deficiency who was treated with rivaroxaban followed by dabigatran. After one month on rivaroxaban, he began experiencing blood in his stools and unrelenting pain in his lower extremities. He also found it difficult to obtain medication despite having insurance and, as a result, did not maintain compliance. He was then assessed at the hospital, symptomatically treated, and discharged on dabigatran. After six weeks, he reported symptomatic relief and fewer side effects. This case involved a head-to-head clinical comparison of rivaroxaban and dabigatran as alternatives to warfarin anticoagulation therapy.

### SPL drug information for warfarin sodium [^111UNPPr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of warfarin sodium PO (also known as Coumadin, Jantoven):

- **Aki**: Use caution in patients with a history of kidney disease.

- **Bleeding tendency**: Use caution in patients with vitamin C or K deficiency.

- **Calciphylaxis**: Use caution in patients with and without ESRD.

- **Hematoma, bleeding**: Use caution in patients receiving intramuscular injections of other drugs.

- **Maculopapular rash**: Use caution in patients with a history of coumarin anticoagulants hypersensitivity.

- **Tissue necrosis**: Use extreme caution in patients with diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease or atherosclerosis, recent trauma or surgery, improper dosing of warfarin, and protein C and S deficiency.

- **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis, lower extremity amputation, purple-toe syndrome**: Use extreme caution in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and DVT.

---

### Jantoven [^116795fd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Warfarin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which include factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post-ribosomal synthesis of these clotting factors. It promotes the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in proteins that are crucial for biological activity. Warfarin is believed to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibiting the C1 subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration; however, the peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action for a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of Jantoven may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap, consistent with the half-lives of the affected vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins: Factor II – 60 hours, VII – 4 to 6 hours, IX – 24 hours, X – 48 to 72 hours, and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Jantoven is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of warfarin. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans, but generally has a more rapid clearance.

- **Absorption**: Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed.

### Oral vitamin K produces a normal INR within 24 hours of its administration in most patients discontinuing warfarin [^114qmvf4]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

A randomized, blinded study in 30 patients was undertaken, revealing that low-dose oral vitamin K was more effective than a placebo in correcting the INR in patients discontinuing warfarin. Larger studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of oral vitamin K, particularly for patients temporarily stopping warfarin to undergo interventional procedures.

### Coumadin [^116Z36Ej]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Individualized dosing**: The dosage and administration of Coumadin must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in determining the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with Coumadin [see References (15)].

- **Recommended target INR ranges and durations for individual indications**: An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

	- **Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE])**: Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication, as follows:
		- For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
		- For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
		- For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment for the individual patient.

### Safety of a four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate versus plasma for vitamin K antagonist reversal: An integrated analysis of two Phase IIIb clinical trials [^116Ucp6f]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Our study has a number of strengths and limitations. The analyses presented here use data from the two largest, prospective, randomized controlled trials of VKA reversal. However, neither of the trials was powered to demonstrate significant differences between the treatment groups for safety outcomes. Although there may be pathophysiologic differences between preoperative patients and bleeding patients, pooling the data from the two studies allows further investigation of rare events such as thromboembolic events, fluid overload events, and deaths and provides an overall assessment of 4F‐PCC safety in patients requiring VKA reversal in two settings. Another limitation was that the clinicians and study investigators could not be blinded to study treatment allocation due to differences in the administration of 4F‐PCC and plasma. However, a blinded SAB assessed deaths and serious thromboembolic events for relatedness to treatment.

### Colesevelam hydrochloride [^117K1nD6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies**: Colesevelam hydrochloride may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients susceptible to deficiencies of vitamin K, such as those on warfarin or with malabsorption syndromes, may be at increased risk when taking colesevelam hydrochloride. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Drug interactions**: Colesevelam hydrochloride reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. It is recommended to administer drugs with a known interaction at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs that have not been tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider administering them at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Warfarin poisoning with delayed rebound toxicity [^111rh7J8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Intentional poisoning with warfarin is not the same as over-anticoagulation, for which guidelines exist. The coagulopathy resulting from a warfarin overdose is reversed with vitamin K1, the dose and timing of which is often guided by experience with the management of over-anticoagulation with warfarin therapy rather than acute overdose.

- **Case report**: We report a case of a 50-year-old man who ingested an unknown amount of his warfarin, venlafaxine, and paracetamol. He presented with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5, which steadily increased over 24 hours to 7, despite receiving an initial 1 mg of vitamin K1. He was then treated with 5 mg vitamin K1, and once the INR returned to 4.5, 40 hours post-ingestion, he was discharged home. He was also treated with a full course of acetylcysteine for the paracetamol overdose. The following day, his INR rebounded to 8.5 and he suffered a spontaneous epistaxis requiring readmission; he was treated with low titrated doses of vitamin K1. The warfarin concentration was 74.6 μg/mL, 26 hours post-ingestion, and decreased to 3.7 μg/mL over 72 hours.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Our case highlights the risk of a rebound elevated INR even three days after acute warfarin overdose despite treatment with vitamin K1. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of vitamin K1 in comparison with warfarin, repeat INR testing, and continued treatment with oral vitamin K1 may help avoid complications of rebound coagulopathy in warfarin overdose.

### A comparison of the efficacy and rate of response to oral and intravenous vitamin K in reversal of over-anticoagulation with warfarin [^116a9jAH]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

The role of oral vitamin K administration in the reversal of anticoagulation is not yet clear because of a paucity of data on the early effects of treatment, apparent differences in efficacy between preparations, and a lack of data comparing oral with intravenous administration. We have compared the effects on the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and activities of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X at 4 hours and 24 hours after administration of three oral vitamin K preparations and of intravenous vitamin K in 64 anticoagulated patients who required non-urgent partial correction of anticoagulation.

Our data confirm that correction of anticoagulation is more rapid after intravenous administration of vitamin K than after oral administration of similar or larger doses. At 24 hours, satisfactory correction of INR can be achieved using low-dose vitamin K given by either the intravenous or oral route. Our data, and that from previous studies, suggest that there may be differences in efficacy between orally administered products.

Administration of vitamin K by either route was accompanied by changes in the activities of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors that reflected their respective biological half-lives. In the 24 hours after treatment, the relationship between the INR and the individual vitamin K-dependent clotting factors was similar to that described previously in stable anticoagulated patients. We conclude that the reversal of anticoagulation with warfarin is achieved more rapidly by intravenous administration of vitamin K. Satisfactory, but slower, reversal can be achieved with oral administration.

### Risk of thromboembolic events after protocolized warfarin reversal with 3-factor PCC and factor VIIa [^112Lxygi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Bleeding events and life-threatening hemorrhage are the most feared complications of warfarin therapy. Prompt anticoagulant reversal aimed at the replacement of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors is essential to promote hemostasis. A retrospective cohort study of warfarin-treated patients experiencing a life-threatening hemorrhage was performed, comparing those treated with an institution-specific warfarin reversal protocol (postimplementation group) and those who received the prior standard of care (preimplementation group). The reversal protocol included vitamin K, 3-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant factor VIIa. Demographic and clinical information, anticoagulant reversal information, and all adverse events attributed to warfarin reversal were recorded.

A total of 227 patients were included in the final analysis, with 109 in the preimplementation group and 118 in the postimplementation group. Baseline patient characteristics were similar in both groups, with the exception of higher average Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores in the postimplementation group (P = 0.0005). The most common indication for anticoagulation reversal was intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Prereversal international normalized ratios (INRs) were similar in both groups. Attainment of INR normalization to less than 1.4 was higher, and rebound INR was lower in the postimplementation group (P < .0001; p = 0.0013). Thromboembolic complications were significantly higher in the postimplementation group (P = 0.003). Elevated baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and mechanical valve as an indication for reversal were associated with increased risk.

### Safety of a four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate versus plasma for vitamin K antagonist reversal: An integrated analysis of two phase IIIb clinical trials [^116URsgW]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

In the United States, clinicians prescribe the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin to 3.4 million patients each year for the treatment and prophylaxis of various prothrombotic conditions. Although effective for this indication, its use is often associated with adverse drug-related events; data collected between 2007 and 2009 implicate warfarin as the medication associated with the largest number of adverse drug events requiring emergency treatment in patients over 65 years of age. These events most commonly manifest as acute bleeding and result in an estimated 33,000 hospitalizations per year.

Patients receiving VKAs often require rapid anticoagulation reversal when they present with major bleeding or require urgent surgical or invasive procedures. Treatment options include vitamin K (oral or intravenous [IV]) concomitant with plasma or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). PCCs are lyophilized concentrates of vitamin K‐dependent coagulation factors (F) either activated or nonactivated. Many treatment guidelines recommend the use of nonactivated PCCs rather than plasma for rapid VKA reversal in the case of major bleeding or prior to urgent surgery or other invasive procedures. Currently, plasma is the most commonly used agent for VKA reversal in many countries, particularly in those where PCCs are not licensed for use.

Recently, two phase IIIb clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nonactivated four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F‐PCC) versus plasma for urgent VKA reversal.

### Welchol [^111tVWvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies**: Welchol may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients susceptible to deficiencies of vitamin K (e.g. patients on warfarin, or those with malabsorption syndromes) or other fat-soluble vitamins may be at increased risk when taking Welchol. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Drug interactions**: Welchol reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Administer drugs with a known interaction at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs that have not been tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider administering these drugs at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU)**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with PKU. Welchol for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 3.75 gram packet contains 27 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Welchol for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Welchol for oral suspension.

### Optimizing warfarin reversal — an ex vivo study [^114qgKdn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Warfarin reversal is a common clinical situation. This process is commonly performed using vitamin K and, depending on the urgency, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), or activated factor VII. Even though PCCs are widely used, the ideal dosing regimen is far from established.

- **Objectives**: To verify differences in warfarin reversal patterns using FFP, recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa), and PCC, and to test the hypothesis that supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratios (INRs) might not correlate with thrombin generation (TG) and identify the ideal concentrations of PCC required to reverse various INR thresholds.

- **Methods**: We studied the effects of FFP, rFVIIa, and Beriplex P/N on the INR and TG using the calibrated automated thrombography assay in ex vivo warfarinized plasma. Plasmas with different INRs were spiked with different concentrations of Beriplex P/N.

- **Results**: Beriplex P/N was the only agent that completely normalized TG and the INR. The endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and the peak thrombin showed a significant negative correlation with all INRs. The ETP and velocity of TG reached a plateau at an INR of approximately 4.0. A concentration equivalent to a dose of 30 IU kg(-1) Beriplex P/N normalized the ETP, the INR, FII, FVII, FIX, and FX of samples with INRs ≥ 4.0. Higher doses resulted in hypercoagulable TG patterns. A concentration equivalent to a dose of 20 IU kg(-1) was sufficient to reverse warfarin at an INR range of 2.0–3.9, as judged by the same tests.

- **Conclusions**: Warfarin reversal algorithms could be simplified.

### Effect of vitamin K intake on the stability of oral anticoagulant treatment: Dose-response relationships in healthy subjects [^115sodWX]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants exert their effect by blocking the utilization of vitamin K, yet little is known about competitive aspects of their interaction with dietary vitamin K. We carried out systematic dose-response studies in healthy volunteers who had been stably anticoagulated and maintained on their individualized doses for 13 weeks. First, we studied the response to weekly incremental doses (50 µg-500 µg) of vitamin K(1) supplements (K(1)) taken daily for 7 days. The threshold K(1) dose causing a statistically significant lowering of the INR was 150 µg/day. In 25% of the participants, the INR change was regarded as clinically relevant at a vitamin K intake of 150 µg/day. Circulating undercarboxylated osteocalcin did not decrease until 300 µg K(1)/day compared with 100 µg K(1)/day for undercarboxylated FII, suggesting differential antidotal effects on bone and hepatic gamma-carboxylation. Next, we tested the response to vitamin K-rich food items. The short-lived response after meals of spinach and broccoli suggested an inefficient bioavailability from these two sources. We conclude that short-term variability in intake of K(1) is less important to fluctuations in the international normalized ratio (INR) than has been commonly assumed and that food supplements providing 100 µg/day of vitamin K(1) do not significantly interfere with oral anticoagulant therapy.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early onset of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a girl baby 50 min after birth: a rare case [^1173JdSX]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) is defined as a bleeding disorder caused by insufficient activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, where coagulation is promptly corrected by vitamin K supplementation. The process of hemostasis is a complex mechanism involving local reactions of blood vessels (vascular phase), the activity of platelets (platelet phase), and the interaction of several specific coagulation factors circulating in the blood (plasma phase). If one of these three factors is disturbed, there will be a disturbance in the hemostasis process, with clinical manifestations of bleeding. Acquired clotting disorders can arise from a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, liver disease, accelerated breakdown of coagulation factors, and coagulation inhibitors. Vitamin K is essential for the activity of several carboxylase enzymes in liver cells. It is required to synthesize and activate coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S. The half-lives of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors are short; therefore, vitamin K deficiency can lead to neonatal VKDB.

The incidence of early-onset VKDB in at-risk neonates who did not receive vitamin K supplementation ranges from 6% to 12%. Among cases where vitamin K administration was not given before delivery, the occurrence of early-onset VKDB is as high as 50%. The usual bleeding sites include the head (cephalohematoma, intracranial), intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal, and gastrointestinal tract. The severity of the clinical presentation may be influenced by the type of maternal treatment.

### Safety of a four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate versus plasma for vitamin K antagonist reversal: An integrated analysis of two phase IIIb clinical trials [^1175Tffp]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although the association of PCCs with thromboembolic events has historically been a concern, small prospective studies investigating the use of PCCs have reported a low incidence of these events (0%–4.6%). Two comprehensive reviews evaluating the safety and thrombogenicity of PCCs concluded that patients treated with PCCs for VKA reversal have a low risk of thromboembolic events. The meta‐analysis conducted by Dentali et al. estimated the incidence of these events as 1.8% (95% CI = 1.0 to 3.0) in patients treated with 4F‐PCCs. A pharmacovigilance study of safety data on the 4F‐PCC used in this study, collected from February 1996 to March 2012, also reported a low incidence of thromboembolic complications (approximately one event per 31,000 infusions). In the present study, thromboembolic events occurred with similar frequencies in the 4F‐PCC and plasma treatment groups. Thromboembolism may occur in this patient population due to underlying predisposing risk factors, the acute medical condition for which they are being treated, their acute care hospitalization, or finally, either a delay in reinitiating or the complete withdrawal of anticoagulation therapy, rather than the treatment option used for VKA reversal.

Observational data, including the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) hemovigilance reporting scheme, have shown that plasma use is associated with fluid overload events. A lower incidence of fluid overload and related cardiac events would be expected in patients treated with 4F‐PCC.

### Dietary vitamin K influences intra-individual variability in anticoagulant response to warfarin [^113ZoLR5]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

The relationship between dietary intake of vitamin K, fat, plasma vitamin K concentrations, and anticoagulation response to warfarin within individuals was investigated. Additionally, the study examined the contribution of dietary vitamin K to differences in warfarin dose requirements among 53 patients on warfarin therapy with stably controlled anticoagulation. Each patient completed a dietary record of all foods consumed daily for four weeks. Blood samples were taken weekly to measure the international normalized ratio (INR), plasma vitamin K, triglycerides, and warfarin enantiomer concentrations. The patients' genotype for CYP2C9 was also determined.

Regression analysis of the data revealed that for each increase of 100 micrograms in daily dietary vitamin K intake averaged over four days, the INR was reduced by 0.2. There was no correlation between the daily dose of warfarin and average daily dietary vitamin K intake over 28 days. The regression model for warfarin dose showed that while dietary vitamin K had no effect, CYP2C9 genotype (P = 2%) and age (P < 1%) significantly contributed to inter-patient variability in dose requirements. A consistent intake of vitamin K could reduce intra-patient variability in the anticoagulation response, thereby improving the safety of warfarin therapy.

### Role of dietary vitamin K intake in chronic oral anticoagulation: Prospective evidence from observational and randomized protocols [^117PmMLZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The potential association between vitamin K intake and coagulation instability has been explored primarily in case reports and small, retrospective, uncontrolled studies. We prospectively evaluated the effects of dietary vitamin K intake on anticoagulation parameters.

- **Methods**: In an observational protocol, clinical characteristics and vitamin K intake, assessed semiquantitatively, were evaluated in 39 outpatients who made 230 visits to our anticoagulation clinic. In a randomized crossover protocol, 12 patients with stable anticoagulation underwent 4-day in-hospital dietary interventions, 1 to 2 weeks apart, providing a 500% increase and an 80% decrease in vitamin K intake relative to the baseline level.

- **Results**: Univariate analysis of the observational data demonstrated a progressive, statistically significant inverse association between the vitamin K intake score and different levels of anticoagulation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that vitamin K intake was independently associated with both overcoagulation and undercoagulation. In the randomized protocol, the international normalized ratio increased from 2.6 ± 0.5 at baseline to 3.3 ± 0.9 at day 7 (P = 0.005) in subjects on the vitamin K-depleted diet and decreased from 3.1 ± 0.8 at baseline to 2.8 ± 0.6 at day 4 (P = 0.04) in those on the vitamin K-enriched diet.

- **Conclusion**: Our prospective data strengthen the concept that the interaction between vitamin K and coumarin is a clinically relevant, major independent factor that interferes with anticoagulation stability.

### Influence of dietary vitamin K intake on subtherapeutic oral anticoagulant therapy [^112A6w7i]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

It is unclear what advice should be given to patients using vitamin K antagonists with respect to dietary vitamin K intake. We performed a nested case-control study in patients attending a Dutch anticoagulation clinic to determine the association between vitamin K intake and subtherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) values, as well as the interaction between usual and recent vitamin K intake. Compared to patients with a normal usual vitamin K intake, those with a high vitamin K intake had a decreased risk of a subtherapeutic INR (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56–1.16), and patients with a low vitamin K intake had an increased risk (HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.79–2.25).

In patients with a low usual vitamin K intake, recent vitamin K intake was twice as high in cases as in controls (164 vs. 85 µg/d). Such a difference was not observed in patients with a normal or high usual vitamin K intake. Our results suggest that a high vitamin K intake reduces the risk of a low INR by lessening the influence of incidental consumption of vitamin K-rich food on the INR. These findings support the recommendation for patients on vitamin K antagonists to eat a sufficient amount of vitamin-K-containing foods.

### Rapid reversal of warfarin-associated hemorrhage in the emergency department by prothrombin complex concentrates [^111584R4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Life-threatening warfarin-associated hemorrhage is common, with a high mortality. In the United States, the most commonly used therapies — fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K — are slow and unpredictable and can result in volume overload. Outside of the United States, prothrombin complex concentrates are often used instead; these pooled plasma products reverse warfarin anticoagulation in minutes rather than hours. This article reviews the literature relating to warfarin reversal with fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant factor VIIa and provides elements for a management protocol based on this literature.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^112P542H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose, which, along with the necessity of maintaining a narrow therapeutic range, means that selecting the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in-range, time to INR in-range, and effect on serious adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, DARE, and the NHS Health Economics Database in The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012), and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials comparing different initiation regimens of warfarin were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

- **Main results**: We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomization. However, only two studies reported adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in-range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I² = 83%).

### New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: No need for pharmacogenomics [^1111SqC1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have overwhelming efficacy data and present significant challenges. In addition to the potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. It had been hoped that the integration of pharmacogenomic with clinical information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

### Calciphylaxis arising following bariatric surgery: A case series [^1163AfjV]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Recently, the role of vitamin K deficiency in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis has gathered growing evidence. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, has been shown to promote vascular calcification in animal models by inhibiting the carboxylation of endothelial matrix Gla protein. Functional vitamin K deficiency, from warfarin use and other causes, is associated with an increased risk of calciphylaxis among patients undergoing dialysis. Although vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin, its deficiency has not been frequently reported, except after biliopancreatic diversion. Of the three patients in this case series with available data, all had low serum vitamin K levels.

Although uncommon, a subset of patients may develop protein-calorie malnutrition. This complication occurs frequently in RYGB and is associated with the length of the common channel because it determines the length of the small intestine available for the mixture of pancreatic secretions with the dietary protein. Low levels of albumin in three patients in our series could suggest malnutrition; however, this is confounded by the underlying inflammation as a result of calciphylaxis itself, as well as other comorbidities.

This case series suggests that clinicians should consider calciphylaxis in the differential diagnosis for painful skin lesions arising after weight loss surgery. This is particularly true if the patients show signs of micronutrient deficiencies or malnutrition. Overall, bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for obesity that can improve the health-related quality of life for these patients, but careful monitoring is essential.

### Bleeding of unknown cause and unclassified bleeding disorders; diagnosis, pathophysiology and management [^1155Vy2p]. Haemophilia (2020). High credibility.

Bleeding tendency can arise from several possible causes, including vitamin K deficiency, hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, acute kidney injury, platelet dysfunction or hypofunction, clotting factor dysfunction or deficiency, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 deficiency, hyperviscosity, and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, certain medications may contribute to bleeding tendency, such as tazemetostat, ramucirumab, propylthiouracil, epoprostenol, cobimetinib, caplacizumab, avapritinib, cefdinir, and binimetinib.

### Vitamin K antagonists — current concepts and challenges [^1139KZCD]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have, for decades, been the cornerstone of anticoagulation in the outpatient setting. While the long half-life makes once-daily administration practical, close monitoring of VKA effect is necessary because these medicines have a narrow therapeutic index. Despite inter-individual variations in response to VKA doses, the increasing availability of specialized anticoagulation monitoring systems, along with a better understanding of potential drug and dietary interactions, has made the use of VKAs safer and less burdensome. In the future, newer classes of oral anticoagulants and genomic-based dosing strategies may further expand or improve the management options for many patients at risk for thromboembolism.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^1138kd8Y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The treatment options for reversing the anticoagulation effect of warfarin include withholding warfarin, administering vitamin K1 (phytomenadione), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). FFP is prepared from whole blood and plasma apheresis donations and contains both pro-coagulant and anticoagulant proteins. It is indicated for coagulation factor replacement in patients with multiple coagulation factor deficiencies, including vitamin K–dependent coagulation factor deficiency due to warfarin therapy. Administration of FFP requires ABO blood group compatibility testing, thawing, and infusion. The adverse effects of FFP include allergic reactions, acute lung injury, transmitted diseases, circulatory overload, and thromboembolic events.

PCC is a concentrated vitamin K–dependent coagulation factor product (factors II, VII, IX, and X) derived from large donor pooled plasma that is stored as a lyophilized powder. PCCs are available as 3-factor (3F-PCCs) (factors II, IX, X) or 4-factor (4F-PCCs) (factors II, VII, IX, X) concentrates. Three-factor PCCs have small amounts of natural anticoagulants (protein C and S), but 4F-PCCs have concentrated amounts of protein C and S, and small amounts of heparin.

Guidelines suggest that in patients with major or life-threatening VKA-associated bleeding, all anticoagulants must be discontinued, and reversal agents must be administered if available. Major bleeding, as defined by the Control of Anticoagulation Subcommittee, refers to bleeding with hemodynamic compromise.

### Interindividual variability in sensitivity to warfarin — nature or nurture [^112aujrN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Interindividual variability in responses to warfarin is attributed to dietary vitamin K, drug interactions, age, or genetic polymorphism in the cytochrome P4502C9 enzyme (CYP2C9) (allelic variants 2C9*2 and 2C9*3) linked with impaired metabolism of the potent enantiomer S-warfarin.

- **Patients and methods**: We quantified the relative effects of age and of simultaneously determined CYP2C9 genotype, plasma warfarin and vitamin K concentrations, and concurrent medications on warfarin maintenance doses in 156 patients at optimized stable anticoagulation.

- **Results**: Allele frequencies for CYP2C9✱1, CYP2C9✱2, and CYP2C9✱3 were 0.84, 0.10, and 0.06, respectively. Warfarin doses were 6.5 ± 3.2, 5.2 ± 2.4, and 3.3 ± 2.0 mg/d in the three genotype groups (P < .001). Patients aged ≥ 66 years with the CYP2C9✱3 allele required only 2.2 ± 1.2 mg/d compared with 7.9 ± 3.7 mg/d in those ≤ 65 years old bearing the CYP2C9✱1 allele (P < .001). In multiple regression analysis, warfarin maintenance doses were independently associated with plasma warfarin (reflecting its metabolic clearance) (r² = 0.26), age (possibly reflecting increased intrinsic sensitivity) (r² = 0.12), and genotype (reflecting S-warfarin levels) (r² = 0.10) but not with plasma vitamin K.

- **Conclusions**: At optimal anticoagulation, important determinants of warfarin dose include age, CYP2C9 genotype, and plasma warfarin concentration.

### Association of warfarin use with valvular and vascular calcification: A review [^1112FHw8]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K is required for the activity of various biologically active proteins in our body. Apart from clotting factors, vitamin K-dependent proteins include regulatory proteins like protein C, protein S, protein Z, osteocalcin, growth arrest-specific gene 6 protein, and matrix Gla protein. Glutamic acid residues in matrix Gla protein are γ-carboxylated by vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylase, which enables it to inhibit calcification.

Warfarin, being a vitamin K antagonist, inhibits this process and has been associated with calcification in various animal and human studies. Though no specific guidelines are currently available to prevent or treat this less-recognized side effect, discontinuing warfarin and using an alternative anticoagulant seems to be a reasonable option. Newer anticoagulants, such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban, offer promise as future therapeutic options in such cases.

Drugs including statins, alendronate, osteoprotegerin, and vitamin K are currently under study as therapies to prevent or treat warfarin-associated calcification.

### Prothrombin complex concentrates: A brief review [^111Q2Q3G]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Prothrombin complex concentrates are haemostatic blood products containing four vitamin K-dependent clotting factors: II, VII, IX, and X. They serve as a useful, reliable, and fast alternative to fresh frozen plasma for reversing the effects of oral anticoagulant treatments, specifically vitamin K antagonists. Occasionally, they are used for factor II or factor X replacement in patients with congenital or acquired deficiencies and are widely prescribed in Europe.

Several retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated their efficacy in normalizing coagulation and controlling life-threatening bleeding. Few side-effects, primarily thromboembolic events, have been reported. The link between these events and prothrombin complex concentrate infusion has often been questioned. The use of prothrombin complex concentrates in new promising indications, such as the management of massive bleeding, requires prospective studies providing a high level of evidence in high-risk settings.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^115syHSH]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, specifically those on warfarin, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend administering 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (25–50 units/kg) and vitamin K (5 mg IV, for one dose) to patients experiencing major bleeding while on warfarin.

### Coumadin [^111nwPXz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Warfarin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which include Factors II, VII, IX, and X, and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post-ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin K promotes the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins that are essential for biological activity. Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration; however, the peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of Coumadin may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. This is consistent with the half-lives of the affected vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins: Factor II - 60 hours, VII - 4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, X - 48 to 72 hours, and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Coumadin is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of warfarin. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans, but generally has more rapid clearance.

- **Absorption**: Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed.

### Observations on possible effects of daily vitamin K replacement, especially upon warfarin therapy [^111P3vBH]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Daily parenteral vitamin K supplement is now recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients receiving IV hyperalimentation. This is considered preferable to the previous recommendations of weekly parenteral or oral supplements, or in some cases, no supplement at all. Supplemental vitamin K1 will ensure adequate supplies for hepatic saturation and thus the production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulants protein C, protein S, and protein Z. However, this is not the entire story. The recommended supplement will affect other physiological systems that utilize vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation.

Vitamin K is not just one molecule but rather consists of two natural substances, vitamin K1 and K2, and the synthetic K3s. It is not understood what effect, if any, may occur due to the saturation or competition from vitamin K1 on the functioning of vitamins K2 and the derivatives of K3 in vivo. These have roles in bone mineralization, cell growth, and blood vessel health, all known to be influenced by vitamins K. There are possibly other physiological systems yet to be studied in relation to vitamins K and gamma-carboxylation.

This review also considers the available research on warfarin when administered to patients receiving hyperalimentation and the potential effects the vitamin K supplements may have. Since studies at the time of writing have not controlled for vitamin K intake, consideration is given to whether one should expect any change in previously reported outcomes when using low-dose warfarin for prophylaxis against central vein thrombosis. Additionally, possible physiological implications are discussed.

### Xeloda [^117TStZe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **Increased risk of bleeding with concomitant use of vitamin K antagonists**: Advise patients on vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, that they are at an increased risk of severe bleeding while taking Xeloda. Advise these patients that INR should be monitored more frequently, and dosage modifications of the vitamin K antagonist may be required while taking and after discontinuation of Xeloda. Advise these patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if signs or symptoms of bleeding occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Serious adverse reactions from dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency**: Inform patients of the potential for serious and life-threatening adverse reactions due to DPD deficiency and discuss with your patient whether they should be tested for genetic variants of DPYD that are associated with an increased risk of serious adverse reactions from the use of Xeloda. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if symptoms of severe mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

- **Cardiotoxicity**: Advise patients of the risk of cardiotoxicity and to immediately contact their healthcare provider for new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Diarrhea**: Inform patients experiencing grade 2 diarrhea (an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools) that they should seek medical guidance.

### Welchol [^116PdaRT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies**: Welchol may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients with a susceptibility to deficiencies in vitamin K (e.g. those on warfarin or with malabsorption syndromes) or other fat-soluble vitamins may be at increased risk when taking Welchol. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Drug interactions**: Welchol reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Administer drugs with a known interaction at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs that have not been tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider administering them at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU)**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with PKU. Welchol for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 3.75 gram packet contains 27 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Welchol for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Welchol for oral suspension.

### Vitamin k for improved anticoagulation control in patients receiving warfarin [^111CPwot]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Effective use of warfarin involves maintaining the international normalised ratio (INR) within a relatively narrow therapeutic range. However, patients exhibit a wide range of responses to their warfarin dosage. Overcoagulation can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding, while undercoagulation may result in increased clot formation. There is some evidence that patients with a variable response to warfarin may benefit from a concomitant low dose of vitamin K.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of concomitant supplementation of low-dose oral vitamin K for anticoagulation control in patients being initiated on or taking a maintenance dose of warfarin.

- **Search methods**: To identify previous reviews, we searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2011). To identify primary studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014), Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations database and Ovid MEDLINE® (OvidSP) (1946 to 25 February 2014), Embase (OvidSP) (1974 to week 8 of 2014), Science Citation Index Expanded™ & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science™) (1945 to 27 February 2014), and the NHS Economics Evaluations Database (NHS EED) (via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014). We did not apply any language or date restrictions. We used additional methods to identify grey literature and ongoing studies.

### Vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein as multifaceted protector of vascular and tissue integrity [^114LHD6A]. Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist, widely prescribed to reduce coagulation by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Patients on warfarin treatment are prone to develop vascular calcification. Specimens of aortic valves were obtained from 45 patients (57.8% women; mean age, 71 years) undergoing heart transplantation with clinically manifest aortic valve stenosis or insufficiency, among whom 10 patients received preoperative treatment with vitamin K antagonists.

The grade of aortic valve calcification in patients with preoperative fenprocoumon treatment was two-fold greater than in matched controls without such treatment. A post hoc patient-level meta-analysis of eight prospective randomized trials compared the changes in coronary percent atheroma volume and the calcium index in matched arterial segments of patients with coronary artery disease who were treated (n = 171) or not (n = 4,129) with warfarin during an 18- to 24-month period. A significantly greater annualized increase in calcium index was observed in warfarin-treated compared with non-warfarin-treated patients (median 0.03 versus 0.02; P < 0.001).

A patient-matched cohort (n = 164 per group) produced confirmatory results; the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of having a greater calcium index in relation to warfarin treatment was 1.16 (CI, 1.05–1.28; P = 0.003).

### Xeloda [^113ozRkt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Increased risk of bleeding with concomitant use of vitamin K antagonists**: Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking Xeloda concomitantly with oral vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Clinically significant increases in prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) have been reported in patients who were on stable doses of a vitamin K antagonist at the time Xeloda was introduced. These events have occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating Xeloda and, in a few cases, within one month after stopping Xeloda. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases.

- **Monitoring and adjustment**: Monitor INR more frequently and adjust the dose of the vitamin K antagonist as appropriate [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Additional information**: See full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

### Optimizing quality care for the oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) [^1129QZ9T]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the only oral anticoagulants for decades. The management of anticoagulant therapy with VKAs is challenging due to their intricate pharmacological properties. The success of VKA therapy depends on the quality of treatment, which is ensured through continuing comprehensive communication and education.

- **Educational program**: The program should address crucial aspects of VKA therapy, including the initiation of treatment, pharmacological considerations, dietary factors, and drug-drug interactions, as well as the temporary suspension of treatment during surgical interventions or invasive procedures.

- **Patient education**: The initial and continuing education of patients is of paramount importance. Patient associations can play a significant role in this educational process.

- **Anticoagulation clinics**: The quality of treatment is enhanced when patients are managed in anticoagulation clinics. Furthermore, a federation of these clinics can improve patient care through regular meetings that update knowledge on VKA treatment.

The learning objectives of this paper are to enable readers to properly approach patients starting VKA treatment, recognize possible pitfalls of the treatment, and provide appropriate solutions.

### Dietary vitamin K and therapeutic warfarin alter the susceptibility to vascular calcification in experimental chronic kidney disease [^116bX7C2]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is cardiovascular disease, with vascular calcification being a key modifier of disease progression. A local regulator of vascular calcification is vitamin K. This γ-glutamyl carboxylase substrate is an essential cofactor in the activation of several extracellular matrix proteins that inhibit calcification. Warfarin, a common therapy in dialysis patients, inhibits the recycling of vitamin K and thereby decreases the inhibitory activity of these proteins. In this study, we sought to determine whether modifying vitamin K status, either by increasing dietary vitamin K intake or by antagonism with therapeutic doses of warfarin, could alter the development of vascular calcification in male Sprague-Dawley rats with adenine-induced CKD.

- **Effect of warfarin on CKD rats**: Treatment of CKD rats with warfarin markedly increased pulse pressure and pulse wave velocity, as well as significantly increased calcium concentrations in the thoracic aorta (3-fold), abdominal aorta (8-fold), renal artery (4-fold), and carotid artery (20-fold).

- **Impact of dietary vitamin K1**: In contrast, treatment with high dietary vitamin K1 increased vitamin K tissue concentrations (10–300-fold) and blunted the development of vascular calcification.

Thus, vitamin K has an important role in modifying mechanisms linked to the susceptibility of arteries to calcify in an experimental model of CKD.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios - Is there a general consensus [^11382rdD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Anticoagulant therapy is fundamental for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. With an aging population, the number of people requiring chronic oral anticoagulation to manage conditions such as atrial fibrillation is increasing. Currently available options for anticoagulation include vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, primarily warfarin) and the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban). However, several studies describe the risk of hemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulants. VKA use has been associated with more than double the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) compared with non-use, while patients receiving DOAC therapy have a lower or comparable risk of ICH or major bleeding compared with VKA therapy. Although DOACs have significantly changed the anticoagulation therapy landscape, DOAC-treated patients remain at some risk of major bleeding (up to 5% of patients, based on clinical trial data).

Prompt anticoagulation reversal during severe or life-threatening bleeding events is a key component of multimodal therapy in these complex and fortunately rare clinical scenarios. However, the decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit–risk ratio of supporting hemostasis and potentially promoting post-reversal thrombosis. The advisability of administering reversal agents depends upon several clinical factors, including patient stability, timing of the last anticoagulant dose, and baseline coagulation assays (particularly international normalized ratio [INR]).

### Assessment of the efficacy of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen in lowering the international normalised ratio in over-anticoagulated patients: a randomised clinical trial [^115YLxsj]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). High credibility.

Guidelines advocate using fixed doses of oral vitamin K to reverse excessive anticoagulation in warfarinised patients who are either asymptomatic or have minor bleeds. Over-anticoagulated patients present with a wide range of international normalised ratio (INR) values, and response to fixed doses of vitamin K varies. Consequently, a significant proportion of patients remain outside their target INR after vitamin K administration, making them prone to either haemorrhage or thromboembolism.

The study compared the performance of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen to that of a fixed-dose regimen, with the primary measure being the proportion of over-anticoagulated patients returning to their target INR within 24 hours. One hundred and eighty-one patients with an index INR > 6.0 (asymptomatic or with minor bleeding) were randomly allocated to receive oral administration of either a tailored dose (based on index INR and body surface area) or a fixed dose (1 or 2 mg) of vitamin K. A greater proportion of patients treated with the tailored dose returned to within the target INR range compared to the fixed-dose regimen (68.9% vs. 52.8%; P = 0.026), while a smaller proportion of patients remained above the target INR range (12.2% vs. 34.0%; P < 0.001). Individualised vitamin K dosing is more accurate than the fixed-dose regimen in lowering INR to within the target range in excessively anticoagulated patients.

### New strategies for effective treatment of vitamin K antagonist-associated bleeding [^117F8XaC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been used as oral anticoagulants in the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events for over half a century. Although these antagonists are effective in the management of thromboembolic events, the need for routine monitoring and the associated risk of bleeding has prompted the development and licensing of direct oral anticoagulants for specific clinical indications. Despite these developments, vitamin K antagonists remain the oral anticoagulants of choice in many clinical conditions.

Severe bleeding associated with oral anticoagulation requires urgent reversal. Several options for the reversal of vitamin K antagonists exist, including vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates, and plasma. In this manuscript, we review the evidence and provide physicians with treatment strategies for more effective management of vitamin K antagonist-associated bleeding.

### Poor correlation of supratherapeutic international normalised ratio and vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factor levels during warfarin therapy [^113B7smd]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio (ST-INR) are at risk for bleeding. ST-INR is corrected by withholding warfarin therapy and often by supplementing vitamin K or providing vitamin K-dependent factors; the exact therapeutic decision is based on the extent of the prolonged INR. Currently, ST-INRs are frequently observed in clinical practice due to the use of sensitive recombinant tissue thromboplastin reagents and automation. However, there are scant data correlating an ST-INR with various vitamin K-dependent factors.

This prospective cohort study, set in a large tertiary care teaching hospital for the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, defined the relationship between ST-INR (> 5.0) and measured vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors. Prothrombin time, INR, and vitamin K-dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X were measured in 78 patients with an INR > 5.0 (ST-INR) who were on warfarin therapy for more than 2 months. There was no significant relationship between the ST-INR and levels of important vitamin K-dependent factors II and X. These data support the recent guidelines that the management of an INR > 5.0 should be driven by the clinical determinants rather than specific INR values per se.

### Concerns about clinical efficacy and safety of warfarin in diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation [^115AaiME]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Low credibility.

Warfarin exerts anticoagulant effects by inhibiting the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. However, this type of posttranslational modification is also essential for the proper functioning of other gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) proteins, such as osteocalcin (bone Gla protein) and matrix Gla protein (MGP). Osteocalcin-deficient mice have been shown to develop hyperostosis, whereas gamma-carboxylation confers a greater Ca-binding capacity to osteocalcin, playing a crucial role in normal bone mineralization. Therefore, warfarin may have deleterious effects on bone health.

Circulating vitamin K levels were decreased in women with osteoporotic hip fracture and inversely correlated with the incidence of vertebral fracture. High levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin, a marker of low vitamin K status, were associated with reduced lumbar bone mineral density and predicted the increased risk of hip fracture in healthy women. Moreover, intake of vitamin K-rich food is restricted in AF patients receiving warfarin. Consistent with these findings, the risk of osteoporotic bone fracture was reported to be significantly increased in elderly patients with AF receiving long-term warfarin therapy compared with untreated subjects.

Meta-analysis revealed that the risk of bone fracture was significantly lower in AF patients receiving NOACs compared with warfarin. As is the case with AF, osteoporotic bone fracture is increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, especially in those with a long-term disease history.

### Perioperative hemostatic management of patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^113SRUW5]. Anesthesiology (2008). High credibility.

Clinicians, including anesthesiologists, surgeons, and intensivists, are frequently called on to correct coagulopathy in patients receiving oral anticoagulation therapy. Before elective surgery, anticoagulation reversal may be undertaken over several days by discontinuing warfarin or vitamin K treatment, but rapid correction is required in an emergency. European and American guidelines recommend prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) for anticoagulation reversal in patients with life-threatening bleeding and an increased international normalized ratio. Compared with human fresh frozen plasma, PCCs provide quicker correction of the international normalized ratio and improved bleeding control.

Although there are historic concerns regarding potential infectious and thrombotic risks with PCCs, PCC formulations are much improved. Recombinant activated factor VII is a potential alternative to PCCs, but preclinical comparisons suggest that PCCs are more effective in correcting coagulopathy. Although many patients who require rapid reversal of warfarin are currently treated with fresh frozen plasma, PCCs should be considered as an alternative therapy.

### Novel horizons in anticoagulation: The emerging role of factor XI inhibitors across different settings [^116XhUNu]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

Anticoagulants are key in the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Historically, vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin were the mainstay of anticoagulant therapy, prized for their effectiveness in a broad range of thromboembolic conditions. The emergence of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) since 2010 has marked a significant shift in this landscape. DOAC have rapidly replaced vitamin K antagonists for various indications after demonstrating at least comparable efficacy in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, and in the treatment of VTE, with enhanced safety. In this regard, a noteworthy advantage of DOAC is the reduction of the risk of serious bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage, compared to that associated with the use of vitamin K antagonists. Additionally, DOAC offer the convenience of fewer drug-drug and food-drug interactions, and fixed-dose administration without the need for routine monitoring of the anticoagulant effect.

Despite the benefits of DOAC, thromboembolic diseases continue to pose substantial morbidity and mortality risks, and existing anticoagulants, by disrupting hemostasis, may result in bleeding complications that offset the benefits of antithrombotic treatment. This underscores the ongoing need for effective anticoagulants with lower bleeding risks. In response, research has shifted towards upstream factors in the coagulation system, focusing primarily on the contact pathway, where factor XI (FXI) has emerged as a promising target.

### Role of prothrombin complex concentrates in reversing warfarin anticoagulation: A review of the literature [^1114be4B]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Over-anticoagulation is a common problem with warfarin therapy and can lead to major or life-threatening bleeding. The goal of urgent warfarin reversal is to elevate or replace vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. In the United States, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is considered the standard of care for warfarin reversal.

Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) offer an alternative to FFP for rapidly replacing deficient clotting factors and correcting the international normalized ratio (INR). However, few prospective clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these concentrates relative to other treatment modalities. A review of the published literature over the last 30 years found that PCCs offer a rapid and specific method for replacing vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and restoring normal hemostasis in the context of over-coagulation. In those studies in which PCCs were compared with FFP, PCCs were found more effective in shortening the time to INR correction and were associated with a low risk of thrombotic adverse events.

Evidence-based treatment guidelines are needed to optimize the use of PCCs for warfarin reversal.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^1156yJMb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were first introduced in the 1920s from studies on the "hemorrhagic" effect of spoiled sweet clover consumption by cattle and have evolved ever since to the cornerstone of oral anticoagulation therapy. The most commonly used VKA in the United States is warfarin, while in some European countries acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon are commonly used. VKAs exhibit their anticoagulant effect by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the post-translational modification of vitamin K–dependent proteins. Inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 results in impaired synthesis of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, as well as of anticoagulant proteins C, S, and Z. The primary indications for VKA use are prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or mechanical cardiac valves.

Although VKAs are efficacious in the prevention and treatment of VTE and AF-related thromboembolic complications, their use has some hindrances. First, the dose required to provide therapeutic anticoagulation is highly variable between individuals. It is influenced by various pharmacogenetic parameters, such as polymorphisms affecting VKA pharmacokinetics (cytochrome CYP2C9 gene that regulates VKAs hepatic metabolism) and pharmacodynamics (VKORC1 gene). Second, co-administration of other medications, such as…

### Implementation of genotype-guided dosing of warfarin with point-of-care genetic testing in three UK clinics: A matched cohort study [^116V2Rqs]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is widely used as an anticoagulant in the UK and internationally. It is an effective treatment for venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of embolic strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, warfarin can be challenging to use because of its narrow therapeutic index and the inability to predict individual dose requirements, with maintenance doses varying from 0.5 to 20 mg/day. Response to warfarin is monitored using the international normalised ratio (INR), with a target range between 2 and 3 in patients with AF. The dose is subsequently increased, decreased, or maintained depending on the INR value. Establishing the maintenance dose early is important as it reduces both the risk of complications (bleeding and thrombosis) and the number of clinic visits required for INR monitoring, thus increasing convenience for both patients and clinics.

Many factors influence warfarin dose requirements, including demographic, clinical, and genetic factors. Genetic factors have the greatest influence: two significant variants are in the CYP2C9 gene, which is involved in the metabolism of warfarin. Individuals carrying these variants have reduced metabolic capacity with an increased warfarin half-life, therefore requiring a lower dose to achieve a therapeutic INR. The other variant is in the vitamin K epoxide reductase gene, VKORC1, an activator of the extrinsic clotting pathway, which warfarin antagonizes. Variation in VKORC1 also influences the warfarin dose.

Dosing algorithms that predict maintenance warfarin dose requirements of an individual based on a combination…

### Effects of prothrombin complex concentrate and recombinant activated factor VII on vitamin K antagonist induced anticoagulation [^114d66wg]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Warfarin and its derivatives are widely used for the prevention of thrombotic incidents. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) have been used clinically for the acute reversal of this agent. However, there is a paucity of data on the comparative efficacies of these hemostatic interventions.

- **Materials and methods**: Using in vivo rat and in vitro human models of anticoagulation, we compared PCC and rFVIIa on the recovery of endogenous thrombin generation. For in vivo reversal of anticoagulation, saline (control), PCC 50 U ml(-1), or rFVIIa 100 μg ml(-1) was given to rats that received phenprocoumon (2.5 mg kg(-1)) orally. For the in vitro model, plasma samples from warfarin-treated individuals with INR values of 2.1–6.7 were spiked with PCC (0.2, 0.4, or 0.72 U ml(-1)) or rFVIIa (3.0 μg/ml). The treatments were evaluated using prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin generation (Thrombinoscope).

- **Results**: Administration of phenprocoumon to rats prolonged PT (14.7 ± 0.5 to 50.43 ± 0.7 s) and decreased peak thrombin generation by 89 ± 2.3%. Administration of PCC dose-dependently reversed the anticoagulation effects both in warfarin-treated human plasma and in phenprocoumon-treated rats by shortening PT and increasing peak thrombin levels. However, rFVIIa only reversed PT but had minimal effects on peak thrombin levels.

- **Conclusion**: Both PCC and rFVIIa reverse warfarin anticoagulation based on PT, but only PCC restores overall thrombin generation.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and warfarin in cirrhotic patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^1117Kdx2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver. Despite its effectiveness, warfarin has several limitations. It has a low therapeutic index, involves multiple food and drug interactions, and requires regular coagulation monitoring. These challenges are exacerbated in cirrhotic patients who already have an innately elevated international normalized ratio (INR). Warfarin is involved in a complex pathway of drug metabolism by human cytochrome P450 (CYP; CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4), contributing to a wide range of warfarin–drug interactions. Liver cirrhosis can further impact the enzymes responsible for warfarin metabolism. Conversely, drug-drug interactions through CYP metabolism are generally not a significant issue for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), except for rivaroxaban, which has 66% CYP metabolism. Therefore, NOACs may have advantages over warfarin in patients with cirrhotic atrial fibrillation.

NOACs such as apixaban and rivaroxaban directly inhibit factor Xa, while dabigatran directly inhibits thrombin (factor IIa). These NOACs are considered safer and more convenient alternatives to warfarin as they do not require regular coagulation monitoring. However, cirrhotic patients were excluded from all large clinical trials of NOACs, leaving a gap in data about their clinical outcomes in this specific patient population. To date, most available data have been limited to small retrospective clinical studies.

### A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen identifies FSP1 as the warfarin-resistant vitamin K reductase [^113LnQvj]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The process of vitamin K-dependent (VKD) carboxylation relies on the redox cycling of vitamin K. In vitro studies suggest that vitamin K is reduced to KH2, the active form of the vitamin for VKD carboxylation, via two pathways: a warfarin-sensitive DTT-dependent pathway and a warfarin-resistant NAD(P)H-dependent pathway. VKOR was proposed to be responsible for the warfarin-sensitive pathway, while the enzyme for the warfarin-resistant (or antidotal) pathway was thought to be NQO1.

However, we have previously demonstrated that high doses of vitamin K were sufficient to rescue warfarin poisoning in both wild-type and NQO1-deficient mice. Additionally, the warfarin-resistant vitamin K reductase (VKR) activity, distinct from VKOR and NQO1, was detected in both wild-type and NQO1-knockout mice. This suggests that NQO1 is not the warfarin-resistant VKR. Whether VKOR is sufficient for the two-step reduction of K epoxy (K epo) to KH2, and whether the antidotal effect of vitamin K arises from competition with warfarin for VKOR binding, or from the existence of a warfarin-resistant VKR that bypasses dysfunctional VKOR, remains elusive.

### Supplemental vitamin K improves the stability of anticoagulation in a patient with low tissue stores of vitamin K secondary to coeliac disease [^116V2ZvH]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Maintenance of a patient's international normalised ratio (INR) within the appropriate target range remains a challenge in clinical practice. The effects of medication, alcohol, and compliance on stable control are well documented. Recent evidence also shows that supplemental vitamin K in patients with low body stores improves the stability of INR in these patients. Here, the case of a 57-year-old with coeliac disease requiring warfarin for a metallic mitral valve, who had poor INR stability resulting in thrombotic and bleeding complications, is described. Her vitamin K body stores were extremely low. Supplementation of vitamin K (100 μg daily) resulted in improvement in anticoagulation stability (mean (SD) 3.41 (1.68) vs 4.68 (3.34)). The percentage time spent within the target INR range doubled following vitamin K supplementation. This case illustrates a relatively new approach to managing patients with highly unstable INR levels and provides extra understanding of factors influencing INR stability.

### Unique secretion mode of human protein Z: its Gla domain is responsible for inefficient, vitamin K-dependent and warfarin-sensitive secretion [^115p8GFs]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Protein Z is a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein involved in the regulation of blood coagulation. Plasma concentrations of protein Z vary widely between subjects and are greatly reduced during warfarin therapy. We developed a sensitive and quantitative assay for protein secretion using a secretory luciferase to explore the mode of secretion of protein Z compared with that of factor X. Protein Z secretion was much less efficient than factor X and was totally dependent upon added vitamin K, while factor X secretion was not. Protein Z secretion was highly sensitive to warfarin treatment of the synthesizing cells. In contrast, although factor X secretion was not precluded by warfarin, its gamma-carboxylation was completely blocked.

- **Exchange of propeptide and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain**: An exchange of the propeptide and/or gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain between protein Z and factor X reproduced the inefficient and warfarin-sensitive secretion pattern of protein Z, and vice versa. Joining of the propeptide and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain to luciferase also demonstrated that the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain of protein Z was responsible for its warfarin-sensitive secretion. Thus, it was concluded that the difference observed in secretion patterns of protein Z and factor X was mainly based on the structure of their gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domains.

### The association of vitamin K status with warfarin sensitivity at the onset of treatment [^114c4bMp]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

We investigated the association of vitamin K status with warfarin sensitivity among 40 orthopedic patients beginning perioperative algorithm-dosed warfarin. Baseline vitamin K status was assessed using plasma vitamin K-1 and vitamin K-1 2,3 epoxide concentrations, and a questionnaire-based estimation of usual vitamin K intake. Warfarin sensitivity was assessed as the increase in the International Normalized Ratio (INR) after two doses of 5 mg of warfarin and as the 4-day accumulation of under-gamma-carboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II), adjusted for warfarin dose requirement. Multivariate models were used to assess vitamin K variables as predictors of warfarin sensitivity. The mean INR increase was 0.53 U, and the mean PIVKA-II increase was 771 ng/ml/mg warfarin. Demographic factors were not associated with warfarin response. For each 1 standard deviation (SD) lower value of plasma vitamin K-1, but not the other vitamin K variables, the INR rose 0.24 U (P ≤ 0.01). A higher usual vitamin K intake and plasma vitamin K-1, and lower plasma vitamin K-1 2,3 epoxide, were all associated with a lower PIVKA-II increase over 4 days. Respective differences in PIVKA-II accumulation per SD increase of each variable were -165, -218, and 236 ng/ml/mg warfarin (all P ≤ 0.05). We concluded that dietary and biochemical measures of vitamin K status were associated with early warfarin sensitivity.

### Thromboembolic events after vitamin K antagonist reversal with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate: Exploratory analyses of two randomized, plasma-controlled studies [^116D7o8K]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Health care providers prescribe warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, to more than 3.4 million patients annually in the United States for various prothrombotic conditions. The Food and Drug Administration describes warfarin as among the top 10 drugs with the largest number of serious adverse drug reactions submitted during the 1990s and 2000s.

Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with prothrombotic conditions by inhibiting the synthesis of functional vitamin K–dependent clotting factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. Patients receiving vitamin K antagonists who are actively bleeding or in need of an urgent surgical procedure require rapid reversal of anticoagulation through the prompt replenishment of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. Literature and guidelines recommend a combination therapy of vitamin K and either plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate for the acute reversal of oral anticoagulation.

### Shifting the paradigm: A population health approach to the management of direct oral anticoagulants [^113QqZGj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Until a decade ago, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, enjoyed nearly 60 years of market exclusivity as the only available oral anticoagulants. With their variable dosing, narrow therapeutic window, frequent laboratory monitoring, and a plethora of endogenous and exogenous factors impacting the quality of therapy, VKAs have represented a significant therapeutic challenge, requiring substantial resources to manage.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) first appeared on the US market in 2010 and have reshaped the anticoagulation landscape. With fixed dosing, predictable pharmacokinetics, and no intensive therapeutic monitoring requirement, DOACs are generally considered safer and more convenient than VKAs. Despite these advantages, DOACs are still associated with inappropriate prescribing and associated adverse events, resulting in a concerted effort from regulatory agencies to improve anticoagulation safety. The Joint Commission recently highlighted the need for DOAC vigilance via "Sentinel Event Alert 61" as well as updated National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) to "reduce the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulant therapy".

These safety concerns highlight that while DOACs do not require monitoring in the traditional sense (i.e. frequent scheduled one-on-one interactions between anticoagulation care providers and individual patients), there is an increasing need for oversight. This increased demand presents a unique challenge for anticoagulation programs. Providing DOAC oversight within the traditional practice model, which was justifiable.

### Jantoven [^115i1QmN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Monitoring to achieve optimal anticoagulation**: Jantoven has a narrow therapeutic range, and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, careful monitoring of anticoagulation during Jantoven therapy is essential. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize within the therapeutic range. Once stabilized, maintain dosing by performing periodic INR tests. The frequency should be based on the clinical situation, with generally acceptable intervals ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with Jantoven, as well as when other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring Jantoven therapy.

- **Renal impairment**: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Missed dose**: The anticoagulant effect of Jantoven persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose.

### Fracture risks in patients treated with different oral anticoagulants: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115yprsH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly prescribed to prevent or treat thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is a traditional OAC and has been a primary long-term treatment option for these conditions for decades. Recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been approved as alternatives and have demonstrated similar or superior efficacy and safety compared with warfarin. Because aging is one of the strongest risk factors for both atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, the prescription of OACs has gradually increased in the aging population worldwide.

Some previous studies have suggested that warfarin may increase fracture risks via its vitamin K antagonizing effect, which impairs bone mineralization. In contrast, NOACs are independent of mechanisms associated with vitamin K antagonists. However, previous studies have provided conflicting evidence on the association between warfarin and fracture risks. A prior cohort study published in 2017 compared the fracture risk associated with an NOAC (dabigatran) and warfarin and reported a significantly lower fracture risk in dabigatran users. Another cohort study in 2017 observed no significant difference in fracture risks among patients taking NOACs (both dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors) and warfarin. A meta-analysis in 2018 based on 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that patients treated with NOACs had a lower fracture risk than those treated with warfarin.
