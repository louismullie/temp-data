## Question

What is the work up for chronically elevated RBCs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to work up chronically elevated red blood cell (RBC) counts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true erythrocytosis and excluding spurious or relative causes. Then, I should classify the process into clonal versus non-clonal etiologies using JAK2 testing and erythropoietin levels. Next, I will evaluate secondary causes systematically, including hypoxia, endogenous EPO-producing tumors, and medications. After that, I need to consider hereditary erythrocytosis when secondary causes are not found. Finally, I will address special scenarios such as masked polycythemia vera, splanchnic vein thrombosis, and idiopathic erythrocytosis, and close with management principles and follow-up plans [^112DVQRU] [^11686JZY].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its chronicity, because I need to ensure we are dealing with true erythrocytosis rather than transient or spurious elevations; persistent elevation of hemoglobin above 16.5 g/dL in men or 16.0 g/dL in women, or hematocrit above 49% in men or 48% in women, on at least two occasions separated by time, is a reasonable threshold to trigger evaluation, and I should also consider sex-, race-, and altitude-adjusted norms to avoid overcalling disease in high-altitude residents or individuals with high-normal values at the extreme tail of the distribution [^11686JZY] [^11798zui].

> Wait, let me verify whether this is true erythrocytosis versus an apparent increase due to plasma volume contraction; I should check for dehydration, diuretic use, or recent phlebotomy, and if uncertainty persists, consider measuring red cell mass, although many centers no longer perform isotopic RCM routinely and rely on clinical correlation and serial counts, recognizing that RCM adds limited diagnostic value in most modern algorithms [^11686JZY].

> Next, I should review the CBC with differential and indices carefully; if I see leukocytosis or thrombocytosis, particularly with a left-shifted granulopoiesis, that nudges me toward a myeloproliferative neoplasm such as polycythemia vera, whereas isolated erythrocytosis without other lineages affected is more suggestive of secondary causes or hereditary erythrocytosis, and I must remember to keep masked PV in mind when hemoglobin and hematocrit are not strikingly high but the clinical picture fits an MPN [^113YdaL2] [^114UXnEC].

> I will now examine the peripheral smear; I need to ensure there are no dysplastic changes or leukoerythroblastic features that would point to myelodysplastic syndrome or marrow infiltration, and I should document erythroid morphology, because an MPN pattern supports PV while secondary erythrocytosis typically shows normocytic, normochromic cells without dysplasia [^112LM63t].

> Let me first confirm the pivotal early tests; JAK2 V617F mutation testing on peripheral blood with an assay sensitive to at least 1–3% mutant allele burden is recommended in all patients with persistent, significant erythrocytosis, and if V617F is negative but suspicion remains high, I should reflex to JAK2 exon 12 testing because a minority of PV harbor exon 12 mutations; concurrently, I should obtain a serum erythropoietin level, expecting it to be low or inappropriately normal in PV and elevated in secondary erythrocytosis [^113YdaL2] [^115Pp3z4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the interpretation: a positive JAK2 mutation in the setting of sustained erythrocytosis essentially establishes PV unless there is compelling evidence of a secondary process, whereas a negative JAK2 with elevated EPO strongly supports secondary erythrocytosis and should redirect me to search for hypoxia, tumors, or drugs, while a negative JAK2 with low EPO keeps PV in the differential and may prompt marrow examination if clinical suspicion persists [^115Pp3z4] [^1172nQUo].

> For secondary erythrocytosis, I need to ensure I evaluate for chronic hypoxia systematically; I should check pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases, consider sleep apnea testing if symptoms or nocturnal desaturation are present, obtain pulmonary function tests when obstructive or restrictive lung disease is suspected, and assess for right-to-left cardiac shunts such as Eisenmenger physiology, remembering that smoking and carbon monoxide exposure elevate carboxyhemoglobin and functionally reduce oxygen delivery, thereby stimulating EPO [^114KoTQ2].

> I should also consider endogenous EPO production; let me think about renal imaging with abdominal ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging to look for renal masses or cysts that can secrete EPO, and I should not forget hepatic lesions such as hepatocellular carcinoma or hemangioblastoma that can be ectopic EPO sources, especially when EPO is high and no hypoxic lung or cardiac disease is identified [^114s1Z5Q] [^114KoTQ2].

> But wait, what if medications are the driver; I need to check for testosterone therapy and other androgens, which commonly increase hematocrit and may necessitate dose reduction or temporary cessation, and I should also review for SGLT-2 inhibitors and other emerging agents linked to erythrocytosis, counseling patients on risks and arranging CBC monitoring after initiation or dose changes while shared decision-making guides continuation or modification of therapy [^116mfAx6] [^113YdgKi].

> If JAK2 is negative and EPO is low, I should verify the possibility of hereditary erythrocytosis, particularly in young patients or those with a family history; I will now examine for high oxygen-affinity hemoglobin variants with hemoglobin electrophoresis and oxygen dissociation studies, consider 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, and pursue genetic testing for oxygen-sensing pathway mutations including VHL, PHD2/EGLN1, EPAS1/HIF2A, and EPOR when indicated, tailoring the panel to phenotype and EPO level [^114KoTQ2].

> Hold on, I should verify special diagnostic pitfalls; masked PV can present with hemoglobin and hematocrit near or even within normal limits if there is concomitant iron deficiency or expanded plasma volume, so in the right clinical context with low EPO and other MPN features, I should proceed to bone marrow biopsy to assess erythroid predominance and megakaryocyte morphology, and consider endogenous erythroid colony assays where available to support autonomous erythropoiesis [^115Pp3z4] [^11686JZY].

> I need to ensure I do not miss MPN-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis; in patients with Budd-Chiari or portal vein thrombosis, even with normal peripheral counts, I should test for JAK2 because approximately half of idiopathic SVT cases harbor JAK2 mutations, and some will have unmasked MPN with increased red cell mass on specialized testing, which changes management toward cytoreduction and anticoagulation strategies [^117Fzkyp] [^111gjakt] [^115fkLsm].

> Let me reconsider when the workup is exhaustive yet the etiology remains unclear; idiopathic erythrocytosis remains a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out PV, secondary causes, and hereditary conditions, and management is individualized with careful thrombotic risk assessment, judicious phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit below approximately 45–48%, and low-dose aspirin when no contraindications exist, acknowledging uncertainty in thrombotic risk and the absence of randomized trial data for phlebotomy in this subgroup [^1161c2nN].

> Finally, I should confirm a rational management approach; for PV, phlebotomy to a hematocrit target less than 45% reduces thrombotic risk and cytoreductive therapy such as hydroxyurea or interferon is added based on age and thrombotic history, while allopurinol and aspirin are used as indicated; for secondary erythrocytosis, treatment of the underlying hypoxia, tumor, or offending drug is paramount; for hereditary erythrocytosis, counseling and targeted genetic guidance are key, and in all cases I should monitor for iron deficiency from repeated phlebotomies and counsel on symptom surveillance for thrombosis, adjusting the plan as new data emerge [^112DVQRU] [^1141UaUZ].

The workup for chronically elevated RBCs begins with **confirming true erythrocytosis** by repeating CBC, assessing plasma volume, and excluding spurious causes [^11686JZY]. Then, **classify as primary or secondary** using JAK2 V617F testing and serum EPO [^113YdaL2] [^113eZLHf]; low EPO suggests PV, while high EPO suggests secondary causes. Next, **evaluate secondary causes** with pulse oximetry/ABG, sleep apnea testing, renal/hepatic imaging, and medication review (testosterone, SGLT-2 inhibitors) [^116mfAx6]. If JAK2 is negative and EPO is high, consider hereditary erythrocytosis (VHL, PHD2, EPOR, Hb variants) [^1141UaUZ]. Bone marrow biopsy is reserved for **JAK2-negative, EPO-low cases** or diagnostic uncertainty. Management targets hematocrit < 45% with phlebotomy, treat underlying causes, and use cytoreduction or low-dose aspirin as indicated [^112DVQRU].

---

## Initial evaluation

### Confirm true erythrocytosis

Confirm true erythrocytosis by **repeating CBC** to verify persistent elevation, and exclude spurious causes such as dehydration, diuretics, or laboratory error. Assess plasma volume to distinguish true from relative erythrocytosis, using direct radioisotope measurement if available [^11686JZY] or infer clinically from history and exam. True erythrocytosis is defined as hemoglobin > 16.5 g/dL in women or > 18.5 g/dL in men, or hematocrit > 48% in women or > 52% in men [^11798zui].

---

### History and physical examination

History should document smoking, alcohol, diuretics, testosterone or other drugs, symptoms of hypoxia (dyspnea, snoring), and family history. Physical examination should assess for plethora, hypertension, splenomegaly, clubbing, and signs of chronic lung or cardiac disease [^116mfAx6].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Basic laboratory tests

Basic laboratory tests should include a **CBC with indices**, a reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear to assess morphology and cytopenias. Evaluate organ function with **renal and liver panels** and inflammatory status with CRP/ESR [^117Fk92E]. Assess iron status with ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron; interpret ferritin cautiously in inflammation [^113DECq2].

---

### Differentiate primary vs secondary erythrocytosis

| **Test** | **Primary erythrocytosis (pv)** | **Secondary erythrocytosis** |
|-|-|-|
| JAK2 V617F mutation | Positive in > 95% | Negative |
| Serum erythropoietin (EPO) | Low or normal | Elevated |
| Bone marrow biopsy | Hypercellular with erythroid predominance | Normal or reactive |

---

Bone marrow biopsy is reserved for **JAK2-negative cases with low EPO** or diagnostic uncertainty [^115Pp3z4].

---

## Evaluation of secondary causes

### Hypoxia-related causes

Hypoxia-related causes include chronic lung disease, sleep apnea, and congenital heart disease; screen with pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas, and polysomnography as indicated [^114KoTQ2].

---

### Renal and hepatic causes

Renal and hepatic causes include EPO-secreting tumors and cysts; evaluate with renal and hepatic imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) [^114KoTQ2].

---

### Medication-induced erythrocytosis

Medication-induced erythrocytosis is commonly due to testosterone, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or erythropoietin; review medications and discontinue offenders when possible [^116mfAx6].

---

## Evaluation of hereditary erythrocytosis

Consider hereditary erythrocytosis when secondary causes are excluded and erythrocytosis is lifelong or familial; test for **VHL, PHD2, EPOR mutations, and high-affinity hemoglobinopathies** [^1172nQUo].

---

## Indications for bone marrow biopsy

Bone marrow biopsy is indicated for **JAK2-negative cases with low EPO** or when diagnostic uncertainty persists despite initial testing [^115Pp3z4].

---

## Management principles

- **Phlebotomy**: Maintain hematocrit < 45% to reduce thrombotic risk [^notfound].
- **Treat underlying cause**: Address hypoxia, tumors, medications, or hereditary conditions.
- **Cytoreductive therapy**: Hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha for high-risk PV or intolerance to phlebotomy [^112DVQRU].
- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Low-dose aspirin for thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated [^112DVQRU].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular CBC** to track hematocrit and blood counts, with periodic clinical reassessment for symptoms, thrombosis, and disease progression. Continue to monitor and treat cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

---

The workup for chronically elevated RBCs requires a **structured approach**: confirm true erythrocytosis, distinguish primary from secondary causes, and tailor management to etiology and risk, with ongoing monitoring to prevent complications.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^11693D6F]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Three critical parameters related to RBCs

RBC count: This denotes the concentration of RBCs per microliter of blood, typically enumerated in millions. Integral to oxygen transportation, diminished counts may indicate conditions such as anemia, while elevated counts could signal disorders like polycythemia vera.

Hemoglobin: This intracellular protein is responsible for transporting oxygen to tissues and returning carbon dioxide to the lungs. Hemoglobin concentrations, quantified in grams per deciliter, can reflect various health conditions, with lower levels potentially indicative of anemia and higher levels suggestive of polycythemia vera or chronic hypoxia.

Red blood cell specific volume (RBCSV): This parameter represents the volume fraction of RBCs in the blood, also called hematocrit. Normal hematocrit ranges differ by sex. Deviations from normal ranges can indicate various conditions — low levels may suggest anemia, and high levels could indicate dehydration or other disorders.

2.2 RBC count

According to the definition of the standard RBC count in routine blood testing at our hospital, the reference range for men is 4.0 to 5.5 × 10¹²/L and that for women is 3.5 to 5.0 × 10¹²/L. After excluding patients with elevated RBC counts (> 5.5 × 10¹²/L in men and > 5.0 × 10¹²/L in women), the patients were divided into those with reduced RBC counts (< 4.0 × 10¹²/L in men and < 3.5 × 10¹²/L in women) and normal RBC counts (≥ 4.0 × 10¹²/L in men and ≥ 3.5 × 10¹²/L in women). We chose to evaluate RBC count as our primary parameter rather than hemoglobin or RBC specific volume (hematocrit), because RBC count is less affected by hypoxia, dehydration, and volume status, which can be confounding clinical factors within this patient population.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^114Eakpo]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

In acute settings, the patient blood management program focuses on the avoidance of unnecessary blood transfusions. The highest RBC transfusion targets have been advocated for patients having cardiovascular disease, especially in acute forms, ischemia, and massive bleeds. The program wisely urges the prevention of anemia, but, if prevention has not occurred, transfusions provide an acute solution. In addition, these acute blood transfusion guidelines lack specific guidance on inherited bleeding disorders, which carry a permanent risk for bleeds at low factor levels. Therein, the conservative RBC transfusion limits do not necessarily apply, and the correction of coagulation factor levels alone is not enough, as hemostasis relies on synergistic actions of several mechanisms.

To sum up, in clinics, whatever the nature of the bleeding disorder, early primary hemostasis impairment by reduced RBC numbers and the presence of anemia are to be avoided if possible. The cause of anemia needs to be clarified and managed accordingly, with iron deficiency most often being the hematological background. The active evaluation of RBCs and implementation of specific laboratory diagnosis for anemia should be considered a priority rather than an afterthought in the follow-up of patients with hemostasis and thrombosis issues. To close the circle, this review continues to further discuss what clinicians can learn from basic science and some of the latest observations that can be translated into patient management, whenever possible.

### Polycythemia vera [^114e6gBM]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The resultant hyperviscosity of the blood predisposes such patients to thrombosis. Polycythemia vera should be suspected in patients with elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, splenomegaly, or portal venous thrombosis. Secondary causes of increased red blood cell mass (e.g., heavy smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, renal disease) are more common than polycythemia vera and must be excluded. Diagnosis is made using criteria developed by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group; major criteria include elevated red blood cell mass, normal oxygen saturation, and palpable splenomegaly. Untreated patients may survive for six to 18 months, whereas adequate treatment may extend life expectancy to more than 10 years. Treatment includes phlebotomy with the possible addition of myelosuppressive agents based on a risk-stratified approach. Agents under investigation include interferon alfa-2b, anagrelide, and aspirin. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### The complete evaluation of erythrocytosis: congenital and acquired [^1172nQUo]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The approach to a patient with erythrocytosis is greatly simplified by assessing the clonality of the process upfront. In this regard, there has been a dramatic shift toward genetic testing and away from traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass. Clonal erythrocytosis is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV) and is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). All other scenarios represent non-clonal erythrocytosis, often referred to as secondary erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level is usually normal or elevated in secondary erythrocytosis and subnormal in PV. Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with peripheral blood JAK2 mutation analysis and serum Epo measurement to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. Conversely, the patient with life-long erythrocytosis is more likely to suffer from congenital polycythemia and should therefore be evaluated for germline mutations that result in enhanced Epo effect (for example, Epo receptor mutations), altered intracellular oxygen sensing (for example, mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene) or decreased P50 (for example, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathy). The order of tests in this instance depends on the clinical scenario and serum Epo level.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

In the patient presenting with an elevated blood count who does not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis needs to be considered as a possible explanation. A young patient and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should specifically raise this possibility. Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in the genes in the oxygen sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been shown to be accounted for by mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. In those who have a possible hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific investigation to rule out the more common acquired clonal disorders, and, if indicated, other secondary causes, measurement of specific cytokines as indicated, and search for specific identified molecular lesions that have been shown to cause these hereditary disorders. There remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Blood counts in adult and elderly individuals: defining the norms over eight decades of life [^113iS1J5]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The blood count is one of the most common tests used for health assessment. In elderly individuals, selection of a 'healthy' reference population for laboratory assessment is difficult due to the high prevalence of chronic morbidities, leading to uncertainty regarding appropriate reference intervals. In particular, age-specific lower haemoglobin reference limits to define anaemia are controversial. Here, we applied a data mining approach to a large dataset of 3 029 904 clinical routine samples to establish blood count reference intervals. We excluded samples from units/specialists with a high proportion of abnormal blood counts, samples from patients with an unknown or decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate, and samples with abnormal test results in selected other analytes. After sample exclusion, 566 775–572 060 samples from different individuals aged 20–100 years were available for analysis. We then used an established statistical algorithm to determine the distribution of physiological test results and calculated age- and sex-specific reference intervals. Our results show substantial trends with age in haematology analytes' reference intervals. Most notably, haemoglobin and red cell counts decline in men with advanced age, accompanied by increases in red cell volume in both sexes. These findings were confirmed in an independent dataset, and suggest an at least partly physiologic cause.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11686JZY]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approach

In clinical practice, hematology referrals for erythrocytosis are triggered by Hgb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dl/49% and 16 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, and should be confirmed by at least two separate blood counts evaluated at different time points. This should be followed by distinguishing true from apparent erythrocytosis; the former is a result of either a clonal MPN, as in PV, or a non-clonal process resulting in secondary erythrocytosis. It is also important to recognize inapparent (masked) erythrocytosis in which an increase in red cell mass (RCM) is accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma volume and therefore masked by a normal Hgb/Hct. Similarly, in situations with normal Hgb/Hct and concomitant iron deficiency, PV is often underrecognized. Conversely, an apparent erythrocytosis may result from either a reduction in plasma volume (relative erythrocytosis) or extreme high normal values which exceed the 95th percentile of sex-, race-and altitude-adjusted normal values. RCM measurement is no longer available at our institution; however, upon evaluation of its performance and practical utility in a total of 105 patients with erythrocytosis; elevated RCM was seen in 76%, 20%, 21%, and 57% with PV, secondary erythrocytosis, apparent erythrocytosis, and essential thrombocythemia, respectively. In the particular study RCM significantly correlated with both Hct and Hgb levels (p < 0.001). Hgb/Hct values below which an elevated RCM was not observed were 16/48% for males and 13/39% for females. In contrast, values > 19.5/58% for males and 17.5/53% for females were almost always associated with increased RCM. In other words, RCM measurement was found to be suboptimal in distinguishing PV from other causes of erythrocytosis and failed to offer any additional diagnostic value. Furthermore, obesity is a confounding factor that hinders accurate interpretation of RCM values.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis: a systematic review [^116mfAx6]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Secondary erythrocytosis refers to an elevation in hemoglobin or hematocrit in response to elevated serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels, rather than intrinsic dysfunction of the bone marrow. The most common cause of secondary erythrocytosis is chronic hypoxia, which can result from conditions such as hypoxic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, smoking, and cyanotic heart disease. Other secondary causes include EPO-secreting tumors and posttransplantation erythrocytosis.

Medications are an increasingly recognized cause of secondary erythrocytosis. Testosterone has been well established in the literature to cause an elevation in hemoglobin and hematocrit. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have also been identified as a cause of drug-induced erythrocytosis.,

Current guidelines on the diagnosis and management of secondary erythrocytosis are limited. In 2005, the British Society of Haematology published guidelineson the investigation and management of erythrocytosis, with a subsequent amendmentin 2007 to include JAK2 mutation testing due to its role in polycythemia vera, a primary cause of erythrocytosis. These guidelines recommended a thorough history and physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral film, JAK2 mutation testing, and other investigations to identify primary vs secondary causes. More recently, these guidelines were updated to provide recommendations for the management of several secondary causes of erythrocytosis; however, drug-induced erythrocytosis was not addressed.

Although guidelines for the management of drug-induced erythrocytosis related to testosterone are available, there is variability in the definition of erythrocytosis and recommendations. The 2018 American Urological Association guidelinesrecommended withholding testosterone if hematocrit exceeds 50% to investigate for an etiology and reducing the dose or temporarily discontinuing testosterone for hematocrit ≥ 54%. In comparison, the 2018 Endocrine Society guidelinesrecommended withholding testosterone for hematocrit > 54% until hematocrit normalizes, then resuming therapy at a lower dose; they also included therapeutic phlebotomy as an effective management strategy. Evidence to support specific hematocrit thresholds is lacking, and considerable uncertainty remains surrounding optimal management. Moreover, existing guidelines do not include suggestions on diagnostic investigations for other secondary causes of erythrocytosis and do not mention the role of cytoreductive therapy, antiplatelet agents, or anticoagulation. Furthermore, since the publication of these guidelines, new drugs associated with erythrocytosis have emerged, namely SGLT-2 inhibitors.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### Increased monocyte count and red cell distribution width as prognostic biomarkers in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^116VsBTa]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) represents a chronic, progressive lung disease with dismal prognosis despite the advent of novel antifibrotic compounds. The disease course is highly variable and prognosis remains challenging. A clinicians' friendly, easily applicable and cost-effective prognostic biomarker with uniform cut-off values that will guide disease stratification and tailoring of therapeutic approaches is missing. Several biomarkers including Mucin 5b and Toll-interacting protein single nucleotide polymorphisms, telomere length and gene expression signatures have been suggested as reliable prognosticators in patients with IPF; yet, measurement of such biomarkers remains laborious and requires expensive and sophisticated infrastructure. In addition, lack of standardization of samples' collection protocols leading to non-reproducible cut-off thresholds, further limits their widespread clinical applicability.

Abundant evidence has highlighted the role of Complete Blood Count (CBC) in the prognostication of patients with various chronic lung diseases. Asthma researchers are currently using peripheral eosinophils to implement anti-IL5/13 therapeutic regimens. Three major studies, encompassing an overall of almost 10,000 patients with IPF and scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease have recently identified elevated peripheral blood monocyte count as a biomarker of disease progression and mortality. Given that monocyte count is a clinically applicable and inexpensive biomarker, these findings warrant further investigation in real-life studies. In line with this concept another parameter of CBC, red cell distribution width (RDW), has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in several chronic lung diseases including IPF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Increased RDW seems to represent a biomarker of early hypoxemia.

To this end, our aim was to evaluate the prognostic role of parameters of CBC, including monocyte count and RDW in two independent cohorts (derivation and validation) of patients with IPF in a real-life clinical setting.

### Red cell membrane disorders: structure meets function [^114Qx2xX]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

The mature red blood cell (RBC) lacks a nucleus and organelles characteristic of most cells, but it is elegantly structured to perform the essential function of delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from all other cells while enduring the shear stress imposed by navigating small vessels and sinusoids. Over the past several decades, the efforts of biochemists, cell and molecular biologists, and hematologists have provided an appreciation of the complexity of RBC membrane structure, while studies of the RBC membrane disorders have offered valuable insights into structure-function relationships. Within the last decade, advances in genetic testing and its increased availability have made it possible to substantially build upon this foundational knowledge. Although disorders of the RBC membrane due to altered structural organization or altered transport function are heterogeneous, they often present with common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia. However, they may require substantially different management depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid emergence of complications or inappropriate interventions. We propose an algorithm for laboratory evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia with a focus on RBC membrane disorders. Here, we review the genotypic and phenotypic variability of the RBC membrane disorders in order to raise the index of suspicion and highlight the need for correct and timely diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of red cell membrane disorders [^111z6yPq]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders and hydration defects often present with the common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia, but they may require substantially different management, based on their pathophysiology. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to avoid inappropriate interventions and prevent complications. Advances in genetic testing availability within the last decade, combined with extensive foundational knowledge on RBC membrane structure and function, now facilitate the correct diagnosis in patients with a variety of hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs). Studies in patient cohorts with well-defined genetic diagnoses have revealed complications such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis, which is amenable to monitoring, prevention, and treatment, and demonstrated that splenectomy is not always an effective or safe treatment for any patient with HHA. However, a multitude of variants of unknown clinical significance have been discovered by genetic evaluation, requiring interpretation by thorough phenotypic assessment in clinical and/or research laboratories. Here we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding clinical management in patients with RBC membranopathies and propose an algorithm for the laboratory workup of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia, with a clinical case that exemplifies such a workup.

NASPGHAN pediatric IBD diagnosis — pediatricians "are ideally positioned to initiate the workup" when UC or CD is suspected, and initial laboratory studies "should assess for" inflammatory markers (elevated white blood cell and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]). Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a diagnostic and management challenge with emerging areas for exploration [^1161c2nN]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite published algorithms for approaching the work-up of erythrocytosis, a significant proportion of patients are left with uncertainty as to its aetiology and prognosis. The term 'idiopathic erythrocytosis' (IE) is applied when known primary and secondary aetiologies have been ruled out. However, the assignment of secondary aetiologies is not always straightforward or evidence based, which can lead to misdiagnosis and heterogeneity in cohort studies. Furthermore, new studies have identified germline or somatic mutations that may affect prognosis. Epidemiological and cohort data are inconsistent as to whether IE increases the risk for complications such as arterial and venous thromboembolism, clonal transformation or comorbid conditions. Randomized trials assessing the role of phlebotomy for long-term management of IE have not been performed, so treatment remains a vexing problem for clinicians. Standardization of terminology and testing strategies, including comprehensive genetic screening in clinical research, are key to refining our understanding of IE.

### Why does my patient have erythrocytosis? [^112puSuY]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Primary polycythemias are the result of intrinsic abnormalities of the hematopoietic progenitors that lead to constitutive overproduction of red cells accompanied by low erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Secondary polycythemias are caused by conditions resulting in increased EPO production. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a primary polycythemia, and is a chronic clonal progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm. A single recurrent point mutation in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 molecule (JAK2(V617F)) is present in > 95% of patients with PV. The goal of therapy in PV is to normalize blood counts to minimize the risk of thrombotic events.

Introduction

Polycythemia and erythrocytosis

There are several different parameters for diagnosis of polycythemia and erythrocytosis based on a blood count: the number of red blood cells, the hematocrit, and the hemoglobin concentration. Elevations in these measures can occur on a primary or secondary basis (Table 1). Primary polycythemia results from functional abnormalities intrinsic to erythroid progenitors, causing them to be hypersensitive to or independent of erythropoietin. This category includes polycythemia vera (PV), which is associated with acquired somatic mutations in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2), dominantly inherited primary familial and congenital polycythemia or erythrocytosis, caused by germline gain-of-function erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) mutations, and erythrocytosis due to SH2B3 mutations. Primary familial and congenital polycythemia or erythrocytosis predisposes patients to cardiovascular disorders, perhaps due to chronic augmented erythropoietin signaling in all tissues bearing EPOR. In contrast, in secondary erythrocytosis, functionally normal erythroid progenitors are exposed to increased levels of circulating erythropoiesis-stimulating factors. In most instances, the erythropoiesis-stimulating factor is erythropoietin, but cobalt, insulin growth factor 1, increased angiotensin signaling and manganese may also stimulate erythropoiesis.

Table 1.
Classification of polycythemia and erythrocytosis.

Acquired causes of secondary erythrocytosis include erythrocytosis of pulmonary disease, high altitude erythrocytosis, Eisenmenger syndrome, smoking, carboxyhemoglobinemia, erythropoietin-producing tumors, doping with erythropoietin, post- renal transplant erythrocytosis, exogenous testosterone use, and cobalt and manganese toxicities. Congenital secondary erythrocytosis can be caused by high oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants, inherited low 2,3-diphosphoglycerate leading to high hemoglobin oxygen affinity, congenital methemoglobinemia, and a recently described gain-of-function mutation of the gene encoding erythropoietin (EPO). Other congenital conditions include rare germline mutations in hypoxia sensing pathway genes, including loss of function mutations of VHL encoding von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein and EGLN1 encoding prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), and gain-of-function mutations of EPAS1 encoding hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2α.

### How I manage acquired pure red cell aplasia in adults [^116QKnvN]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder with multiple etiologies. The multifaceted nature of this disease is emphasized by the variety of concomitant clinical features. Classic idiopathic presentation aside, prompt recognition of pathogenetic clues is important because of their diagnostic and therapeutic implications. As a consequence, treatment of PRCA is diverse and strictly dependent on the presented clinical scenario. Here, we propose a series of clinical vignettes that showcase instructive representative situations derived from our routine clinical practice. Using these illustrative clinical cases, we review the diagnostic workup needed for a precise diagnosis and the currently available therapeutic options, discussing their applications in regard to the various PRCA-associated conditions and individual patients' characteristics. Finally, we propose a treatment algorithm that may offer guidance for personalized therapeutic recommendations.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — laboratory evaluation in acute ischemic priapism states that optimal blood tests have not been defined and should be selectively ordered based on specific patient risk factors and clinical suspicion; a complete blood count (CBC) may identify elevated white blood cell counts suggesting malignancy. Among men with sickle cell disease (SCD), acute ischemic priapism is associated with lower hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, reticulocyte count, white blood cells, and platelet counts, and platelet and eosinophil counts may also be elevated; however, these laboratory values often will not be used to guide treatment of the acute presentation. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or similar hemoglobinopathy testing may be appropriate in select clinical scenarios, and electrophoresis and other sickle cell testing should be reserved for select clinical scenarios, while a reticulocyte count will assist in determining the status of a patient with SCD and may be incorporated into the workup along with a CBC. Testing for potential substances may have a high rate of false negativity, and given these associated risks, a thorough medication and social history may provide enough information to determine the underlying cause without collection of these studies.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

Acute chest pain in sickle cell disease — management and diagnostic evaluation are specified as follows: in patients with sickle cell disease who report acute chest pain, emergency transfer by EMS to an acute care setting is recommended, and in patients with sickle cell disease who report acute chest pain, ACS should be excluded. In supporting text, in patients with sickle cell disease who experience chest pain, ACS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and these patients should be transferred to an acute care setting by EMS when there is clinical suspicion of ACS. For diagnostic workup when acute chest syndrome is a concern, the recommended evaluation includes an ECG, troponin test, complete blood count with white blood cell differential, reticulocyte count, anteroposterior and lateral chest radiograph, and blood and sputum cultures.

### How to manage polycythemia vera [^112DVQRU]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

My diagnostic approach in case of isolated erythrocytosis is based on the visit and the interview of patients, and on checking the causes of secondary erythrocytosis. If causes of secondary erythrocytosis are not evident and serum erythropoietin level is low-normal, I study JAK2 mutations. In the case of a patient with erythrocytosis and other signs of myeloproliferation, such as leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is likely, and I test serum erythropoietin and JAK2 mutations first. I stratify patients at diagnosis of PV according to age and history of thrombosis. I start hydroxyurea for patients who are at a high risk of thrombosis (that is, with one or two risk factors), while I continue only phlebotomy in other cases. All PV patients, if not contraindicated, receive aspirin. I follow up patients monthly until normalization of their blood cell counts or splenomegaly, and afterwards every 2 months with visit, cell blood count and blood smear evaluation. After diagnosis, I perform bone marrow biopsy only in the case of clinical signs of disease evolution.

### A rational approach to JAK2 mutation testing in patients with elevated hemoglobin: results from the JAK2 prediction cohort (JAKPOT) study [^117DmHwm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythrocytosis, most often measured as an increase in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, is a common reason for referral to internal medicine and hematology clinics and a rational approach is required to effectively identify patients with polycythemia vera while avoiding over-investigation.

Aim

We aimed to develop and validate a simple rule to predict JAK2 mutation positivity based on complete blood count parameters to aid in the diagnostic approach to patients referred for elevated hemoglobin.

Setting

Internal medicine and hematology clinics at an academic tertiary referral center.

Participants

The JAK2 Prediction Cohort (JAKPOT), a large retrospective cohort (n = 901) of patients evaluated by internal medicine and hematology specialists for elevated hemoglobin.

Design

JAK2 mutation analysis was performed in all patients and clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Patients were randomly divided into derivation and validation cohorts. A prediction rule was developed using data from the derivation cohort and tested in the validation cohort.

Key Results

The JAKPOT prediction rule included three variables: (i) red blood cell count > 6.45×10¹²/L, (ii) platelets > 350×10⁹/L, and (iii) neutrophils > 6.2×10⁹/L; absence of all criteria was effective at ruling out JAK2-positivity with sensitivities 94.7% and 100%, and negative predictive values of 98.8% and 100% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively, with an overall low false negative rate of 0.4%. The rule was validated for three different methods of JAK2 testing. Applying this rule to our entire cohort would have resulted in over 50% fewer tests.

Conclusion

In patients with elevated hemoglobin, the use of a simple prediction rule helps to accurately identify patients with a low likelihood of having a JAK2 mutation, potentially limiting costly over-investigation in this common referral population.

Chronic transfusion therapy in sickle cell disease — mechanistic effects and targets: Chronic scheduled transfusion of packed red blood cells is effective in reducing most complications of SCD by decreasing both the burden of sickle erythrocytes and the hemolytic rate. The HbS level can be reduced to less than 50% within weeks by simple transfusions or within hours by erythrocytapheresis, and a goal hemoglobin concentration of 10–12 g/dl is often attainable via chronic transfusion therapy. The guideline reports a systematic review to identify studies pertinent to management decisions for patients who have SCD and either RHC-confirmed PH or an increased risk for mortality (i.e. TRV ≥ 2.5 m/s or NT-pro-BNP ≥ 160 pg/ml).

### Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood: a review for the pediatric emergency medicine physician [^116jtkcD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood is a form of pure red cell aplasia that is self-limited and occurs in children 4 years old and younger. It is characterized by an absence or a significantly reduced quantity of erythroblasts in the bone marrow without underlying congenital red blood cell abnormalities. Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood should be considered in previously healthy children who present with normocytic anemia and lack of reticulocytosis without evidence of blood loss, hemolysis, or other causes of bone marrow suppression. Evaluation should be targeted at ruling out other causes of anemia. Management is mainly supportive, although some children may require blood transfusions for symptomatic anemia. Most patients demonstrate a return of hematopoiesis within two weeks of diagnosis and normalization of blood counts within two months.

### Role of red cell mass evaluation in myeloproliferative neoplasms with splanchnic vein thrombosis and normal hemoglobin value: a study of the France intergroupe des syndromes myeloprolifératifs [^115fkLsm]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) include portal vein thrombosis (PVT), Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), and splenic and/ or mesenteric vein thrombosis (S/MVT). They are frequently associated with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), with up to 50% of idiopathic SVT cases exhibiting the JAK2 V617F mutation. Diagnosing MPN in the context of SVT is challenging because the resultant portal hypertension and subsequent splenomegaly and hypersplenism can lower blood cell counts, obscuring the elevated counts typical of MPN. The routine inclusion of JAK2 V617F mutation screening in SVT patient evaluations has enabled the identification of MPN that lack the usual hematological features, representing about 15% of BCS and PVT cases. These patients, who otherwise would remain undiagnosed, are categorized as having unclassified MPN (MPN-U), leaving the decision to initiate cytoreductive therapy unresolved. Prior to the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation, demonstrating an increased red cell mass (RCM) through isotopic methods was a key diagnostic criterion for polycythemia vera (PV). According to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, hemoglobin levels above 18.5 g/dL in males and 16.5 g/dL in females were considered indicative of increased RCM, leading to the discontinuation of RCM measurement in many facilities.W e hypothesized that for patients with JAK2 V617F-positive SVT and normal hemoglobin levels, RCM measurement could facilitate the diagnosis of PV, thereby guiding the initiation and adjustment of cytoreductive therapy.

### The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study [^114FMCNq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

In a patient with acute pancreatitis, RDW level at the presentation has been reported to be an independent risk factor for mortality. Similarly, RDW level has also been found to be a predictor for mortality in bacteremia and septic shock. An increased RDW level has been reported in these inflammatory and infectious pathologies. Elevated RDW can result from any disease process that causes the premature release of reticulocytes into the circulation. Elevations in RDW have been shown to be associated with elevated inflammatory markers, such as CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin 6. Proinflammatory cytokines of sepsis (tumor necrosis factor A, interleukin 6, and interleukin 1b) have been shown to directly and negatively affect the survival of red blood cells in the circulation, promote deformability of the red blood cell membrane, and suppress erythrocyte maturation. These inflammatory mediators of sepsis can thus lead to newer, larger reticulocytes to enter the peripheral circulation, and thus increase RDW. Unlike the above-mentioned studies, we found a significantly lower, albeit within normal limits, RDW level in patients with acute appendicitis compared with subjects in the control group. This finding may be the result of greater RDW level in chronic inflammatory diseases compared to that in acute conditions. A strong correlation of RDW with inflammatory markers, CRP and sedimentation rate has also been observed. In our study, on the other hand, RDW was not correlated with CRP and leukocyte count.

In conclusion, RDW level was lower in patients with acute appendicitis. No studies in literature have examined RDW level in acute appendicitis before. The magnitude of difference in RDW seen between AA and controls was so slight as to be of no utility in diagnostic testing. We think that further prospective, multicenter studies with a large sample size are needed in this field.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^115Pp3z4]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

During the evaluation of erythrocytosis, PV should always be considered and the diagnosis excluded by the absence of a JAK2 mutation (V617F exon 14 and exon 12); also helpful in this regard is serum EPO especially in cases of JAK2 V617F-negative but exon 12 mutated PV, where serum EPO levels are often subnormal. If PV is suspected clinically or EPO is subnormal with the absence of JAK2 V617F, a bone marrow examination is recommended in order to identify histological features associated with MPN. Additional testing for MPN associated mutations; CALR and SH2B3/LNK, albeit rarely found in PV, may be pursued. Though predating molecular designations and not uniformly performed, in centers where available, bone marrow erythroid progenitor cultures may be a useful adjunct to rule-out endogenous erythroid proliferation. According to a seminal study on the subject, endogenous erythroid colonies were noted in the vast majority of PV (43 of 46) and in 0 of 17 secondary erythrocytosis cases, substantiating the enduring value of this test.

Once PV has been conclusively ruled out, we entertain the possibility of either hereditary or acquired erythrocytosis and commence our workup by reviewing prior blood counts when available in order to determine the duration of erythrocytosis. Figure 2 reviews our diagnostic algorithm which hinges upon duration of erythrocytosis (if known) and EPO levels.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11798zui]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythrocytosis refers to either a true or apparent increase in hemoglobin (Hgb)/hematocrit (Hct); distinction requires familiarity with sex-, race- and altitude-adjusted normal values, together with an appreciation of extreme normal values that exceed the 95th percentile (2 SD) of reference range and attention to clinical factors associated with plasma volume depletion (relative erythrocytosis). In 2008, the World Health organization (WHO) proposed Hgb and Hct diagnostic thresholds of 18.5 g/dl/52% and 16.5 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, for investigation of polycythemia vera (PV). However, in 2016, the WHO classification system revised the Hct/Hct thresholds for PV diagnosis to 16.5 g/dL/49% in males and 16 g/dL/48% in females. In a recent large population-based study, the incidence of erythrocytosis ranged from 0.3% to 3.4% based on the application of the WHO 2008 and 2016 criteria, respectively; importantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was reported only in the context of a higher Hgb threshold (WHO 2008).

The diagnostic workup of JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis lacks uniformity, and often includes investigations for rare hereditary conditions and several acquired entities known to be associated with secondary erythrocytosis. In a substantial proportion (up to 70%) of patients, despite extensive testing, erythrocytosis remains uncharacterized and sometimes labeled as "idiopathic", which is often a diagnosis of exclusion. The complexity and variability of the decision-making processes involved in managing erythrocytosis were underscored by an international survey of 134 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) physicians evaluating standard practice in erythrocytosis; in this regard, while first-line assessments were relatively consistent (JAK2, EPO testing), second-line investigations were markedly heterogeneous. Equally variable were treatment practices, including the decision to initiate daily aspirin therapy and/or phlebotomy, as well as the desired Hct target, ranging from 48–56%. Some of this variability in management stems from unsubstantiated concern regarding thrombosis risk. The particular issue was further highlighted in a recent retrospective study where as many as one-third of patients with secondary erythrocytosis were subjected to bone marrow examination and 42% to periodic phlebotomy. Herein, we outline our systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach in JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis; our review also includes illustrative cases and a discussion on underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis [^1119wX33]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a diagnostic tool for many conditions affecting the central nervous system. Urgent indications for lumbar puncture include suspected central nervous system infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage. CSF analysis is not necessarily diagnostic but can be useful in the evaluation of other neurologic conditions, such as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and malignancy. Bacterial meningitis has a high mortality rate and characteristic effects on CSF white blood cell counts, CSF protein levels, and the CSF:serum glucose ratio. CSF culture can identify causative organisms and antibiotic sensitivities. Viral meningitis can present similarly to bacterial meningitis but usually has a low mortality rate. Adjunctive tests such as CSF lactate measurement, latex agglutination, and polymerase chain reaction testing can help differentiate between bacterial and viral causes of meningitis. Immunocompromised patients may have meningitis caused by tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, or fungal or parasitic infections. Subarachnoid hemorrhage has a high mortality rate, and rapid diagnosis is key to improve outcomes. Computed tomography of the head is nearly 100% sensitive for subarachnoid hemorrhage in the first six hours after symptom onset, but CSF analysis may be required if there is a delay in presentation or if imaging findings are equivocal. Xanthochromia and an elevated red blood cell count are characteristic CSF findings in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can mimic central nervous system infection. It has a poor prognosis, and large-volume CSF cytology is diagnostic.

### Evaluation of WHO criteria for diagnosis of polycythemia vera: a prospective analysis [^113xaLY7]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated the accuracy of the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diagnosing polycythemia vera (PV), especially in "early-stage" patients. A total of 28 of 30 patients were diagnosed as PV owing to an elevated Cr-51 red cell mass (RCM), JAK2 positivity, and at least 1 minor criterion. A total of 18 PV patients did not meet the WHO criterion for an increased hemoglobin value and 8 did not meet the WHO criterion for an increased hematocrit value. Bone marrow morphology was very valuable for diagnosis. Low serum erythropoietin (EPO) values were specific for PV, but normal EPO values were found at presentation (20%). We recommend revision of the WHO criteria, especially to distinguish early-stage PV from essential thrombocythemia. Major criteria remain JAK2 positivity and increased red cell volume, but Cr-51 RCM is mandatory for patients who do not meet the defined elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit value (> 18.5 g/dL and 60% in men and > 16.5 g/dL and 56% in women, respectively). Minor criteria remain bone marrow histology or a low serum EPO value. For patients with a normal EPO value, marrow examination is mandatory for diagnostic confirmation. Because the therapies for myeloproliferative disorders differ, our data have major clinical implications.

Guideline 4.6- evaluation for ESA induced pure red cell Aplasia (PRCA)

We do not recommend routine screening for anti-erythropoietin antibodies among CKD patients regularly treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents. (2A)
We recommend that the diagnosis of ESA induced PRCA should be considered whenever a patient receiving long term ESA therapy (more than 8 weeks) develops all the following (2A):
- a sudden decrease in Hb concentration at the rate of 5 to 10 g/L per week OR requirement of transfusions at the rate of approximately 1 to 2 per week,
- normal platelet and white cell counts,
- absolute reticulocyte count less than 10,000/μl
We recommend that all ESA therapy should be stopped in patients who develop ESA induced PRCA. (2A)
We recommend that patients who remain transfusion dependent after withdrawing ESA therapy should be treated with immunosuppressant medications guided by the level of anti EPO antibodies. (2A)

Guideline 4.7 - monitoring of treatment - hypertension during ESA therapy

We recommend that blood pressure should be monitored in all patients receiving ESAs and, if present, hypertension be treated by volume removal and/or anti-hypertensive drugs. (1A)

Anaemia of CKD: Blood transfusion (guidelines 5.1–5.3)

Guideline 5.1 - blood transfusion

We recommend that in patients with anaemia of CKD, especially those in whom renal transplantation is an option, red blood cell transfusion should be avoided where possible to minimise the risk of allosensitisation. (1A)

Guideline 5.2 - blood transfusion

We recommend if red blood cell transfusion becomes essential (usually in the setting of acute blood loss, acute haemolysis or severe sepsis) transfusions should be based on policies set by local transfusion guidelines rather than Hb targets for ESA therapy in chronic anaemia of CKD. (1B)

Guidelines 5.3- blood transfusion

We recommend that renal transplant recipients, or those on the transplant waiting list or patients on immunosuppressive therapy should receive only Hepatitis E negative blood components. (2B)

Anaemia of CKD: Post transplant Anaemia (guideline 6.1)

We suggest that the treatment guidelines for anaemia in renal transplant patients should be similar to those for CKD patients not on dialysis. (2B)

### Reference intervals of complete blood count constituents are highly correlated to waist circumference: should obese patients have their own "normal values? " [^1132Yiut]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Body mass index (BMI), the prevalent indicator of obesity, is not easily grasped by patients nor physicians. Waist circumference (WC) is correlated to obesity, is better understood and has a stronger relationship to the metabolic syndrome. We compiled WC, complete blood count (CBC) parameters as well as other pertinent data of 6766 25–55-year-old US volunteers sampled in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in the years 2005–2010. To determine reference intervals of typical US patients visiting their clinician, we used minimal exclusion criteria. We compiled hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count, mean platelet volume, and counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. In addition, we also compiled serum C reactive protein and serum iron. The three major US races were studied and reference interval diagrams were constructed for each CBC parameter plotted against WC. WBC count, RDW, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and red blood cell count increase with WC. Conversely, serum iron and MCH and MCV decrease. These relationships may be related to insulin resistance and chronic activation of the immune system and the resulting low-grade inflammatory state. WC is a strong predictor for many CBC parameters, suggesting that WC should be taken into account when evaluating blood count results. Clinicians who take care of obese patients should be aware of altered hematology and investigate and treat accordingly.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis: a systematic review [^113YdgKi]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this review. Our review was limited to peer-reviewed literature; as such, it is inherently limited by publication bias, and we cannot exclude the possibility of relevant studies in other databases that were not searched. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including the types, formulations, and doses of medications as well as in the study quality and designs, with most of the studies being retrospective in nature. As such, the rates of thromboembolism are difficult to interpret, particularly given the lack of reporting for baseline risk of thromboembolism in these studies. Furthermore, several of the findings discussed in this review were demonstrated in relatively small patient populations and may not be generalizable. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of drug-induced erythrocytosis and identify multiple classes of medications that may be implicated in erythrocytosis. Further studies would be helpful to establish a clinical approach to drug-induced erythrocytosis and to clarify clinical outcomes in this condition.

Suggestions for clinical practice

Due to the heterogeneity of these patient populations and of the included studies, there is limited evidence to guide clinical practice for drug-induced erythrocytosis. Based on this systematic review of existing literature, we suggest the following.

General recommendations

All patients starting the medications covered in this review should be counseled on the risks of developing erythrocytosis and associated thrombosis risk, while acknowledging that high-quality evidence for the latter is lacking for most medications. We suggest that physicians monitor patients for drug-induced erythrocytosis with a CBC after initiating treatment, with the frequency of ongoing monitoring depending on the type of medication and its indication. The role of phlebotomy or aspirin is uncertain, and these interventions may not be sufficient to mitigate thrombosis risk. Practitioners should discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment and engage in shared decision-making. If relevant, enrollment in a clinical trial or prospective registry should be considered.

Areas requiring further investigation

It is currently unknown which patients are at higher risk of drug-induced erythrocytosis or require more extensive investigations such as bone marrow biopsy or molecular testing. The development of a predictive model or scoring system may help clarify this. Further studies for prospective validation would also be beneficial to determine thromboembolic risk associated with drug-induced erythrocytosis, to establish whether antiplatelet agents or phlebotomy have a role in mitigating this risk, and to clarify long-term follow-up in this heterogeneous patient population.

### Rationale for revision and proposed changes of the WHO diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis [^114UXnEC]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera

The key diagnostic issue in PV is which red cell parameters (Hb, Hct) may be more conveniently used as a surrogate of an increased red cell mass as measured by the isotope test. According to the 2007/2008 updated WHO classification, the first major diagnostic criterion requires one of the following four components: Hb level > 18.5 g/dl in men and > 16.5 g/dl in women or red cell mass that is > 25% above mean normal predicted, or Hb level > 17 g/dl in men (> 15 g/dl in women) associated with a sustained increase of ⩾2 g/dl from baseline that cannot be attributed to correction of iron deficiency. Altogether it has been argued that application of these criteria may result in an underdiagnosis of PV by excluding patients with actual red cell mass that is 25% above mean predicted value, but whose Hb and Hct levels are below the WHO guidelines. Recently, the term masked PV (mPV) was re-introducedfor JAK2 -mutated patients with latent (initial, occult pre-polycythemic) disease manifestations who present with a BM morphology consistent with PV and display persistently raised Hb levels between 16.0 and 18.5 g/dl for men and 15.0 and 16.5 g/dl for women. Subsequently, a Hb level of 16.5 g/dl in men and 16.0 g/dl for women or in accordance with the BCSH criteria, a Hct level of 49% in men and 48% in women was determined to be the optimal cutoff levels for distinguishing JAK2 -mutated ET from mPV. These data were entered in the new proposal for the WHOand accordingly shown in Table 1. The clinical relevance of recognizing mPV was demonstrated in a recent study on 66 JAK2 -mutated patients younger than 40 years who revealed a higher risk of thrombosis compared with a control group of 97 cases with overt PV due to the less frequent use of phlebotomies or cytoreductive treatment. Altogether based on these clinical findings and the fact that BM morphology is superimposable to that of overt PV, according to the original 2008 criteria, it makes little sense that the term mPV is maintained, because it may be argued that this entity is in fact fully consistent with PV. Finally, the use of the endogenous erythroid colony growth assay was discarded as a minor diagnostic criteriondue to limited practicability (time consuming, no standardization, restricted to specialized institutions, costly).

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis: a systematic review [^115unD8R]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines highlight the lack of consensus on the clinical approach to drug-induced erythrocytosis and the need for further clarification of the clinical outcomes in these conditions. Existing literature does not suggest a clear association between drug-induced erythrocytosis and an increased risk of thromboembolic disease, although there is conflicting evidence for testosterone and thromboembolic risk existing independently of testosterone-induced erythrocytosis. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review of the literature on drug-induced erythrocytosis. Our primary objective was to evaluate the latest evidence on the diagnosis, management, and clinical outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis to inform a clinical approach to diagnosis and management of these conditions. Secondary objectives included the determination of clinically relevant subtypes, investigations for and management of special populations (including pregnancy and perioperative patients), and outcomes (including thrombosis, bleeding, and mortality) of patients with drug-induced erythrocytosis.

In summary, an SF < 15 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency (specificity 0.99). A cut-off of 45 µg/L provides a respectable specificity of 0.92, and figures below this may warrant consideration of GI investigation, especially in the context of a chronic inflammatory process with anaemia.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias and Hb E — and most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log₁₀ ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.

A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA, but is dependent on compliance. A ≥ 10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective and difficult to justify in most cases.

After excluding thalassaemia carriage, low Retic-Hb provides evidence of iron restriction, and should be considered in the laboratory work-up of anaemia particularly where there is chronic renal impairment. Retic-Hb is reported to be a more reliable marker of iron restriction than sTfR in healthy blood donors. An early indicator of response to iron therapy in IDA is provided by a rising Retic-Hb on day 4, similar to the observation of a falling percentage of hypochromic red cells in response to therapy. An algorithm for the diagnostic approach to IDA is suggested in figure 1.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111LZUAq]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 4.5 - monitoring of treatment - resistance to ESA therapy

We recommend that inadequate response ('resistance') to ESA therapy is defined as failure to reach the target Hb level despite SC epoetin dose > 300 IU/kg/week (450 IU/kg/week IV epoetin), or darbepoetin dose > 1.5 microgram/kg/week. Hyporesponsive patients who are iron replete should be screened clinically and by investigations for other common causes of anaemia. (1A)

Audit measure

Prevalence of resistance to ESA among renal replacement therapy patients.

Rationale

Extensive publications are available on the topic of resistance to ESA therapy including the Revised European Best Practice Guidelines which defines ESA resistance as above. Failure to respond at an earlier stage in therapy should however raise suspicion of ESA resistance.

Comparison of the individual Hb outcome achieved and the dose of ESA used can provide a useful way of highlighting individuals that are ESA resistant during local unit audit. ESA therapy is efficacious in most patients. However many conditions and treatment variables can cause or explain apparent resistance to ESA therapy. Adequate investigation and management of these underlying conditions is crucial in achieving satisfactory outcome haemoglobin values as well as requiring therapy in their own right.

Guideline 4.6- evaluation for ESA induced pure red cell Aplasia (PRCA)

- We do not recommend routine screening for anti-erythropoietin antibodies among CKD patients regularly treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents. (2A)

- We recommend that the diagnosis of ESA induced PRCA should be considered whenever a patient receiving long term ESA therapy (more than 8 weeks) develops all the following (2A):

- a sudden decrease in Hb concentration at the rate of 5 to 10 g/L per week OR requirement of transfusions at the rate of approximately 1 to 2 per week,

- normal platelet and white cell counts,

- absolute reticulocyte count less than 10,000/μl

- We recommend that all ESA therapy should be stopped in patients who develop ESA induced PRCA. (2A)

- We recommend that patients who remain transfusion dependent after withdrawing ESA therapy should be treated with immunosuppressant medications guided by the level of anti EPO antibodies. (2A)

Follow-up and recurrent IDA

12. Hb levels normalise with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

16. We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the Treatment section, and if the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should obviously be addressed as appropriate. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative BDE, no evidence of CD, no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favourable, and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for recurrent IDA. In an era of limited resources, we would suggest checks at perhaps 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

Further investigation is however warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhoea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers and the persistence or recurrence of IDA. Persistent IDA describes the situation where there is haematological evidence of ongoing iron deficiency despite adequate IRT, while in recurrent IDA the haematological abnormalities resulting from iron deficiency resolve with IRT, only to reappear at a later date.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Pancreatic ascites is a diagnostic challenge because of its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic approach that incorporates a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis, is crucial. As noted above, the physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and in severe cases may be in respiratory distress.

Laboratory tests

Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactic acid, uric acid and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites cases and is likely to be dilutional, due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases, and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites.

On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio, are usually normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are typically elevated, especially in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Serum lipase and amylase levels are often normal or mildly elevated in pancreatic ascites, thereby rendering these tests non-diagnostic.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^116XHNu4]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

This high prevalence among children and pregnant women is further complicated by the occurrence of two specific forms of anemia that have been observed exclusively in these groups: "physiological anemia" and "pathological anemia". In pregnant women, "physiological anemia" is caused by a hemodilution process, leading to Hb values below the threshold defined by the WHO, although this condition is considered normal. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the main form of Hb during fetal development and is gradually replaced by adult hemoglobin (HbA) after birth. By around 6 months of age, HbF levels typically decrease to less than 1% in normal populations, with most Hb being HbA (approximately 96%) and HbA2 making up 2.5%–3.5%. Therefore, hemolysis associated with elevated HbF levels is not characteristic of healthy children beyond infancy. The original claim about hemolysis due to elevated HbF in children under 5 has been adjusted to align with these facts. This normal process results in Hb values falling below the threshold defined by the WHO, classifying it as anemia. This postnatal adjustment, described by Joseph Barcroft in 1932 as "Everest in utero", is a normal physiological response rather than a sign of disease. During this period, neonates possess high iron stores, almost double (75 mg/kg) that of adults, which adequately support erythropoiesis in early life. Thus, dietary iron primarily serves to replace small daily iron losses and support growth needs. In most cases, this modest requirement is sufficiently met through breastfeeding.

In contrast, pathological anemia refers to reductions in Hb concentration due to underlying pathological processes and typically requires clinical evaluation and treatment. The causes of pathological anemia are diverse, ranging from conditions that induce blood loss, shorten red blood cell lifespan, or hinder Hb synthesis and red blood cell production. These include chronic inflammation, which disrupts iron metabolism through elevated hepcidin levels and impairs iron absorption — rendering oral iron supplementation less effective. Other etiologies include chronic kidney disease (which reduces erythropoietin production), gastrointestinal disorders (that impair nutrient absorption), malaria (which accelerates hemolysis), hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, red blood cell membrane disorders, red blood cell channelopathies, red blood cell enzyme deficiencies, and infections with neglected tropical diseases such as schistosomiasis and hookworm. These diverse causes reflect the multifactorial nature of pathological anemia, which varies according to age, physiological status, and regional disease burden.

### Rusfertide cuts number of needed blood draws to treat PCV-NCI… [^113FFrY2]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Rusfertide Nearly Eliminates Need for Phlebotomies to Treat Polycythemia Vera, by Shana Spindler For people with polycythemia vera, treatment with the drug rusfertide appears to substantially reduce their reliance on blood draws to avoid serious health problems. That's according to results of the first-ever clinical trial to test a drug like rusfertide — which blocks the production of iron-rich blood cells — in people with this chronic blood cancer. In people with polycythemia vera, the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. This overproduction of cells thickens the blood and, if left untreated, increases the risk for blood clots, heart attack, and stroke. For decades, the main treatment for polycythemia vera has been regular blood draws, or phlebotomy, to remove excess red blood cells. But this rudimentary treatment has downsides, including debilitating fatigue and brain fog.

The need to make regular trips to a doctor's office for the procedure is also time consuming and affects people's quality of life. To ensure that they stay below that level, people with polycythemia vera regularly visit their doctor to check their hematocrit. If it's too high, they then undergo therapeutic phlebotomy — a process akin to blood donation — in which a large needle is inserted into a vein to remove blood from the body. The process takes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, according to Dr. Kremyanskaya, but the office visit in total can stretch much longer and interfere with people planning their lives. Treatment with rusfertide essentially tricks the body into behaving as if it has higher hepcidin levels, which causes iron levels to drop in the bloodstream, she continued. And without iron, red blood cell production stops.

Indeed, findings from laboratory and animal model studies suggested that increasing hepcidin activity in the body could potentially limit red blood cell production. Researchers have been testing various therapies that take advantage of this finding, including the hepcidin imitator rusfertide. VERIFYing the benefit Rusfertide appears to help people with polycythemia vera maintain healthy hematocrit levels without the need for phlebotomy for more than 2 years, according to findings from the third and final part of the REVIVE trial, presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2023.

### What to transfuse: specifications for red cell products… [^1172PrUh]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary management of severe anemia in β thalassemia is regular red blood cell transfusions. Healthcare providers can work with their blood bank partners to develop thalassemia-specific red blood cell transfusion protocols. In selecting RBC products for patients receiving regular transfusions, it's important for the clinical team to carefully consider which products emphasize efficacy while also minimizing risk of hemolytic and non-hemolytic transfusion complications. What type of RBC product is needed by people with β thalassemia. The optimization of RBC products is vital when transfusing people with β thalassemia. The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends.
- Leukoreduction of RBC units via filtration during the pre-storage period to prevent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions
- Storage of RBC units in additive solutions or citrate phosphate dextrose-adenine
- Using non-apheresis-derived RBC units for transfusions in adults due to smaller hemoglobin increments with apheresis-derived units.
- Washed RBC units for individuals who experience severe, recurrent allergic reactions
- RBC units that are less than 2 weeks old, when possible, to reduce the impact of the storage lesion on red cell survival
- Using non-irradiated RBC units, as routine use of irradiated RBC units may be detrimental. What type of RBC antigen matching is needed by people with β thalassemia. Prevention of red cell alloimmunization is an important goal of transfusion management in thalassemia.

Ideally, an individual's RBC genotyping is performed once the decision to initiate regular transfusions is made. The results of this typing determine their risk for developing alloantibodies and/or autoantibodies and determine the extent to which antigen-matched blood is needed. The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends:

- Individuals without a history of alloimmunization are given RBC units matched to Cc, Ee, and K blood group antigens
- Individuals with one or more alloantibodies are given RBC units matched to Cc, Ee, K, Jka/b, Fya/b, and Ss blood group antigens It is important for providers to maintain an accurate antibody history, as an antibody screen can become negative over time, and individuals with a history of developing antibodies need antigen-negative blood to prevent hemolytic transfusion reactions.

### Erythrocytosis associated with carcinoma of the kidney… [^114s1Z5Q]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE ASSOCIATION of erythrocytosis with a variety of lesions of the kidney has been noted in an increasing number of cases. Hypernephroma has been the most common lesion, with some 49 cases having been reported, mostly within the last 5 years. The papers of Damon et al. 1 and Lawrence and Donald2 record most of these cases. The 11 cases of non-neoplastic renal lesions with erythrocytosis have been summarized by Jones et al.
3. From the hematologic standpoint, erythrocytosis is evident, with elevation of the hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count, but, in contrast to polycythemia vera, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly are all lacking. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level, which is almost invariably elevated in polycythemia vera, is normal in renal erythrocytosis.
4. The relationship of a humoral factor controlling erythropoiesis and the kidney has been supported by a large body of experimental work.
