## Question

Should someone who is 14 weeks pregnant be taking lithium?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether someone who is 14 weeks pregnant should be taking lithium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the teratogenic and perinatal risks of lithium exposure by trimester. Then, I should quantify maternal relapse risks if lithium is stopped now. Next, I will review pregnancy-related pharmacokinetic changes and monitoring. After that, I need to reconcile conflicting peripartum dosing recommendations. Then, I should compare alternatives like lamotrigine or antipsychotics. Finally, I will align this with guideline recommendations and synthesize a practical, shared decision-making plan.

> Let me first confirm the timing context. At 14 weeks, organogenesis for the heart has largely passed, which lowers the relative risk of structural malformations from new exposure, though pregnancy and neonatal risks such as preterm birth and neonatal adaptation remain relevant with ongoing lithium use, so I should not overstate safety here without data to back it up [^112kJ8Vv].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of first-trimester cardiac risk before I imply anything definitive. Contemporary cohort data suggest an absolute cardiac malformation risk around 2.1% with lithium versus 0.8% in unexposed, an adjusted relative risk near 3, which translates to about a 1.3% absolute excess; Ebstein's anomaly can occur but remains rare in modern cohorts, and overall major malformations may not be significantly elevated when genetic anomalies are excluded, though cardiovascular anomalies show a signal in some studies [^116knBnn] [^112oCYog] [^115q3sH7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk being "over" after the first trimester. Lithium exposure during pregnancy has been associated with spontaneous preterm birth, large-for-gestational-age infants, and neonatal hypoglycemia in population-based analyses, so even if structural teratogenic risk declines after the first trimester, other obstetric and neonatal risks persist and should inform monitoring and counseling at 14 weeks [^116knBnn] [^111izGzF].

> I need to check the consequences of discontinuation now. Prospective data show a 71% overall recurrence risk in pregnancy among women with bipolar disorder, with median time to relapse markedly shorter after abrupt or rapid discontinuation and most recurrences being depressive or mixed; this materially increases maternal suicide risk and can degrade prenatal care, and postpartum relapse risk is also heightened in vulnerable patients, so abrupt stoppage at 14 weeks is risky without a robust alternative plan [^111TPjZo] [^112JWZrp] [^114AVoxx].

> Next, I should review lithium pharmacokinetics in pregnancy. Renal clearance rises substantially during gestation, often necessitating dose increases to maintain efficacy, and standard recommendations are to implement regular therapeutic drug monitoring with more frequent checks as pregnancy advances; let me be precise and emphasize keeping levels at the lowest effective end of the therapeutic range with close clinical assessment rather than chasing a single number [^1177veaM] [^117S8BsX] [^114Wfkg9].

> Now, delivery management is tricky, and I should double-check competing recommendations. The FDA labeling historically advises decreasing or discontinuing lithium 2–3 days before expected delivery to mitigate maternal and neonatal toxicity risk, but more recent observational data did not find a clear association between neonatal lithium level at delivery and acute outcomes and cautioned against routine pre-delivery dose reductions that might amplify postpartum relapse risk; initially I thought routine pre-delivery discontinuation was mandatory, but wait, the newer datasets suggest a case-by-case approach rather than an automatic taper for all patients [^1177veaM] [^116mZCcp] [^112JSKs7] [^1167UoK6].

> I will now examine neonatal considerations to ensure I am not under-calling risk. Lithium freely equilibrates across the placenta with cord-to-maternal ratios near 1, and higher neonatal concentrations have been linked to transient complications such as hypotonia; even with short pre-delivery holds, transient neonatal issues are not eliminated, which reinforces the need for anticipatory newborn observation and collaboration with pediatrics rather than assuming a brief pause will prevent all events [^113PG81R] [^111oNZHj].

> But wait, what if we consider alternatives mid-pregnancy? Lamotrigine has reassuring malformation data from multiple registries, though its prophylactic efficacy profile differs from lithium, particularly for mania prevention; antipsychotics can be reasonable, but metabolic risks, including gestational diabetes, warrant monitoring; valproate is generally contraindicated or avoided in pregnancy due to clear teratogenicity, so switching from effective lithium to valproate would be inappropriate here [^1161oFE5] [^11371WDC] [^114ufk3K] [^114YdrSk].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure alignment. The VA/DoD guideline supports continuing lithium at the lowest effective dose with psychoeducation and shared decision-making in pregnant patients stabilized on lithium, and other expert guidance advises against abrupt discontinuation of psychotropics in pregnancy due to relapse risk, which matches the risk-benefit calculus at 14 weeks [^114ph6bz] [^1142b4w3].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework and check feasibility. The choice at 14 weeks hinges on illness severity and prior course favoring continuation in those with severe or recurrent bipolar disorder, current euthymia on lithium arguing against destabilizing switches, and system capacity for surveillance, including therapeutic drug monitoring and targeted fetal imaging; I should confirm that a detailed anatomy scan with focused fetal cardiac evaluation around 18–22 weeks and third-trimester growth assessment are accessible, and ensure the patient understands absolute and relative risks to support informed consent [^1167UoK6] [^116knBnn].

> Putting this together, lithium should not be automatically discontinued at 14 weeks; rather, continue at the lowest effective dose with enhanced monitoring, including regular serum lithium and creatinine with increasing frequency later in pregnancy, maintenance of stable dietary sodium and avoidance of diuretics and interacting medications, a detailed anatomy scan with fetal echocardiographic assessment at 18–22 weeks, consideration of third-trimester growth ultrasounds given LGA risk, and a peripartum plan coordinated with maternal–fetal medicine, psychiatry, anesthesia, and pediatrics that weighs the FDA's suggestion to reduce or hold near delivery against contemporary data supporting individualized continuation, followed by close postpartum monitoring for maternal relapse and neonatal observation for tone, feeding, glucose, and thyroid function, with prompt postnatal lithium dose adjustment as physiology normalizes [^1177veaM] [^117S8BsX] [^112Kaja2] [^116mZCcp] [^112JSKs7] [^1167UoK6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the patient receives balanced counseling that the excess absolute risk of cardiac malformations from first-trimester lithium exposure is small but real, that ongoing pregnancy and neonatal risks are manageable with surveillance, and that the maternal risk of relapse from discontinuation at 14 weeks is high and time-sensitive; with this, the risk-benefit ratio favors carefully monitored continuation rather than routine cessation at this stage of pregnancy [^116knBnn] [^112oCYog] [^111TPjZo] [^115q3sH7].

In select cases, **lithium can be continued at 14 weeks** [^114ph6bz] if the patient has severe bipolar disorder and alternatives are ineffective, but use the **lowest effective dose** [^112kJ8Vv] with close monitoring. The **absolute risk of cardiac malformations is low** but higher than unexposed, and **lithium crosses the placenta** [^113PG81R], so monitor maternal levels, renal and thyroid function [^117S8BsX], and fetal growth [^113cg6GX]. If continued, **reduce or stop lithium 24–48 hours before delivery** [^1177veaM] to limit neonatal exposure [^113PG81R], and restart postpartum with monitoring [^1177veaM].

---

## Risks associated with lithium use at 14 weeks gestation

- **Lithium crosses the placenta**, resulting in fetal exposure to maternal levels [^113PG81R] and increasing the risk of congenital malformations, especially cardiac defects such as Ebstein's anomaly. The **absolute risk is low** but higher than in unexposed pregnancies.

- **Cardiac malformations**: Lithium exposure is associated with a small increased risk of cardiac malformations, including Ebstein's anomaly [^115q3sH7] [^112oCYog].
- **Neonatal complications**: Lithium exposure near delivery can cause neonatal toxicity, including hypotonia, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties [^113PG81R] [^111oNZHj].
- **Maternal complications**: Lithium use during pregnancy can cause maternal toxicity, including renal and thyroid dysfunction [^117S8BsX].

---

## Benefits of continuing lithium therapy during pregnancy

Lithium is effective for **preventing relapse** [^111TPjZo] in bipolar disorder, and **discontinuation increases relapse risk**, including postpartum psychosis [^114AVoxx]. Continuing therapy can **reduce relapse risk** and support **maternal stability**, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes [^114ph6bz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend **individualized decisions** about lithium use in pregnancy, balancing maternal stability with fetal risk [^114ph6bz] [^112JWZrp]. If continued, use the **lowest effective dose** with close monitoring [^112kJ8Vv].

- **Dose adjustments**: Monitor serum lithium and adjust dose as renal clearance increases in pregnancy [^1177veaM] [^114Ma5CU].
- **Monitoring**: Monitor renal and thyroid function, and fetal growth throughout pregnancy [^112kJ8Vv] [^117S8BsX].
- **Delivery management**: Reduce or stop lithium 24–48 hours before delivery to limit neonatal exposure, and restart postpartum with monitoring [^1177veaM] [^113PG81R].

## Alternative mood stabilizers

Alternative mood stabilizers such as **lamotrigine** and certain antipsychotics may be considered; however, each has distinct risks and benefits [^112kJ8Vv] [^11371WDC]. Lamotrigine has a **lower risk of congenital malformations** than lithium but may be **less effective for mania** [^1147FJi8] [^1161oFE5] [^11787GEc].

---

## Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes

Limited data suggest **no significant long-term neurodevelopmental differences** in children exposed to lithium in utero, but more research is needed [^116MQqbf] [^115cvYSV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Lithium use at 14 weeks gestation should be **individualized**, balancing maternal stability with fetal risk. If continued, use the **lowest effective dose** with close monitoring. If discontinued, **taper gradually** and consider alternatives.

### Lithium carbonate [^112kJ8Vv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lithium may cause harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Early voluntary reports to international birth registries suggested an increase in cardiovascular malformations, especially for Ebstein's anomaly, with first trimester use of lithium. Subsequent case-control and cohort studies indicate that the increased risk for cardiac malformations is likely to be small; however, the data are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk. There are concerns for maternal and/or neonatal lithium toxicity during late pregnancy and the postpartum period [see Clinical Considerations]. Published animal developmental and toxicity studies in mice and rats report an increased incidence of fetal mortality, decreased fetal weight, increased fetal skeletal abnormalities, and cleft palate (mouse fetuses only) with oral doses of lithium that produced serum concentrations similar to the human therapeutic range. Other published animal studies report adverse effects on embryonic implantation in rats after lithium administration. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, serum lithium concentrations should be monitored closely. The text is incomplete here, but the general guideline is to adjust the dose throughout pregnancy and consider the postpartum period to manage potential toxicity effectively.

### Lithium carbonate [^1177veaM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period**: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, monitor serum lithium concentrations and adjust the dosage as needed in a pregnant woman because renal lithium clearance increases during pregnancy. Avoid sodium restriction or diuretic administration. To decrease the risk of postpartum lithium intoxication, decrease or discontinue lithium therapy two to three days before the expected delivery date to reduce neonatal concentrations and reduce the risk of maternal lithium intoxication due to the change in vascular volume, which occurs during delivery. At delivery, vascular volume rapidly decreases, and the renal clearance of lithium may decrease to pre-pregnancy concentrations. Restart treatment at the preconception dose when the patient is medically stable after delivery with careful monitoring of serum lithium concentrations.

- **Dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment**: Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with dosages less than those for patients with normal renal function. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault).

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^114ph6bz]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bipolar disorder, more specifically concerning pregnant patients, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend considering offering continued treatment with lithium at the lowest effective dose. This should be done within a framework that includes psychoeducation and shared decision-making for patients with bipolar disorder who are or might become pregnant and are stabilized on lithium.

### Risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in women treated or not treated with mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder: Population based cohort study [^111i6CK8]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Decision making in the treatment of bipolar disorder involves balancing risks. On one hand, there is the increased risk of mothers relapsing with mood episodes, and on the other, there is the risk of potential congenital malformations and perinatal complications after exposure of the fetus to drugs. Our findings of increased risks for several of the investigated outcomes, also in the untreated women, suggest that mood stabilising treatment is probably not the sole reason for the increased risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes previously observed in women with bipolar disorder.

The role of treatment is, however, still unclear, as the overall analyses of variation in outcomes generally did not support a significant difference between treated and untreated women. The possibility of an anabolic drug effect with increased risks of gestational diabetes and reduced risks of fetal growth restriction should be noted.

### Lithium placental passage and obstetrical outcome: Implications for clinical management during late pregnancy [^113PG81R]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Lithium has been used during pregnancy for more than four decades, but quantification of fetal lithium exposure and clinical correlations of such exposure are limited. The study objectives were to quantify the rate of lithium placental passage, assess any association between plasma concentration of lithium at delivery and adverse perinatal events, and determine whether lithium concentrations can be reduced by briefly suspending therapy proximate to delivery.

Maternal blood and umbilical cord blood were obtained at delivery for assay of lithium concentrations, and obstetrical outcome data were collected prospectively for 10 participants. These data were combined with results from MEDLINE and PsycINFO searches that identified 32 cases in which maternal lithium was administered throughout delivery. Statistical analysis of the pooled data was conducted.

The ratio of lithium concentrations in umbilical cord blood to maternal blood (mean = 1.05, SD = 0.13) was uniform across a wide range of maternal concentrations (0.2–2.6 meq/liter). Significantly lower Apgar scores, longer hospital stays, and higher rates of CNS and neuromuscular complications were observed in infants with higher lithium concentrations (> 0.64 meq/liter) at delivery. Withholding lithium therapy for 24–48 hours before delivery resulted in a 0.28 meq/liter reduction in maternal lithium concentration.

Lithium completely equilibrates across the placenta. Higher lithium concentrations at delivery are associated with more perinatal complications.

### Risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in women treated or not treated with mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder: Population based cohort study [^115wiQxJ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic and episodic severe mental disorder, often requiring continuous mood-stabilising treatment to prevent relapses and lower the risk of suicide. Lithium, certain anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics are recommended as mood stabilisers in bipolar disorder. Knowledge about the consequences of treatment with mood stabilisers during pregnancy is, however, limited.

Antipsychotics during pregnancy have been associated with congenital malformations, preterm birth, and abnormal fetal growth. In a recent study, however, we could not confirm an association between antipsychotics during pregnancy and abnormal fetal growth, except for an increased risk of macrocephaly after the use of clozapine or olanzapine. Furthermore, antipsychotics, regardless of type, were associated with increased risks of gestational diabetes. Lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine have been associated with congenital malformations, but for lithium, the data are conflicting and difficult to interpret. Some authors suggest lithium as the first-line treatment of choice for bipolar disorder during pregnancy, whereas others have recommended avoiding this drug.

Having bipolar disorder has been linked to slightly increased risks of pregnancy complications, preterm birth, and giving birth to small-for-gestational-age infants. However, previous studies did not assess drug treatment, and to our knowledge, no attempts have been made to differentiate between the influences on potential adverse effects of the illness itself, the use of drugs, associated adverse lifestyle behaviors, and comorbidities.

Subgroup analysis

We next compared women using lithium during pregnancy (n = 434) to those who were prescribed lithium prior to pregnancy, but not during (n = 871). Women using lithium during pregnancy had an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth (8.7% vs. 4.4%; aRR 2.08 [95% CI 1.20, 3.59]), birth of a large for gestational age infant (9.0% vs. 4.3%; aRR 1.86 [95% CI 1.10, 3.13]), neonatal hypoglycemia (5.5% vs. 2.6%; aRR 2.72 [95% CI 1.47, 5.04]), and cardiac malformations (2.1% vs. 0.8%, aRR 2.99 [95% CI 1.10, 8.10]) compared to those who discontinued lithium prior to pregnancy.

- **Adjusted analyses**: Adjusted analyses were retrieved via inverse probability weighting. Covariates included maternal age, body mass index, smoking status, country of birth, education, parity, and medical conditions, as well as the use of antipsychotics, neuroleptics, and lamotrigine during pregnancy.

We also compared the same outcomes among women diagnosed with a maternal psychiatric illness (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and psychosis) and either prescribed lithium (n = 412) or not (n = 9,140). Associations observed were similar to the primary analysis: spontaneous preterm birth remained associated with maternal lithium use (8.0% vs. 3.4%; aRR 2.34 [95% CI 1.55, 3.56]), as was the risk of birthing a large for gestational age infant (9.5% vs. 4.1%; aRR 2.28 [95% CI 1.61, 3.23]), but not preeclampsia or birthing a small for gestational age infant. Regarding secondary outcomes, lithium use was associated with an increased…

### Lithium [^117S8BsX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concomitant medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**: See Table 1 for dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years). Obtain serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose and regularly until the patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. Each 5 mL of Lithium Oral Solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), which is equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate. See Table 2 for lithium carbonate and lithium oral solution dose conversion.

- **Serum lithium monitoring**: Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone.

### Informing patients of the teratogenic potential of mood stabilizing drugs: A case note review of the practice of psychiatrists [^111Cuvih]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate are established human teratogens. Women of childbearing potential who are prescribed these drugs should be informed of their teratogenic potential and advised of the need for adequate contraception and the protective role of folate. We reviewed the clinical records of all women of childbearing age in long-term contact with one specialist mental health Trust, providing services for a total population of 750,000. One hundred and thirty-eight (16%) of 837 women of childbearing age were prescribed one or more of these drugs. There was documented evidence that 29 (21%) of these women had been informed about teratogenicity and that 33 (24%) had been advised about contraception. Fourteen women (10%) had a confirmed pregnancy while taking lithium, carbamazepine, or valproate; eight had a complication of pregnancy. If prescribing practice in this large mental health Trust were typical of the UK, between 7,000 and 11,000 women of childbearing potential would be prescribed lithium, carbamazepine, or valproate by psychiatrists without documented discussion of the risks.

### Newer-generation antiepileptic drugs and the risk of major birth defects [^1147FJi8]. JAMA (2011). High credibility.

Epilepsy during pregnancy presents a therapeutic challenge. Since the 1990s, the number of licensed antiepileptic drugs has substantially increased, but safety data on the use of newer-generation antiepileptic drugs during the first trimester and their relation to birth defects are limited.

The objective of this study is to examine the association between fetal exposure to newer-generation antiepileptic drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy and the risk of major birth defects.

The study design is a population-based cohort study consisting of 837,795 live-born infants in Denmark from January 1, 1996, through September 30, 2008. Individual-level information on antiepileptic drugs dispensed to mothers, birth defect diagnoses, and potential confounders were sourced from nationwide health registries.

The main outcome measures are prevalence odds ratios (PORs) of any major birth defect diagnosed within the first year of life by fetal exposure to antiepileptic drugs.

Results indicate that among 1532 infants exposed to lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, gabapentin, or levetiracetam during the first trimester, 49 were diagnosed with a major birth defect compared to 19,911 of the 836,263 who were not exposed to an antiepileptic drug (3.2% vs 2.4%, respectively; adjusted POR [APOR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.36). A major birth defect was diagnosed in 38 of 1019 infants (3.7%) exposed to lamotrigine during the first trimester (APOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.83–1.68), in 11 of 393 infants (2.8%) exposed to oxcarbazepine (APOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.46–1.59), and in 5 of 108 infants (4.6%) exposed to topiramate (APOR, 1.44; 95% CI).

### Pregnancy outcome following in utero exposure to lithium: A prospective, comparative, observational study [^112oCYog]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). High credibility.

The authors conducted a prospective, comparative observational study to evaluate the risk of major anomalies following exposure to lithium during pregnancy.

A total of 183 lithium-exposed pregnancies of women who contacted the Israeli Teratology Information Service were followed up (90.2% in the first trimester) and compared with 72 disease-matched and 748 nonteratogenic-exposed pregnancies.

There were significantly more miscarriages (adjusted odds ratio = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.08–3.48) and elective terminations of pregnancy (17/183 [9.3%] compared with 15/748 [2.0%]) in the lithium-exposed group compared with the nonteratogenic exposure group. The rate of major congenital anomalies, after exclusion of genetic or cytogenetic anomalies, was not significantly different between the three groups: lithium-exposed in the first trimester (8/123 [6.5%]), bipolar (2/61 [3.3%]), and nonteratogenic (19/711 [2.7%]).

- **Cardiovascular anomalies**: These occurred more frequently in the lithium group exposed during the first trimester when compared with the nonteratogenic exposure group (5/123 [4.1%] compared with 4/711 [0.6%]), but not after excluding anomalies that spontaneously resolved (3/123 [2.4%] compared with 2/711 [0.3%]). Ebstein's anomaly was diagnosed in one lithium-exposed fetus and in two retrospective lithium cases that were not included because contact with the information service was made after the prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound.

- **Noncardiovascular anomalies**: The rate of noncardiovascular anomalies was not significantly different between the groups.

The rate of preterm deliveries was higher in the lithium-exposed group, indicating a potential concern for preterm birth associated with lithium use in pregnancy.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^1117iRvE]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Lithium is well-established as an effective first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, a major psychiatric condition affecting 2% of the global population. With an average age of onset at 25 years, many women of reproductive age are offered lithium. Deciding whether to continue lithium during pregnancy requires balancing the risk of fetal exposure with the benefits for the mother.

The maternal advantages of continuing lithium during pregnancy are clear. Women who stop treatment during pregnancy are almost threefold more likely to experience recurrence or relapse compared to those continuing prophylactic medications. Lithium is also effective in preventing suicide; thus, discontinuation may put women at risk of self-harm and deterioration of psychosocial and medical well-being.

In contrast, associations between lithium exposure in utero and the risk of adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes are unclear. Associations between lithium use and congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations, have been reported, suggesting an increased likelihood of malformation. Studies exploring potential associations between lithium and adverse pregnancy outcomes have been limited to small observational studies and case reports. Meta-analyses of these have reported an increased likelihood of spontaneous abortion and neonatal readmission to the hospital.

Better information on the possible impact of lithium administration on adverse pregnancy outcomes could aid clinical decision-making and surveillance in the management of psychiatric illness.

### Case report and review of the perinatal implications of maternal lithium use [^115CrcqY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to review the use of lithium during pregnancy and its effects on the neonate. This work comprises a case study and a review of the published literature. Lithium is commonly used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, specifically bipolar depression. Bipolar disorders that require treatment with lithium demand special consideration when a woman becomes pregnant. Reported neonatal problems associated with maternal lithium therapy include Ebstein's anomaly, poor respiratory effort and cyanosis, rhythm disturbances, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction, hypoglycemia, hypotonia and lethargy, hyperbilirubinemia, and large-for-gestational-age infants. While lithium can have adverse effects on the fetus and newborn infant, data suggest normal behavioral patterns in childhood.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^112Kaja2]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Regarding other pre-specified primary outcomes, lithium use was associated with a higher risk of birthing a large for gestational age infant, with a crude relative risk of 2.59 (95% CI 19.2, 3.50; 9.0% vs 3.5%) and an adjusted relative risk of 2.64 (95% CI 1.91, 3.66; 9.0% vs 3.5%). There was no association between lithium use and preeclampsia (3.5% vs 2.8%; aRR 1.01 [95% CI 0.59, 1.73]) or the birth of a small for gestational age infant (3.0% vs 2.3%; aRR 1.05 [95% CI 0.54, 2.06]).

Among secondary outcomes across the whole population, no associations were found between lithium use and macrosomia (defined as birthweight > 4500 g; 21.4% vs 18.6%; aRR 1.05 [95% CI 0.25, 4.32]), neonatal hypoglycemia (5.5% vs 2.5%; aRR 1.46 [95% CI 0.89, 2.40]), a 5-min Apgar score < 6 (2.5% vs 1.3%; aRR 0.92 [95% CI 0.38, 2.22]), total malformations (4.4% vs 3.4%; aRR 1.41 [95% CI 0.90, 2.23]), or perinatal death (0.5% vs 0.5%; aRR 1.08 [95% CI 0.15, 7.67]). However, a higher incidence of neonates with cardiac malformations was observed among women who used lithium (2.1% vs 0.8%), with an aRR of 3.17 (95% CI 1.64, 6.13). Of these, the majority (66.6%) were reported as malformations of the cardiac septa (ICD-10 Q21).

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^1122f9Tz]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A prespecified statistical analysis plan was generated prior to analyses and agreed upon by the authors. Characteristics of the population were described according to lithium use during pregnancy. Lithium users and non-users were compared via bivariate analysis using Pearson's chi-squared test for categorical data and Student's t-test for continuous variables.

The average treatment effect for lithium-treated women (average treatment effect on the treated) on adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes was estimated using Stata's 'teffects' command and presented as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals; within-mother clustering was accounted for in standard errors. Regression models were inverse probability weighted to achieve covariate balance between exposure groups. A propensity score for exposure was calculated for each individual using a logistic regression that included variables considered likely confounders based upon directed acyclic graphs and selected a priori for inclusion in the propensity score models. Included covariates were: maternal age (≥ 35 years), body mass index (≥ 30 kg/m²), smoking status, country of birth, education, parity, maternal psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia and psychosis, with an interaction term between these), other medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension), and medications such as antipsychotics (ATC code N05A), central stimulants (ATC code N06BA), or lamotrigine (ATC code N03AX09) dispensed during or 3 months prior to pregnancy.

Second, with the aim of achieving balance between exposed and unexposed groups, the estimated propensity scores were used to balance the samples.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^113hUWdB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

In this study, we examined the association between lithium use during pregnancy and fetal growth parameters. In the lithium-exposed group, we found increased fetal growth at 20 weeks of gestation when compared with the control group. Additionally, we found that prenatal lithium exposure was related to increased birth weight, whereas the average gestational age at birth was lower. Furthermore, lithium use during pregnancy was associated with LGA birth weight and preterm birth. No association of maternal bipolar spectrum disorder and fetal growth was found, which may potentially suggest a specific effect of lithium exposure during pregnancy on fetal growth.

An environmental study by Harari et al. found a non-significant inverse association between lithium exposure during pregnancy and fetal size in the second trimester in a study of 194 pregnancies in the Argentinean Andes. In addition, they found a significant association between lithium exposure during pregnancy and birth length but no association with birth weight. In this study, lithium exposure was through drinking water in relatively very low concentrations (median 25 μg/L, which corresponds to 0.0036 mmol/L, i.e. 122 times lower than the mean lithium blood concentration in our study), which could explain the difference in our findings. It is possible the increases in fetal growth and birth weight found in our study are not present when lithium blood concentration is low. The association of lithium and higher neonatal birth weight was previously found in a prospective cohort study by Jacobson et al.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^111izGzF]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In this nationwide population-based study, lithium taken during or the three months prior to pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth, the birth of a large-for-gestational-age infant, and cardiac malformations. Importantly, these associations persisted in a pre-specified sub-analysis restricted to women with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or psychosis; and a further pre-specified analysis examined mothers who used lithium during pregnancy compared to those who took lithium prior to pregnancy but not during. Among these two subgroup analyses, an increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia was also observed, in addition to the complications noted in the primary analysis. Reassuringly, however, we did not find associations between lithium use and preeclampsia, nor the birth of a small-for-gestational-age infant. These two complications can reflect placental dysfunction, and fetuses that are small-for-gestational-age incur an increased stillbirth risk.

In contrast to our results, two meta-analyses have reported no association between maternal lithium use and preterm birth. Importantly, both these studies did not differentiate between iatrogenic (where preterm birth was medically indicated) and spontaneous preterm birth, whereas our study focused on spontaneous preterm birth. The strength of our finding is that spontaneous preterm birth was consistently associated with lithium use when we compared women using lithium to not only the unexposed whole population, but also among women with psychiatric illnesses and those who ceased lithium use.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^115cKvyF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

The BAP 2020 guidelines provide updated recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, particularly in specific circumstances, such as pregnancy. They advise against the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications during pregnancy, if possible, due to the lack of dosing flexibility.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^1156Sj5V]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

The results of the multiple regression analyses on birth weight and gestational duration are presented. Lithium use during pregnancy was significantly associated with an average increase in birth weight of 142.43 grams (95% CI: 58.01, 226.89). In addition, lithium use during pregnancy was associated with gestational duration, with an average decrease of 1.41 weeks (95% CI: −1.78, −1.05). Results of the binary logistic regression analyses showed that lithium use during pregnancy was associated with large for gestational age (LGA) (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.09, 3.12) and premature birth (adjusted OR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.86, 5.74).

In the sensitivity analyses, no association of bipolar spectrum disorder with 20 weeks' fetal growth, birth weight, and gestational duration was found. The results of our analyses did not change when we limited the analyses to one pregnancy per mother, when all pregnancies before the year 2002 were removed from the analyses, and when pregnancies with gestational diabetes were removed from the lithium group.

### Risk of recurrence in women with bipolar disorder during pregnancy: prospective study of mood stabilizer discontinuation [^111TPjZo]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

This study estimated the risk of recurrence of mood episodes among women with a history of bipolar disorder who continued or discontinued treatment with mood stabilizers during pregnancy.

- **Method**: In a prospective observational clinical cohort study, the authors determined recurrence risk and survival-analysis-based time to recurrence of a new episode in 89 pregnant women with DSM-IV bipolar disorder. Eligible subjects were euthymic at conception and continued mood stabilizer treatment or discontinued treatment proximate to conception.

- **Results**: The overall risk of at least one recurrence in pregnancy was 71%. Among women who discontinued versus continued mood stabilizer treatment, recurrence risk was twofold greater, median time to first recurrence was more than fourfold shorter, and the proportion of weeks ill during pregnancy was five times greater. Median recurrence latency was 11 times shorter after abrupt/rapid versus gradual discontinuation of mood stabilizer. Most recurrences were depressive or mixed (74%), and 47% occurred during the first trimester. Predictors of recurrence included bipolar II disorder diagnosis, earlier onset, more recurrences per year, recent illness, use of antidepressants, and use of anticonvulsants versus lithium.

- **Conclusions**: Discontinuation of mood stabilizer, particularly abruptly, during pregnancy carries a high risk for new morbidity in women with bipolar disorder, especially for early depressive and dysphoric states. However, this risk is reduced markedly by continued mood stabilizer treatment. Treatment planning for pregnant women should consider the risks associated with discontinuation.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^111LhCx4]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Perinatal outcomes among women diagnosed with bipolar disorder, psychosis, or schizophrenia were examined. Adjusted analyses were conducted using inverse probability weighting, incorporating covariates such as maternal age, body mass index, smoking status, country of birth, education, parity, medical conditions, and the use of antipsychotics, neuroleptics, and lamotrigine during pregnancy.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^112yghSi]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To account for the impact of underlying psychiatric illness on perinatal outcomes, we performed two subgroup analyses. Both were planned a priori. First, we compared the same outcomes among women with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or psychosis who were either prescribed lithium or not.

Second, we compared women who had used lithium during pregnancy to those who had used lithium prior to pregnancy but not in the 3 months prior to conception or during pregnancy.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^1133hFPF]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Previous studies reporting congenital malformations have been conflicting. A meta-analysis published in 2020 concluded that lithium was associated with an increased likelihood of congenital malformations overall and specifically with cardiac malformations. In the present study, lithium use was not associated with congenital malformations overall; however, further analysis revealed an increased risk of cardiac malformations among lithium-exposed women. It is important to note that across all studies, including ours, the absolute risk of malformation is low.

Given that large for gestational age infants are at increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia, identifying both to be associated with lithium use strengthens the plausibility of our findings. Additionally, lithium use has been associated with altered blood glucose levels and hypoglycemia in adults, thus increasing the plausibility of this association in the neonate. Although we did not explore gestational diabetes within the present study, rates were similar in women exposed and unexposed to lithium during pregnancy. Additionally, two previous meta-analyses reported no association between maternal lithium use and gestational diabetes. Thus, the association between lithium and the birth of a large for gestational age infant and neonatal hypoglycemia is unlikely to be attributed to an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

### Valproate sodium [^114YdrSk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including valproate sodium, during pregnancy. Women who are taking valproate sodium during pregnancy should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling toll-free 1–888–233–2334 or visiting the website at http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This enrollment must be done by the patient herself.

- **Risk summary**: For use in the prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)]. For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue the medication abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus, resulting in maternal and fetal hypoxia and posing a threat to life.

Maternal use of valproate during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects like spina bifida, as well as malformations involving other body systems. These include craniofacial defects such as oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, and limb malformations. This risk is dose-dependent.

### Management of lithium dosing around delivery: An observational study [^116mZCcp]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Recommendations on lithium dosing around delivery vary, with several guidelines suggesting that lithium should be discontinued prior to delivery. We aimed to evaluate the validity of these recommendations by investigating: 1) maternal lithium blood level changes following delivery, and 2) the association between neonatal lithium blood levels at delivery and neonatal outcomes.

In this retrospective observational cohort study, we included women with at least one lithium blood level measurement during the final week of pregnancy and the first postpartum week. For aim 2, we included a subcohort of women with neonates for whom neonatal lithium blood levels (obtained from the umbilical cord or a neonatal vein puncture within 24 hours of delivery) were available.

There were a total of 233 maternal lithium blood level measurements; 55 (23.6%) in the week before delivery and 178 (76.4%) in the week after. There was no association between time and lithium blood level/dose ratio (Pearson correlation coefficient −0.03, P = 0.63). Additionally, we included a total of 29 neonates for whom a lithium measurement was performed within 24 hours postpartum. Maternal and neonatal lithium blood levels were strongly correlated. We observed no associations between neonatal lithium blood levels at delivery and neonatal outcomes.

Based on our findings, we do not recommend lowering the dosage or discontinuation of lithium prior to delivery. Stable dosing can prevent subtherapeutic lithium serum levels, which is especially important in the postpartum period.

Regarding medical management for peripartum depression, specifically concerning antidepressants, SIGN 2012 guidelines recommend monitoring for alterations in fetal growth in patients taking antipsychotics during pregnancy. Additional monitoring for blood glucose abnormalities is necessary when olanzapine or clozapine are used.

### Postpartum psychosis: A proposed treatment algorithm [^114AVoxx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

There is evidence for lithium as an adjunctive medication in postpartum psychosis (PPP) for both acute treatment and prophylaxis, and a case report suggests it may also be effective in monotherapy in acute PPP. In a study of 64 women with PPP, 98.4% achieved clinical remission with a combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic, and lithium.

In this stepwise treatment study:

- **Benzodiazepine alone**: 6.3% achieved remission.
- **Combination of benzodiazepine and antipsychotic**: 18.8% achieved remission.
- **Combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic, and lithium**: 73.4% achieved remission. The final step of the study algorithm was electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which was not used as all participants had responded to the combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic, and lithium.

In the same cohort, 79.7% of women maintained remission at nine months postpartum with lithium monotherapy.

Lithium has the most robust evidence base for relapse prevention in PPP. There are concerns about declining rates of lithium prescription worldwide at present, with a preference given to second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Similarly, in PPP, antipsychotics are routinely preferred in clinical practice for long-term relapse prevention, possibly because of clinicians' negative perception of lithium's side effect profile and requirement for blood monitoring. However, given the metabolic risks of antipsychotics in women with PPP and the superiority of evidence for lithium in relapse prevention, we recommend consideration of lithium for relapse prevention in PPP.

### SPL drug information for lithium citrate [^112Mjnm1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lithium citrate PO in pregnant patients throughout all trimesters, it is advised to avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is important to monitor the thyroid function of the neonate and watch for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. Early voluntary reports to international birth registries suggested an increase in cardiovascular malformations, particularly concerning Ebstein's anomaly, with first trimester use of lithium. There are concerns regarding maternal and/or neonatal lithium toxicity during late pregnancy and the postpartum period. If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, serum lithium concentrations should be carefully monitored, and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. Two to three days prior to delivery, the lithium dosage should be decreased or discontinued to mitigate the risk of maternal and/or neonatal toxicity.

### A common clinical conundrum: Antidepressant treatment of depression in pregnant women [^116QDRad]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Low credibility.

Depression during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes. Treatment during pregnancy requires a balanced discussion of the risks of both drug exposure and untreated depression. An updated review of the epidemiology, outcomes, and management of maternal depression is presented. Adverse outcomes are associated with both maternal depression and antidepressants. Research gaps include data on the longitudinal developmental trajectory of offspring exposed to antidepressants compared to depression, with assessment of in utero symptom exposure and environmental exposures. Additionally, neonatal syndrome associated with antidepressant use during pregnancy has no consensus definition or mechanistic explanation. With sophisticated large-scale epidemiologic studies, there has been progress in distinguishing the impact of depression processes from medication used for treatment. Optimal treatment of perinatal depression includes close symptom monitoring and medication adjustments to maintain symptom remission. This evolving field requires frequent consultation with reproductive data sources included in this article.

### Anticonvulsant mood stabilizer and lithium use and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [^113zt18v]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine the comparative safety of mood stabilizers with respect to risk of preeclampsia, placental abruption, growth restriction, and preterm birth.

- **Methods**: A cohort study was carried out using Medicaid Analytic eXtract data for pregnant women linked to live-born infants enrolled from 2000 to 2010. Exposure to lamotrigine, valproate, topiramate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and lithium during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was assessed. The reference group did not fill a prescription for an anticonvulsant or lithium during the 3 months prior to conception or the first half of pregnancy. Women who continued mood stabilizer monotherapy after 20 weeks were also compared to those who discontinued. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with propensity score stratification to control for confounding.

- **Results**: Among 1,472,672 pregnancies, 10,575 (0.7%) were exposed to anticonvulsant mood stabilizer or lithium monotherapy and 917 (0.06%) were exposed to polytherapy. In unadjusted analyses, exposure to each specific mood stabilizer and polytherapy was associated with increased risks of all adverse outcomes considered compared to no exposure (RR ranged from 1.15 to 1.56). However, these RR estimates were not meaningfully elevated with adjustment for confounding (0.89 to 1.16). Continuation of mood stabilizers was not associated with an increased risk for any outcomes compared to discontinuation and was associated with a reduced risk of placental abruption and growth restriction.

In conclusion, anticonvulsant mood stabilizers and lithium were not associated with increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes, suggesting a potential safety advantage when continued during pregnancy.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring of psychoactive drugs during pregnancy in the genomic era: Challenges and opportunities [^114Wfkg9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Various symptoms of mental illness occur commonly during pregnancy. It is estimated that serious mental disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, panic, and other anxiety disorders, occur with a frequency of 10 to 25% in community samples of US women in their child-bearing years. As a result, approximately a third of all women take at least one psychoactive drug during pregnancy. Fetal drug exposure has been documented for all psychoactive drugs studied at the time of writing. However, the rate and extent of placental transfer within and between psychoactive drug classes remain ill-defined. The contribution of various genetic factors, such as the role of polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters in controlling the variability of fetal drug exposure, is also unclear.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has traditionally played an important role in psychiatric pharmacotherapy during pregnancy to ensure an adequate drug dose to achieve desired benefits while avoiding excessive fetal accumulation. In the genomic era, individualized treatment with specific drugs tailored to the mother's and fetus's genotype should eventually become the standard of care. Several methodological problems need to be overcome for this prediction to become reality. One approach to this goal, taken by the Specialized Center of Research on Sex and Gender Factors Affecting Women's Health at the Emory University Women's Mental Health Program, is described. This research is grounded on TDM of pregnant women receiving antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anti-epileptic drugs.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^114mXtU2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Thanks to a collaboration between Erasmus University Medical Center and Leiden University Medical Center, we were able to include a large number of women with bipolar disorder who used lithium during pregnancy. Also, thanks to a collaboration with the Generation R study, we were able to compare this group with a representative sample of the general population, which increased the power of this study. The results of this study need to be interpreted with a few limitations in mind. As in any observational study, we cannot rule out residual confounding, namely, unmeasured factors associated with both lithium and fetal growth. For example, we did not have detailed information on education and socioeconomic status in the lithium group and were therefore not able to adjust for these possible confounders. However, it is unlikely that our results are driven by a confounding effect of socioeconomic status. Bipolar disorder is associated with lower socioeconomic status, and low socioeconomic status has been associated with lower birth weight. On the contrary, we find fetal growth to be increased in the lithium group. Other possible confounding factors of importance might be related to the severity of the psychiatric disease, as well as dosing regimens and serum levels of lithium, glucose metabolism, and nutrition. Also, our study was not designed to study trimester-specific effects since we assessed fetal growth at one time point during pregnancy. We did have birth weight data, enabling us to conclude that the effect we found at around 20 weeks of gestation was still present at birth.

### Brain development after intrauterine exposure to lithium: A magnetic resonance imaging study in school-age children [^115cvYSV]. Bipolar Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Lithium is often continued during pregnancy to reduce the risk of perinatal mood episodes for women with bipolar disorder. However, little is known about the effect of intrauterine lithium exposure on brain development. The aim of this study was to investigate brain structure in children after intrauterine exposure to lithium.

- **Methods**: Participants were offspring, aged 8–14 years, of women with a diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder. A total of 63 children participated in the study: 30 with and 33 without intrauterine exposure to lithium. Global brain volume outcomes and white matter integrity were assessed using structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, respectively. Primary outcomes were total brain, cortical and subcortical gray matter, cortical white matter, lateral ventricles, cerebellum, hippocampus and amygdala volumes, cortical thickness, cortical surface area, global fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity. To assess how our data compared to the general population, global brain volumes were compared with those from the Generation R study (N = 3243).

- **Results**: In our primary analyses, we found no statistically significant associations between intrauterine exposure to lithium and structural brain measures. There was a non-significant trend toward reduced subcortical gray matter volume. Compared to the general population, lithium-exposed children showed reduced subcortical gray and cortical white matter volumes.

- **Conclusion**: We found no differences in brain structure between lithium-exposed and non-lithium-exposed children aged 8–14 years.

### Prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnancy and breastfeeding: focus on emerging mood stabilizers [^11787GEc]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorders are reported to have a high incidence during childbearing years, and the need may arise to start or continue pharmacological treatment during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In recent years, several investigations have evaluated the efficacy of emerging mood-stabilizing agents in the treatment of bipolar disorders, such as lamotrigine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone.

A number of studies examining the use of oxcarbazepine point to its potential usefulness in prophylactic treatment. The aim of this review is to compare information from the literature on the safety of lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine to the safety data on classic mood stabilizers during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

A computerized search, conducted from 1980 to April 5, 2006, led to the summarization of the results. (References were updated after acceptance and prior to publication.)

Emerging mood stabilizers show uncertain safety parameters in pregnancy and lactation. Limited information on lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine does not suggest a clear increase in teratogenicity, while olanzapine appears to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic complications in pregnant women. Data about risperidone and quetiapine are still inconclusive. Finally, the literature on the safety of these compounds in breastfeeding is anecdotal.

Untreated pregnant bipolar women are at an increased risk of poor obstetrical outcomes and relapse of affective symptoms. On the other hand, treatment during these periods requires careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits.

### The effect of prenatal lithium exposure on the neuropsychological development of the child [^116MQqbf]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by episodes of depression and (hypo)mania. Lithium is the most effective maintenance treatment and is also well established during the acute phase of the disease. As the onset of bipolar disorder is often in early adulthood, lithium is frequently prescribed to women of childbearing age and may be continued during pregnancy. An important reason to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy is that it reduces the risk of a mood episode during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. However, lithium crosses the placenta freely, resulting in fetal serum levels equaling that of the mother. For well-informed and balanced decision-making, more information on the potential fetal impact is needed.

Most research has focused on the teratogenicity of lithium, investigating the incidence of congenital malformations in lithium-exposed infants. Recently, two large studies have confirmed the results of previous smaller studies and reported that lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations, but this effect was smaller than previously estimated. Some other studies have reported an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, increased birth weight, and neonatal admissions.

### Management of lithium dosing around delivery: An observational study [^112JSKs7]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Recommendations on lithium dosing around delivery vary, with several guidelines suggesting that lithium should be discontinued prior to delivery. This study aimed to evaluate the validity of these recommendations by investigating maternal lithium blood level changes following delivery and the association between neonatal lithium blood levels at delivery and neonatal outcomes.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective observational cohort study, women with at least one lithium blood level measurement during the final week of pregnancy and the first postpartum week were included. For the second aim, a subcohort of women with neonates for whom neonatal lithium blood levels (obtained from the umbilical cord or a neonatal vein puncture within 24 hours of delivery) were available.

- **Results**: There were a total of 233 maternal lithium blood level measurements, with 55 (23.6%) taken in the week before delivery and 178 (76.4%) in the week after. No association between time and lithium blood level/dose ratio was found (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.03, P = 0.63). A total of 29 neonates were included for whom a lithium measurement was performed within 24 hours postpartum. Maternal and neonatal lithium blood levels were strongly correlated. There were no associations observed between neonatal lithium blood levels at delivery and neonatal outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: Based on these findings, we do not recommend lowering the dosage or discontinuation of lithium prior to delivery. Stable dosing can prevent subtherapeutic lithium serum levels, which is especially important in the postpartum period.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^1179mDLt]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

In this retrospective observational cohort study, data were collected from two academic medical centers in the Netherlands: the Erasmus University Medical Center and the Leiden University Medical Center. Pregnant women using lithium and referred for advanced fetal ultrasound scanning between March 1994 and January 2018 were evaluated for eligibility. In the Netherlands, all pregnant women using lithium are referred for an advanced 20-week ultrasound scan. All singleton pregnancies were included if there was daily lithium use from conception until 20 weeks of gestation and if data from the advanced 20-week ultrasound scan were available (n = 119).

As a control population, the Generation R Study, a prospective population-based study conducted in Rotterdam with delivery dates from 2002 until 2006, was used. All participants in the Generation R Study provided written informed consent. The Generation R Study is designed to identify early environmental and genetic determinants of growth, development, and health from fetal life until young adulthood. All singleton pregnancies in the Generation R Study with information from the start of pregnancy and data from the 20-week ultrasound scan were included as a reference group (n = 8184). None of these pregnancies were exposed to lithium. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Erasmus University Medical Center and conducted and reported in accordance with the STROBE guidelines.

### Peripartum lithium management: Early maternal and neonatal outcomes [^111oNZHj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that a 30–50% lithium dose reduction or lithium discontinuation 24–48 hours before delivery could minimize neonatal complications. We investigated the maternal lithemia changes around delivery following a brief discontinuation, the placental transfer of lithium at delivery, and the association between neonatal lithemia at delivery and acute neonatal outcomes.

- **Methods**: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a teaching hospital from November 2006 to December 2018. Data were extracted from medical records. We included psychopathologically stable women with a singleton pregnancy, treated with lithium in late pregnancy, with at least one maternal and neonatal lithemia at delivery. Lithium was discontinued 12 hours before a scheduled caesarean section or induction, or at admission day to hospital birth, and was restarted 6–12 hours postpartum.

- **Results**: Sixty-six mother-infant pairs were included, and 226 maternal and 66 neonatal lithemias were obtained. We found slight maternal lithemia fluctuations close to 0.20 mEq/L and an early postpartum relapse rate of 6%. The mean (SD) umbilical cord/mother intrapartum lithemia ratio was 1.10 (0.17). Fifty-six percent of neonates presented transient acute complications. Neonatal hypotonia was the most frequent outcome (N = 15). Mean lithemia levels were 0.178 mEq/L higher in those with hypotonia than in those without (p = 0.028).

- **Limitations**: It is a retrospective cohort of a moderate sample size of healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies and results cannot be generalized to all pregnant women treated with lithium.

### SPL drug information for lithium carbonate [^1167UoK6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lithium carbonate PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is important to monitor the thyroid function of the neonate and observe neonates for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. The use of adequate methods of contraception should be encouraged. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. During pregnancy, serum lithium levels should be closely monitored, and prenatal diagnosis of malformations should be conducted. Use should be discontinued shortly before delivery and restarted a few days postpartum. After birth, the newborn should be monitored for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity, including thyroid function.

### Valproate teratogenicity: A moving target [^116uDfqg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Within several years after receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the late 1970s, valproate was shown to increase the risk for major congenital malformations and learning disabilities in the offspring of women who used the drug during pregnancy. Nonetheless, its use in pregnant women has persisted for more than four decades, recently resulting in numerous lawsuits and, in countries other than the United States, criminal indictments of the manufacturers of valproate.

Use of valproate in pregnancy persisted and extended beyond its original indication for the treatment of epilepsy. Several recent studies indicate that the drug is more often prescribed to treat pregnant women with bipolar depression and migraine than for seizure control. Especially concerning is the absence of valproate from the list of more than 60 drugs for which the FDA has implemented Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies to prevent or limit untoward consequences associated with specific drugs. Until this step is taken, avoidance of the teratogenic effects of valproate will rely on the vigilance of those caring for women and people with the potential to get pregnant.

### Risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in women treated or not treated with mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder: Population based cohort study [^113H9nqu]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations of the study**: The major strengths of this study include its large sample size with a population-based cohort and the inclusion of comprehensive information on maternal diagnoses, drug use, and important confounders such as smoking, body mass index, and alcohol and substance misuse. The results are highly generalisable owing to the study design and minimal losses to follow-up. The bipolar diagnoses in the Swedish patient register have high validity in relation to the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision. Obtaining information on drug use from the prescribed drug register ensured coverage throughout the pregnancy, except in situations of hospital admission when a drug might have been administered without a prescription. However, since only four of the untreated women were admitted to a psychiatric ward during pregnancy, the lack of information on hospital-administered drugs was of negligible importance.

	- We did not examine other drugs or medical conditions as covariates, which, at least theoretically, could have influenced our results. Treatment was measured based on dispensed drugs, which does not necessarily imply the use of a drug; nonetheless, fairly good agreement has been reported between the use of anticonvulsants and antipsychotics during pregnancy and dispensed drugs. Furthermore, misclassification of drug use is likely to be non-differential according to outcome status, and if anything, this may bias the risk estimates toward the null. The reasons for treatment, which were unknown to us, might have biased the results.

### LamictalXR [^1161oFE5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

As with other AEDs, physiological changes during pregnancy may affect lamotrigine concentrations and/or its therapeutic effect. There have been reports of decreased lamotrigine concentrations during pregnancy and the restoration of pre-pregnancy concentrations after delivery. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response.

- **Human data**: Data from several international pregnancy registries have not shown an increased risk for malformations overall. The International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry reported major congenital malformations in 2.2% (95% CI: 1.6%, 3.1%) of 1,558 infants exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester of pregnancy. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry reported major congenital malformations among 2.0% of 1,562 infants exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester. EURAP, a large international pregnancy registry focused outside of North America, reported major birth defects in 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3%, 3.7%) of 2,514 exposures to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester. The frequency of major congenital malformations was similar to estimates from the general population.

- **Increased risk of isolated oral clefts**: The NAAED Pregnancy Registry observed an increased risk of isolated oral clefts. Among 2,200 infants exposed to lamotrigine early in pregnancy, the risk of oral clefts was 3.2 per 1,000 (95% CI: 1.4, 6.3), representing a three-fold increased risk versus unexposed healthy controls. This finding has not been observed in other large international pregnancy registries. Furthermore, a case-control study based on 21 congenital anomaly registries covering…

### Management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^111wWFNp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness.

- **Method**: An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated.

- **Results**: The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g. sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past.

- **Conclusions**: Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^113cg6GX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Lithium is an effective treatment in pregnancy and postpartum for the prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder, but there is a lack of knowledge about the potential adverse impact on fetal development.

- **Aims**: To investigate the impact of lithium exposure on early fetal growth.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective observational cohort study, we included all singleton pregnancies of women using lithium and referred for advanced fetal ultrasound scanning between 1994 and 2018 to the University Medical Centers in Leiden and Rotterdam, the Netherlands (n = 119). The Generation R study, a population-based cohort, served as a non-exposed control population from the same geographic region (n = 8184). Fetal head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and transcerebellar diameter were measured by ultrasound at 18–22 weeks of gestation.

- **Results**: Lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an average increase in head circumference of 1.77 mm (95% confidence interval: 0.53, 3.01), in abdominal circumference of 5.54 mm (95% confidence interval: 3.95, 7.12), and in femur length of 0.59 mm (95% confidence interval: 0.22, 0.96) at 18–22 weeks gestation. Furthermore, lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an average increase in birth weight of 142.43 grams (95% confidence interval: 58.01, 226.89), whereas it was associated with an average decrease of 1.41 weeks in gestational duration (95% confidence interval: -1.78, -1.05).

- **Conclusions**: Lithium use during pregnancy was associated with increased fetal growth parameters at 18–22 weeks gestational age and increased birth weight.

### Wellbutrin XL [^113kNhTq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical considerations: A prospective, longitudinal study followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants during pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than those who continued antidepressants. Consider the risks to the mother of untreated depression and potential effects on the fetus when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medications during pregnancy and postpartum.

- **Data**:

- **Human data**: Data from the international bupropion Pregnancy Registry (675 first trimester exposures) and a retrospective cohort study using the United Healthcare database (1,213 first trimester exposures) did not show an increased risk for malformations overall. The Registry was not designed or powered to evaluate specific defects but suggested a possible increase in cardiac malformations.

- No increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall has been observed after bupropion exposure during the first trimester. The prospectively observed rate of cardiovascular malformations in pregnancies with exposure to bupropion in the first trimester from the international Pregnancy Registry was 1.3% (9 cardiovascular malformations/675 first-trimester maternal bupropion exposures), which is similar to the background rate of cardiovascular malformations (approximately 1%). Data from the United Healthcare database, which has a limited number of exposures, is consistent with these findings.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^111ZZBoS]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Descriptive statistics and statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 24, IBM). The association of prenatal lithium exposure with fetal growth measurements and birth weight was analyzed using separate multiple linear regression analyses. Models for fetal growth and birth weight were adjusted for the following covariates: maternal age, maternal BMI, gestational age at the time of measurement, parity, smoking, and psychotropic medication use other than lithium (i.e. a combined covariate for the use of drugs for depression, psychosis, and insomnia/anxiety). In addition, the model for birth weight was adjusted for the sex of the child. Interactions between the covariates and lithium use were tested for significant improvement of the model fit. Quadratic and cubic terms for gestational age were tested for significant improvement of the model fit. Models for gestational age at birth were adjusted for maternal age, maternal BMI, parity, smoking, and psychotropic medication use other than lithium. To compare our results to previous studies and assess clinical relevance, we additionally calculated odds ratios for preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation) and large for gestational age (LGA, i.e. a birth weight above the 90th percentile of birth weight by gestational age and sex), using binary logistic regression analyses. Odds ratios were adjusted for the same covariates as described previously. All continuous covariates were centered to improve interpretation. Missing data in the covariates were handled using appropriate imputation methods.

### Maternal and infant outcomes associated with lithium use in pregnancy: An international collaborative meta-analysis of six cohort studies [^115q3sH7]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

Concerns about teratogenicity and maternal and offspring complications restrict the use of lithium during pregnancy for the treatment of mood disorders. We aimed to investigate the association between in-utero lithium exposure and risk of pregnancy complications, delivery outcomes, neonatal morbidity, and congenital malformations.

- **Methods**: In this meta-analysis, primary data from pregnant women and their children from six international cohorts based in the community (Denmark, Sweden, and Ontario, Canada) and in clinics (the Netherlands, UK, and USA) were analysed. Pregnancies were eligible for analysis if the pregnancy resulted in a liveborn singleton between 1997 and 2015, if health-related information was available for both mother and infant, and if the mother had a mood disorder (bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) or if she had been given lithium during pregnancy (at least two dispensations of lithium during pregnancy that were dispensed any time from 1 month before conception until the delivery, or a single lithium dispensation during pregnancy when there was at least one other lithium dispensation within 6 months before or after this date). Pregnancies during which the mother had been prescribed known teratogenic drugs were excluded. Pregnancies were grouped into a lithium-exposed group and a mood disorder reference group. The main outcome measures were pregnancy complications, delivery outcomes, neonatal readmission to the hospital within 28 days of birth, and congenital malformations (major malformations and major cardiac malformations).

### Management of lithium dosing around delivery: An observational study [^116uqB3i]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

- **3 Results**

- **Lithium blood level changes following delivery (Aim 1)**: We identified 78 women with a total of 100 pregnancies who were referred to the specialized outpatient university clinics of Rotterdam (n = 57) and Leiden (n = 21). The most common psychiatric diagnosis was bipolar spectrum disorder (n = 68, 87.2%), while the remaining women (n = 10, 12.8%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, depressive disorder, or borderline personality traits. Median parity of all pregnancies was 1 (range 0–6) with a mean age at delivery of 34.6 years (SD 4.3).

	- **There were a total of 233 lithium blood level measurements**: 55 (23.6%) in the week before delivery and 178 (76.4%) in the week after. The mean lithium dosage was 1071 mg (SD 368) in the week before delivery and 1016 mg (SD 284) in the week after delivery. The mean lithium blood level was 0.73 mmol/L in the week before delivery and 0.70 mmol/L in the week after delivery. The course of the lithium blood level/dose ratio before and after delivery can be seen in Figure 1. There was no association between time and ratio (Pearson correlation coefficient −0.03, P = 0.63). Lithium blood levels not normalized to dose can be found in Supplementary Figure 1.

- **Lithium blood levels and neonatal complications (Aim 2)**: We included a total of 29 neonates for whom a lithium measurement was performed within 24 hours postpartum (20 umbilical cord, 9 neonatal vein puncture). Cohort characteristics are represented in Table 1. While approximately half of the neonates had a complica

### Psychopharmacological drug utilization patterns in pregnant women with bipolar disorder - a nationwide register-based study [^114Ma5CU]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is often associated with a lifetime indication for treatment with psychotropic drugs; thus, pregnant women face the dilemma of whether to continue treatment or not. This study describes the psychopharmacological drug utilization patterns among women with bipolar disorder from 12 months preconception to 12 months postpartum.

- **Methods**: We conducted a register-based cohort study among all Danish women aged 15–55 with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, who gave birth to their first and singleton child between January 1997 and December 2012. Psychotropic drug use was determined by prescriptions obtained from the Danish National Prescription Registry.

- **Results**: We identified 336 women. The proportion of women redeeming prescriptions for any psychotropic drug decreased during pregnancy, from 54.8% in the 3 months preconception to 36.6% in the third trimester (p < 0.001). Lithium dosing increased significantly during pregnancy. A total of 35 (41.2%) of the women on psychotropic monotherapy and 37 (50.0%) of the women on psychotropic polypharmacy used an antidepressant without concomitant use of a mood-stabilizer at some time during pregnancy.

- **Limitations**: Only redemption of prescriptions was assessable; thus, we were not able to assess compliance and discontinuation of treatment before the end of the treatment duration. There was no information on drug use during hospitalizations.

- **Conclusions**: We found a decrease in the proportion of women redeeming prescriptions during pregnancy. There was a high prevalence of antidepressant use without a mood-stabilizer.

### The effect of prenatal lithium exposure on the neuropsychological development of the child [^1138oGDw]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Lithium serum level during pregnancy did not affect neuropsychological outcomes in our study. An effect on IQ was observed following correction for parental IQ and maternal lifetime number of episodes, but it was not present after correcting for multiple potential confounders. Importantly, lithium has a small therapeutic range that is usually closely monitored during pregnancy. Given this small range, potential effects of serum levels may not be evident in our relatively small subsample. Notably, serum lithium levels were available only in 61% of lithium-exposed pregnancies, and model estimates showed wide confidence intervals. Consequently, these analyses should be interpreted with caution as they were likely underpowered.

This study has several strengths and limitations. It is the largest prospective cohort study on this topic thus far. A key strength is the use of validated tests for assessing IQ and neuropsychological functioning. Although not every aspect of neuropsychological functioning was studied, the research provided information on IQ and six different cognitive domains. Participants were recruited via specialized centers for perinatal psychiatry, allowing for detailed pregnancy information. This made it possible to define exposure with considerable certainty and correct for the most relevant confounding factors. Furthermore, by including a non-exposed control group with matched maternal psychiatric diagnoses, the study offered substantial comparative analysis.

### Antipsychotic drug use in pregnancy: High dimensional, propensity matched, population based cohort study [^11371WDC]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Decisions about medication use in pregnancy involve weighing the indications and potential benefits over those of potential harm to both mother and child. Women requiring antipsychotic medications are at a higher absolute risk for certain adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes compared with the general population. Therefore, it is prudent to closely monitor the medical health of these women before and during pregnancy, with particular attention to issues related to diabetes, hypertension, preterm birth, and fetal growth. However, antipsychotic medications themselves do not seem to have an extensive negative impact on important measures of maternal medical and short-term perinatal well-being. This is reassuring, at least in the short term, for women with serious mental illness who require antipsychotic medication to achieve and maintain psychiatric stability during and after pregnancy.

### Management of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy [^112JWZrp]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Psychiatric conditions, including substance misuse disorders, are serious, potentially life-threatening illnesses that can be successfully treated with psychotropic drugs, even during pregnancy. Since few rigorously designed prospective studies have examined the safety of these drugs during pregnancy, the default clinical recommendation has been to discontinue them, especially during the first trimester. However, evidence accumulated over the past decade suggests that most psychotropic drugs are relatively safe for use during pregnancy. Not using them when indicated for serious psychiatric illness poses a greater risk to both mother and child, including tragic outcomes such as suicide and infanticide.

This review provides an updated and careful examination of the most rigorous scientific studies on the effects of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy. The lack of evidence in several areas means that definite conclusions cannot be made about the risks and benefits of all psychotropic drug use during pregnancy.

### Benefits and risks of psychiatric medications during pregnancy [^112ki4MZ]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Traditionally, psychiatric medications were withheld during pregnancy due to concerns about teratogenic and other effects. However, evidence demonstrating the safety of most commonly used psychiatric medications, the availability of this information through online databases, and the documentation of adverse effects from untreated maternal mental illness have increased the comfort of physicians and patients with the use of psychiatric medications during pregnancy.

The tricyclic antidepressants and fluoxetine (Prozac) appear to be free of teratogenic effects. Emerging data support similar safety profiles for other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, mood stabilizers appear to be teratogenic. Aside from the established risk of depression worsening in the postpartum period, there is inconsistent evidence concerning the effects of pregnancy on the natural history of mental illness. Decisions regarding the use of psychiatric medications should be individualized, with a primary consideration being the patient's previous level of functioning when not taking medications.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^112pTV8H]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Lithium use: Different types and various compounds of lithium were used. The most commonly prescribed was lithium carbonate, also known as Camcolit® and Priadel®. Another preparation is lithium citrate, also known as Litarex®. In 60 pregnancies, women used lithium carbonate (Camcolit® n = 37, Priadel® n = 19, and lithium carbonate (other brands), n = 4); lithium citrate was used in 38 pregnancies. In the remaining 21 pregnancies, the prescription of lithium medication was unknown. The average daily lithium dosage during pregnancy was 1007 mg, divided over an average of 2.8 doses per day. Lithium citrate dosages (Litarex 564 mg = 6 mmol lithium) were multiplied by 0.395 to calculate lithium carbonate dosage equivalents (400 mg = 10.8 mmol lithium). Maternal lithium plasma level during pregnancy was available for 88 pregnancies. The mean lithium level close to the time of the ultrasound was 0.44 mmol/L.

Fetal growth measurements: Associations of lithium exposure with fetal growth characteristics were noted. Lithium use during pregnancy was significantly associated with an average increase in most growth parameters at 20 weeks of gestation, including head circumference (HC) of 1.77 mm (95% CI: 0.53, 3.01), abdominal circumference (AC) of 5.54 mm (95% CI: 3.95, 7.12), femur length (FL) of 0.59 mm (95% CI: 0.22, 0.96), and estimated fetal weight of 21.05 grams (95% CI: 12.29, 29.81). Lithium use during pregnancy showed no association with transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD) measurements (β: 0.13, 95% CI: −0.11, 0.36).
