## Question

What replaces PO amio if the patient is NPO

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to use to replace oral amiodarone when a patient becomes NPO. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is already on chronic oral amiodarone or needs acute therapy. Then, I should verify the regulatory indication for intravenous amiodarone in patients who cannot take oral medication. Next, I will review guideline-supported dosing regimens for IV amiodarone across scenarios like ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation rate control, and pharmacologic cardioversion. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetics to decide whether to bridge or simply substitute, and how to transition back to oral therapy. Finally, I should confirm safety monitoring, drug interactions, and special populations before summarizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. If a patient on chronic oral amiodarone becomes NPO, the priority is to maintain antiarrhythmic coverage and avoid withdrawal, given amiodarone's long half-life and tissue accumulation; if the patient is new and needs acute therapy, I should align the IV regimen with the indication and hemodynamic status, and I need to ensure continuous ECG monitoring and resuscitation capability when initiating IV therapy [^6ed3ee81] [^fd1be9f5].

> I will now examine the regulatory indication. The FDA labeling for amiodarone injection explicitly states it can be used for patients with ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia refractory to other therapy, and it can also be used to treat patients for whom oral amiodarone is indicated but who are unable to take oral medication, which directly supports substituting IV for PO in NPO patients when clinically appropriate [^bd037702] [^3629d6ac].

> Next, I should review guideline-endorsed IV regimens. For ventricular arrhythmias, the ACC/AHA/HRS guideline supports 300 mg IV bolus for VF/pulseless VT, 150 mg IV bolus for stable VT, followed by 1 mg/min for 6 hours then 0.5 mg/min for 18 hours, with transition to oral dosing thereafter; this is the standard bridge for NPO patients who need ongoing therapy [^6ed3ee81] [^3e8eb829]. For atrial fibrillation rate control in critically ill or decompensated heart failure, IV amiodarone is reasonable when beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are ineffective or contraindicated, with typical loading of 150 mg over 10 minutes followed by 1 mg/min for 6 hours and 0.5 mg/min thereafter, recognizing slower onset than some alternatives [^1cc67200] [^4f0c171c]. For pharmacologic cardioversion of AF, IV amiodarone is a reasonable option, albeit with conversion often taking 8–12 hours, using similar loading and infusion strategies [^70c3efd0] [^52aa2ee6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply stopping the oral drug. I need to check pharmacokinetics. Amiodarone has a very long terminal half-life of roughly 26–107 days, so abrupt cessation of oral therapy does not lead to immediate loss of effect; however, to avoid undertreatment during prolonged NPO status, substituting IV amiodarone is prudent, and the total daily IV dose of about 720–1000 mg approximates a 200–400 mg oral maintenance dose, though exact conversion is imprecise and should be individualized with clinical response guiding adjustments [^17603789] [^e93e3a92] [^7f7cc4ce].

> Let me think about the transition back to oral therapy. The FDA labeling and clinical reviews provide a practical bridge: if IV amiodarone was used for less than 1 week, oral loading of 800–1600 mg/day is reasonable; if 1–3 weeks of IV therapy, 600–800 mg/day is typical; if more than 3 weeks, 400 mg/day often suffices, with further reduction to 200–400 mg/day for long-term maintenance based on efficacy and tolerability; this aligns with the principle that tissue stores accumulate with prolonged IV use, allowing lower oral loads [^a069d758] [^7f7cc4ce].

> I should confirm safety monitoring and precautions. Before and during IV therapy, I need to correct electrolytes, obtain baseline and periodic liver enzymes, chest radiograph, and pulmonary function tests when feasible, and monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, QT prolongation, and pulmonary toxicity; boxed warnings emphasize these risks and the need for continuous ECG monitoring and resuscitation capability during initiation, with particular vigilance in patients with structural heart disease or decompensated heart failure [^fd1be9f5] [^7f7cc4ce]. I also need to remember drug interactions, notably potentiation of warfarin and digoxin, so I should anticipate dose reductions and check levels when relevant [^ea6a372f].

> But wait, what if the indication is AF rate control and the patient is not in decompensated heart failure? In that scenario, first-line agents are beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and IV amiodarone is reserved when these are ineffective or contraindicated; in decompensated HFrEF, IV amiodarone is favored over calcium channel blockers for acute rate control, reinforcing that the substitute is context-specific rather than a universal replacement [^1cc67200] [^931181f2].

> I should double-check special populations. In renal impairment, including intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or CRRT, no dose adjustment is required for IV amiodarone, though clinical monitoring remains essential; in hepatic disease, use caution and monitor transaminases, reducing dose or discontinuing if liver enzymes rise excessively; in older adults, clearance is slower, so lower starting doses and slower titration are prudent [^e65f072e] [^53dbf592] [^251d7ce0] [^0e1bca7e] [^0fef213f].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows: if a patient on chronic oral amiodarone becomes NPO, substitute IV amiodarone using a 150 mg bolus over 10 minutes followed by 1 mg/min for 6 hours then 0.5 mg/min for 18 hours, totaling about 1000 mg in the first 24 hours, and continue at 0.5 mg/min thereafter if needed; for breakthrough VT/VF, repeat 150 mg boluses as required, and transition back to oral dosing based on duration of IV therapy as above, while maintaining continuous ECG monitoring and reassessing electrolytes, liver function, lungs, and thyroid periodically during treatment [^e93e3a92] [^6ed3ee81] [^ede0d800] [^fd1be9f5].

---

When a patient on oral amiodarone becomes NPO, **switch to IV amiodarone** to maintain therapeutic levels and prevent arrhythmia recurrence [^bd037702]. Use a **150 mg IV bolus over 10 minutes**, followed by a **1 mg/min infusion for 6 hours**, then **0.5 mg/min for 18 hours** (total ~1,000 mg in 24 hours) [^e93e3a92]. After 24 hours, continue at 0.5 mg/min or transition to oral amiodarone when feasible, adjusting the dose based on clinical response and duration of IV therapy [^e93e3a92] [^ede0d800]. Monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, and hepatic or pulmonary toxicity during IV therapy [^fd1be9f5].

---

## Indications for switching to IV amiodarone

IV amiodarone is indicated when **oral therapy is interrupted** (e.g. NPO status) to maintain therapeutic levels and prevent arrhythmia recurrence [^bd037702]. It is also used for acute treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and for patients who cannot take oral medication [^3629d6ac].

---

## Recommended IV amiodarone dosing regimen

The recommended IV amiodarone regimen is:

| **Phase** | **Dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial load | 150 mg IV bolus | Over 10 minutes |
| First infusion | 1 mg/min | 6 hours (360 mg) |
| Second infusion | 0.5 mg/min | 18 hours (540 mg) |
| Total initial dose | ~1,000 mg | 24 hours |

---

After 24 hours, continue the infusion at **0.5 mg/min** or transition to oral amiodarone when feasible [^e93e3a92].

---

## Transition from IV to oral amiodarone

When transitioning from IV to oral therapy, adjust the oral dose based on the **duration of IV therapy**:

| **Duration of iv therapy** | **Recommended oral dose** |
|-|-|
| < 1 week | 800–1,600 mg/day (divided doses) |
| 1–3 weeks | 600–800 mg/day (divided doses) |
| > 3 weeks | 400 mg/day (once daily or divided doses) |

---

These recommendations align with FDA labeling and clinical practice guidelines [^ede0d800] [^7f7cc4ce].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Monitor for hypotension and bradycardia during IV infusion [^fd1be9f5].
- **Hepatic function**: Monitor liver enzymes periodically due to risk of hepatotoxicity [^fd1be9f5].
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Monitor for signs of pulmonary toxicity, especially with prolonged use [^fd1be9f5].
- **Drug interactions**: Amiodarone interacts with warfarin, digoxin, and other antiarrhythmics; adjust concomitant medications as needed [^ea6a372f].

---

## Alternative antiarrhythmic medications

If amiodarone is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider alternatives such as **sotalol, dofetilide, or procainamide**, selected based on patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and arrhythmia type [^55572aac] [^70c3efd0].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Switch to IV amiodarone**: 150 mg bolus, then 1 mg/min for 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/min for 18 hours [^e93e3a92].
- **Continue or transition**: Maintain 0.5 mg/min or switch to oral therapy based on duration of IV use [^e93e3a92] [^ede0d800].
- **Monitor**: Watch for hypotension, bradycardia, hepatic and pulmonary toxicity, and drug interactions [^fd1be9f5].

---

Switching from oral to IV amiodarone in NPO patients is a **clinically sound strategy** to maintain therapeutic levels and prevent arrhythmia recurrence. The recommended IV regimen and careful monitoring ensure safe and effective therapy during the transition.

Amiodarone is licensed for the treatment of severe cardiac rhythm disorders where other treatments either cannot be used or have failed. Because of safety concerns, the summary of product characteristics (SPC) recommends that amiodarone "should be initiated and normally monitored only under hospital or specialist supervision". However, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring maintenance therapy often falls to non-specialists. Here, we discuss safety issues relating to the long-term use of oral amiodarone in adults.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Amiodarone hci [^bd037702]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Amiodarone HCl injection is indicated for initiation of treatment and prophylaxis of frequently recurring ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia in patients refractory to other therapy. Amiodarone HCl injection also can be used to treat patients with VT/VF for whom oral amiodarone is indicated, but who are unable to take oral medication. During or after treatment with amiodarone HCl injection, patients may be transferred to oral amiodarone therapy (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION).

Amiodarone HCl injection should be used for acute treatment until the patient's ventricular arrhythmias are stabilized. Most patients will require this therapy for 48 to 96 hours, but amiodarone HCl injection may be safely administered for longer periods if necessary.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^1117aa44]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

Conclusion

Patients with new-onset AF who are treated with amiodarone should receive a loading dose, immediately followed by an infusion. Clinicians should consider continuing amiodarone infusions in patients who are receiving inotropes until the inotrope is ceased. Patients who have pre-existing congestive cardiac failure or SIRS diagnosed on admission into ICU are at a greater risk of recurrence of AF. Vigilance of magnesium replacement, avoiding excessive volume depletion and the resolution of SIRS would appear a reasonable approach to limit AF recurrence, particularly as many known parameters are managed routinely within a tight range for patients in the ICU. A clear dosing guide is not available and further research is required to elicit the best dosing strategy.

### Amiodarone hci [^64d8f2f9]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving oral amiodarone therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal. Until further studies have been performed, it is recommended that FiO 2 and the determinants of oxygen delivery to the tissues (e.g. SaO 2, PaO 2) be closely monitored in patients on amiodarone.

Pulmonary Fibrosis

Only 1 of more than 1000 patients treated with amiodarone HCl injection in clinical studies developed pulmonary fibrosis. In that patient, the condition was diagnosed 3 months after treatment with amiodarone HCl injection, during which time she received oral amiodarone. Pulmonary toxicity is a well-recognized complication of long-term amiodarone use (see labeling for oral amiodarone).

Loss of Vision

Cases of optic neuropathy and/or optic neuritis, usually resulting in visual impairment, have been reported in patients treated with oral amiodarone. In some cases, visual impairment has progressed to permanent blindness. Amiodarone HCl injection is indicated for initiation of treatment and prophylaxis of frequently recurring ventricular fibrillation (VF) and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients refractory to other therapy and can also be used to treat patients with VT/VF for whom oral amiodarone is indicated, but who are unable to take oral medication. Optic neuropathy and/or neuritis may occur at any time following initiation of therapy. A causal relationship to the drug has not been clearly established. If symptoms of visual impairment appear, such as changes in visual acuity and decreases in peripheral vision, prompt ophthalmic examination is recommended. Appearance of optic neuropathy and/or neuritis calls for re-evaluation of amiodarone therapy. The risks and complications of antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone must be weighed against its benefits in patients whose lives are threatened by cardiac arrhythmias. Regular ophthalmic examination, including fundoscopy and slit-lamp examination, is recommended during administrations of amiodarone (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Amiodarone — evidence for conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation includes the following: In the SAFE‑T trial of persistent AF, conversion occurred in 27% after 28 d with amiodarone versus 24% with sotalol and 0.8% with placebo. Oral amiodarone is associated with a conversion rate between 15% and 40% over a period of 28 d. In a comparative study, amiodarone and propafenone showed similar rates (40%) in persistent AF averaging 5 mo in duration, and all amiodarone conversions occurred after 7 d, with responses between 1 and 14 d. Reported adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, visual disturbances, thyroid abnormalities, nausea, constipation, phlebitis with peripheral IV administration, and serious toxicity including death due to bradycardia ending in cardiac arrest.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended starting dosing regimen is: (2)
Initial Load: 150 mg in 100 mL infused over 10 minutes
Followed by: 1 mg/min for 6 hours
Followed by: 0.5 mg/min thereafter
For breakthrough episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, repeat the Initial Load (2)

2.1 General Considerations

Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit, solution should be clear. Visually inspect the container. If the administration port protector is damaged, detached or not present, discard the container as the solution path sterility may be compromised. Check for minute leaks prior to use by squeezing the bag firmly. If leaks are detected, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Protect from light until ready to use.

NEXTERONE Premixed Injection is available in GALAXY containers as a single-use, ready-to-use, iso-osmotic solution in dextrose for intravenous administration. No further dilution is required. Discard any unused portion after use.

Administer NEXTERONE Premixed Injection, whenever possible, through a central venous catheter dedicated to that purpose. Use an in-line filter during administration.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

NEXTERONE Premixed Injection response can vary. Monitor patient response and adjust dose accordingly. In controlled clinical trials, mean daily doses above 2100 mg were associated with an increased risk of hypotension.

Admixture Incompatibility Amiodarone in D5W Injection forms precipitates with the drugs shown in Table 2. If co-administration of the following drugs is necessary, use separate intravenous administration lines.

2.3 Transition From Intravenous Amiodarone to Oral Amiodarone

Table 3 provides suggested doses of oral amiodarone to be initiated after varying durations of NEXTERONE infusion.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage must be individualized based on severity of arrhythmia and response. Use the lowest effective dose. Obtain baseline chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, thyroid function tests, and liver aminotransferases. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment

Recommended Dosage:

Initiate treatment with a loading doses of 800 to 1600 mg/day until initial therapeutic response occurs (usually 1 to 3 weeks). Once adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, reduce amiodarone hydrochloride dose to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day.

Administration:

Administer amiodarone hydrochloride tablets consistently with regard to meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Administration of amiodarone hydrochloride tablets in divided doses with meals is suggested for total daily doses of 1000 mg or higher, or when gastrointestinal intolerance occurs.

Initiate treatment with a loading doses of 800 to 1600 mg/day until initial therapeutic response occurs (usually 1 to 3 weeks). Once adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, reduce amiodarone hydrochloride dose to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

There is no well-established relationship between plasma concentration and effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed. Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low, and who might benefit from a dose increase, or unusually high, and who might have dosage reduction in the hope of minimizing side effects.

Effects on abnormal rhythms are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used. There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still. There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.

Consistent with the slow rate of elimination, antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after amiodarone hydrochloride is discontinued, but the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable. In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the arrhythmia, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted.

### Reimagining anticoagulation clinics in the era of direct oral anticoagulants [^c40b6ce8]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation clinics were initially developed to provide safe and effective care for warfarin-treated patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, and mechanical valve replacement. Traditionally, these patients required ongoing laboratory monitoring and warfarin dose adjustment by expert providers. With the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban), many have questioned the need for anticoagulation clinic. However, we think that the growing number of oral anticoagulant choices creates an urgent need for expanding the traditional role of the anticoagulation clinic. We outline 3 key purposes that a reimagined anticoagulation clinic would serve: (1) to assist patients and clinicians with selecting the most appropriate drug and dose from a growing list of anticoagulant options (including warfarin), (2) to help patients minimize the risk of serious bleeding complications with careful long-term monitoring and peri-procedural management, and (3) to encourage ongoing adherence to these life-saving medications. We also describe how repurposing anticoagulation clinics as broader medication safety clinics would promote safe and effective care across a range of cardiovascular conditions for high-risk medications (eg, spironolactone, amiodarone). Finally, we highlight a few existing health systems that are overcoming key challenges to implementing a reimagined anticoagulation or medication safety clinic structure.

### Practical regimen for amiodarone use in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation [^6302bf37]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurs in 5% to 65% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Although postoperative atrial fibrillation is often regarded as a temporary, benign, operation-related problem, it is associated with a twofold to threefold increase in risk of adverse events, including permanent or transient stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death.

Methods

This randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial included 250 eligible consecutively enrolled patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). They received 300 mg of amiodarone/placebo administered intravenously over 20 minutes on the first postoperative day and an oral dose of 600 mg of amiodarone or placebo twice daily for the first 5 postoperative days.

Results

The patients in amiodarone prophylaxis experienced a reduction in risk of atrial fibrillation of 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0% to 24%), with the number needed to treat at 6.9 (95% CI, 4.2 to 20), and the results for symptomatic atrial fibrillation showed a risk reduction of 18% (95% CI, 9.4% to 26), with the number needed to treat at 5.7 (95% CI, 3.9 to 11). Of the patients who developed atrial fibrillation in the placebo group, 84% experienced a symptomatic attack versus only 43% in the amiodarone group.

Conclusions

Postoperative prophylaxis with a high dose of oral amiodarone after an intravenous bolus infusion is a safe, practical, feasible, and effective regimen for CABG patients. It significantly diminishes the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

What should I avoid while taking amiodarone hydrochloride tablets?

Avoid drinking grapefruit juice during treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride tablets. Drinking grapefruit juice with amiodarone hydrochloride tablets may increase the amount of amiodarone hydrochloride in your blood, and this may lead to side effects.
Amiodarone hydrochloride tablets can make your skin sensitive to sunlight. You could get severe sunburn. Use sunscreen and wear a hat and clothes that cover your skin to help protect you if you must be in sunlight. Talk to your healthcare if you get a sunburn. See "Skin problems" in the Medication Guide section "What are the possible side effects of amiodarone hydrochloride tablets?" below.

What are the possible side effects of amiodarone hydrochloride tablets?

 Amiodarone hydrochloride tablets can cause serious side effects, including:

See "What is the most important information I should know about amiodarone hydrochloride tablets?"
Nerve problems. Amiodarone hydrochloride tablets can cause nerve problems. Call your healthcare provider if you develop symptoms of nerve problems, including: a feeling of "pins and needles" or numbness in your hands, legs, or feet, muscle weakness, uncontrolled movements, poor coordination, or trouble walking.
Skin problems. Amiodarone hydrochloride tablets can cause your skin to be more sensitive to the sun or turn a bluish-gray color. People who have fair skin or people who have a lot of sun exposure may be more at risk for these skin problems. Some of the bluish-gray skin color may return to normal after stopping amiodarone hydrochloride tablets.
Thyroid problems. Amiodarone hydrochloride tablets can cause you to have either decreased thyroid function (hypothyroidism), which can sometimes be severe, or an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), which can be severe.
If you develop decreased thyroid function during treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride tablets, your healthcare provider may need to reduce your dose or stop your treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride tablets, and possibly prescribe medicine to replace your thyroid hormone.
An overactive thyroid can cause you to produce too much thyroid hormone. You can have abnormal heartbeats even while you are receiving amiodarone hydrochloride tablets. Your healthcare provider may prescribe certain medicines to treat your overactive thyroid. Call your healthcare provider if you get any abnormal heart beats during treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride tablets. This may mean that you have an overactive thyroid.
Your healthcare provider should do tests to check your thyroid function before you start and during treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride tablets.
Call your healthcare provider if you develop any of the following symptoms of a thyroid problem during treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride tablets:

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia — clinical considerations for acute management note that electrical cardioversion is always indicated for hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, and monomorphic VT is usually related to a structural abnormality such as MI scarring but is mechanistically heterogeneous; some "idiopathic" VTs respond well and terminate with intravenous verapamil or adenosine, and if these unique VT entities cannot be recognized with confidence, it is prudent to assume that one is dealing with VT related to structural heart disease. Timely termination is usually desirable even if VT is well tolerated, this can be achieved with cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, or pacing techniques, and DC cardioversion even at early stage or as a "first line" is reasonable; caution needs to be exercised if the patient also has concurrent AF (e.g., double tachycardia), and if such is the case, the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation need to be followed when feasible. Initial treatment often includes the administration of intravenous antiarrhythmic medication, with advantages including the lack of necessity for anesthesia and ready availability and disadvantages including delay in termination, failure to terminate in some patients, and adverse effects including hypotension and proarrhythmia; only intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, and amiodarone are widely available and intravenous ajmaline is used frequently in some European countries. Intravenous amiodarone loading has proved useful in unstable and recurrent VT and it is also reasonable in patients in whom oral amiodarone is required after the intravenous phase; although intravenous amiodarone has an early effect on AV nodal conduction, the effects on myocardial conduction and refractoriness are gradual in onset and maximum effect may not be seen for weeks or months, so intravenous amiodarone is not ideal for early conversion of stable monomorphic VT, whereas intravenous procainamide is more appropriate when early slowing of the VT rate and termination of monomorphic VT are desired; close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular status is recommended in the presence of congestive HF or severe LV dysfunction as intravenous procainamide can cause transient hypotension, and lidocaine is effective when VT is thought to be related to myocardial ischemia.

Atrial fibrillation pharmacological cardioversion — drug selection and monitoring notes that vernakalant "allows the rapid restoration of SR in patients with AF (but not in atrial flutter)" and may be administered in mild to moderate heart failure and stable ischaemic heart disease; intravenous flecainide and propafenone are "restricted to patients without altered cardiac substrate". Ibutilide is an alternative but "is torsadogenic and should be avoided in patients with long QT", with the "QTc interval… carefully monitored during and immediately after the infusion". Intravenous amiodarone "was not shown to convert AF acutely in placebo controlled studies", but in heart failure patients it "slows significantly the heart rate in less than 12 h" and is "superior to intravenous sotalol concerning overall conversions". Selected outpatients may self-administer an oral bolus of flecainide or propafenone once safety is confirmed in-hospital; this "pill-in-the-pocket" strategy is "marginally less effective than in-hospital cardioversion or continuous AAD therapy" yet "may be preferred by eligible patients". Pre-treatment with oral antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, sotalol or ibutilide "may improve the efficacy of electrical cardioversion of AF and/or prevent early AF recurrences", and SR "may be restored (e.g., during a 3–4 weeks of pre-treatment…)".

Atrial flutter — acute treatment recommendations: COR I, LOE B-NR, acute antithrombotic therapy is recommended to align with antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF). COR IIa, LOE B-R, intravenous amiodarone can be useful for acute control of the ventricular rate in atrial flutter with systolic heart failure when beta blockers are contraindicated or ineffective and in the absence of pre-excitation; because of potential toxicity, amiodarone should not be used for long-term rate control in most patients, and potential risks and benefits should be considered for patients with atrial flutter lasting ≥ 48 hours who are not adequately anticoagulated.

### Comparison of plasma concentrations for two amiodarone products [^8b98157c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A generic formulation of amiodarone was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration based on single-dose equivalence data. Because amiodarone has complex pharmacokinetic properties, a narrow therapeutic range, and a significant adverse effect profile, concern about equivalency persists.

Objective

To compare steady-state plasma concentrations of the brand-name reference product Cordarone with the AB-rated generic formulation, Pacerone, in patients exposed to both products.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center on 138 patients who were taking a stable dose of amiodarone before and after an amiodarone generic product substitution.

Results

Seventy-seven patients had steady-state plasma concentrations documented for each product at the same dose. The mean steady-state plasma concentrations of amiodarone were not significantly different for Cordarone compared with Pacerone (1.07 ± 0.48 vs. 1.19 ± 0.66 micro g/mL, respectively); similarly, the concentrations of the active metabolite (desethylamiodarone) did not differ (0.95 ± 0.30 vs. 0.96 ± 0.49 micro g/mL, respectively). However, the variability in plasma drug concentrations between products was increased as compared to variability within each product.

Conclusions

This study indicates that comparable steady-state concentrations can be achieved with a change in formulation from Cordarone to Pacerone. However, individual responses vary, suggesting that monitoring of plasma concentrations is prudent 1–3 months after any change from one product to another.

### A comparison of two individual amiodarone regimens to placebo in open heart surgery patients [^72fba157]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This study compares the ability of two oral amiodarone regimens to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) as compared with the placebo among elderly open heart surgery (OHS) patients receiving beta blockade.

Methods

This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 220 patients undergoing OHS. Patients (average age, 73 years) received 7 g of oral amiodarone more than 10 days starting 5 days before OHS (slow load; n = 56), a 6 g oral amiodarone regimen more than 6 days starting 1 day before OHS (fast load; n = 64), or matching placebo in one of the two previously mentioned regimens (n = 100).

Results

Patients receiving the slow load amiodarone regimen had a significant reduction in the risk of AF (48.4%; p = 0.013), AF lasting more than 24 hours (76.5%; p = 0.003), symptomatic AF (90.0%; p = 0.002), and recurrent AF (64.5%; p = 0.025) as compared with the placebo. Patients receiving the fast load amiodarone regimen had significant reductions in the risk of AF lasting more than 24 hours (52.6%; p = 0.038) and symptomatic AF (65.0%; p = 0.024), but the incidence of any AF or any recurrence of AF only showed a trend toward significance (34.0% and 45.5%; p = 0.054 and 0.09, respectively).

Conclusions

Oral amiodarone in a slow loading regimen provides significant suppression of all AF factors and can be used when a patient has started it at least 5 days before OHS. If a patient has less than 5 days before OHS, the fast loading regimen is an efficacious alternative as it provides significant benefits in preventing AF from lasting more than 24 hours and for preventing symptomatic AF. Both regimens were well tolerated and safe in elderly patients receiving beta blockade according to the hospital's standard protocol.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):
- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated.

EFFECTS OF INTRAVENOUS AND

ORAL AMIODARONE ON

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC PARAMETERS

⇔No change

At higher doses (> 10 mg/kg) of amiodarone HCl injection, prolongation of the ERP RV and modest prolongation of the QRS have been seen. These differences between oral and IV administration suggest that the initial acute effects of amiodarone HCl injection may be predominantly focused on the AV node, causing an intranodal conduction delay and increased nodal refractoriness due to slow channel blockade (class IV activity) and noncompetitive adrenergic antagonism (class II activity).

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

Amiodarone exhibits complex disposition characteristics after intravenous administration. Peak serum concentrations after single 5 mg/kg 15-minute intravenous infusions in healthy subjects range between 5 and 41 mg/L. Peak concentrations after 10-minute infusions of 150 mg amiodarone HCl injection in patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) range between 7 and 26 mg/L. Due to rapid distribution, serum concentrations decline to 10% of peak values within 30 to 45 minutes after the end of the infusion. In clinical trials, after 48 hours of continued infusions (125, 500 or 1000 mg/day) plus supplemental (150 mg) infusions (for recurrent arrhythmias), amiodarone mean serum concentrations between 0.7 to 1.4 mg/L were observed (n = 260).

ICD and Amiodarone Use

Patients assigned to the ICD group had the device implanted as soon as possible after randomization. For patients in this group, the study encouraged the local clinician investigator to (1) choose, preferentially, a single-chamber device; (2) program the ICD to back up pacing in a ventricular-inhibited mode at a rate of 40 beats/min, to detect VF at 180 beats/min, and to provide shock with maximum energy; (3) activate the antitachycardia pacing to deliver 8-beat bursts that begin at 81% of the tachycardia cycle duration for those cycles below the VF threshold and repeating this strategy if necessary; and (4) avoid the use of amiodarone, except in cases of multiple ICD shocks and electrical storm, in those with CCC refractory to β-blockers (including sotalol hydrochloride), catheter ablation, or both.

Patients assigned to the amiodarone group received amiodarone once a day. For this, the study encouraged the local clinical investigator to (1) initiate an oral loading dose of 600 mg/d for 10 days on an outpatient basis; (2) continue amiodarone use with an oral maintenance single dose of 200 to 400 mg/d until the end of the study; (3) consider the optimum maintenance dose for each patient (investigator discretion) based on antiarrhythmic efficacy on 24-hour Holter monitor, resting heart rate, adverse effects, and an excessively prolonged corrected QT interval; (4) adjust doses during follow-up, aiming at a maintenance dose of 200 to 400 mg/d; (5) recommend pacemaker implantation in cases of severe bradyarrhythmia for supporting appropriate amiodarone use; and (6) indicate an ICD should any episode of sustained VT or VF occur during follow-up.

Although treatment crossover in either direction was strongly discouraged, it was permitted when it was clearly in the patient's best interest. Concerning concomitant medical therapy, for both groups, local clinician investigators were encouraged to (1) optimize the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor blockers), spironolactone, diuretics, and oral anticoagulants (when appropriate); and (2) not introduce any other antiarrhythmic drugs, except sotalol.

Amiodarone HCl injection should be administered only by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias, who are thoroughly familiar with the risks and benefits of amiodarone therapy, and who have access to facilities adequate for monitoring the effectiveness and side effects of treatment.

Thyroid Abnormalities

Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T 4) to triiodothyronine (T 3) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T 3 levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T 3 (rT 3) in clinically euthyroid patients. It is also a potential source of large amounts of inorganic iodine. Because of its release of inorganic iodine, or perhaps for other reasons, amiodarone can cause either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function should be monitored prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction. Because of the slow elimination of amiodarone and its metabolites, high plasma iodide levels, altered thyroid function, and abnormal thyroid-function tests may persist for several weeks or even months following amiodarone withdrawal.

Hypothyroidism has been reported in 2 to 4% of patients in most series, but in 8 to 10% in some series. This condition may be identified by relevant clinical symptoms and particularly by elevated serum TSH levels. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Hypothyroidism is best managed by amiodarone dose reduction and/or thyroid hormone supplement. However, therapy must be individualized, and it may be necessary to discontinue amiodarone tablets in some patients.

### Amiodarone hci [^54dbad9a]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

There is no established relationship between drug concentration and therapeutic response for short-term intravenous use. Steady-state amiodarone concentrations of 1 to 2.5 mg/L have been associated with antiarrhythmic effects and acceptable toxicity following chronic oral amiodarone therapy.

Pharmacodynamics

Amiodarone HCl injection has been reported to produce negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects in animals and humans. In clinical studies of patients with refractory VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, treatment-emergent, drug related hypotension occurred in 288 of 1836 patients (16%) treated with amiodarone HCl injection. No correlations were seen between the baseline ejection fraction and the occurrence of clinically significant hypotension during infusion of amiodarone HCl injection.

Clinical Trials

Apart from studies in patients with VT or VF, described below, there are two other studies of amiodarone showing an antiarrhythmic effect before significant levels of DEA could have accumulated. A placebo-controlled study of IV amiodarone (300 mg over 2 hours followed by 1200 mg/day) in post-coronary artery bypass graft patients with supraventricular and 2- to 3-consecutive-beat ventricular arrhythmias showed a reduction in arrhythmias from 12 hours on. A baseline-controlled study using a similar IV regimen in patients with recurrent, refractory VT/VF also showed rapid onset of antiarrhythmic activity; amiodarone therapy reduced episodes of VT by 85% compared to baseline.

Administration of amiodarone is a reasonable option for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). A single oral bolus dose of propafenone or flecainide (pill-in-the-pocket) can be administered to terminate persistent AF outside the hospital once treatment has proved safe in hospital for selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, and before antiarrhythmic medication is initiated, a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist should be given to prevent rapid AV conduction in the event atrial flutter occurs (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of amiodarone can be beneficial on an outpatient basis in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF when rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is not deemed necessary (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of quinidine or procainamide might be considered for pharmacological cardioversion of AF, but the usefulness of these agents is not well established (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin and sotalol may be harmful when used for pharmacological cardioversion of AF and are not recommended (Level of Evidence: A).

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Amiodarone shows considerable interindividual variation in response. Thus, although a starting dose adequate to suppress life-threatening arrhythmias is needed, close monitoring with adjustment of dose as needed is essential. The recommended starting dose of amiodarone HCl injection is about 1000 mg over the first 24 hours of therapy, delivered by the following infusion regimen:

After the first 24 hours, the maintenance infusion rate of 0.5 mg/min (720 mg/24 hours) should be continued utilizing a concentration of 1 to 6 mg/mL (Amiodarone HCl Injection concentrations greater than 2 mg/mL should be administered via a central venous catheter). In the event of breakthrough episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, 150 mg supplemental infusions of amiodarone HCl injection mixed in 100 mL of D 5W may be administered. Such infusions should be administered over 10 minutes to minimize the potential for hypotension. The rate of the maintenance infusion may be increased to achieve effective arrhythmia suppression.

The first 24-hour dose may be individualized for each patient; however, in controlled clinical trials, mean daily doses above 2100 mg were associated with an increased risk of hypotension. The initial infusion rate should not exceed 30 mg/min.

Based on the experience from clinical studies of amiodarone HCl injection, a maintenance infusion of up to 0.5 mg/min can be cautiously continued for 2 to 3 weeks regardless of the patient's age, renal function, or left ventricular function. There has been limited experience in patients receiving amiodarone HCl injection for longer than 3 weeks.

Adverse effects are uncommon but include rapid atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, intraventricular conduction disturbances, hypotension, and bradycardia on conversion. Available data on propafenone loading in organic heart disease are scant; this agent should be used cautiously or not at all for conversion of AF in such cases and should be avoided in patients with HF or severe obstructive lung disease.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring… [^ede0d800]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Because of the complexity and widespread use of this agent, other treatment decisions often are affected. This article reviews the pharmacology, indications, adverse effects, and drug interactions of amiodarone, and outlines a strategy for surveillance of patients who are taking this drug. Indications LONG-TERM TREATMENT Amiodarone is approved for use in the secondary prevention of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The North American Society for Pacing and Electrophysiology recommends amiodarone as the antiarrhythmic agent of choice in patients who have survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. Because implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are more effective than amiodarone in reducing mortality in high-risk patients with previous myocardial infarction, primary treatment should be an ICD.

6–9 In these patients, amiodarone may be used as an adjunct to reduce the frequency of ICD shocks or to control atrial fibrillation in selected highly symptomatic patients. The relative efficacy of amiodarone and ICDs in preventing sudden death in patients without coronary disease is under investigation. 16 However, these guidelines list amiodarone as being only "possibly effective" for the treatment of refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. In contrast, a recent study comparing the use of amiodarone and lidocaine in patients with shock-resistant, out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation showed that amiodarone therapy substantially improves survival and hospital admission rates.

Patients who received intravenous amiodarone for less than one week should take 800 to 1, 600 mg oral amiodarone per day. 2 Patients who received intravenous amiodarone for one to three weeks should take 600 to 800 oral amiodarone per day, and patients who received intravenous amiodarone for more than three weeks should take 400 mg oral amiodarone per day. The primary treatment for pulmonary toxicity is withdrawal of amiodarone and provision of supportive care and, in some cases, corticosteroids. In most instances, the toxicity is reversible.

### Comparison of effectiveness of ranolazine plus amiodarone versus amiodarone alone for conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation [^fac5629c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Ranolazine, an antianginal agent with antiarrhythmic properties, prevents atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with acute coronary syndrome. In experimental models, the combination of ranolazine and amiodarone has marked synergistic effects that potently suppress AF. Currently, the clinical effect of the ranolazine-amiodarone combination for the conversion of AF is unknown. This prospective randomized pilot study compared the safety and efficacy of ranolazine plus amiodarone versus amiodarone alone for the conversion of recent-onset AF. We enrolled 51 consecutive patients with AF (< 48-hour duration) eligible for pharmacologic cardioversion. Patients (33 men, 63 ± 8 years of age) were randomized to intravenous amiodarone for 24 hours (group A, n = 26) or to intravenous amiodarone plus oral ranolazine 1,500 mg at time of randomization (group A + R, n = 25). The 2 groups were well balanced with respect to clinical characteristics and left atrial diameter. Conversion within 24 hours (primary end point) was achieved in 22 patients (88%) in group A + R versus 17 patients (65%) in group A (p = 0.056). Time to conversion was shorter in group A + R than in group A (9.8 ± 4.1 vs 14.6 ± 5.3 hours, p = 0.002). According to Cox regression analysis, left atrial diameter and A + R treatment were the only independent predictors of time to conversion (hazard ratio 5.35, 95% confidence interval 2.37 to 12.11, p < 0.001; hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.88, p < 0.001, respectively). There were no proarrhythmic events in either group. In conclusion, addition of ranolazine to standard amiodarone therapy is equally safe and appears to be more effective compared to amiodarone alone for conversion of recent-onset AF.

### Single-day loading dose of oral amiodarone for the prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery [^ee987db1]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Various regimens have been proposed for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation, including the use of intravenous and oral amiodarone. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a single-day loading dose of oral amiodarone in prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation during the 7 days after coronary artery bypass surgery.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study encompassing 315 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. They received either amiodarone (159 patients) or placebo (156 patients). Therapy consisted of a single oral loading dose of 1200 mg of amiodarone 1 day before surgery, followed by the maintenance dose of 200 mg daily during the next 7 days. Only episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting more than 1 hour or associated with hemodynamic compromise were taken into consideration.

Results

Overall, the incidence of atrial fibrillation was similar in patients who received amiodarone (31/159, 19.5%) and placebo (33/156, 21.2%) (P = 0.78). However, amiodarone reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years): it occurred in 20 of 75 (26.7%) patients on amiodarone and in 28 of 65 (43.1%) patients in the placebo group (P = 0.05). There were no differences between the study groups regarding the postoperative intrahospital morbidity and mortality and the duration of hospital stay.

Conclusions

A single-day loading dose of oral amiodarone (1200 mg) does not prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation in a general population of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. However, it appears that this regimen reduces the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in elderly patients.

### Giving IV and oral amiodarone perioperatively for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery: the GAP study [^a0f308b9]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Purposes

We studied the use of perioperative IV and oral administration of amiodarone for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

Background

In the United States, > 500,000 patients undergo CABG each year. Numerous studies to date have suggested that postoperative atrial fibrillation occurs in 30 to 50% of patients, leading to significant morbidity, including hypotension, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, prolonged hospital stay, and increased hospital costs. The objective of this study was to assess the use of IV amiodarone in combination with oral amiodarone to reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Method

From January 1999 to October 1999, 51 patients scheduled for CABG were randomly selected for participation in the amiodarone administration trial. IV amiodarone, 0.73 mg/min, was administered on call to the operating room for 48 h, followed by oral amiodarone, 400 mg q12h, for the next 3 days. The amiodarone group was case-control matched to the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in 92 patients undergoing CABG using conventional medical therapy during the same period. The primary end point of this study was the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, length of hospital stay, and hospital costs, compared to the control group undergoing CABG during the same time.

Results

Atrial fibrillation occurred in 3 of 51 patients (5.88%) in the amiodarone group, compared to 24 of 92 patients (26.08%) in the control group. Length of hospital stay in the amiodarone group was less than in the control group (5.3 days vs 6.7 days), with a trend toward decrease in hospital costs.

Conclusion

The administration of IV amiodarone in conjunction with oral amiodarone for a total dose of 4,500 mg over 5 days appears to be a hemodynamically well-tolerated, safe, and effective treatment in decreasing the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, shortening length of stay, and a trend toward lowering hospital costs, even in patients with significantly reduced left ventricular function (< 30%). A large multicenter study using IV and oral amiodarone should be pursued prior to deciding whether its use should become standard therapy in all patients undergoing CABG in order to decrease the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^70c3efd0]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation — recommendations and agents — is outlined as follows: For patients with AF, pharmacological cardioversion is reasonable as an alternative to electrical cardioversion for those who are hemodynamically stable or in situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred but cannot be performed (COR 2a, LOE C‑LD). For patients with AF, ibutilide is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion for patients without depressed LV function (LVEF < 40%) (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with AF, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion, although time to conversion is generally longer than with other agents (8–12 hours) (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with recurrent AF occurring outside the hospital, the "pill‑in‑the‑pocket" approach with a single oral dose of flecainide† or propafenone,‡ with a concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking agent,† is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion if previously tested in a monitored setting (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with AF, use of intravenous procainamide may be considered for pharmacological cardioversion when other intravenous agents are contraindicated or not preferred (COR 2b, LOE B‑R). Ibutilide works rapidly for pharmacological cardioversion of AF but is associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, particularly in patients with HFrEF.

Desethylamiodarone clearance and volume involve an unknown biotransformation factor.

The systemic availability of oral amiodarone in healthy subjects ranges between 33% and 65%. From in vitro studies, the protein binding of amiodarone is > 96%.

In clinical studies of 2 to 7 days, clearance of amiodarone after intravenous administration in patients with VT and VF ranged between 220 and 440 mL/h/kg. Age, sex, renal disease, and hepatic disease (cirrhosis) do not have marked effects on the disposition of amiodarone or DEA. Renal impairment does not influence the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone. After a single dose of amiodarone HCl injection in cirrhotic patients, significantly lower C max and average concentration values are seen for DEA, but mean amiodarone levels are unchanged. Normal subjects over 65 years of age show lower clearances (about 100 mL/h/kg) than younger subjects (about 150 mL/h/kg) and an increase in t½ from about 20 to 47 days. In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone are not significantly altered but the terminal disposition t½ of DEA is prolonged. Although no dosage adjustment for patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiac abnormalities has been defined during chronic treatment with oral amiodarone, close clinical monitoring is prudent for elderly patients and those with severe left ventricular dysfunction.

### Amiodarone versus other pharmacological interventions for prevention of sudden cardiac death [^bc85935b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of cardiac death. There are two main strategies to prevent it: managing cardiovascular risk factors and reducing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) constitute the standard therapy for both primary and secondary prevention; however, they are not widely available in settings with limited resources. The antiarrhythmic amiodarone has been proposed as an alternative to ICD.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of amiodarone for primary or secondary prevention in SCD compared with placebo or no intervention or any other antiarrhythmic drugs in participants at high risk (primary prevention) or who have recovered from a cardiac arrest or a syncope due to Ventricular Tachycardia/Ventricular Fibrillation, or VT/VF (secondary prevention).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO) and LILACS on 26 March 2015. We reviewed reference lists of included studies and selected reviews on the topic, contacted authors of included studies, screened relevant meetings and searched in registers for ongoing trials. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the efficacy of amiodarone versus placebo, no intervention, or other antiarrhythmics in adults. For primary prevention we considered participants at high risk for SCD. For secondary prevention we considered participants recovered from cardiac arrest or syncope due to ventricular arrhythmias.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. We contacted trial authors for missing data. We performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Three studies included more than one comparison.

Main Results

We included 24 studies (9,997 participants). Seventeen studies evaluated amiodarone for primary prevention and six for secondary prevention. Only three studies used an ICD concomitantly with amiodarone for the comparison (all of them for secondary prevention). For primary prevention, amiodarone compared to placebo or no intervention (17 studies, 8383 participants) reduced SCD (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), cardiac mortality (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00). The quality of the evidence was low. Compared to other antiarrhythmics (three studies, 540 participants), amiodarone reduced SCD (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00), cardiac mortality (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.86) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76). The quality of the evidence was moderate. For secondary prevention, amiodarone compared to placebo or no intervention (two studies, 440 participants) appeared to increase the risk of SCD (RR 4.32; 95% CI 0.87 to 21.49) and all-cause mortality (RR 3.05; 1.33 to 7.01). However, the quality of the evidence was very low. Compared to other antiarrhythmics (four studies, 839 participants) amiodarone appeared to increase the risk of SCD (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.56 to 3.52; very low quality of evidence), but there was no effect in all-cause mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.42; low quality evidence). Amiodarone was associated with an increase in pulmonary and thyroid adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low to moderate quality evidence that amiodarone reduces SCD, cardiac and all-cause mortality when compared to placebo or no intervention for primary prevention, and its effects are superior to other antiarrhythmics. It is uncertain if amiodarone reduces or increases SCD and mortality for secondary prevention because the quality of the evidence was very low.

Agents with proven efficacy to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) — evidence summary and amiodarone: Thirty-six controlled trials evaluating 7 antiarrhythmic drugs for maintenance were identified, including 14 trials in paroxysmal AF and 22 trials in persistent AF. Available evidence suggests that amiodarone is more effective than either class I drugs, sotalol, or placebo for long-term maintenance in patients refractory to other drugs, but it is associated with a relatively high incidence of potentially severe extracardiac toxic effects, making it a second-line or last-resort agent in many cases. The use of low-dose amiodarone (200 mg daily or less) may be effective and associated with fewer side effects. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and/or previous myocardial infarction (MI), amiodarone is associated with a low risk of proarrhythmia, making it an appropriate initial choice to prevent recurrent AF in these situations, and it provides the added benefit of effective rate control, frequently eliminating the need for other drugs to control the ventricular rate. In the CTAF trial context, a majority of the 403 patients had first-time paroxysmal (46%) or persistent (54%) AF of less than 6-month duration.

### Chapter 5: guideline recommendations: which AAD and for whom? [^aa923bdd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This chapter discusses the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/ Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for atrial fibrillation (AF) management with particular focus on antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) selection and the identification of individuals for whom AAD treatment is appropriate. Discussion includes AAD indications, when to start an AAD, choosing among AADs, how to minimize proarrhythmic risk, how to determine efficacy, and the use of adjuvant interventions. The indications for all AADs are based on safety; the current AHA/ACC/HRS and ESC guidelines state that the choice of AAD is based on the presence or absence of structural heart disease (SHD), coronary artery disease, or heart failure (HF), with further recommendations in the ESC guidelines based on HF type (e.g. HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF] versus HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). The chapter closes with a discussion of the lack of consistent use of guideline-directed care, with a review of supportive data from the recently reported AIM-AF survey-a multinational survey on AF management that involved both cardiologists and electrophysiologists. In AIM-AF, inappropriate drug selection in terms of suitable candidate selection and drug choice occurred with all types of drugs and in most patient groups. Most notable was the overuse of amiodarone in patients without SHD, and the widespread use of sotalol, including its use in patients with HFrEF. Chapter 5 is summarized as follows.

### Antiarrhythmic drug therapy for atrial fibrillation: are the guidelines guiding clinical practice? [^5d4def6f]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The AFFIRM study showed no clear survival advantage for a rhythm versus rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is appropriate in a large number of patients with AF. The American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology AF management guidelines include a safety-based algorithm for selection of AAD therapy. Class 1C agents are recommended as first-line therapy in patients without or with minimal structural heart disease. However, market research and clinical study data indicate a growing use of class III agents (mainly amiodarone) despite long-term safety and tolerability concerns, suggesting that clinical practice does not adhere to current guidelines.

Atrial flutter (acute treatment) — management is stratified by hemodynamic stability: under the "Hemodynamically stable" pathway, rhythm control includes "Synchronized cardioversion; oral dofetilide, IV ibutilide, and/or rapid atrial pacing† (Class I)", and rate control lists "IV beta blockers, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (Class I)", with "IV amiodarone (Class IIa)" also shown; when "Hemodynamically stable" is "No", rhythm control is "Synchronized cardioversion (Class I)" and rate control again lists "IV amiodarone (Class IIa)". Anticoagulation is mandatory and "for rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, synchronized cardioversion or rapid atrial pacing is not appropriate".

### Amiodarone – avoid the danger of torsade de pointes [^7095a4ef]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

We present two patients who had life-threatening arrhythmias, which are highly likely to be secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, occasionally its use can transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions and contra-indications of amiodarone as well as the need for vigilance following initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.

Atrial fibrillation — treatment algorithm for pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm lists options by left ventricular (LV) function and setting. In patients with normal LV function, IV amiodarone or ibutilide (2a) are listed, and procainamide may be considered when amiodarone and ibutilide are not optimal; recommend avoidance of IV procainamide after amiodarone or ibutilide. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 40%), IV amiodarone (2a) is listed. For AF occurring outside the hospital in patients with normal LV function ("pill‑in‑the‑pocket"), flecainide or propafenone (2a) are listed. Use is "in the absence of preexcitation", the first dose is administered in a monitored facility, and IV amiodarone requires several hours for efficacy whereas ibutilide is generally effective in 30 to 90 min but carries higher risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.

13.3.2 Pharmacological therapy — elderly management for ventricular arrhythmias and prevention of SCD: Drug therapy should be initiated at lower than the usual dose and titration should take place at longer intervals and smaller doses. Amiodarone is the only antiarrhythmic drug shown to improve prognosis in survivors of cardiac arrest, based on a meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials. Beta blockers have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality and SCD after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in all age groups, with the greatest benefit in those aged 60 to 69 y, and subgroup analyses showed equivalent benefit in younger and older patients. The combination of beta blockers and amiodarone may reduce all-cause mortality and SCD to a greater extent than amiodarone alone. Underuse is documented: after myocardial infarction in patients greater than age 65 y, only 21% of 3737 without contraindications received beta blockers, and treatment was associated with a 43% lower 2-y mortality versus no treatment.

Atrial fibrillation — sotalol risk and role of amiodarone and dofetilide: A Cochrane meta-analysis found sotalol to be associated with increased all-cause mortality (RR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.03–4.81]). Low-dose amiodarone is described as more effective than sotalol and Class IC agents for maintenance of sinus rhythm but "is best reserved" for patients in whom other antiarrhythmics are ineffective, not preferred, or contraindicated. For patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), amiodarone and dofetilide are presented as options for maintenance of sinus rhythm, as they are effective while most other drugs are contraindicated.

### Amiodarone in the new AHA guidelines for ventricular tachyarrhythmias [^aa1d63d1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To delineate amiodarone's role in the new American Heart Association guidelines for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, review the literature that supports the use of amiodarone in ventricular tachyarrhythmias, describe the pharmaceutical properties of amiodarone and elucidate their clinical implications, and discuss the dosing, preparation, and administration of amiodarone.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-October 2000) database and EMBASE Drugs and Pharmacology database (1980-October 2000) was performed. References from published articles and tertiary references were used to gather additional data.

Data Extraction

All articles were screened, and pertinent studies were identified and evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Recent trials have demonstrated amiodarone's usefulness in the setting of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Based on these investigations and contrary to past guidelines, amiodarone is included in the 2000 advanced cardiovascular life support guidelines as a possible agent for hemodynamically stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), non-QT prolonged polymorphic VT, and ventricular fibrillation (VF)/pulseless VT. Although not specifically evaluated in the setting of hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT and non-QT prolonged polymorphic VT, investigations by the intravenous Amiodarone Multicenter Trial Group and other clinical trials make amiodarone an acceptable choice for these arrythmia categories. The results of the ARREST (Resuscitation of Refractory Sustained Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias) trial prove amiodarone to be the antiarrhythmic of choice for VF/pulseless VT.

Conclusions

Amiodarone is classified as a IIb therapeutic intervention for all three arrhythmia categories, which makes it an acceptable, safe, and useful agent with fair to good evidence to support its use. In addition, amiodarone requires careful preparation and delivery to achieve safe and effective outcomes.
