## Question

How would you counsel a patient about the benefits and risks of choosing neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy based on NeoADAURA?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel a patient about the benefits and risks of choosing neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy based on NeoADAURA. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and the strength of evidence. Then, I should verify the magnitude and clinical relevance of the primary and secondary endpoints. Next, I will examine safety and surgical feasibility. After that, I need to compare this strategy with the current standard of care and highlight uncertainties. Finally, I will translate this into a balanced, patient-centered discussion and a practical recommendation, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the source before stating them.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and evidence hierarchy. NeoADAURA is a phase 3, randomized, controlled trial in patients with resectable, EGFR-mutant stage II–IIIB NSCLC, comparing neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy versus osimertinib monotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, with major pathologic response as the primary endpoint and event-free survival as a key secondary endpoint; importantly, adjuvant osimertinib was offered to essentially all patients after surgery, which complicates interpretation of long-term outcomes, so I need to keep that in mind as I proceed [^bff56c7c] [^8e34b6a5].

> Now, I should verify the magnitude of benefit on the primary endpoint. Osimertinib plus chemotherapy achieved a 26% MPR versus 2% with chemotherapy alone, an absolute difference of 24% and an odds ratio around 19.8, which is statistically significant and clinically striking; osimertinib monotherapy achieved 25% MPR, so the incremental benefit of adding chemotherapy to osimertinib for MPR appears modest in this short preoperative window, and I should emphasize that MPR is a surrogate and not guaranteed to translate into survival benefit [^bff56c7c] [^8e34b6a5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about survival. I need to check the EFS signal. At 12 months, EFS was 93% with osimertinib plus chemotherapy, 95% with osimertinib alone, and 83% with chemotherapy alone; however, with only 15% maturity, these EFS data are immature and cannot yet establish a definitive survival advantage, so I should clearly communicate this uncertainty to the patient [^bff56c7c] [^8e34b6a5].

> Next, I should review safety and surgical feasibility. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were 36% with the combination, 13% with osimertinib monotherapy, and 33% with chemotherapy alone; importantly, there were no new safety signals and no excess of surgical delays or ineligibility attributable to osimertinib, which reassures me about operability, though I should still counsel on chemotherapy-related toxicities like cytopenias and fatigue that could theoretically impact timing or recovery [^bff56c7c] [^8e34b6a5].

> I will now examine how this fits with the current standard of care. Adjuvant osimertinib for 3 years after surgery is already a category 1 recommendation for completely resected stage IB–IIIA EGFR-mutant NSCLC based on ADAURA, which showed a robust DFS benefit and later demonstrated improved overall survival; thus, the practical question is whether adding neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy improves outcomes over surgery followed by adjuvant osimertinib, and that remains unanswered until mature EFS and OS data emerge [^334fb64c] [^8f91187c] [^74b75329].

> Wait, let me verify the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in this population. ADAURA allowed adjuvant chemotherapy and still showed benefit with osimertinib regardless of whether chemotherapy was given, and contemporary guidelines endorse adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy for stage II–IIIA disease when feasible, followed by osimertinib; this means that choosing neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy is not replacing a proven adjuvant strategy, but rather repositioning systemic therapy earlier, with the trade-off of exposing patients to chemotherapy preoperatively and relying on MPR as an early signal of activity [^6f54f56c] [^e43e6151] [^334fb64c].

> Let me consider the potential advantages and disadvantages of the neoadjuvant approach. Potential benefits include earlier treatment of micrometastatic disease, tumor downsizing that may facilitate lung-sparing surgery, and pathologic response assessment that could inform prognosis; potential risks include progression during the neoadjuvant window that could render disease unresectable, chemotherapy toxicity that could delay surgery, and the possibility that adding chemotherapy in this short preoperative period may not meaningfully improve long-term outcomes beyond adjuvant osimertinib alone, which I should explicitly discuss with the patient [^bff56c7c] [^8e34b6a5] [^7b13efce].

> But wait, what if the patient is being considered for immunotherapy-based perioperative regimens. I should confirm that patients with EGFR mutations generally derive limited benefit from neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and that guidelines discourage ICI use in this molecular subtype in the perioperative setting, reinforcing that osimertinib-based strategies are preferred when EGFR mutations are present [^5c03c24d] [^f224a5dc].

> I should double-check practical counseling points. I would explain that both osimertinib monotherapy and osimertinib plus chemotherapy dramatically increased MPR compared with chemotherapy alone, yet the incremental MPR benefit of adding chemotherapy was small, EFS is immature, and the current standard remains surgery followed by adjuvant osimertinib with or without adjuvant chemotherapy based on stage and fitness; participation in NeoADAURA or similar trials is reasonable for patients who prioritize early systemic therapy and accept uncertainty, while close multidisciplinary coordination is essential to avoid delays to surgery [^bff56c7c] [^8e34b6a5] [^334fb64c].

> In summary, I need to ensure the patient understands that neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy achieves a high MPR and appears safe perioperatively, but it has not yet proven superiority to the established adjuvant osimertinib paradigm for survival; therefore, outside a clinical trial, standard adjuvant osimertinib with or without adjuvant chemotherapy remains appropriate, and enrollment in trials exploring neoadjuvant targeted therapy is a valid option for those seeking cutting-edge care and contributing to evidence generation [^bff56c7c] [^8e34b6a5] [^334fb64c].

Neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy significantly improves **major pathologic response** (MPR) versus chemotherapy alone in resectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC (26% vs 2%; odds ratio 19.82) [^bff56c7c] and increases **N2 downstaging** (53% vs 21%), suggesting better surgical outcomes [^126d8ce0]. Early event-free survival (EFS) looks favorable (12-month EFS 93% vs 83%), but **OS data are immature** and not yet available [^8e34b6a5]. The regimen is **generally well tolerated**, with no new safety signals and no significant increase in grade ≥ 3 or serious adverse events versus chemotherapy alone; however, chemotherapy-related toxicities (myelosuppression, fatigue, nausea) are more frequent with the combination [^bff56c7c] [^126d8ce0]. This approach is not yet standard of care; patients should be counseled on the promising pathologic benefits, uncertain survival impact, and the need to balance added toxicity against potential gains, ideally within a clinical trial or at experienced centers [^8e34b6a5] [^7b13efce].

---

## Clinical benefits

### Major pathologic response (MPR)

- **MPR rate**: 26% with osimertinib plus chemotherapy vs 2% with chemotherapy alone (absolute difference 24%; odds ratio 19.82; 95% CI 4.60–85.33; P < 0.0001) [^bff56c7c].
- **Clinical significance**: MPR correlates with improved long-term outcomes in NSCLC, though it is a surrogate endpoint and not definitive for survival [^4b52e327].

---

### Nodal downstaging

N2 downstaging occurred in **53% with osimertinib plus chemotherapy vs 21% with chemotherapy alone** (odds ratio 4.77; 95% CI 1.62–14.00), indicating improved resectability and potential for less extensive surgery [^126d8ce0].

---

### Event-free survival (EFS)

At 12 months, EFS was **93% with osimertinib plus chemotherapy vs 83% with chemotherapy alone** (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.23–1.14), suggesting early benefit, though data are immature and not statistically significant [^bff56c7c] [^8e34b6a5].

---

## Safety profile

- **Grade ≥ 3 adverse events**: 36% with osimertinib plus chemotherapy vs 33% with chemotherapy alone; no new safety signals identified [^bff56c7c].
- **Serious adverse events**: Similar rates between arms; no significant increase with the combination [^bff56c7c].
- **Chemotherapy-related toxicities**: Higher incidence of myelosuppression, fatigue, and nausea with the combination, as expected [^4666c11d].

---

## Limitations and uncertainties

- **Overall survival (OS)**: OS data are immature and not yet available; MPR and EFS improvements may not translate into survival benefit [^8e34b6a5].
- **Standard of care**: Adjuvant osimertinib is the current standard after surgery; neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy is investigational and not guideline-endorsed [^334fb64c] [^8f91187c].
- **Patient selection**: Optimal duration of neoadjuvant therapy and which patients benefit most remain unclear [^37af27c5].

---

## Clinical implications and counseling points

- **Potential benefits**: Improved pathologic response and nodal downstaging may enhance resectability and long-term outcomes, though survival benefit is unproven [^bff56c7c] [^126d8ce0].
- **Risks**: Added chemotherapy toxicity and uncertain survival benefit require careful patient selection and shared decision-making [^4666c11d] [^8e34b6a5].
- **Clinical trial participation**: Patients should be encouraged to participate in trials to advance evidence and access emerging therapies [^notfound].

---

Neoadjuvant osimertinib plus chemotherapy yields **substantial improvements in MPR and nodal downstaging** with acceptable toxicity, but **OS benefit remains unproven**. Counsel patients on these pathologic gains, the added chemotherapy-related adverse effects, and the current lack of guideline endorsement, ideally within clinical trials or experienced centers.

In the phase 3 NeoADAURA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04351555), patients with resectable stage II–IIIB NSCLC harboring classical EGFR mutations were randomly assigned either to neoadjuvant osimertinib with or without chemotherapy or to chemotherapy alone. Of note, adjuvant use of osimertinib was offered to all trial participants and was received by greater than 80% of the patients in each arm. The primary outcomes of MPR was significantly improved with osimertinib monotherapy (MPR, 25%; 95% CI, 17%–34%) and osimertinib chemotherapy (MPR, 26%; 95% CI, 18%–34%) versus chemotherapy alone (MPR, 2%; 95% CI, < 1% to 6%). The pathologic complete response rate was less than 10% in both osimertinib groups. The selection of MPR as the primary end point in this trial is a subject of debate, given the uncertainty surrounding its validity as a surrogate for OS and long‐term disease control in the context of targeted therapies. Event‐free survival (EFS) also trended in favor of the osimertinib arms in the NeoADAURA trial; however, the data are still relatively immature to date (15% maturity). Until full maturation of EFS and OS data, the benefit of adding neoadjuvant osimertinib compared with the current standard of care of surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and osimertinib remains uncertain.

The study NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) was published by Jianxing He and colleagues in 2025 in the journal J Clin Oncol. This study is related to the following diseases: Non-small cell lung cancer. In the NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of neoadjuvant osimertinib in patients with resectable, EGFR-mutated, stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer? In the NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) study, the population was: 237 patients (166 female, 71 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with resectable, EGFR-mutated, stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. The key exclusion criteria were past medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis requiring steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD; preoperative radiotherapy treatment as part of their care plan; mixed small cell and non-small cell lung cancer histology; stage I, IIIB N3, IIIC, IVA, or IVB non-small cell lung cancer. In the NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) study, the interventions were: n = 117 osimertinib monotherapy (neoadjuvant osimertinib 80 mg PO once daily for ≥ 9 weeks) n = 120 placebo plus chemotherapy (matching placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 3 cycles). In the NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in major pathological response (25% vs. 2%; AD 23%, 95% CI 15 to 32). In the NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in proportion of N2 disease down-staged at surgery (53% vs. 21%; OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.44 to 12.14). In the NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in grade ≥ 3 and serious adverse events. In the NeoADAURA (osimertinib vs. chemotherapy) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with resectable, EGFR-mutated, stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer, osimertinib monotherapy was superior to placebo plus chemotherapy with respect to major pathological response.

### Modeling the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant osimertinib for patients with resected EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer [^a8c76e0d]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our model demonstrates that there is significant cost associated with the use of 3 years of adjuvant osimertinib, with the majority due to associated drug cost, limiting the CE of this strategy. However, a hypothetical OS benefit of osimertinib of 25%-30% over placebo would improve the ICER to meet a prespecified CE threshold of $195 000. Additional studies of osimertinib after concurrent chemoradiation in those with locally advanced unresectable disease (LAURA trial, NCT03521154) will also provide further insight and a study of neoadjuvant osimertinib (Neo-ADAURA trial, NCT04351555) may limit the need for adjuvant treatment and reduce the risk of overtreating. Ultimately, mature OS data from ADAURA are needed for true CE measure, and additional considerations involving the financial burden to the patient and the utility in delaying recurrence will need to be further elucidated.

### Adjuvant osimertinib for resected EGFR-mutated stage IB-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer: updated results from the phase III randomized ADAURA trial [^eb2bec00]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous trials of adjuvant first-generation EGFR-TKIs have reported CNS efficacy results. The ADJUVANT/CTONG1104 trial reported a reduced risk of extracranial metastases with gefitinib, although a high incidence of CNS metastases was observed among all treated patients (adjuvant gefitinib 29/106 [27%]; adjuvant chemotherapy, 21/87 [24%]). Higher rates of CNS metastases over comparator were also seen among patients who experienced recurrence in the IMPACTand RADIANT trials. Although these trials differ with respect to patient population and follow-up time, these results in the adjuvant setting are consistent with findings that first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs have less CNS efficacy compared with osimertinib in advanced NSCLC. These updated ADAURA data demonstrate osimertinib to be a compelling therapeutic option to reduce the risk of developing CNS metastases in resected EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

The safety profile observed for this extended treatment duration was consistent with the primary analysis. No new safety concerns were reported.

These updated data highlight the importance of routine EGFR testing at diagnosis to ensure that patients have the opportunity for optimal treatment. Future data of interest from ADAURA include long-term safety, subsequent treatment patterns, and overall survival. Tumor and circulating tumor DNA molecular profiling for analyses of minimal residual disease and acquired resistance may provide important information on persistence and resistance mechanisms to optimize treatment strategies in this setting.

Other ongoing studies will inform the efficacy and safety of osimertinib as adjuvant treatment for resected EGFR-mutated stage IA2-IA3 NSCLC (ADAURA2; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), as 5-year adjuvant treatment for EGFR-mutated stage II-IIIB (TARGET; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), as neoadjuvant treatment for EGFR-mutated stage II-IIIB N2 NSCLC (NeoADAURA; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), and as maintenance therapy in unresectable EGFR-mutated stage III NSCLC (LAURA; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:).

### Neoadjuvant osimertinib for the treatment of stage I-IIIA epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small cell lung cancer: a phase II multicenter study [^b5225aa2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The results of this trial do not match the high MPR and pCR rates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ICI observed in EGFR wt NSCLCs. This suggests that activation of an immune response against NSCLC is able to achieve a higher degree of cytotoxic activity than TKI treatment is and that finding ways to induce an anticancer immune response in EGFR mt NSCLC may ultimately be critical to improving long-term DFS and OS.

While this trial did not meet its primary efficacy end point, a larger study will be needed to fully evaluate neoadjuvant osimertinib in early-stage EGFR mt NSCLC. Importantly, there were no safety concerns that arose from this study that would preclude further investigation of neoadjuvant osimertinib. Potential clinical benefit from neoadjuvant osimertinib was observed in a subset of patients that may warrant further investigation. Approximately 50% of patients achieved > 50% pathological regression within their resected tumors after neoadjuvant osimertinib treatment which correlated with improved DFS, EFS, and OS compared with those who did not achieve > 50% pathological regression. However, we cannot rule out that the receipt of adjuvant therapy in a subset of patients may have influenced survival outcomes. Ultimately, combination therapies may be needed to identify the optimal neoadjuvant treatment strategy for EGFR mt NSCLC. The FLAURA2 trial showed that adding platinum doublet chemotherapy to osimertinib led to significantly longer median PFS than osimertinib monotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic EGFR mt NSCLC (25.5 v 16.7 months, HR, 0.62, P < .001). Whether the addition of platinum doublet chemotherapy to osimertinib in the neoadjuvant setting will improve MPR for patients with surgically resectable EGFRmt NSCLC is being tested in the phase III NeoADAURA trial.

In conclusion, neoadjuvant osimertinib treatment did not meet its primary end point for MPR rate and did not demonstrate a significant improvement in MPR over what would be expected by chemotherapy alone. The major limitations of this trial include the small samples size, the lack of a chemotherapy control arm, and insufficient pretreatment and post-treatment tumor tissue available for comprehensive biomarker analyses. Future studies will aim to address these limitations.

### Neoadjuvant and adjuvant osimertinib in stage IA to IIIA, EGFR-mutant NSCLC (NORA) [^c4d33661]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment with adjuvant osimertinib for three years is the standard-of-care for resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. The role of neoadjuvant osimertinib in the perioperative setting is yet to be elucidated in the NeoADAURA study (NCT04351555).

Methods

This is a single-center, pilot study of patients with clinical stage IA to IIIA NSCLC (American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition) harboring an activating EGFR mutation (Exon 19 deletion, L858R) (NCT04816838). Patients were treated with two 28-day cycles of neoadjuvant osimertinib followed by surgical resection and three years of adjuvant osimertinib. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate after two cycles of neoadjuvant treatment. Secondary endpoints included the pathologic complete response rate and major pathologic response rate. Exploratory objectives included the correlation of longitudinal circulating tumor DNA testing (Signatera) and response to neoadjuvant osimertinib.

Results

A total of 25 patients were enrolled and treated with neoadjuvant osimertinib, and all patients received surgical resection with R0 resection. The objective response rate was 44% (n = 11) all of which were partial responses. Fourteen patients (56%) reported stable disease after neoadjuvant osimertinib. The major pathologic response and pathologic complete response rates were 24% (n = 6) and 0%, respectively. None of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median disease-free survival was not reached at a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 13.8–38.6 mo). Six patients (30%) were circulating tumor DNA-positive at baseline and achieved clearance after 1 cycle of neoadjuvant osimertinib. There were no grade 3 adverse events during neoadjuvant treatment.

Conclusions

Two cycles of neoadjuvant osimertinib did not meet its primary endpoint of ORR. Neoadjuvant osimertinib is a feasible approach with a manageable safety profile in resectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

### Neoadjuvant-adjuvant vs neoadjuvant-only PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors for patients with resectable NSCLC: an indirect meta-analysis [^3d14f019]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 20% to 30% of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) initially present with resectable disease; however, 30% to 55% develop recurrence and die of the disease despite surgical excision. Given the high risk of relapse, multidisciplinary research has been the academic focus for decades. Despite use of platinum-based neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, both approaches showed comparable yet marginal improvement in overall survival (OS). Recently, the landscape of adjuvant and neoadjuvant systemic therapy has evolved, incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies with the approval of 4 regimens (nivolumab, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, and osimertinib) based on clinical trials including CheckMate 816, IMpower010, PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091, and ADAURA. Different treatment scenarios are now available for resectable NSCLC, leading to debates about the optimal choices.

### Neoadjuvant osimertinib for the treatment of stage I-IIIA epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small cell lung cancer: a phase II multicenter study [^1e4a3ef1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib is the current standard first-line therapy for patients with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an EGFR exon 21 p.L858R mutation or exon 19 deletion on the basis of the FLAURA trial showing superiority of osimertinib compared with earlier generation EGFR TKIs both in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). More recently, the ADUARA trial demonstrated that adjuvant treatment with osimertinib for up to 3 years after surgical resection improved both disease-free survival (DFS) and OS for patients with stage IB-IIIA EGFR-mutated (p.L858R or exon 19 deletion) NSCLC when compared with placebo. Whether treatment with osimertinib before surgery (neoadjuvant) in patients with early-stage, surgically resectable EGFR -mutated NSCLC is safe or effective is unknown.

The potential benefits of neoadjuvant therapy for the treatment of NSCLC are (1) early exposure to systemic therapy to treat micrometastatic disease and (2) potential for shorter duration of treatment compared with adjuvant therapy. Potential risks of neoadjuvant therapy include (1) treatment-related adverse events (AEs) that delay surgery or lead to surgical ineligibility and (2) tumor progression during the neoadjuvant treatment window leading to tumor unresectability. Neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy given before surgical resection for patients with resectable NSCLC had been an acceptable alternative to adjuvant chemotherapy. Recent trials have shown that the addition of anti-PD1/PDL1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves pathological complete response (pCR) and major pathological response (MPR) rates and event-free survival (EFS) compared with chemotherapy alone. However, multiple studies have shown lack of benefit to ICIs for the treatment of EGFR mt NSCLC, - and exposure to an ICI may increase the risk of serious immune-related adverse events (iRAEs) on subsequent treatment with osimertinib. Therefore, neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy remains the only standard option for the treatment of EGFRmt NSCLC before surgery. Given the benefit of EGFR TKI therapy compared with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, neoadjuvant EGFR TKIs including erlotinib and osimertinib are being evaluated. While these studies suggest activity of neoadjuvant EGFR TKI therapy, the relevance of ORR as the primary end point in these neoadjuvant trials is unclear, as is the generalizability of these findings to the US population of patients with EGFR mt NSCLC.

### The ASCENT trial: a phase 2 study of induction and consolidation afatinib and chemoradiation with or without surgery in stage III EGFR-mutant NSCLC [^97fa7d12]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

If targeted TKIs are rarely curative, how can they be most effectively combined with other treatment modalities to achieve cure? Are TKIs most effective in the neoadjuvant/induction setting or the adjuvant/consolidation setting? ASCENT was not designed to test the independent contributions of induction versus consolidation TKI, but its findings nonetheless establish important starting points for future trial design.

First, we observed that induction TKI can sometimes transform unresectable stage III disease to being amenable to resection, typically when a centrally located tumor exhibited a strong response. In our cohort, disease in 2 of 9 patients was converted from unresectable to resectable, and one of these (cT4N2 at diagnosis, pCR following induction, and declined consolidation) still has no evidence of disease more than 6 years after completing treatment. This trial is too small to measure how often induction TKI can convert unresectable disease to resectable, but it provides proof-of-concept to motivate a future trial of induction TKI and confirms other similar case series. Subsequent work could also assess whether these "converted" patients have better outcomes with surgery or with definitive cCRT alone. A phase 2 trial (NEOLA, NCT06194448) is planned to open in 2024 that will assess outcomes with 8 weeks of induction osimertinib followed by cCRT and indefinite consolidation osimertinib in patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The NEOLA trial — along with the forthcoming LAURA trial (discussed in more detail below) of consolidation osimertinib after cCRT and the ongoing NeoADAURA trial of neoadjuvant osimertinib prior to surgery — will also provide insights into the role of induction TKI before definitive local therapy, Additional work needs to be done to determine whether short-course induction TKI improves radiation outcomes through reducing target volumes, thereby decreasing dose to normal organs at risk such as lungs.

### Could we have improved on ADAURA? Refining global research practices to reduce cancer care disparities [^e00a9ab2]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ADAURA trial of adjuvant osimertinib versus placebo for up to 3 years in patients with resected stage IB-IIIA epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation–positive (EGFRm +) non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was initiated in 2015, before osimertinib was approved and routinely used in advanced EGFRm+ NSCLC, with disease-free survival (DFS) as the primary end point and without crossover. An interim analysis in 2020 led to the trial being unblinded and preliminary results of a highly significant improvement in DFS being presented at ASCO 2020. The study follow-up was still ongoing, awaiting overall survival (OS) outcomes.

### Study details | NCT04035486-clinicalTrials.gov… [^a456e524]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

A Study of Osimertinib With or Without Chemotherapy as 1st Line Treatment in Patients With Mutated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The reason for the study is to find out if an experimental combination of an oral medication called osimertinib when used in combination with chemotherapy is more effective than giving osimertinib alone for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Some lung cancers are due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid which, if known, can help physicians decide the best treatment for their patients. One type of mutation can occur in the gene that produces a protein on the surface of cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. Osimertinib is an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutations.

Unfortunately, despite the benefit observed for patients treated with osimertinib, the vast majority of cancers are expected to develop resistance to the drug over time. The exact reasons why resistance develops are not fully understood but based upon clinical research it is hoped that combining osimertinib with another type of anti-cancer therapy known as chemotherapy will delay the onset of resistance and the worsening of a patient's cancer. In total the study aims to enroll approximately 586 patients, consisting of approximately 30 patients who will participate in a safety run-in component of the trial, and approximately 556 who will receive osimertinib alone or osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy in the main trial. In the main part of the trial there is a one in two chance of receiving osimertinib alone, and the treatment is decided at random by a computer.

The approach to perioperative therapy in the setting of actionable molecular genomics findings (such as EGFR mutations or ALK-rearrangement) in resectable NSCLC requires more data to define optimal standard of care. In the adjuvant setting, long-term OS follow-up for third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib compared with chemotherapy is awaited from ADAURA, although a similarly designed study showing DFS benefit for the first-generation TKI gefitinib did not translate into an OS advantage. An adjuvant trial assessing alectinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC is ongoing. A study assessing the neoadjuvant use of first-generation EGFR TKI erlotinib in potentially resectable stage IIIA NSCLC showed a significant improvement in PFS in the targeted therapy arm compared with chemotherapy, but a non-significant improvement in radiological response. The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium LEADER trial aims to comprehensively assess neoadjuvant targeted therapies matched to oncogenic driver mutations in NSCLC (LCMC4). In contrast, PD1/PD-L1 pathway blockade has been associated with a lower chance of immunotherapy benefit in metastatic EGFR-mutant or ALK-rearranged NSCLC, raising a concern about whether this is a suitable strategy in the neoadjuvant setting.

Management of early-stage NSCLC

The improved survival for local and locoregional disease reflects that, in selected cases, management can be with curative intent — often with surgery as the mainstay of treatment. Surgery improves survival in early-stage disease: in a large retrospective cohort, those with stage I disease who were recommended but declined surgery had an estimated 5-year survival of 11%, compared with 54% in those who underwent surgery. However, fewer than 30% NSCLC patients receive surgery owing to factors such as advanced tumor stage at presentation or medical comorbidities. Surgery remains the gold standard of treatment for medically and surgically appropriate stage I-II NSCLC patients: in stage 1A-1B disease, 5-year overall survival (OS) post-lobectomy ranges from 45% to 65% and declines in a stage-dependent manner thereafter. Surgery is also recommended in selected patients with stage IIIA disease, often as part of multimodality therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is offered to patients with selected stage I-IIIA resected NSCLC and confers an additional absolute survival advantage of 5% at 5 years. The ADAURA trial reportedly demonstrated an impressive disease-free survival (DFS) benefit for osimertinib in resected epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated stage IB-IIIA NSCLC although OS outcomes are awaited.

NACT, given prior to surgery, may provide benefits such as improved tolerability, improved likelihood of receiving treatment and ability to reduce tumor size preoperatively. In trials comparing neoadjuvant against adjuvant or perioperative chemotherapy, rates of chemotherapy completion were higher in the neoadjuvant arms, although with no differences in toxicity. However, it is not clear if cumulative adjuvant chemotherapy dose is associated with improved survival in lung cancer. In two prospective NACT trials, a meta-analysis and a large retrospective study, the benefit of NACT in NSCLC appears similar or non-superior to that of adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of DFS.NACT can be part of the treatment paradigm for borderline-resectable or to downstage stage IIIA NSCLC patients as a bridge to surgery, for example in the presence of mediastinal LN metastases, although treatment decisions in this setting remain highly individualised.

### Perioperative treatment strategies in EGFR-mutant early-stage NSCLC: current evidence and future challenges [^19f68e5e]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment with 3 years of adjuvant osimertinib is considered a new standard in patients with completely resected stage I to IIIA NSCLC harboring a common sensitizing EGFR mutation. This therapeutic approach significantly prolonged the disease-free survival and the overall survival versus placebo and revealed a significant role in preventing the occurrence of brain metastases. However, many unanswered questions remain, including the optimal duration of this therapy, whether all patients benefit from adjuvant osimertinib, and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in this population. Indeed, there is a renewed interest in neoadjuvant strategies with targeted therapies in resectable NSCLC harboring oncogenic drivers. In light of these considerations, we discuss the past and current treatment options, and the clinical challenges that should be addressed to optimize the treatment outcomes in this patient population.

Non–small cell lung cancer treatment

For patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without oncogenic drivers, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment landscape. Uncertainties remain, including the best sequence of agents, their application in patients with oncogene-driven tumors, and the duration of therapy. Key recommendations for future clinical trials are listed in Figures 2 and 3.

Perioperative, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant therapy in early-stage NSCLC

ICIs for early-stage NSCLC have been explored through neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and perioperative strategies. Two notable phase 3 trials, IMpower 010 and KEYNOTE-091/PEARLS, showed prolonged event-free survival (EFS) with adjuvant atezolizumab and pembrolizumab, respectively. CheckMate-816 demonstrated the benefit of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with resectable NSCLC (stage IB-IIIA). The AEGEAN perioperative study of durvalumab showed significant increases in pathologic complete responses and EFS. The KEYNOTE-671 trial was the first to report an overall survival benefit with perioperative pembrolizumab. Checkmate 77T and NEOTORCH, have also shown improved EFS with perioperative ICIs. These approaches (neoadjuvant, perioperative, and adjuvant) have not been directly compared, and practices vary by treatment center and country. Patients with small, negative PD-L1 tumors have limited benefit, highlighting the need for better treatment strategies. Access to high-quality multidisciplinary care and surgical expertise is also vital.

Oncogenic alterations

In patients with resectable or potentially resectable EGFR -mutant NSCLC, neoadjuvant treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been suggested, and a phase 3 study is ongoing. Adjuvant osimertinib showed dramatic survival benefits in the ADAURA trial, reducing the risk of death and brain recurrences by 50%, and making it a new standard for patients with resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC.

For patients with ALK rearrangements, the recent ALINA study has reported a clear EFS benefit with adjuvant alectinib. Treatment strategies for patients with early-stage NSCLC harboring rarer oncogenic alterations are less defined, as these often represent small subgroups in studies. Conducting large trials in small populations is challenging; therefore, if smaller cohorts show benefit, these should be considered in drug approvals.

RESULTS

Patients

Fifty-four patients were screened for eligibility at three National Cancer Institute–designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the United States between July 1, 2018, and October 4, 2022 (Fig 1). Twenty-seven patients were found to be ineligible for the reasons indicated (Fig 1). Twenty-seven eligible patients were enrolled in the study and received at least one cycle of neoadjuvant osimertinib therapy and were evaluable as the ITT population. Eight patients received one cycle and 19 patients received two cycles of neoadjuvant osimertinib. Demographics and clinical characteristics of enrolled/treated patients are listed in Table 1. The majority of patients were female (81.5%), never smoked (63%), and were predominantly White (55.6%) or Asian (40.7%). All pretreatment biopsies (n = 27) were adenocarcinomas with EGFR p.L858R mutations identified in 59.3% (n = 16) of cases and EGFR exon 19 deletions in 40.7% (n = 11). Eight patients (29.6%) had stage IA or IB disease, 19 patients (70.4%) had stage IIA-IIIA disease. Twenty-four patients underwent surgical resection, one patient (3.7%) was unable to undergo surgical resection because of disease progression, two patients (7.4%) elected not to have surgery because of requirement of pneumonectomy. Eight patients (33.3%) received adjuvant platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) + pemetrexed chemotherapy. Six patients (25%) received adjuvant osimertinib (3 of whom also received adjuvant chemotherapy). Two patients (8.3%) received postoperative radiation therapy (PORT). The median DFS follow-up was 17.5 months. Nine patients (37.5%) who underwent surgical resection have experienced disease recurrence. Fifteen patients (62.5%) remain disease-free in follow-up. Three patients (11.1%) who enrolled in the study have died, with a median survival follow-up of 25.8 months.

In ADAURA (3 years of adjuvant osimertinib versus placebo), disease-free survival in stage II–IIIA patients was significantly prolonged with osimertinib, HR 0.17 (P < .001), with median DFS not reached versus 19.6 months; in stage IIIA, DFS HR was 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.20). OS data are still immature and the approach is FDA approved and should be discussed with eligible patients, and given the known OS benefit of chemotherapy the panel recommends adjuvant platinum chemotherapy for chemotherapy eligible resected NSCLC with these EGFR mutations before consideration of osimertinib.

### Impact of select actionable genomic alterations on efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer [^4861a3f5]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, immunotherapy has been shown to improve OS in KRAS -mutants compared with chemotherapy, however, STK11 co-mutation in KRAS -mutants has been associated with resistance to immunotherapy. Due to the small sample size, our study does not allow for meaningful conclusions about the impact of KRAS co-mutations on the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Nonetheless, the present study extends the potential limited benefit from immunotherapy alone in patients harboring select (non- KRAS) AGAs in the neoadjuvant setting for early-stage resectable NSCLC. Integrating insights from other investigations, the optimal neoadjuvant treatment strategy for AGAs-associated NSCLC warrants further comprehensive exploration.

In the neoadjuvant setting, several efforts are ongoing to evaluate the role of targeted therapy with or without chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy only. A phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant osimertinib (NCT03433469) demonstrated a 15% MPR rate and 48% partial response rate in appropriate stage I–IIIA operable patients. We await the results of the ongoing phase 3 NeoADAURA trial(NCT04351555), which is evaluating osimertinib with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with resectable EGFR -mutant NSCLC. The ongoing NAUTIKA-1 (NCT04302025) uses an umbrella design to screen for AGAs (ALK, ROS1, NTRK, BRAF, RET) and allocates patients to the appropriate neoadjuvant therapy trials prior to surgery. This will provide further evidence for appropriate treatment strategy based on tumor molecular profiles. As the field advances, the timing and role of immunotherapy and targeted therapy with or without chemotherapy in the perioperative setting will need to be further defined.

### Perioperative therapy for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer: weighing options for the present and future [^f7c5e22b]. JCO Oncology Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Anatomic surgical resection followed by cisplatin-based platinum-doublet adjuvant chemotherapy has been a long-standing standard of care for patients with early-stage, resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). More recently, incorporating of immunotherapy and targeted therapy in the perioperative setting has demonstrated improved disease-free or event-free survival in biomarker-defined subsets of patients. This article summarizes the results of major trials that led to approvals beyond chemotherapy in the perioperative setting. Alongside adjuvant osimertinib as a favored strategy for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, there are competing potential standards of care for integrating immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant versus adjuvant setting, with advantages and disadvantages for each strategy. Emerging data in the coming years will provide further insight that may potentially lead to a combination of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment for many patients. Future trials should focus on clarifying the benefit of each component of treatment, defining an optimal treatment duration, and incorporating minimal residual disease to optimize treatment decisions.

### Neoadjuvant osimertinib for resectable-mutated non-small cell lung cancer [^bff56c7c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Adjuvant osimertinib is the standard of care for patients with resected epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Neoadjuvant treatment could improve surgical and long-term outcomes.

Methods

In this randomized, controlled, phase III study, patients with resectable, EGFR -mutated, stage II-IIIB NSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive neoadjuvant osimertinib (80 mg orally once daily for ≥ 9 weeks) plus platinum-based chemotherapy (once every 3 weeks for three cycles), osimertinib monotherapy (for ≥ 9 weeks), or placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy (control), followed by surgical resection. Adjuvant osimertinib was offered to eligible patients after completion of surgery. The primary end point was major pathologic response (MPR) by blinded central pathology review. Event-free survival (EFS) was a secondary end point.

Results

Overall, 358 patients were randomly assigned to receive osimertinib plus chemotherapy (121 patients), osimertinib monotherapy (117 patients), or placebo plus chemotherapy (120 patients). Osimertinib plus chemotherapy (MPR rate 26%) and osimertinib monotherapy (25%) demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the MPR rate versus placebo plus chemotherapy (2%), with corresponding odds ratios of 19.82 (95.002% CI, 4.60 to 85.33; P < .0001) and 19.28 (99.9% CI, 1.71 to 217.39; P < .0001), respectively. With 15% data maturity, the EFS rates at 12 months were 93%, 95%, and 83% with osimertinib plus chemotherapy, osimertinib monotherapy, and placebo plus chemotherapy, respectively. In the neoadjuvant period, grade ≥ 3 adverse events of any cause occurred in 36%, 13%, and 33% of patients with osimertinib plus chemotherapy, osimertinib monotherapy, and placebo plus chemotherapy, respectively. No new safety concerns were identified.

Conclusion

Neoadjuvant osimertinib with or without chemotherapy demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the MPR rate over chemotherapy alone in patients with resectable, EGFR -mutated, stage II-IIIB NSCLC.

Safety

The most common treatment-emergent AEs were consistent with the known toxicity of osimertinib (Table 3). The rate of treatment-related grade 3 or 4 AEs was 11.1% (Table 3). Eight patients (29.6%) experienced a dose hold and three patients (11.1%) a dose reduction. Two patients (7.4%) discontinued therapy because of an AE. Patient 29 discontinued treatment after two cycles during the presurgical window because of grade 2 stomatitis. Patient 44 discontinued treatment after one cycle because of grade 2 neutropenia. No patients experienced a delay in surgery or became ineligible for surgery because of an AE. No significant intraoperative complications were reported. During the postoperative monitoring period, which including the day of surgery until 6 weeks after surgery, the most common AEs were atrial fibrillation (25%), dyspnea (20.8%), and chest pain (16.7%; Appendix Table A 1). One patient experienced a grade 3 pulmonary embolism with grade 3 dyspnea that was deemed to be a serious AE. All AEs occurring in at least 5% of patients are reported in Appendix Table A 2.

### Neoadjuvant targeted therapy in resectable NSCLC: current and future perspectives [^de059665]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

The standard of care (SoC) for medically operable patients with early-stage (stages I–IIIB) NSCLC is surgery combined with (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with stages II to IIIB disease and some stage IB or, rarely, chemoradiation (stage III disease with mediastinal lymph node metastases). Despite these treatments, metastatic recurrence is common and associated with poor survival, highlighting the need for systemic therapies that are more effective than the current SoC. After the success of targeted therapy (TT) in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring oncogenic drivers, these agents are being investigated for the perioperative (neoadjuvant and adjuvant) treatment of patients with early-stage NSCLC. Adjuvant osimertinib is the only TT approved for use in the early-stage setting, and there are no approved neoadjuvant TTs. We discuss the importance of comprehensive biomarker testing at diagnosis to identify individuals who may benefit from neoadjuvant targeted treatments and review emerging data from neoadjuvant TT trials. We also address the potential challenges for establishing neoadjuvant TTs as SoC in the early-stage setting, including the identification and validation of early response markers to guide care and accelerate drug development, and discuss safety considerations in the perioperative setting. Initial data indicate that neoadjuvant TTs are effective and well tolerated in patients with EGFR - or ALK -positive early-stage NSCLC. Data from ongoing trials will determine whether neoadjuvant targeted agents will become a new SoC for individuals with oncogene-addicted resectable NSCLC.

### The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) 2023 expert consensus document: staging and multidisciplinary management of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^dccacbc9]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Early-stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy — phase 3 data and regulatory actions — are summarized as follows: the addition of neoadjuvant or adjuvant immunotherapy may improve event-free survival (EFS) or disease-free survival (DFS), and based on CheckMate 816 (CM816) and IMpower010, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved nivolumab with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant and atezolizumab after chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II-IIIA NSCLC. There has also been tremendous interest in oncogene-driven targeted therapy after ADAURA, which demonstrated a marked improvement in DFS with osimertinib in the adjuvant setting for patients with resected stage IB to IIIA epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive NSCLC. Recurrence after definitive therapy remains substantial: for stage I-II NSCLC, rates of recurrence range from 20% to 26%, whereas the rate of recurrence is 52% to 70% for stage III NSCLC treated with bi- or trimodality therapy. To decrease recurrence and improve survival, neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy is typically recommended for patients with stage II and III NSCLC and for patients with stage IB NSCLC with high-risk features, although chemotherapy historically offers survival benefit of only about 5% when delivered in either the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Following these approvals and new regimens, early biomarker testing and precise clinical and pathologic staging of surgically resectable patients are critical, there remains a lack of consensus about the use of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC, and recent phase 3 trials have further elucidated the role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant radiation in trimodality therapy for stage II-IIIA NSCLC.

### Treating EGFR-mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer is no longer a one-size-fits-all approach [^9820441c]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Just over 2 decades ago, Lynch et al. published a landmark article in which they elucidated that activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positively correlated with clinical responses to the first‐generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), gefitinib, in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although estimates vary, it is believed that up to one third of cases of NSCLC may harbor these mutations. Over the last 20 years, great strides have been made to improve both the efficacy and the tolerability of therapies targeting EGFR, with fourth‐generation EGFR TKIs in development. In this edition of CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, Borgeaud et al. provide an exceptionally detailed review of EGFR ‐mutant NSCLC that describes the molecular underpinnings of this oncogenic driver, discusses modern treatment approaches, and explores the gamut of clinical situations that can be encountered while treating a patient with EGFR ‐mutant NSCLC.

Although Borgeaud and colleagues explicitly do not cover the management of EGFR exon 20 insertions, they do provide some brief insights into P‐loop and αC‐helix compressing (PACC or uncommon) mutations and present a comprehensive review that can be a useful tool for clinicians treating patients with common EGFR mutations (L858R, exon 19 deletions) across all stages of presentation. Studies investigating the effectiveness of immunotherapy and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors to early phase trials targeting potential acquired mutations on EGFR TKIs are detailed. For clinicians treating patients with early stage or locally advanced NSCLC, their article analyzes pivotal studies, such as ADAURA and LAURA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02511106 and NCT03521154, respectively), which led to osimertinib (third‐generation TKI) becoming the standard of care in the adjuvant and postchemoradiation setting, respectively. Furthermore, crucial ongoing studies are highlighted, such as NeoADAURA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04351555), which is investigating the incorporation of osimertinib in the neoadjuvant setting. Potential considerations for less straight‐forward situations, such as metastatic recurrence while on or after adjuvant osimertinib, are also discussed.

In ADAURA, adjuvant osimertinib for 3 years improved disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 0.20; CI, 0.14–0.30, P < .001), with benefit across stages IB (HR, 0.39; CI, 0.18–0.76), II (HR, 0.17; CI, 0.08–0.31), and IIIA (HR, 0.12; CI, 0.07–0.20), and stage IB included tumors ≥ 3 cm. Osimertinib was associated with an 82% decrease in central nervous system recurrence or death (HR, 0.18; CI, 0.10–0.33). DFS benefit was irrespective of adjuvant chemotherapy, including in those who did not receive chemotherapy before osimertinib (n = 272) versus placebo (HR, 0.23; CI, 0.13–0.40), and "it is appropriate to give adjuvant osimertinib alone" when chemotherapy is not feasible.

Available results from trials of adjuvant TT for resectable NSCLC suggest that surrogate markers (pCR, MPR, EFS, and DFS) may correlate with survival; however, these studies are not designed to assess OS and more data are required to determine a clear association. The single-arm phase 2 SELECT trial investigating adjuvant erlotinib in patients with EGFR -mutant eNSCLC demonstrated high DFS and OS rates: 2-year and 5-year DFS, 88% and 56%, respectively; 5-year OS, 86%. The phase 2 EVAN trial assessed adjuvant erlotinib compared with chemotherapy in patients with EGFR -mutant stage III NSCLC and found that erlotinib improved survival outcomes compared with chemotherapy, and DFS correlated with OS: 5-year DFS and OS rates with erlotinib were 48.2% and 84.8%, respectively. Results from the randomized, phase 3 IMPACT study revealed an improved 2-year DFS rate with adjuvant gefitinib compared with chemotherapy, but this advantage was lost at 5 years and did not translate into OS benefit. Similarly, a significant improvement in DFS did not translate into OS benefit in the final analysis of the phase 3 ADJUVANT-CTONG1104 trial of gefitinib versus chemotherapy for patients with resected stages I to IIIA EGFR -mutant NSCLC. The phase 3 ADAURA study demonstrated significant improvements in DFS with adjuvant osimertinib compared with placebo in patients with stages II to IIIA NSCLC: 3-year DFS rate was 84% versus 34%, respectively. Osimertinib also showed an improvement in DFS in the overall population (stages IB–IIIA), alongside decreased locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, and central nervous system (CNS) recurrence. Despite immature OS at time of approval, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved adjuvant osimertinib for patients with resected NSCLC on the basis of DFS data from this study. Updated data from this trial showed that osimertinib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS. This depicts the first TT to show translation of a DFS benefit into improved OS in this setting and validating DFS as a surrogate marker for OS.

Adjuvant osimertinib recommendation — The NCCN Panel recommends osimertinib as an adjuvant therapy option for eligible patients with completely resected (RO) stage IB to IIIA, and stage IIIB (only T3, N2) EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who have previously received adjuvant chemotherapy or are ineligible to receive platinum-based chemotherapy based on clinical trial data and FDA approval. Osimertinib is recommended in this setting for EGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, and although using a resected specimen may be technically easier for molecular testing, it is also acceptable to use initial diagnostic biopsy specimens.

Rationale for neoadjuvant immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer

For the last two decades perioperative chemotherapy, either as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, has been the SOC for resectable stage II–IIIA NSCLC (online supplemental table 1). However, with an absolute survival benefit of 5.4% at 5 years compared with no chemotherapy, much more need to be done for patients with NSCLC. Also, while some patients with molecularly-defined NSCLC do benefit from TT, notably adjuvant osimertinib for EGFR-mutated lung cancer, most patients have NSCLC tumors that lack targetable alterations. Therefore, within the past 5 years thoracic oncologists have tried to determine whether immunotherapy, which has shown positive outcomes in other cancers such as melanoma, could also benefit patients with resectable NSCLC.

In summary, consolidation osimertinib improves PFS in unresectable stage III EGFR ‐mutant NSCLC after chemoradiation and is preferred over durvalumab, which is not recommended in this setting. Future trials should explore escalation and de‐escalation treatment strategies.

Role of neoadjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors

The role of neoadjuvant TKI monotherapy for resectable EGFR ‐mutant NSCLC has been explored in phase 2 studies. Multiple single‐arm trials demonstrated that a neoadjuvant first‐generation EGFR TKI was generally safe, although modest pathologic responses were achieved. The phase 2 EMERGING‐CTONG1103 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01407822) was the only randomized trial that enrolled patients with stage IIIA N2 EGFR ‐mutant NSCLC and compared perioperative erlotinib (6 weeks and 12 months before and after surgery, respectively) versus perioperative gemcitabine and cisplatin (two cycles before and after surgery). There was no improvement in the objective response rate (ORR) or OS with erlotinib compared with chemotherapy, and the major pathologic response (MPR) rate was low in both groups (9.7% and 0% for erlotinib and chemotherapy, respectively). However, PFS, which was a secondary end point, was significantly improved with erlotinib (median PFS, 21.5 vs. 11.4 months; HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21–0.61). Similarly, several phase 2 trials have evaluated neoadjuvant osimertinib, with rather low MPR and pathologic complete response rates ranging from 10.7% to 24% and from 0% to 3.6%, respectively. These findings suggest that EGFR TKIs might have limited capacity for tumor eradication in the neoadjuvant setting.

### Thoracoscopic lobectomy following neoadjuvant tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment [^4de57c8e]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

At present, there are at least 7 actionable genomic alterations with targeted therapies available for patients with NSCLC. Chemotherapy with or without radiation has been the standard neoadjuvant therapy for the past 25 years. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or combined with chemotherapy have been associated with substantial tumor responses. Combined immunotherapy regimens allow for performance of minimally invasively procedures, but may result in more desmoplastic and fibrotic responses, which may lead to higher rates of conversion to open thoracotomy.

These 2 cases of induction osimertinib followed by VATS lobectomy demonstrate the challenges in predicting the degree of postinduction fibrosis, nodal flare related to reactive or inflammatory changes, and difficulty of dissection. With the expanding use of targeted therapies, their addition to neoadjuvant treatment paradigms is being explored. The phase III international NeoADAURA trial, examining neoadjuvant osimertinib for EGFR -mutant tumors, is open to accrual. Given the strong preference by thoracic surgical oncologists to perform minimally invasive resections, it is expected that more of these procedures will be performed successfully, even after TKI therapy.

Targeted therapy — ADAURA adjuvant osimertinib outcomes — In a phase 3 randomized trial of 682 patients with resected stage IB to IIIA EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adjuvant osimertinib improved 24-month outcomes: 89% (95% CI, 85%–92%) versus 52% (95% CI, 46%–58%) alive and disease-free with an overall HR for disease recurrence or death of 0.20; 99.12% CI, 0.14–0.30; P < .001. At 24 months, 98% (95% CI, 95%–99%) versus 85% (95% CI, 80%–89%) were alive and did not have central nervous system (CNS) disease with an overall HR of 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10–0.33. By stage, 24-month alive and disease-free rates were 88% (95% CI, 78%–94%) versus 74% (95% CI, 60%–80%) in stage IB (overall HR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18–0.70), 91% (95% CI, 82%–95%) versus 56% (95% CI, 45%–65%) in stage II (overall HR 0.17; 95% CI, 0.08–0.31), and 88% (95% CI, 79%–94%) versus 32% (95% CI, 23%–41%) in stage IIIA (overall HR 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07–0.20). Among all participants, 60% (410/682) received adjuvant chemotherapy, overall survival data are not yet available, serious adverse events occurred in 16% (54/339) versus 12% (42/343), interstitial lung disease occurred in 3% with osimertinib versus none with placebo, and there were no deaths with osimertinib versus one with placebo.

### Neoadjuvant osimertinib followed by sequential definitive radiation therapy and / or surgery in stage III epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant non-small cell lung cancer: an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study [^dbc8626d]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The treatment for unresectable, locally advanced stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by consolidation durvalumab. This study aimed to evaluate the benefit of neoadjuvant osimertinib as an alternative therapy to this approach with the aim of reducing the radiation field.

Methods and Materials

This investigation was a nonrandomized, open-label, single-arm, phase 2, prospective, proof-of-concept study. Eligible patients were classified as having treatment-naïve, nonoperable, stage III epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant NSCLC. Patients received 80 mg of oral osimertinib daily for 12 weeks before definitive radiation therapy (RT) and/or surgery. The response was assessed at weeks 6 and 12. For responders, sequential definitive RT and/or surgery were planned. Nonresponders were started on standard CRT. After RT ± surgery or CRT, patients were followed for 2 years without adjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR), with September 20, 2022, set as the cut-off for data collection. Secondary endpoints were safety and the gross tumor volume (GTV), planned tumor volume (PTV), and the percentage of total lung volume minus GTV exceeding 20 Gy (V20%) before versus after osimertinib. Exploratory analyses included assessments of the presence of plasma circulating tumor-free DNA (ctDNA) before osimertinib treatment, at weeks 6 and 12, at the end of RT, and 6 weeks post-RT.

Results

Twenty-four patients were included (19 women; median age, 73 years; range, 51–82 years). Nineteen of 24 had never smoked, 20 of 24 had adenocarcinoma, 16 of 24 had exon 19 deletions, and 8 of 24 had exon 21 mutations. Participants had stage IIIA (10), IIIB (9), or IIIC (5) disease. Three patients were excluded from the analysis (1 dropped out and 2 were still undergoing osimertinib treatment at the cut-off date). The ORR to induction osimertinib was 95.2% (17 partial response, 3 complete response, and 1 progressive disease). After induction osimertinib, 13 of 20 patients were definitively radiated, 3 of 20 underwent surgery, and 5 of 20 were excluded. Four patients were restaged as stage IV (contralateral ground-glass opacities responded to osimertinib), and 1 patient withdrew informed consent. Three patients underwent surgery, one of whom was treated with RT. Two patients achieved pT1aN0, and one achieved pathologic complete response. The median GTV, PTV, and V20% before osimertinib treatment were 47.4 ± 76.9 cm³ (13.5–234.9), 227.0 ± 258.8 cm³ (77.8–929.2), and 27.1 ± 16.4% (6.2–60.3), respectively. The values after osimertinib treatment were 27.5 ± 42.3 cm³ (2.99–137.7); -48 ± 20%; P = 0.02), 181.9 ± 198.4 cm³ (54–718.1); -31 ± 20%; P = 0.01), and 21.8 ± 11.7% (9.1–44.15; -24 ± 40%; P = 0.04), respectively. PTV/GTV/V20% reduction was associated with tumor size and central location. The median follow-up time was 28.71 months (range, 0.4–45.1 months), and median disease-free survival was not reached (mean, 30.59; standard error, 3.94; 95% confidence interval, 22.86–38.31). ctDNA was detected in 5 patients; 4 of 5 were positive for ctDNA at baseline and became negative during osimertinib induction but were again positive after osimertinib treatment was terminated. Interestingly, 3 patients who were ctDNA negative at baseline became weakly positive after RT and then were negative at follow-up. No significant adverse events were reported during the osimertinib or radiation phases.

Conclusions

Neoadjuvant osimertinib therapy is feasible in patients with stage III lung cancer NSCLC, followed by definitive radiation and/or surgery, with an ORR of 95.2% and an excellent safety profile. Osimertinib induction for 12 weeks before definitive radiation (chemo-free) significantly reduced the radiation field by nearly 50% with a linear association with tumor size. Further studies are needed to test this chemo-free approach for long-term outcomes before practices are changed.

In patients with resectable, locally advanced, ALK -positive NSCLC, Zhang et al.reported that neoadjuvant crizotinib was feasible and well tolerated (Table 1). Overall, 10 of 11 patients had a partial response and one had stable disease. Ten of the patients received an R0 resection and two achieved a pCR. In a retrospective study of patients with stage III ALK -positive NSCLC who received surgery after induction therapy of alectinib (n = 16) or crizotinib (n = 13), alectinib was found to have superior efficacy compared with crizotinib (pCR: 37.5% versus 15.4%). Multiple ongoing clinical trials are investigating the efficacy and safety of newer-generation ALK inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting (Table 2).

The investigation of neoadjuvant TTs is still early, and the optimal duration of treatment is not yet known. In the ADAURA study, at time of relapse after adjuvant osimertinib for at least 3 years, 41% of patients were treated with osimertinib; suggesting that some patients may need more than 3 years of adjuvant osimertinib. Treatment duration in the neoadjuvant setting is constrained by the need to undergo resection limiting the number of TT cycles and challenges associated with assessing efficacy. Additional data from ongoing clinical trials will be essential for determining the optimal duration of neoadjuvant TT.

Compared with neoadjuvant CIT trials,- preliminary data indicate that MPR or pCR rates may be lower in neoadjuvant TT trials, whereas other efficacy end points (R0 resection rate, downstaging, event-free survival [EFS], DFS, PFS) are comparable (Table 1). This may be due to inherent differences in mechanism of action; the antitumor effects of chemotherapy are driven by cytotoxic effects and CIT by enhanced immunosurveillance, whereas TTs are cytostatic which may impact the necessary duration of TT in the perioperative setting. Until there is better understanding of pathologic response after neoadjuvant TT, surgical resection should still be conducted in the early-stage setting and survival assessment remains an essential end point.

Importance

A series of high-profile clinical trials for patients with resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have recently changed the standard of care in this setting. Specifically, studies have demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvements in efficacy with the targeted therapy for adjuvant osimertinib in patients with resected NSCLC harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genomic abnormality (GA), whereas trials with chemotherapy combined with nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting and others testing atezolizumab or pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy have all demonstrated improvements in event-free survival (EFS) (for neoadjuvant therapy) or disease-free survival (DFS) (for adjuvant therapy). These trials introduce many open questions about how to apply these findings in clinical practice.

Observations

Treatment with adjuvant osimertinib for 3 years was associated with significant improvement in both DFS and overall survival (OS), but the erosion of the DFS benefit after the duration of treatment ends suggests a potential value for more longitudinal treatment. The potential value of highly effective targeted therapies as adjuvant therapy for other GAs has a compelling rationale but no data at this time. Adjuvant atezolizumab or pembrolizumab, generally administered for 1 year after postoperative chemotherapy, are appropriate considerations, but only atezolizumab for patients with tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels of 50% has demonstrated a benefit in OS. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with nivolumab offers a strong EFS benefit, a shorter interval of treatment, and radiographic and pathologic feedback for patients with resectable stage IB to IIIA NSCLC, although very recent randomized clinical trials of perioperative immunotherapy both combined with chemotherapy preoperatively and administered postoperatively highlight the debatable value of adjuvant immunotherapy after prior chemoimmunotherapy. Improved tumor shrinkage rates with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy suggest the possibility that criteria for resectability may potentially be redefined in anticipation of a good response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Developments in resectable NSCLC have arrived so rapidly that they have also created practical challenges of identifying optimal patients and prioritizing options among these new competing standards. In some cases, practical management requires clinical judgment and discussion with the patient to cover the gaps in prospective data. Caution should be exerted when extrapolating beyond the available data.

In this meta-analysis of 43 studies involving 5431 patients with resectable NSCLC, there was a significant benefit in event-free survival but not overall survival for patients with baseline tumor PD-L1 levels less than 1% who received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy compared with chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant treatment can target micrometastatic disease prior to surgery and can downstage cancer, permitting resection that was previously not possible or considered too extensive. 6, 7 Potential drawbacks of this approach include progression on neoadjuvant therapy, thus precluding surgery, and possible effects on surgical performance. in the adjuvant setting across all programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 strata after overall survival results were produced from KEYNOTE-671.

10, 11 In contrast, the European Medicines Agency approved nivolumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting only in patients at high risk of recurrence and with tumor cell PD-L1 expression levels greater than 1%. There was no significant difference between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in the relative risk of receiving all cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, pneumonectomy, or bilobectomy or having surgical delay or open surgery. However, patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy were more likely to undergo R0 resection. There was no significant difference in the pooled prevalence of patients who had a complete response or progressive disease, but there was an increase in the proportion of patients with a partial response or stable disease for chemoimmunotherapy vs chemotherapy.

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date comparing neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and chemotherapy using RCT data. Overall, we found that neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy was associated with improved OS, EFS, MPR, and pCR compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy; in addition, chemoimmunotherapy was associated with improved resectability and an increased rate of R0 resections, with a similar rate of adverse events.

Introduction

Approximately half of all patients with NSCLC present with early-stage disease, and this figure will increase with the expansion of screening programs for high-risk populations. Surgery is the primary curative-intent treatment option for patients with resectable NSCLC (stages I–IIIB) and is recommended with neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy for stages II to IIIB disease and selected stage IB cases or, rarely, chemoradiation for stage III disease with mediastinal lymph node metastases. Despite available treatments, disease recurrence is common in patients who have undergone resection and is associated with poor survival and socioeconomic burden. - A pooled analysis of five adjuvant chemotherapy trials in patients with resected NSCLC demonstrated a modest 5.4% improvement in overall survival (OS) at 5 years compared with surgery alone. Similarly, in a meta-analysis of patients with resectable NSCLC, neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved 5-year OS by 5% compared with surgery alone. Thus, there is a need for additional treatments that reduce disease recurrence, prolong survival, and increase cure rates in patients with early-stage NSCLC (eNSCLC). Recent advances in the eNSCLC setting include the approval of multiple adjuvant treatment options including the following: osimertinib for patients with resected NSCLC (stages IB–III) whose tumors harbor classic EGFR mutations; atezolizumab after platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with resected NSCLC (stages II–III) whose tumors have programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression according to country-specific thresholds; and pembrolizumab after optional platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with resected NSCLC (stage IB [T2a ≥ 4 cm], II, or IIIA; seventh edition of the TNM cancer staging system). Ongoing studies may lead to the approval of additional adjuvant targeted therapies (TTs), including the ALINA trial investigating adjuvant alectinib for patients with resected ALK -positive NSCLC. The neoadjuvant field is also rapidly evolving with the recent approval of neoadjuvant nivolumab in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with resectable NSCLC. Currently, there are no approved neoadjuvant TTs for resectable NSCLC.

### Postoperative chemotherapy use and outcomes from ADAURA: osimertinib as adjuvant therapy for resected EGFR-mutated NSCLC [^6f54f56c]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in patients with resected stages II to IIIA (and select IB) NSCLC; however, recurrence rates are high. In the phase 3 ADAURA study (NCT02511106), osimertinib was found to have a clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with resected stages IB to IIIA EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) NSCLC. Here, we report prespecified and exploratory analyses of adjuvant chemotherapy use and outcomes from ADAURA.

Methods

Patients with resected stages IB to IIIA EGFRm NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to receive osimertinib or placebo for 3 years. Adjuvant chemotherapy before randomization was not mandatory, per physician and patient choice. DFS in the overall population (IB-IIIA), with and without adjuvant chemotherapy, was a prespecified analysis. Exploratory analyses included the following: adjuvant chemotherapy use by patient age, disease stage, and geographic location; DFS by adjuvant chemotherapy use and disease stage.

Results

Overall, 410 of 682 patients (60%) received adjuvant chemotherapy (osimertinib, n = 203; placebo, n = 207) for a median duration of 4.0 cycles. Adjuvant chemotherapy use was more frequent in patients: aged less than 70 years (338 of 509; 66%) versus more than or equal to 70 years (72 of 173; 42%); with stages II to IIIA (352 of 466; 76%) versus stage IB (57 of 216; 26%); and enrolled in Asia (268 of 414; 65%) versus outside of Asia (142 of 268; 53%). A DFS benefit favoring osimertinib versus placebo was observed in patients with (DFS hazard ratio = 0.16, 95% confidence interval: 0.10–0.26) and without adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio = 0.23, 95% confidence interval: 0.13–0.40), regardless of disease stage.

Conclusions

These findings support adjuvant osimertinib as an effective treatment for patients with stages IB to IIIA EGFRm NSCLC after resection, with or without previous adjuvant chemotherapy.

Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with resected stage II or III non-small-cell lung cancer. However, biomarker-informed clinical trials are starting to push the management of early-stage lung cancer beyond cytotoxic chemotherapy. This review explores recent and ongoing studies focused on improving cytotoxic chemotherapy and incorporating targeted and immunotherapies in the management of early-stage, resectable lung cancer. Adjuvant osimertinib for patients with EGFR -mutant tumors, preoperative chemoimmunotherapy, and adjuvant immunotherapy could improve outcomes for selected patients with resectable lung cancer, and ongoing or planned studies leveraging biomarkers, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy may further improve survival. We also discuss the unique barriers associated with clinical trials of early-stage lung cancer and the need for innovative trial designs to overcome these challenges.

ADAURA phase 3 adjuvant osimertinib — In resected stage IB to IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, adjuvant osimertinib versus placebo in 682 patients improved 24 months disease-free survival to 89% (95% CI, 85%–92%) versus 52% (95% CI, 46%–58%) with overall HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.20; 99.12% CI, 0.14–0.30; P < .001, and increased freedom from central nervous system (CNS) disease at 24 months to 98% (95% CI, 95%–99%) versus 85% (95% CI, 80%–89%) with overall HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10–0.33. Stage-specific 24‑month disease‑free survival was 88% (95% CI, 78%–94%) versus 71% (95% CI, 60%–80%) in stage IB (overall HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18–0.76), 91% (95% CI, 82%–95%) versus 56% (95% CI, 45%–65%) in stage II (overall HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.08–0.31), and 88% (95% CI, 79%–94%) versus 32% (95% CI, 23%–41%) in stage IIIA (overall HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07–0.20). Among all participants, 60% (410/682) received adjuvant chemotherapy, and overall survival data are not yet available. Serious adverse events were reported in 16% (54/339) with osimertinib versus 12% (42/343) with placebo; Ten patients (3%) receiving osimertinib had interstitial lung disease versus no patients with placebo, and there were no deaths in the osimertinib group versus one in the placebo group.

### Neoadjuvant osimertinib for the treatment of stage I-IIIA epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small cell lung cancer: a phase II multicenter study [^06b5d30e]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the safety and efficacy of the third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with surgically resectable stage I-IIIA EGFR -mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Patients and Methods

This was a multi-institutional phase II trial of neoadjuvant osimertinib for patients with surgically resectable stage I-IIIA (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] V7) EGFR -mutated (L858R or exon 19 deletion) NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03433469). Patients received osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily for up to two 28-day cycles before surgical resection. The primary end point was major pathological response (MPR) rate. Secondary safety and efficacy end points were also assessed. Exploratory end points included pretreatment and post-treatment tumor mutation profiling.

Results

A total of 27 patients were enrolled and treated with neoadjuvant osimertinib for a median 56 days before surgical resection. Twenty-four (89%) patients underwent subsequent surgery; three (11%) patients were converted to definitive chemoradiotherapy. The MPR rate was 14.8% (95% CI, 4.2 to 33.7). No pathological complete responses were observed. The ORR was 52%, and the median DFS was 40.9 months. One treatment-related serious adverse event (AE) occurred (3.7%). No patients were unable to undergo surgical resection or had surgery delayed because of an AE. The most common co-occurring tumor genomic alterations were in TP53 (42%) and RBM10 (21%).

Conclusion

Treatment with neoadjuvant osimertinib in surgically resectable (stage IA-IIIA, AJCC V7) EGFR -mutated NSCLC did not meet its primary end point for MPR rate. However, neoadjuvant osimertinib did not lead to unanticipated AEs, surgical delays, nor result in a significant unresectability rate.

NCCN Guidelines — treatment timing relative to biomarker results indicate that if a clinically actionable biomarker is found, appropriate therapy recommendations are provided; if results are unknown or pending, patients can be treated as if they do not have driver oncogenes. Retrospective data indicate that the availability of molecular testing prior to treatment initiation is associated with longer overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC, and if an urgent start is required, clinicians should consider holding immunotherapy for one cycle (ie, just use platinum-based chemotherapy regimens). Clinicians need to be aware of the long half-life of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the potential for higher rates of side effects when using certain targeted therapies, such as osimertinib, in combination with or following checkpoint inhibitors. If a clinical actionable biomarker is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, the planned systemic therapy (including maintenance therapy) can be either interrupted or completed before switching to the appropriate targeted therapy.

### Clinical outcomes of perioperative immunotherapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer [^f224a5dc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Despite these challenges, biomarker testing in early-stage NSCLC is vital given that patients with NSCLC with EGFR and ALK alterations either were excluded from studies incorporating neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (eg, Checkmate 816 [A Neoadjuvant Study of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab or Nivolumab Plus Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer]) or did not show any evidence of benefit from receiving immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting (ie, IMPower010 [Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) Compared to Best Supportive Care Following Chemotherapy in Patients With Lung Cancer]). Given that there is evidence of improved outcomes with targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting for these patients — as demonstrated by data from the ADAURA (AZD9291 Versus Placebo in Patients With Stage IB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Following Complete Tumour Resection With or Without Adjuvant Chemotherapy) trial, using osimertinib in EGFR -mutant NSCLC, and the ALINA (A Study Comparing Adjuvant Alectinib Versus Adjuvant Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Patients With ALK Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) trial, using alectinib in ALK -positive NSCLC, studies — biomarker testing is imperative. Furthermore, for patients with NSCLC with EGFR or ALK alterations, neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy or adjuvant immunotherapy is generally not recommended.

We defined neoadjuvant therapy as chemoimmunotherapy use preceding surgery. We found that most patients in the neoadjuvant cohort had stage IIIA disease. The 18-month clinical DMFS was numerically higher for patients with stage IIIA disease in the neoadjuvant cohort compared with the adjuvant cohort (78.9% vs 77.4%). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials demonstrated overall survival benefit of the neoadjuvant approach in patients with stage III NSCLC, revealing a statistically significant HR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.53–0.85). Similar results have been reported for patients with stage II to IIIB NSCLC in a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database. Additionally, a recent consensus statement from the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer indicated a strong preference for neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy compared with upfront surgery for medically operable patients with resectable clinical stage IIIA NSCLC. Regardless, these patients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team to devise an individualized treatment plan, ideally in a tumor board setting and consisting of surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, pulmonologists, radiologists, and supportive care staff.

Data From Clinical Trials Investigating Neoadjuvant TT

Given the success of TTs in the advanced disease setting and impressive survival benefits found with adjuvant osimertinib, neoadjuvant TTs are being increasingly investigated for treatment of oncogene-addicted resectable lung cancer. Most neoadjuvant TT trials focus on EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as these are the most established TTs in this landscape (Table 1). It is important to note that patients with EGFR -mutant and ALK -rearranged NSCLC have inherent differences in tumor biology and the respective TKIs, of which there are multiple generations, are associated with distinct mechanisms of resistance. As such, EGFR and ALK TKIs and their associated targets are uniquely distinguished.

To date, the EGFR TKIs gefitinib, erlotinib, and osimertinib have been explored in the neoadjuvant setting (Table 1). An open-label, single-arm phase 2 study reported that gefitinib was a generally safe and feasible regimen in unselected patients with stage I NSCLC, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 11%; the strongest predictor of response was the presence of an EGFR mutation. Another single-arm phase 2 study demonstrated that neoadjuvant gefitinib was a viable treatment option for patients with EGFR -mutant, stages II to IIIA NSCLC; ORR was 54.5%, major pathologic response (MPR) was 24.2%, and median DFS was 33.5 months. In a retrospective study of 10 patients who underwent salvage surgery for borderline resectable NSCLC after neoadjuvant gefitinib, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 14 months and OS was more than or equal to 36 months. Erlotinib was also reported to be an effective neoadjuvant therapy in a study of Chinese patients with stage IIIA NSCLC: erlotinib resulted in a higher ORR (67% versus 19%), pathologic response rate (67% versus 38%), and OS (51.0 versus 20.9 mo) than cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy. The EMERGING-CTONG 1103 study was a randomized phase 2 trial comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with erlotinib in patients with stages IIIA to N2 EGFR -mutant NSCLC. The primary end point of ORR was not met (54.1% erlotinib versus 34.3% chemotherapy), but an improvement in median PFS was observed (21.5 versus 11.4 mo, respectively), though this did not translate into an OS benefit. Preliminary results from ongoing clinical trials of osimertinib suggest that this third-generation EGFR TKI is a generally safe and may be an effective neoadjuvant treatment. In a small phase 2 study of 27 patients with stages I to IIIA EGFR -mutant NSCLC, neoadjuvant osimertinib-induced pathologic responses (MPR: 15%) and downstaging of disease before surgery; however, the study did not meet its primary end point. Final results from the NEOS study in 38 patients with resectable stages II to IIIB EGFR -mutant NSCLC revealed an ORR of 71.1%, R0 surgical resection rate of 93.8%, and MPR rate of 10.7%.

### Thoracoscopic lobectomy following neoadjuvant tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment [^e8e9c11d]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Pre- and postinduction imaging of 2 patients treated with neoadjuvant osimertinib.

Central Message

Degree of fibrosis, preservation of tissue planes, technical difficulty, and operative duration were not predictable preoperatively in 2 patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy after TKI therapy.

See Commentaries on pages 298 and 299.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is approved for the treatment of stage IV non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. Comparison of TKI versus conventional platinum doublet-based chemotherapy in stage IV NSCLC has demonstrated improved progression-free survival with TKI therapy. The recently published phase III FLAURA trial found superior overall survival with osimertinib, a third-generation TKI, compared with the second-generation TKIs gefitinib or erlotinib, in patients with previously untreated EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. These findings resulted in Food and Drug Administration approval of osimertinib as a first-line therapy for locoregional or metastatic NSCLC. The recent ADAURA trial demonstrated significantly improved disease-free survival with adjuvant osimertinib for completely resected stage IB to IIIA EGFR -mutant NSCLC.

Notwithstanding these seminal publications, limited data exist on the surgical aspects of lung cancer resection after neoadjuvant TKI therapy. Specifically, reports on the degrees of tissue fibrosis and difficulty in dissection are not currently available, which may become more relevant as an increasing number of patients are treated preoperatively with targeted therapy. We present 2 patients with locally advanced EGFR -mutant NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant osimertinib followed by thoracoscopic lobectomy and complete lymphadenectomy. Both patients received care in a multidisciplinary setting in consultation with both thoracic surgery and medical oncology. Written informed consent was obtained for publication of this report.

### FDA benefit-risk assessment of osimertinib for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harboring epidermal growth factor receptor T790M mutation [^c9b1f47d]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

On March 30, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved osimertinib for the treatment of patients with metastatic, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed following EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Approval was based on demonstration of a statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) when comparing osimertinib with chemotherapy in an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial (AURA3). In this confirmatory trial, which enrolled 419 patients, the PFS hazard ratio for osimertinib compared with chemotherapy per investigator assessment was 0.30 (95% confidence interval 0.23–0.41), p < .001, with median PFS of 10.1 months in the osimertinib arm and 4.4 months in the chemotherapy arm. Supportive efficacy data included PFS per blinded independent review committee demonstrating similar PFS results and an improved confirmed objective response rate per investigator assessment of 65% and 29%, with estimated median durations of response of 11.0 months and 4.2 months, in the osimertinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Patients received osimertinib 80 mg once daily and had a median duration of exposure of 8 months. The toxicity profile of osimertinib compared favorably with the profile of other approved EGFR TKIs and chemotherapy. The most common adverse drug reactions (> 20%) in patients treated with osimertinib were diarrhea, rash, dry skin, nail toxicity, and fatigue. Herein, we review the benefit-risk assessment of osimertinib that led to regular approval, for patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR TKI whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy.

Implications For Practice

Osimertinib administered to metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring an EGFR T790M mutation, who have progressed on or following EGFR TKI therapy, demonstrated a substantial improvement over platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as well as durable intracranial responses. The ability to test for the T790M mutation in plasma using the FDA-approved cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) identifies patients with NSCLC tumors not amenable to biopsy. Since a 40% false-negative rate has been observed with the circulating tumor DNA test, re-evaluation of the feasibility of tissue biopsy is recommended to identify patients with a false-negative plasma test result who may benefit from osimertinib.

### Adjuvant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of people with resected stage I to III non-small-cell lung cancer and EGFR mutation [^0c5c1ed1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative adjuvant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor osimertinib is the standard care for stage IB-IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation, following complete tumour resection, with or without prior platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the role of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in this setting is debated, particularly concerning long-term curative effects versus recurrence delay. Uncertainties persist around treatment duration, harms, and effectiveness across disease stages, prior chemotherapy, or EGFR-sensitising mutation types.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and harms of adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in people with resected stage I to III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring an activating EGFR mutation.

Search Methods

We searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) to 9 December 2024, along with conference proceedings (from 2019) and clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting benefits or harms of adjuvant EGFR TKIs in adults with resected stage I-III NSCLC. Trials compared EGFR TKIs with platinum-based chemotherapy, placebo/best supportive care (BSC), or second-and/or third-generation EGFR TKIs versus first- and/or second-generation EGFR TKIs. Participants were adults with histologically confirmed stage I-III NSCLC.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed search results, resolving disagreements with a fourth author. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events (AEs); secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life (HRQoL), relapse risk during drug-off time, and brain relapse risk. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects and fixed-effect models with hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity with the I² statistic.

Main Results

We included nine RCTs involving 2603 participants, and identified six ongoing trials. Five trials compared EGFR TKIs with placebo/BSC, and four compared them with chemotherapy. We found no trials comparing second-and/or third-generation to first- and/or second-generation EGFR TKIs. Six trials had low selection bias risk; most had unclear or high risk for detection or performance bias; and four were high risk for other biases. The certainty of the evidence (GRADE) ranged from moderate to very low, depending on the outcome. First-, second-, and/or third-generation EGFR TKIs versus placebo/BSC EGFR TKIs probably improve overall survival compared to placebo/BSC (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73; 3 studies, 864 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). TKIs may improve disease-free survival compared to placebo/BSC, but the evidence is very uncertain (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.41; 5 studies, 1153 participants). We are uncertain if there is a difference between groups in serious adverse events (≥ grade 3) as the evidence is very uncertain, with wide confidence intervals spanning both potential harm and no effect (RR 2.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 14.37; 4 studies, 1134 participants). Mild-to-moderate adverse events (grades 1 and 2) may be more frequent with EGFR TKIs compared to placebo/BSC, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.29; 4 studies, 1134 participants). One study assessed HRQoL, with no clinically meaningful decline compared to placebo/BSC (592 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). First-, second-, and/or third-generation EGFR TKIs versus chemotherapy Overall survival was similar between EGFR TKIs and chemotherapy (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.18; 4 studies, 878 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). TKIs may have improved disease-free survival compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.83; 4 studies, 878 participants; low-certainty evidence). TKIs may have reduced serious adverse events (≥ grade 3) compared to chemotherapy (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.52; 4 studies, 811 participants; low-certainty evidence). TKIs may have increased mild-to-moderate adverse events (grades 1 and 2) (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.78; 4 studies, 811 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two studies assessed HRQoL, showing no clear difference compared to chemotherapy, as assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung instrument (2 studies, 399 participants) and the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (2 studies, 400 participants), both with moderate-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

Adjuvant EGFR TKIs may improve disease-free survival compared to both placebo/BSC and chemotherapy. There is moderate-certainty evidence that EGFR TKIs increase overall survival compared to placebo/BSC. However, they likely result in little to no difference in overall survival compared to chemotherapy. We could not rule out a potential survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in people with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Approximately 50% of participants experienced relapse or death within one year of stopping TKI therapy, indicating that the disease-free survival benefit may wane after withdrawal. This raises the possibility that prolonged adjuvant TKI therapy could be associated with improved long-term outcomes, although further research is needed to clarify this.

### Rapid guideline update offers key evidence-based recommendations for stage III NSCLC management… [^1a158639]. ASCO Daily News (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points:

- Based on data from the ADAURA trial, the ASCO Expert Panel now recommends offering adjuvant osimertinib after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with resected stage III NSCLC with EGFRexon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation. These trials include the ADAURA trial as well as two trials that have explored the use of PD-L1 receptor immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment of potentially resectable stages I-III NSCLC. 3–6 One of the key updated recommendations by the ASCO Expert Panel was based on recent overall survival data from the phase 3 ADAURA trial. The trial evaluated OS with 3-year adjuvant osimertinib versus placebo in a total of 682 patients with completely resected.

4 Based on data from the ADAURA trial, the ASCO Expert Panel now recommends offering adjuvant osimertinib after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with resected stage III NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation. Based on data from the ADAURA trial, the ASCO Expert Panel now recommends offering adjuvant osimertinib after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with resected stage III NSCLC with. Briefly, the CheckMate-816 and KEYNOTE-671 trials demonstrated benefit with chemoimmunotherapy prior to surgical resection with respect to event-free survival. 5, 6. Remaining Questions Although the updated recommendations represent a culmination of key data from recently published trials, the dynamic nature of clinical research will undoubtedly provide further guideline revisions.

"Over the next several years, we expect to see data around the use of osimertinib in patients with stage III treated non-surgically with chemoradiation with. Also, Dr. Singh suggested that there is a need to identify whether the 3-year adjuvant osimertinib duration is appropriate for all patients. If lesser duration of treatment can suffice for a subgroup of patients, Dr. Singh and the Expert Panel want to know if this would also lead to a reduction in both treatment costs and potential treatment related adverse effects. — Brandon May.

### Induction immune-checkpoint inhibitors for resectable oncogene-mutant NSCLC: a multicenter pooled analysis [^086abfdb]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we found that neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy could be clinically valuable for EGFR -mutant patients and potentially be extended to other rare driver mutations. Considering the underlying influence of tumor heterogeneity to targeted therapy, relatively low pathological response of targeted therapy in neoadjuvant setting and long-term benefit of immunotherapy, we assume front-line use of neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy may provide higher cured potentials and long-term survival benefit. Therefore, we proposed an underlying mode of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in optimizing whole-course treatment for localized oncogene-mutant NSCLC (Supplementary Fig. 3). Indeed, for localized NSCLC, multiplex genotyping is getting increasingly pivotal to guide personalized perioperative treatment. Ongoing trials such as LCMC4 (NCT04712877), NeoADAURA (NCT04351555) and NAUTIKA1 (NCT04302025) trials are evaluating matched neoadjuvant targeted therapies regarding molecular genotyping. However, neither MPR nor pCR which may indicate curative conditions from published prospective trials of neoadjuvant targeted therapy were satisfactory till now. An ongoing phase 2 trial called Neo-DIANA (NCT04512430) would evaluate neoadjuvant atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy and bevacizumab for EGFR -mutated NSCLC. Matched umbrella trials evaluating neoadjuvant targeted therapies should be expected and future trials of combination immunotherapy are warranted to further clarify its clinical significance, identify potential beneficiaries and tailor more optimal treatment modalities for oncogene-mutant localized NSCLC.

Osimertinib after complete resection in EGFR-mutated non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) — In the Wu et al randomized trial of completely resected EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R stage IB–IIIA NSCLC, patients received osimertinib 80 mg once daily for 3 years or placebo; postoperative chemotherapy was allowed (given in 26% and 75% of stage IB and II–IIIA patients, respectively), and the primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) in stage II–IIIA disease. A total of 682 patients were randomly assigned; 60% received adjuvant chemotherapy. At 24 months, 90% on osimertinib (95% CI, 84 to 93) versus 44% on placebo (95% CI, 37 to 51) were alive and disease-free, with HR 0.17 (99.06% CI, 0.11 to 0.26; P < .001). In the stage IB–IIIA population, 89% on osimertinib versus 52% on placebo were alive and disease-free at 24 months (95% CI, 85 to 92 vs 95% CI, 46 to 58), with overall HR 0.20 (99.12% CI, 0.14 to 0.30; P < .001). Overall survival data are immature, and whether there is an overall survival benefit is unknown.

Treatment of patients with NSCLC who have uncommon (non‐ex20ins) kinase domain EGFR mutations

Uncommon EGFR mutations, representing activating mutations of the kinase domain other than L858R, ex19del, and ex20ins, represent a challenge. Taken altogether, uncommon mutations generally exhibit lower response rates and PFS with EGFR TKIs. They represent a very heterogenous group, with variable sensitivity to EGFR TKIs. Because of their rarity, uncommon EGFR mutations were excluded from the ADAURA and NeoADAURA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04351555) trials, resulting in a lack of prospective studies exploring the role of perioperative TKIs for individuals with NSCLC harboring these mutations. In the metastatic setting, few prospective trials have been conducted for uncommon EGFR mutations. A post‐hoc analysis of the LUX‐Lung trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00525148, NCT00949650, and NCT01121393) with afatinib reported a response rate of 71.0% (95% CI, 54.1%–84.6%) and a PFS of 10.7 months (95% CI, 5.6–14.7 months) for all uncommon mutations altogether. The ACHILLES study/Thoracic Oncology Research Group study TORG1834 (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry identifier UMIN031180175) is the only randomized trial specifically evaluating a EGFR TKI versus platinum‐pemetrexed chemotherapy in uncommon EGFR mutations. Patients were randomized to receive either afatinib (n = 73) or chemotherapy (n = 36), and the median PFS was 10.6 months with afatinib versus 5.7 months with chemotherapy (HR, 0.422; 95% CI, 0.256–0.694). The overall response rate was also superior with afatinib, at 61.4% versus 47.1% with chemotherapy. At the time of this writing, OS data had not been reported. Several single‐arm studies have evaluated third‐generation TKIs in this setting, with response rates of 50%–55% and a median PFS of 8.2–9.4 months. The combination of amivantamab plus lazertinib has demonstrated promising activity in uncommon EGFR mutations in the phase 1/1B CHRYSALIS‐2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04077463), with a 55% response rate (95% CI, 40%–69%) in treatment‐naive patients, with median duration of response not estimable (NE; 95% CI, 9.9 months to NE) and a promising median PFS of 19.5 months (95% CI, 11.0 months to NE).

### Osimertinib (Tagrisso) [^019618be]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

A total of 556 patients were randomized to TAGRISSO (n = 279) or to control (gefitinib n = 183; erlotinib n = 94). The median age was 64 years (range 26–93 years); 54% were < 65 years of age; 63% were female; 62% were Asian and 64% were never smokers. Baseline WHO performance status was 0 (41%) or 1 (59%); 5% had Stage IIIb and 95% had Stage IV; and 7% received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. With regard to EGFR tumor testing, 63% were exon 19 deletions and 37% were exon 21 L858R; 5 patients (< 1%) also had a concomitant de novo T790M mutation. EGFR mutation status was confirmed centrally using the cobas®EGFR Mutation Test in 90% of patients. At the time of the final data cut-off, of those randomized to TAGRISSO and to investigator's choice erlotinib or gefitinib arm, 133 (48%) and 180 (65%) patients had received at least one subsequent treatment, respectively. Out of the 180 patients randomized to erlotinib or gefitinib who received subsequent treatment, 85 (47%) patients received TAGRISSO as first subsequent therapy.

FLAURA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to TAGRISSO as compared to erlotinib or gefitinib (see Table 16 and Figure 4). The final analysis of overall survival demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients randomized to TAGRISSO compared to erlotinib or gefitinib (see Table 17 and Figure 5).

### Molecular residual disease analysis of adjuvant osimertinib in resected EGFR-mutated stage IB-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer [^e54c1861]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

In ADAURA, a DFS and MRD event-free status was maintained for most (75%, 84 of 112) patients during adjuvant osimertinib treatment and posttreatment follow-up. Most DFS or MRD events occurred after osimertinib treatment discontinuation or completion (68%, 19 of 28) and within 12 months after osimertinib (58%, 11 of 19). Furthermore, the DFS and MRD event-free rate was high (66%) 24 months after completion or discontinuation of osimertinib treatment; this suggests that osimertinib can reduce or eradicate the micrometastatic component of the disease in some patients, leading to long-term benefit that persists after completion of adjuvant therapy. Longer follow-up is required to adequately assess this hypothesis. We can also hypothesize that, in the ADAURA setting, a subset of patients at risk of recurrence posttreatment completion may benefit from adjuvant treatment beyond 36 months or from treatment intensification via combination strategies. MRD monitoring may provide a powerful tool to personalize the use of postadjuvant treatment, although this requires prospective studies to fully elucidate the risk–benefit of such an approach.

In this analysis, only a small proportion (8%) of patients had detected MRD at randomization and this is consistent with a previous study in nonbiomarker-selected patients with early-stage NSCLC. Although patients with detected MRD at randomization are likely to represent a high-risk subset with a poor prognosis, those who received adjuvant osimertinib had a greater rate of MRD clearance and a longer DFS compared with patients who received placebo. The large clinical benefit of adjuvant osimertinib demonstrated in ADAURA, combined with the relatively low rate of MRD detected at randomization samples and frequent occurrence (49%) of MRD in the placebo group, suggest that adjuvant osimertinib should not be limited to patients with detected MRD postoperatively. Additionally, an MRD event-free status was maintained for most patients during osimertinib treatment (87%, 97 of 112), with most MRD events occurring after stopping or completing treatment (67%, 10 of 15). Continued monitoring for detected MRD in the postadjuvant treatment follow-up period may identify a high-risk subset of patients who may benefit from further treatment. Although current MRD technologies are not sensitive enough to determine which patients with EGFRm NSCLC are disease-free postsurgery, continued undetected MRD status may represent a population for whom disease has been eradicated and no further treatment is necessary.

### Osimertinib with or without chemotherapy in-mutated advanced NSCLC [^4666c11d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that is selective for EGFR-TKI-sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. Evidence suggests that the addition of chemotherapy may extend the benefits of EGFR-TKI therapy.

Methods

In this phase 3, international, open-label trial, we randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio patients with EGFR -mutated (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not previously received treatment for advanced disease to receive osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with chemotherapy (pemetrexed [500 mg per square meter of body-surface area] plus either cisplatin [75 mg per square meter] or carboplatin [pharmacologically guided dose]) or to receive osimertinib monotherapy (80 mg once daily). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Response and safety were also assessed.

Results

A total of 557 patients underwent randomization. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly longer in the osimertinib-chemotherapy group than in the osimertinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 0.79; P < 0.001). At 24 months, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) of the patients in the osimertinib-chemotherapy group and 41% (95% CI, 35 to 47) of those in the osimertinib group were alive and progression-free. Progression-free survival as assessed according to blinded independent central review was consistent with the primary analysis (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.80). An objective (complete or partial) response was observed in 83% of the patients in the osimertinib-chemotherapy group and in 76% of those in the osimertinib group; the median response duration was 24.0 months (95% CI, 20.9 to 27.8) and 15.3 months (95% CI, 12.7 to 19.4), respectively. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events from any cause was higher with the combination than with monotherapy - a finding driven by known chemotherapy-related adverse events. The safety profile of osimertinib plus pemetrexed and a platinum-based agent was consistent with the established profiles of the individual agents.

Conclusions

First-line treatment with osimertinib-chemotherapy led to significantly longer progression-free survival than osimertinib monotherapy among patients with EGFR -mutated advanced NSCLC. (Funded by AstraZeneca; FLAURA2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04035486.).

Targeted therapy and biomarker testing in the neoadjuvant setting — As such, the use of targeted therapy in the neoadjuvant space is recommended only in the setting of a clinical trial. It is recommended that patients being evaluated for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and ICI be tested for EGFR and ALK alterations, and those found to have targetable alterations known to derive limited benefit from ICI should not be offered ICI in the neoadjuvant setting; this reflects that patients with EGFR or ALK alterations derive limited benefit from ICI and that administration of ICI can compromise subsequent response and cause increased adverse events upon administration of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

14.1 Adjuvant Treatment of Early-Stage EGFR Mutation-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

The efficacy of TAGRISSO was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ADAURA [NCT02511106]) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive NSCLC who had complete tumor resection, with or without prior adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients with resectable tumors (stage IB – IIIA according to American Joint Commission on Cancer [AJCC] 7thedition) were required to have predominantly non-squamous histology and EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations identified prospectively from tumor tissue in a central laboratory by the cobas®EGFR Mutation Test. Patients with clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease, prior history of ILD/pneumonitis, or who received treatment with any EGFR kinase inhibitor were not eligible for the study.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily or placebo following recovery from surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy if given. Patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized within 10 weeks and patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized within 26 weeks following surgery. Randomization was stratified by mutation type (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations), race (Asian or non-Asian) and pTNM staging (IB or II or IIIA) according to AJCC 7thedition. Treatment was given for 3 years or until disease recurrence, or unacceptable toxicity.

### Adjuvant treatments for surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations: a review [^f37cd02a]. JAMA Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The use of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage IB-IIIA resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has limited benefit for improving cure rates. The proportion of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations among patients with resected NSCLC is comparable to that observed in patients with advanced disease, and the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been demonstrated to prolong disease-free survival (DFS). With recent approval of osimertinib in this context, a focus on the rapidly evolving scenario and future perspective in clinical practice is needed and was the aim of the current review.

Observations

Randomized phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated DFS benefit with adjuvant EGFR TKI therapy in patients with resected EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The most recent trial (ADAURA) assessed 3-year adjuvant osimertinib and showed consistent DFS benefit and a significant role of the intervention in preventing the occurrence of brain metastasis. However, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy, the appropriate duration of treatment, the management of disease relapse, and the effective cure rate remain undetermined. A deeper investigation on molecular biomarkers, covariant patterns, and dynamic monitoring of postsurgical circulating DNA would be helpful for the implementation of future strategies to further improve survival rates after adjuvant therapy for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.

Conclusions and Relevance

Adjuvant osimertinib revolutionized the treatment algorithm for patients with stage IB-IIIA resected EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Further evidence driven by clinical issues will be key for further optimization of the goals of adjuvant treatment in these patients.

Metastatic recurrence during or after adjuvant osimertinib

Recurrence occurring during adjuvant osimertinib will often indicate resistance to osimertinib, whereas recurrence after the end of adjuvant treatment can indicate either resistance or disease flare after cessation of therapy. In all patients, a new biopsy, if feasible, is recommended to evaluate resistance mechanisms to osimertinib. The management of these patients depends on the timing of the recurrence regarding adjuvant treatment, the site and extent of recurrence, and the presence or not of resistance mechanisms. For recurrence occurring after adjuvant osimertinib, without a resistance mechanism on re‐biopsy, we would consider osimertinib rechallenge as a potential option (see Management of patients with metastatic EGFR‐mutant NSCLC, below), although there are no prospective studies supporting this approach. Patients who develop disease recurrence while on adjuvant osimertinib will usually be managed the same as those who have disease progression in the metastatic setting, except in special circumstances, such as oligoprogression amenable to local ablative therapy, in which osimertinib continuation could be considered (see Treatment options at progression after EGFR TKI, below).

Pathologic tumor responses

In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population of 22 patients in the Nivo+CT arm, MPR occurred in seven patients (32.1%, 7/22, 80% confidence interval (CI) 18.7–43.1%, P = 0.036 for the statistical test against the assumed historical control of 15%), and this arm met the prespecified boundary of six responses to be considered efficacious; pCR occurred in four patients (18.2%, 4/22, 95% CI 5.2–40.3%) (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). All 22 treated patients underwent surgery on trial, and the median percentage of viable tumor was 50.5% (range 0–95.5%; Fig. 2b). In the ITT population of 22 patients in the Ipi+Nivo+CT arm, MPR occurred in 11 patients (50%, 11/22, 80% CI 34.6–61.1%, P = 0.00012 for the statistical test against the assumed historical control of 15%), also meeting the prespecified boundary of six responses to be considered efficacious; pCR occurred in four patients (18.2%, 4/22, 95% CI 5.2–40.3%) (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). Twenty patients (91%) underwent surgery on trial, and the median percentage of viable tumor was 4.5% (range 0–94.4%; Fig. 2b). In 20 resected patients, the MPR and pCR rates were 55% and 20%, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). The association between the treatment arm and MPR in subgroups of interest was explored (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Among the patients with stage IIIA disease, the odds of having MPR were 16.0 (95% CI 1.54–166) times higher in the Ipi+Nivo+CT arm than in the Nivo+CT arm. Similar results were obtained when analyses were performed in the population without known tumor EGFR/ALK alterations (Extended Data Fig. 2b). In both arms combined, the odds of having MPR among the former/current smokers was 23.6 (95% CI 1.11–498) times higher than among never smokers, and the odds of having MPR among patients with squamous histology was 9.60 (95% CI 1.73–53.4) times higher than among patients with non-squamous histologies (Supplementary Table 4).

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study agree with previous research findings that recurrence rates in early-stage EGFR-positive NSCLC are high, including stage IA, yet a significant number of patients remain disease-free at 5-years without osimertinib. Prospective studies are needed to validate our risk estimation model incorporating both clinical and molecular features, with the aim of identifying patients who will benefit from adjuvant osimertinib and distinguish them from those who are cured without adjuvant treatment. Identifying individualized risk features can facilitate tailored surveillance and adjuvant treatment strategies for early-stage EGFR-positive NSCLC.

Postoperative systemic therapy updates — adjuvant pembrolizumab and osimertinib after complete resection: For the 2023 update (Version 2), the panel added a recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab for eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage IIB to IIIA, stage IIIB (only T3, N2), or high-risk stage IIA NSCLC who are negative for EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, or ALK fusions and who have previously received adjuvant chemotherapy, noting that the benefit of adjuvant pembrolizumab is unclear for patients with PD-L1 levels less than 1%. The panel also expanded the molecular testing criteria to include ALK rearrangements because patients with completely resected (R0) NSCLC who have ALK rearrangements, EGFR exon 19 deletions, or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations have less benefit from ICIs. Single-agent therapy with osimertinib is recommended for eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage IB–IIIA or stage IIIB (T3, N2) NSCLC if patients have EGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, regardless of PD-L1 levels.

### Neoadjuvant targeted therapy in resectable NSCLC: current and future perspectives [^848e524f]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Surgery plus (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy or rarely neoadjuvant chemoradiation for patients with early-stage, resectable NSCLC is associated with unacceptable rates of recurrence and poor survival. Given the survival benefits of TT in the advanced disease setting, these agents are now being investigated in patients with eNSCLC. Results from ongoing clinical trials indicate that neoadjuvant TTs are likely to be effective and improve outcomes in patients with EGFR - and ALK -positive eNSCLC. Additional data from ongoing trials are highly anticipated and will indicate whether neoadjuvant targeted treatments are feasible for patients with eNSCLC with different oncogenic driver mutations.

As the field moves towards using TTs for eNSCLC, it is essential that molecular testing and biomarker screening at diagnosis are integrated into clinical practice to optimize treatment options and clinical outcomes. The need for unified and robust surrogate markers that may expedite the approval of TTs remains a challenge. Building on the demonstrated efficacy of TTs in the aNSCLC setting and promising preliminary clinical trial results, neoadjuvant TT is expected to improve outcomes of patients with eNSCLC with oncogenic drivers and transform the early-stage treatment landscape.

Adjuvant atezolizumab — patient selection after resection and platinum chemotherapy in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is detailed as follows: There was no difference in overall survival (OS) in the intention‑to‑treat population (HR, 1.07; CI, 0.80–1.42), and the drug is not approved for stage IB. Patients with nonsquamous histology and PD‑L1 ≥ 1% appeared to derive benefit (HR, 0.60; CI, 0.42–0.84), whereas the squamous cell carcinoma PD‑L1 ≥ 1% subgroup was not significant. Patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements did not show a statistical benefit, and given adjuvant osimertinib availability, the document states "we do not recommend adjuvant atezolizumab for patients whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations". For resected stage II–IIIA NSCLC with PD‑L1 expression ≥ 50%, "we recommend strong consideration of atezolizumab as adjuvant treatment following platinum-based chemotherapy", and for PD‑L1 1% to 49%, "atezolizumab may be considered as an adjuvant treatment following platinum-based chemotherapy". Adjuvant atezolizumab was well tolerated without new safety concerns.
