## Question

How wpuld you work up shortness of breath with high suspicion for PE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to work up shortness of breath with high suspicion for pulmonary embolism, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and hemodynamic assessment. Then, I should verify pretest probability using validated tools. Next, I will consider the low, intermediate, and high pretest probability branches, including PERC, D-dimer with age-adjustment, and imaging. After that, I need to check special populations and pitfalls. Finally, I will review documentation, communication, and follow-up to close the loop safely.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and oxygenation, because hemodynamic instability changes everything in suspected PE. I need to ensure the patient is stable before committing to a stepwise diagnostic algorithm; if unstable, I should not delay imaging or empiric therapy while waiting for labs, and bedside echocardiography or emergent CTPA may be indicated depending on availability and clinical context [^111m2sux] [^112ymNHB].

> Wait, let me verify the pretest probability step before ordering any tests, because every downstream decision hinges on it. I should use a validated tool such as Wells or revised Geneva, or structured gestalt, to classify risk as low, intermediate, or high; this stratification is foundational to evidence-based diagnostic pathways endorsed by ACP and ESC guidance [^113nGpw9] [^115qBoz5] [^113ShcWT] [^112LkK69].

> For low pretest probability, I need to check whether the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria can safely end the workup. If all eight PERC are met, the post-test probability is about 0.3% and no further testing is recommended; if PERC is not fully negative, I should obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer and apply age-adjusted thresholds in patients older than 50 years to decide on imaging, which reduces unnecessary CT while maintaining safety [^117URCzd] [^114fWovk] [^114q8N2s] [^1163JJ7h].

> Hold on, I should verify the D-dimer strategy in intermediate probability because false reassurance is dangerous. A normal D-dimer using a high-sensitivity assay excludes PE in this group, but an elevated D-dimer should trigger imaging; age-adjusted cutoffs markedly improve specificity without sacrificing sensitivity, which is precisely where over-imaging occurs in older adults [^116x4kmB] [^114q8N2s] [^1163JJ7h].

> For high pretest probability, I need to ensure I do not delay definitive imaging or empiric therapy. CTPA is first-line when available and not contraindicated; if contrast is unsafe or unavailable, a V/Q scan is reasonable, and if neither is feasible, bedside echocardiography or lower-extremity ultrasound can substitute diagnostically when proximal DVT is found, since treatment is the same and this avoids pulmonary imaging risks [^114MVN56] [^112ymNHB] [^113vNAQD].

> But wait, what if the patient is unstable or the CT is nondiagnostic? I should double-check that bedside echocardiography can identify right ventricular dysfunction suggestive of high-risk PE and guide urgency, while recognizing that a normal echo does not exclude PE; in such cases, empiric anticoagulation may be warranted while arranging definitive imaging or considering thrombolysis if shock is present [^111m2sux] [^112ymNHB].

> I will now examine special populations and common pitfalls so I do not misapply rules. In pregnancy, I should avoid radiation when possible and favor V/Q scanning or leg ultrasound; in renal failure, I need to balance contrast nephropathy risk against diagnostic yield; in COPD or other lung disease, V/Q may be less specific, so CTPA is often preferred; in pediatrics, adult tools are less validated, so clinician gestalt plus D-dimer and imaging remain pragmatic; and in COVID-19, thrombotic risk is elevated, so a lower threshold for imaging is reasonable when suspicion is high [^115cfMiL] [^112ymNHB] [^111qTkph] [^116qZr7c].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to apply PERC broadly, but I should confirm its intended use. PERC is for low pretest probability only; applying it to intermediate or high risk increases miss rates, so I must not overextend it beyond the validated low-risk population, even though some studies explored broader use with mixed results [^117URCzd] [^11234jpu].

> Next, I should review documentation and communication because shared decision-making improves appropriateness and satisfaction. I need to record the pretest probability, the decision rule used, why PERC or D-dimer was or was not applied, and the imaging rationale; I should also counsel on radiation, contrast, and overdiagnosis risks, and provide return precautions if PE is excluded without imaging, aligning with best-practice advice on patient engagement and stewardship [^113j6V7p] [^111VGK8y] [^115xQJ3G].

> Let me reconsider the follow-up plan to ensure safety if PE is excluded noninvasively. If low or intermediate probability patients are discharged after PERC or negative D-dimer, I should arrange timely reassessment and clear instructions to return for worsening dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or leg swelling; this mirrors validated strategies in primary care and emergency settings that safely avoid imaging in appropriately selected patients [^1177PkKx] [^114fWovk].

> Finally, I should confirm that my approach aligns with contemporary guidance emphasizing pretest probability, selective D-dimer use, and judicious imaging to minimize harms while avoiding missed diagnoses. The ACP, ESC, and chest pain guidelines converge on these principles, and adherence reduces unnecessary CT, contrast exposure, and overdiagnosis without compromising safety when applied rigorously [^11693TVn] [^113e1XSR] [^112RC4or].

For shortness of breath with high suspicion of PE, **immediate CTPA is the first-line test** [^114MVN56] [^113ioWLG] to confirm or exclude PE, with **no role for D-dimer** in this context [^117Kqscd]. If CTPA is contraindicated, use a **V/Q scan or lower-extremity ultrasound** [^113vNAQD] [^112ymNHB]. Start **empiric anticoagulation** if imaging is delayed or the patient is unstable [^112ymNHB]. Use **Wells or Geneva** to structure pretest probability, but do not delay imaging when suspicion is high [^113nGpw9] [^115qBoz5]. This approach balances diagnostic accuracy with the risks of radiation, contrast, and overdiagnosis [^112cyc5R] [^115xQJ3G].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

Use **Wells or Geneva** to structure pretest probability, but do not delay imaging when suspicion is high [^115xQJ3G] [^112ymNHB]. In high-risk patients, **skip D-dimer** because a normal result does not exclude PE [^117Kqscd].

---

## Initial diagnostic testing

### High-sensitivity D-dimer assay

- **Indication**: Low or intermediate pretest probability [^112UjLr8].
- **Threshold**: Age-adjusted cutoff (age × 10 ng/mL) for patients > 50 years [^114ZGKy6] [^1163JJ7h].
- **Interpretation**: Negative result excludes PE; positive result prompts imaging [^116gCFFG].

---

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)

- **First-line**: High sensitivity/specificity; rapid; detects alternative diagnoses [^115771Z4] [^112xxCeW].
- **Limitations**: Radiation, contrast risks, overdiagnosis of subsegmental PE [^112cyc5R] [^115xQJ3G].
- **Contraindications**: Severe renal impairment, contrast allergy, pregnancy [^114ZHCnB].

---

### Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan

Reserve the **V/Q scan** for when CTPA is contraindicated or unavailable [^114MVN56]; it is less sensitive but avoids contrast [^115771Z4].

---

### Lower extremity venous ultrasound

Use **lower-extremity venous ultrasound** when DVT symptoms are present or CTPA is contraindicated; a proximal DVT confirms VTE and guides treatment [^113vNAQD] [^112ymNHB].

---

## Diagnostic algorithm based on pretest probability

| **Pretest probability** | **Initial test** | **Next step if positive** |
|-|-|-|
| Low | D-dimer | CTPA or V/Q scan |
| Intermediate | D-dimer | CTPA or V/Q scan |
| High | CTPA | Immediate imaging |

---

## Empiric anticoagulation

Start **empiric anticoagulation** if imaging is delayed or the patient is unstable; use LMWH, fondaparinux, or DOACs [^116Sn1TG] [^116wmKo1].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Use V/Q scan or CTPA with shielding; avoid radiation when possible [^114ZHCnB].
- **Renal impairment**: Prefer V/Q scan or ultrasound; avoid contrast [^114ZHCnB].
- **Contrast allergy**: Use V/Q scan or ultrasound [^114ZHCnB].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **High suspicion**: Immediate CTPA; no D-dimer [^114MVN56] [^117Kqscd].
- **Low/intermediate**: Use D-dimer with age-adjusted cutoff; positive results need imaging [^114ZGKy6] [^112UjLr8].
- **Contraindications**: Use V/Q scan or ultrasound [^114MVN56].
- **Empiric anticoagulation**: Start if imaging is delayed or the patient is unstable [^112ymNHB].

---

A structured approach using **CTPA first-line** for high suspicion, with D-dimer reserved for low/intermediate risk, ensures accurate, timely diagnosis while minimizing harm [^114MVN56] [^1179BewV].

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

Importance

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by occlusion of blood flow in a pulmonary artery, typically due to a thrombus that travels from a vein in a lower limb. The incidence of PE is approximately 60 to 120 per 100 000 people per year. Approximately 60 000 to 100 000 patients die from PE each year in the US.

Observations

PE should be considered in patients presenting with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope. The diagnosis is determined by chest imaging. In patients with a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, the following 3 steps can be used to evaluate a patient with possible PE: assessment of the clinical probability of PE, D-dimer testing if indicated, and chest imaging if indicated. The clinical probability of PE can be assessed using a structured score or using clinical gestalt. In patients with a probability of PE that is less than 15%, the presence of 8 clinical characteristics (age < 50 years, heart rate < 100/min, an oxygen saturation level of > 94%, no recent surgery or trauma, no prior venous thromboembolism event, no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, and no estrogen use) identifies patients at very low risk of PE in whom no further testing is needed. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a D-dimer level of less than 500 ng/mL is associated with a posttest probability of PE less than 1.85%. In these patients, PE can be excluded without chest imaging. A further refinement of D-dimer threshold is possible in patients aged 50 years and older, and in patients with a low likelihood of PE. Patients with a high probability of PE (ie, > 40% probability) should undergo chest imaging, and D-dimer testing is not necessary. In patients with PE and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, compared with heparin combined with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin followed by warfarin alone, direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, are noninferior for treating PE and have a 0.6% lower rate of bleeding. In patients with PE and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg, systemic thrombolysis is recommended and is associated with an 1.6% absolute reduction of mortality (from 3.9% to 2.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 patients per year and may cause approximately 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. First-line therapy consists of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, with thrombolysis reserved for patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg.

In a meta-analysis of 12 studies, which included 14 844 patients, the PERC were found to have a sensitivity of 97%. The PERC should not be used in patients with intermediate pretest probability.

Acute pulmonary embolism — talking points for clinicians to use with patients during PE evaluation: Imaging has risks. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria exclude PE in patients with low pretest probability. D-dimer testing excludes PE in patients at low pretest probability who do not meet the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria or patients at intermediate pretest probability. Alternative diagnostic strategies exist for patients who cannot have CT.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — high pretest probability: For patients with high pretest probability of PE according to either clinician gestalt or a clinical prediction tool, imaging studies should be performed. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method of diagnosis when it is available and there is no contraindication to radiographic contrast dye. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning should be used when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. Of note, a D-dimer assay should not be obtained in patients with a high pretest probability of PE because a negative value will not obviate the need for imaging.

The clinical calculator "Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism" for pulmonary embolism.

The Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is a clinical prediction rule that stratifies patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) into different risk categories. It is used in the emergency department or outpatient setting to determine the likelihood of PE in patients presenting with symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained cough.

The Wells' Criteria includes factors such as clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), an alternative diagnosis less likely than a PE, heart rate over 100 beats per minute, immobilization or surgery in the previous four weeks, previous history of DVT or PE, hemoptysis, and malignancy.

The score helps clinicians decide whether to proceed with further diagnostic testing, such as D-dimer testing or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Patients are classified as having a low, moderate, or high probability of PE based on their total score.

The Wells' Criteria should not be used in patients with a clear alternative diagnosis, or in patients who have been on full anticoagulation for more than 48 hours. It is also not applicable in pregnant patients or in patients under the age of 18.

The Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism calculator assesses the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism based on seven input factors, each contributing a specific score, which when summed, categorizes the risk level. These factors are: clinical signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis, previous history of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis, heart rate over 100 beats per minute, immobilization for 3 or more days or recent surgery within the past 4 weeks, if pulmonary embolism is as likely as or more likely than an alternative diagnosis, hemoptysis, and cancer or recent end of cancer treatment.

The inputs are boolean (yes/no) values for each criterion which correspond to predetermined scores:

| **Factor** | **Score** |
|-|-|
| Clinical signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis | 3 |
| Previous, objectively diagnosed pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis | 1.5 |
| Heart rate > 100 | 1.5 |
| Immobilization ≥ 3 days or surgery in the previous 4 weeks | 1.5 |
| Pulmonary embolism as likely as or more likely than an alternative diagnosis | 3 |
| Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) | 1 |
| Cancer/palliative care/stopped treatment of cancer within 6 months | 1 |

To calculate the total score, assess each input factor: if the input is true (yes), add its corresponding score to the total; if false (no), add zero. The sum of these scores determines the risk interpretation:

- A total score of 2 or less implies a low risk of pulmonary embolism with a probability of 1.3%.
- A score between 2.5 and 6 suggests a moderate risk with a probability of 16.2%.
- A score greater than 6 indicates a high risk with a probability of 40.6%.

The outputs of this calculator include both the numerical score and its interpretation, providing an analysis of the risk level for pulmonary embolism based on the users' inputs. The systematic consideration of clinically relevant symptoms and history enhances the accuracy of predicting pulmonary embolism risk.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^114ZHCnB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the lack of clinical diagnostic criteria and imperfect investigations. The presenting symptoms are common and non-specific varying from chest pain, shortness of breath, cough and haemoptysis, to syncope and cardiac arrest. There is a high false positive rate with non-invasive testing (d-dimer) but relatively significant potential adverse events (radiation and contrast associated complications) with more invasive testing such as Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA).

Various scoring systems exist in an attempt to limit unnecessary imaging for those identified as having a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism without increasing the risk of missing the potentially life threatening diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Using a combination of the Wells score and either a d-dimer (if PERC positive) or no testing (if PERC negative) can reduce the need for imaging. These scoring systems are particularly useful for junior doctors who may lack clinical experience. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) has been validated for use within the emergency department. Within the emergency departments in which this project was undertaken there were no specific guidelines that junior doctors were required to follow although discussion with senior clinicians prior to requesting a d-dimer or imaging was encouraged.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines describe proposed best standards that should be met when considering the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism which involves appropriate use of the Wells scoring system.

Below is a summary of these guidelines:

Patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism should all have an assessment of their general medical history, a physical examination, and a chest X-ray. All patients with suspected pulmonary embolism should have their probability of pulmonary embolism assessed using the two-level Pulmonary Embolism Wells score.

Patients with a likely two-level Wells score should NOT have a d-dimer and be offered CTPA with the exception of patients with contrast allergy, renal impairment, or in whom risk of irradiation is high who should instead be offered a Ventilation Perfusion (V/Q) scan. All patients not able to have immediate imaging should have interim parenteral anticoagulant therapy.

### Sixteen-year-old athlete with chest pain and shortness of breath due to pulmonary emboli [^111qTkph]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that is extremely uncommon in the healthy pediatric population.

Objective

Because pediatric PE is rarely on the Emergency Physician's differential diagnosis, with this case we hope to increase the clinical suspicion for PE in children who present to the Emergency Department (ED).

Case Report

This is a case of bilateral pulmonary embolism in a 16-year-old basketball player whose only risk factor is oral contraceptive medication. Initial vital signs demonstrated a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), blood pressure 124/74 mm Hg, heart rate 74 beats/min, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Subsequent vital signs, physical examination, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and laboratory assessments were all within normal limits. Using clinician gestalt in combination with the patient's Wells score of 0, a D-dimer was obtained and returned at 1916 ng/mL. The computed tomography scan with PE protocol detected a total of seven pulmonary emboli bilaterally. The patient was anticoagulated with Lovenox (Sanofi US, Bridgewater, NJ) in the ED and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Complete thrombophilia work-up was negative. The patient was discharged with Lovenox and was transitioned to warfarin.

Conclusions

Emergency Physicians may be inclined to discharge a pediatric patient at low pre-test probability for PE with outpatient follow-up if the work-up is non-contributory. But the current adult PE clinical criteria are not as sensitive or specific in the pediatric population. This case demonstrates that the clinician's gestalt should play a major role in combination with the Wells score and PERC (pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria) rule to exclude PE until clinical decision rules specific for the pediatric population are established.

### Comparison of the wells score with the revised Geneva score for assessing suspected pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112NGpYF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Revised Geneva score for pulmonary embolism" for pulmonary embolism.

The Revised Geneva Score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients. This scoring system is used in the adult population presenting with symptoms suggestive of PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained cough.

The Revised Geneva Score is particularly useful in the emergency department or outpatient settings where PE is suspected. It helps clinicians decide whether further diagnostic testing (like CT pulmonary angiography) is needed. The score is based on various factors including age, previous history of DVT or PE, recent surgery or fracture, active malignancy, unilateral lower limb pain, hemoptysis, heart rate, and pain on lower limb deep venous palpation and unilateral edema.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that this score is less accurate in patients with certain conditions that can mimic the symptoms of PE, such as heart failure or pneumonia. It is also less reliable in pregnant women due to physiological changes that can affect the score parameters.

The Revised Geneva score for pulmonary embolism calculator evaluates eight inputs related to a patient's clinical history and symptoms, assigning a numerical score to each based on predefined criteria. The inputs include age, past medical history, recent surgeries, presence of malignancy, specific pain symptoms, hemoptysis, heart rate, and findings on limb examination. Each potential response to these inputs is assigned a score depending on its relevance to pulmonary embolism risk.

The scoring system is as follows:

- **Age > 65 years**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Previous DVT or PE**: Yes = 3, No = 0
- **Surgery or fracture within 1 month**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Active malignant condition**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Unilateral lower limb pain**: Yes = 3, No = 0
- **Hemoptysis**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Heart rate**: < 75 = 0, 75–94 = 3, ≥ 95 = 5
- **Pain on lower limb palpation and unilateral edema**: Yes = 4, No = 0

The calculator processes these inputs by summing the assigned scores, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 22. This total score is then used to interpret the risk of pulmonary embolism:

- A score of 3 or less indicates a 4–20% risk of pulmonary embolism.
- A score between 4 and 10 suggests a 25–40% risk.
- A score greater than 10 indicates a substantial risk, ranging from 50–91%.

### The influence of the availability heuristic on physicians in the emergency department [^111E6Kqg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Heuristics, or rules of thumb, are hypothesized to influence the care physicians deliver. One such heuristic is the availability heuristic, under which assessments of an event's likelihood are affected by how easily the event comes to mind. We examined whether the availability heuristic influences physician testing in a common, high-risk clinical scenario: assessing patients with shortness of breath for the risk of pulmonary embolism.

Methods

We performed an event study from 2011 to 2018 of emergency physicians caring for patients presenting with shortness of breath to 104 Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. Our measures were physician rates of pulmonary embolism testing (D-dimer and/or computed tomography scan) for subsequent patients after having a patient visit with a pulmonary embolism discharge diagnosis, hypothesizing that physician rates of pulmonary embolism testing would increase after having a recent patient visit with a pulmonary embolism diagnosis due to the availability heuristic.

Results

The sample included 7,370 emergency physicians who had 416,720 patient visits for shortness of breath. The mean rate of pulmonary embolism testing was 9.0%. For physicians who had a recent patient visit with a pulmonary embolism diagnosis, their rate of pulmonary embolism testing for subsequent patients increased by 1.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval 0.42 to 2.34) in the 10 days after, which is approximately 15% relative to the mean rate of pulmonary embolism testing. We failed to find statistically significant changes in rates of pulmonary embolism testing in the subsequent 50 days following these first 10 days.

Conclusion

After having a recent patient visit with a pulmonary embolism diagnosis, physicians increase their rates of pulmonary embolism testing for subsequent patients, but this increase does not persist. These results provide large-scale evidence that the availability heuristic may play a role in complex testing decisions.

This first of two practice reviews addresses pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis considering important aspects of PE clinical presentation and comparing evidence-based PE testing strategies. A companion paper addresses the management of PE. Symptoms and signs of PE are varied, and emergency physicians frequently use testing to 'rule out' the diagnosis in people with respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. The emergency clinician must balance the benefit of reassuring negative PE testing with the risks of iatrogenic harms from over investigation and overdiagnosis.

Pulmonary embolism imaging — Table 2 suggestions for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) specify the following actions using computed tomography (CT) and alternative tests. Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE", with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". Defer CT until after d-dimer result for "Intermediate pretest probability" or "Low pretest probability and PERC > 0", supported by "Low incidence of PE (< 1.1%) if d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0", given an "Incidence of PE < 1%". For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography", because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast". A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required".

Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

### Safe exclusion of pulmonary embolism using the wells rule and qualitative D-dimer testing in primary care: prospective cohort study [^1177PkKx]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

For many doctors, patients with unexplained shortness of breath or pleuritic chest pain pose a diagnostic dilemma. In particular doctors in primary care, who in many countries are the first to be consulted when patients have these symptoms, have to differentiate between common self limiting diseases, such as myalgia or respiratory tract infections, and the rarer life threatening diseases such as pulmonary embolism. As the symptoms of pulmonary embolism may be relatively mild, it can be easily missed, and because pulmonary embolism has a high mortality doctors do not always get another chance if it is misdiagnosed. As a result, most doctors in primary care have a low threshold for referring patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and only 10–15% of referred patients are actually diagnosed as having the condition.

To stratify patients with suspected pulmonary embolism between a high probability (need for referral) of having the condition compared with a low probability, clinical decision rules (combining the different characteristics of patients and the disease into a score) have been developed. The clinical decision rule developed by Wells and colleagues is the most widely known, validated, and implemented tool for the detection of pulmonary embolism in secondary care. The Wells clinical decision rule combines seven items into a score ranging from 0 to 12.5. Based on many studies in secondary care, a threshold of < 2 or ≤ 4 was introduced into the rule. Below these levels patients are classified, respectively, as being at very low risk or low risk of having pulmonary embolism. A large diagnostic management study in secondary care concluded that a negative laboratory based quantitative D-dimer (degradation product of fibrin) test result in patients with a Wells score of ≤ 4 safely excluded pulmonary embolism without the need for additional investigations by imaging.

Such a diagnostic strategy seems ideal in primary care to facilitate decisions on referral to secondary care, in particular since easy to use point of care D-dimer tests providing results within minutes are available for use at the doctor's practice or in the patient's home. Before such a diagnostic strategy can be implemented, however, it needs to be validated in the proper setting of primary care. Owing to differences in the spectrum of disease, symptoms, and doctors' experience, encouraging results from referral centres may not be readily applicable in primary care.

We carried out a formal external validation of the Wells pulmonary embolism rule combined with a point of care qualitative D-Dimer test to evaluate the safety and efficiency of using this clinical decision rule in primary care.

### Emergency department management of pulmonary embolism [^116Sn1TG]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

There are several points that bear repetition. First, consider the diagnosis of PE in all patients presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, oxygen desaturation, or unexplained hypotension. Evaluate these patients in a rational manner. At any individual hospital, develop algorithms with consultants so that when one is faced with a patient with a PE, the flow of both diagnostics and therapeutics flows smoothly and rapidly. Consider the concept of risk stratification, and remember that not all patients with PE are created equal. In particular, be on the same page with all consultants regarding the use of right heart echocardiography, both for its potential diagnostic capabilities and for its ability to identify patients who could be at greater risk for bad outcomes.

### Pulmonary embolism: making sense of the diagnostic evaluation [^111c6F2c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the publication of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis in 1990, the diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary embolism continues to be approached in an inconsistent fashion. The reasons for this are unclear but likely have to do with inadequate methods for predicting pretest probability of disease and the inconvenience and perceived risk of pulmonary angiography. Because pulmonary embolism and its treatment carry substantial risk of morbidity and mortality, a consistent approach to evaluation is desirable. This article reviews large, prospective studies that suggest that it may be unnecessary to diagnose pulmonary embolism with the certainty that pulmonary angiography allows. Finally, the article proposes an algorithm that may be acceptable to patients and clinicians alike if safety is confirmed in future prospective studies.

### Emergency evaluation for pulmonary embolism, part 1: clinical factors that increase risk [^113wQsRn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal, but profligate testing for PE can harm patients.

Objectives

With consideration of potential medicolegal implications, this two-part review provides current evidence about the care of patients with suspected and diagnosed PE in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Discussion

In part 1, we review published evidence to describe the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of PE in the ED setting. Older age, surgery requiring endotracheal intubation within the past 30 days, new use of oral contraceptives, and prior unprovoked venous thromboembolism in nonanticoagulated patients are clear risk factors for PE in ED patients. Recent history of unexplained dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis increase probability, but the effect of syncope is less clear. Treated and inactive cancer, smoking, obesity, and pregnancy have not been found to increase the probability of PE in symptomatic ED patients. Unexplained dyspnea, tachycardia, and a low pulse oximetry reading increase probability of PE. Finding of wheezing on lung auscultation reduces the probability of PE, and findings that suggest deep venous thrombosis increase the probability of PE.

Conclusions

Understanding of risk factors, historical data, and physical findings that have been found to increase or decrease the probability of PE in symptomatic ED patients can help create rational guidelines for the diagnostic approach to PE.

### Trends in imaging for suspected pulmonary embolism across US health care systems, 2004 to 2016 [^112cyc5R]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism is a common and potentially fatal disease, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of up to 5%. Approximately 20% of individuals with pulmonary embolism (PE) die before diagnosis or on the first day after their diagnosis. Because the signs and symptoms of PE are often nonspecific, advanced imaging is commonly used for the diagnosis. Ventilation-perfusion lung studies (V/Q scans, a nuclear medicine examination) were traditionally the noninvasive imaging test of choice, but in the early 2000s this imaging modality was supplanted by chest computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Chest CTPA is faster and more sensitive than V/Q scan; however, the improved sensitivity is at least in part believed to be owing to the detection of inconsequential, subsegmental PE.

Since its introduction, CTPA has been embraced by emergency department (ED) and hospital physicians, and rates of use have increased dramatically, resulting in concerns of overuse. Previous studies examining trends in the use of computed tomography (CT) (based on survey or claims data) have not distinguished chest CT (ie, all chest CT except for CTPA) from CTPA. In 2001, CT (including CTPA) was used in 2.6% of ED visits for chest pain or shortness of breath, which increased to 12.5% in 2009, with an average growth of 28.1% per year. In an analysis of Medicare beneficiaries with suspected PEfrom 2002 to 2009, chest CT use increased 5-fold, but positivity rates (yield) decreased from 7.3% in 2002 to 5.9% in 2009. This finding suggests that a smaller percentage of patients have received the potential benefit of CTPA with respect to improved detection, and more patients have experienced potential harms, including exposure to ionizing radiation, intravenous contrast, and overdiagnosis. This observation is further supported by an increasing incidence of PE, with a lower case mortality rate but no change in overall PE mortality.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^114fWovk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — low pretest probability evaluation uses the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) and D-dimer testing. In patients believed to be at low risk for PE, the PERC criteria should be applied. In those who meet all 8 PERC criteria, the risk for PE is lower than the risks of testing; do not order a plasma d-dimer test. Those who do not meet all of the criteria should be further stratified by using a plasma d-dimer test. A normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; do not order imaging studies. An elevated plasma D-dimer level should lead to imaging studies. The PERC items are Age < 50, Initial heart rate < 100 beats/min, Initial oxygen saturation > 94% on room air, No unilateral leg swelling, No hemoptysis, No surgery or trauma within 4 wk, No history of venous thromboembolism, and No estrogen use; the table notes that pretest probability with score of 0 is < 1%.

### Diagnosis and exclusion of pulmonary embolism [^112XvjVG]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to test for pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a lethal mistake, but PE and produces symptoms similar to many other diseases. Overtesting for PE has negative consequences.

Objectives

Use published evidence to create a rationale and safe diagnostic approach for ambulatory and emergency patients with suspected PE in 2017.

Findings

Pulmonary embolism need not be pursued in patients with no symptoms of PE in the present or recent history (dyspnea, chest pain, cough or syncope), and always normal vital signs. When clinicians have a low clinical suspicion for PE or a Wells score < 2, they can reasonably exclude PE with the Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria (PERC rule). For patients with a "PE-unlikely" pretest probability (Wells or simplified revised Geneva score < 5), PE can be ruled out with a normal or age-adjusted D-dimer concentrations. Other patients should undergo pulmonary vascular imaging, and the choices are discussed, including computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography, planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Conclusions

A thoughtful algorithm for PE exclusion and diagnosis requires pretest probability assessment in all patients, followed by selective use of clinical criteria, the quantitative D-dimer, and pulmonary vascular imaging.

### Differential value of risk factors and clinical signs for diagnosing pulmonary embolism according to age [^113HFu5W]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

The diagnostic value of clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism (PE) is uncertain in the elderly, who often have concomitant cardiopulmonary diseases that may mimic PE. The aim of our study was to assess the differential value of risk factors, symptoms and clinical signs of venous thromboembolism, results of electrocardiogram and chest X-ray for the diagnosis of PE in suspected patients according to age.

Methods

We analyzed data from two outcome studies which enrolled 1721 consecutive patients presenting in the emergency department with clinically suspected PE defined as acute onset of new or worsening shortness of breath or chest pain without any other obvious etiology. All patients underwent a sequential diagnostic work-up and a 3-month follow-up.

Results

The proportion of confirmed PE was 24.2% (416 of 1721). Strength of the association with PE did not differ according to age group for history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), recent surgery, tachypnea at admission or right ventricular strain on electrocardiogram. Active malignancy, hemoptysis, tachycardia, hemidiaphragmatic elevation and pleural effusion at chest X-ray were no more associated with PE in the patients aged of 75 years or more. Finally, symptoms and signs of deep venous thrombosis, and an alternative diagnosis less probable than PE were associated with PE in all age groups, but the strength of this association decreased significantly with advancing age.

Conclusion

Some risk factors, symptoms and signs of VTE are less strongly or even not at all associated with PE in the elderly. Physicians should take this into account when attending elderly patients suspected of PE and when assessing their clinical probability of PE.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of a 2003 clinical policy on the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).(1) A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) Do objective criteria provide improved risk stratification over gestalt clinical assessment in the evaluation of patients with possible PE? (2) What is the utility of the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE? (3)What is the role of quantitative D-dimer testing in the exclusion of PE? (4) What is the role of computed tomography pulmonary angiogram of the chest as the sole diagnostic test in the exclusion of PE? (5) What is the role of venous imaging in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE? (6) What are the indications for thrombolytic therapy in patients with PE? Evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115j6zVt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^111YNEax]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Perfusion abnormalities are common following acute PE and, depending on the patient's symptoms and echocardiographic findings, may not require any further investigation. Access to perfusion imaging (eg, ventilation–perfusion (VQ) SPECT) or Q SPECT is not universal, and the presence of chronic lung disease reduces the specificity of such scans. Perfusion lung maps can also be obtained at the time of CTPA using dual energy CT or using lung subtraction iodine mapping, allowing an assessment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) and CT features of PH, as well as lung perfusion.

Some patients with breathlessness following an acute PE have a low probability of PH on echocardiogram and have abnormal perfusion scan and/or evidence of chronic, organised fibrotic clot on CTPA. Before considering further assessment, it is important to consider other causes of breathlessness, particularly deconditioning, left heart disease and lung disease. Where deconditioning is suspected, it may be reasonable to advise a graded increase in exercise with review before considering further investigation. Where there is diagnostic doubt, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) may be helpful. If pulmonary vascular disease is the dominant problem limiting exercise, you would expect CPET to demonstrate inefficient ventilation due to high dead space in the lungs. However, deconditioning is commonly found on CPET in patients with persistent breathlessness following an acute PE. Stress echocardiogram is an alternative modality and can demonstrate exercise-induced PH; however, it is not commonly performed in this setting.NT-proBNP may also help stratify the likelihood of significant PH, although data is limitedand elevated levels are also frequently seen in left heart disease, which is a common comorbidity.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115771Z4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — diagnostic test performance and thresholds: CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 95% to 100% in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability and a sensitivity of 85% to 95% in patients with high pretest probability. The sensitivity of V/Q scan for PE is 50% to 98%, and specificity is 20% to 60%. Pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that should only be reserved in patients where the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT angiography or V/Q scan. Age-adjusted (age × 10 ng/mL) d-dimer cutoffs can be used to exclude PE in non–high clinical probability patients who are > 50 years of age, with a sensitivity of > 97% and higher specificities than the conventional cutoff of 500 ng/mL.

Acute pulmonary embolism — reducing repeat CT use in those with prior scans: Physicians, hospitals, and emergency departments (EDs) should develop diagnostic and treatment pathways for patients with a history of multiple CTs for PE, and at least 1 study has demonstrated that patients evaluated for PE by using CT had a significant probability of having another CT performed for PE within 5 years; in fact, 5% of the patients in this study had 5 or more CTs for PE. Preventing this frequent use of repeated CT requires thoughtful planning, clinicians should educate these patients about the risk of radiation from multiple CTs, and an individualized approach to testing is reasonable, including lower-extremity venous ultrasonography or V/Q scanning when appropriate (although V/Q scanning may not be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema).

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) — risk stratification and D-dimer–guided evaluation is described as combining pretest probability with decision tools and selective imaging; patients without elevated risk should not be tested, clinician gestalt accuracy is similar to structured tools but tools standardize care, most tools use D-dimer for lower-risk patients to avoid unnecessary computed tomography (CT) when normal, and D-dimer remains appropriate as an initial step for inpatients; both Wells and Geneva tools have been externally validated; highly sensitive D-dimer assays are assumed, whereas older latex or erythrocyte agglutination assays only rule out PE in low pretest probability.

### Independent evaluation of a simple clinical prediction rule to identify right ventricular dysfunction in patients with shortness of breath [^112xJaae]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients have unexplained persistent dyspnea after negative computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). We hypothesized that many of these patients have isolated right ventricular (RV) dysfunction from treatable causes. We previously derived a clinical decision rule (CDR) for predicting RV dysfunction consisting of persistent dyspnea and normal CTPA, finding that 53% of CDR-positive patients had isolated RV dysfunction. Our goal is to validate this previously derived CDR by measuring the prevalence of RV dysfunction and outcomes in dyspneic emergency department patients.

Methods

A secondary analysis of a prospective observational multicenter study that enrolled patients presenting with suspected PE was performed. We included patients with persistent dyspnea, a nonsignificant CTPA, and formal echo performed. Right ventricular dysfunction was defined as RV hypokinesis and/or dilation with or without moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.

Results

A total of 7940 patients were enrolled. Two thousand six hundred sixteen patients were analyzed after excluding patients without persistent dyspnea and those with a significant finding on CTPA. One hundred ninety eight patients had echocardiography performed as standard care. Of those, 19% (95% confidence interval, 14%-25%) and 33% (95% CI, 25%-42%) exhibited RV dysfunction and isolated RV dysfunction, respectively. Patients with isolated RV dysfunction or overload were more likely than those without RV dysfunction to have a return visit to the emergency department within 45 days for the same complaint (39% vs 18%; 95% CI of the difference, 4%-38%).

Conclusion

This simple clinical prediction rule predicted a 33% prevalence of isolated RV dysfunction or overload. Patients with isolated RV dysfunction had higher recidivism rates and a trend toward worse outcomes.

### Multicentre validation of the Geneva risk score for hospitalised medical patients at risk of venous thromboembolism. explicit ASsessment of thromboembolic RIsk and prophylaxis for medical PATients in Switzerland (ESTIMATE) [^116ZwYgH]. Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Geneva Risk Score for venous thromboembolism" for pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A.

The Geneva Risk Score, also known as the Revised Geneva Score, is a clinical calculator used to estimate the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients. This scoring system is applicable to patients who present with symptoms suggestive of PE, such as sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained cough with or without blood.

The Geneva Risk Score is clinically useful in stratifying patients into different risk categories (low, intermediate, high) based on various factors including age, previous history of DVT or PE, recent surgery or fracture, active malignancy, unilateral lower limb pain, hemoptysis, heart rate, and pain on lower limb deep venous palpation and unilateral edema.

This risk stratification helps clinicians decide whether further diagnostic testing is necessary, and aids in the management of patients with suspected PE. It is particularly useful in the emergency department setting.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Geneva Risk Score. However, it should be noted that this score is not intended to replace clinical judgment, and should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and diagnostic tests.

The Geneva Risk Score calculator is designed to evaluate the likelihood of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) based on various patient conditions. Each of these conditions is assigned a specific score, which is summed to determine the overall risk.

Here's how the scoring system is structured:

- **Conditions contributing 2 points each**:

- Cardiac failure
- Respiratory failure
- Recent stroke within the last 3 months
- Recent myocardial infarction within the last 4 weeks
- Acute infectious disease, including sepsis
- Acute rheumatic disease
- Active cancer
- Myeloproliferative syndrome
- Nephrotic syndrome
- Prior venous thromboembolism
- Known hypercoagulable state

- **Conditions contributing 1 point each**:

- Immobilization for 3 or more days, indicating complete bed rest or inability to walk for more than 30 minutes per day
- Recent travel lasting more than 6 hours
- Age over 60 years
- Obesity (body mass index over 30 kg/m²)
- Chronic venous insufficiency
- Pregnancy
- Hormonal therapy (contraceptive or replacement therapy)
- Dehydration

To compute the score, examine each condition listed above and add the corresponding points only for those conditions present in the patient. The sum of these points becomes the total score.

The interpretation of the total score is as follows:

- A total score of 2 or less suggests a low risk of venous thromboembolism, with an approximate risk of 0.6%.
- A total score of 3 or higher indicates a high risk of venous thromboembolism, estimated at 3.2%.

This tool aids in the assessment of VTE risk, helping healthcare providers make informed decisions based on the patient's health profile.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^11693TVn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians best practice advice — evaluation of suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE): Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered. Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should use age adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted. Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff. Clinicians should obtain imaging with CTPA in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve V/Q scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Pulmonary embolism [^113gaDHB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PE is one of the great challenges in medicine. It is a disease that carries with it a high mortality rate, yet no historical piece of information, physical examination finding, or diagnostic modality is perfect at excluding its possibility. Emergency physicians must be vigilant about considering PE in the differential diagnosis of a variety of presenting complaints and must use a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic options as they manage patients with suspected or confirmed PE. The diagnostic options range from bedside diagnostic tests to highly specialized imaging available at only specialized institutions. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each of the diagnostic modalities assists the physician in employing the best test. Therapeutic options also vary widely and include anticoagulation, vena caval interruption, systemic thrombolysis, embolectomy, and other therapeutic adjuncts, such as ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide. Similarly, awareness of the indications and contraindications to the varied therapeutic agents ensures appropriate therapy when the diagnosis is made.

### Pulmonary embolism [^116C7PxD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging medical diseases in the emergency department. PE is a potentially life threatening diagnosis that is seen in patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea but can span the clinical spectrum of medical presentations. In addition, it does not have any particular clinical feature, laboratory test, or diagnostic modality that can independently and confidently exclude its possibility. This article offers a review of PE in the emergency department. It emphasizes the appropriate determination of pretest probability, the approach to diagnosis and management, and special considerations related to pregnancy and radiation exposure.

### Prospective diagnostic accuracy assessment of the hemosIL HS D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism in emergency department patients [^111r36rL]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chest pain and shortness of breath are among the most common symptoms requiring immediate evaluation. Testing for pulmonary embolism (PE) has become easier and widespread due to D-dimer blood tests. Safe use of these tests is only possible if sensitivity is high and they are used in non-high probability patients. We evaluated diagnostic performance of the HemosIL HS D-dimer, which despite FDA approval in 2005, has been minimally reported in prospective standard clinical care.

Materials and Methods

We used a prospective observational study design to follow patients in a single center with the HemosIL HS ordered for symptoms of possible PE with positive test result if > 243 ng/ml. The outcome was PE or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at the time of presentation or subsequent 45 days determined by structured evaluation of imaging tests, phone, or medical record follow-up in all patients.

Results

529 patients received a D-dimer and 4.7% were ultimately diagnosed with PE or DVT. The sensitivity of the HemosIL HS was 96.0% (95% CI; 79.6 to 99.9%) specificity was 65.7% (95% CI; 61.4 to 69.8%) and likelihood ratio negative was 0.06 (95% CI; 0.01 to 0.42). The probability of PE in patients with a negative D-dimer was 1/332 or 0.3% (95% CI; 0.01% to 1.67%). The receiver operator curve had an area under the curve of 0.87 and supported the current cut-point as optimal.

Conclusions

The HemosIL HS D-dimer had high sensitivity, very low negative post-test probability and is useful in excluding PE in the acute care setting.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^114honJt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — PERC performance and D-dimer cutoffs: The PERC are not a screening tool for all patients and should be applied only to very low–risk patients in whom PE is genuinely suspected, and when used in this manner the PERC should decrease the use of d-dimer testing only in patients who would have otherwise been tested. A meta-analysis of 12 studies found the overall proportion of missed PEs by using PERC was 0.3% (46 of 14 844 total cases), the pooled sensitivity was 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%), and the pooled specificity was 22%, indicating that 22% of d-dimer tests could have been safely avoided had the PERC been universally applied. To date, most recommendations have considered any value above 499 ng/mL as elevated, and a meta-analysis of 13 studies and 12 497 patients without high pretest probability found that using age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs for patients older than 50 years (age × 10 ng/mL) maintained a sensitivity for PE above 97% while significantly increasing specificity.

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. BET 3: pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) for excluding pulmonary embolism [^111yPspV]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was carried out to establish whether the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) can safely exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED). One recent systematic review was directly relevant to the question and incorporated all the other relevant evidence identified. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are shown in table 3. The clinical bottom line is that PERC may be safely applied to patients aged 18–49 years presenting to the ED with chest pain and/or dyspnoea providing that the pre-test probability of PE is 7% or less (equivalent to a Wells score of < 2).

For a patient who has undergone CT imaging and has an incidental finding of chronic thromboembolism (webs and/or attenuated vessels), what should I do?

Strictly, CTEPD cannot be diagnosed until after 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation. If there is an incidental finding of chronic, organised, fibrotic clot and the patient presents with breathlessness, we would recommend therapeutic anticoagulation with reassessment after 3 months. The decision with respect to long-term anticoagulation should be made on an individual basisand consider the risk of PE recurrence, the previous history of PE (if any) and the burden of organised clot seen on CTPA against the risk of potential bleed.

Patients who remain symptomatic at 3 months require further assessment. The first step would usually be an echocardiogram. If there is an intermediate or high probability of PH, then referral to a PH centre is recommended. If there is a low probability of PH, a CPET looking for an abnormal pulmonary vascular response patternshould be considered, or, if unfit to perform CPET, the authors suggest echocardiogram surveillance after a year. NT-proBNP can also help to stratify likelihood of having significant PH. Where patients have a low echocardiographic probability of PH and breathlessness is likely due to other factors, it may not be necessary to perform any further assessment. In cases where the probability of PH is unclear, a follow-up echocardiogram after an interval may be helpful.

Evaluation of suspected acute PE — factors promoting overuse of imaging include that "pregnancy itself does not confer a greater risk for PE", physicians may feel compelled to "rule out the condition even if its likelihood is extremely low" and may prefer dichotomous tests "such as CT", while "the fear of litigation" may drive imaging; patient preferences and limited communication can increase testing, whereas such communication "has also been found to be associated with less use of diagnostic testing"; system factors include the growth in availability and use of CT in emergency departments and after-hours remote radiology, and "supply-sensitive care" whereby technology availability is linked to use and "may also promote overuse"; practice gaps include that many low- or intermediate-risk patients "either have no plasma D- dimer value obtained or go on to have CT despite normal D- dimer levels", and some with elevated d-dimer do not have follow-up CT, "contrary to evidence-based guidelines".

### Prognosis of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism in buenos aires: a prospective cohort study [^111KiErA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

We performed a prospective cohort study nested in the prospective Institutional Registry of Venous Thromboembolic Disease (IRTD Home ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01372514) between June 2006 and May 2011. This study was designed to evaluate all consecutive incident cases of suspected PE at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. This hospital is a tertiary level hospital with 675 beds, 42,700 admissions, and almost 3 million ambulatory consultations each year.

Population

Suspected PE was considered if any patient (in the hospitalized or ambulatory setting) was assessed for PE with a diagnostic test (computed tomography pulmonary angiography [CTPA], ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, or pulmonary angiography).

The IRTD inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) all consecutive inpatients and outpatients older than 16 years of age; (2) patients who were evaluated with a diagnostic test (CTPA, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, or pulmonary angiography) by the attending physician to confirm or rule out PE because of the presence of signs and/or symptoms suggestive of PE (defined as acute onset of new or worsening shortness of breath, tachycardia, or chest pain without any other obvious etiology); and (3) confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an objective diagnostic test. Patients were excluded from the IRTD for the following reasons: (1) patients were tested for any other reason than suspected VTE; (2) patients were unable to provide informed consent or refused to participate; and (3) patients who only visited our hospital for a diagnostic study, but were treated at other centers. For this study, we included only those patients with suspicion of PE who were already included in the IRTD.

Possible cases were collected for the IRTD using a computerized alert that was generated whenever a physician requested an imaging study for VTE among adult patients. Data collection was carried out prospectively by medical students who were specifically trained for this study. They interviewed the patient and the treating physician using a standardized data collection form. Baseline evaluation of all patients, including the Wells score, was performed during the first 24 hours since suspicion of PE, without knowing the diagnostic test results.

PE was confirmed if CTPA or angiography showed filling defects in a sub-segmental or larger pulmonary artery, and was present in at least two consecutive images, or there was a high or intermediate probability of PE in ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, associated with a likely Wells score probability. All others cases were considered as RPE and an alternative final diagnosis was always confirmed.

Which patients should undergo imaging to determine if there are residual perfusion defects or persistent abnormalities?

Residual perfusion defects are common following an acute PE. A meta-analysis of 25 studies reported 52% of patients as having residual perfusion defects at 11 months, although a more recent prospective cohort study reported a prevalence of 29% at a median of 12 months following acute PE.

When evaluating a patient following an acute PE, the decision to perform further imaging should always include an assessment of breathlessness. In the absence of breathlessness, further imaging is not recommended unless there are risk factors for CTEPH present, and further evaluation will impact on treatment decisions. In symptomatic patients, echocardiography is recommended and patients with an intermediate or high risk of PH should be considered for referral to a PH centre (recognising that other comorbidities such as left heart disease may also cause PH). Patients with a low probability of PH, who have significant symptoms and no other cardiopulmonary comorbidity, but with significant residual defects should also be considered for further evaluation such as CPET and/or referral to a PH centre.

Long-term anticoagulation is recommended in patients with PE with no transient risk factor and in CTEPH (irrespective of whether they had a major transient risk factor or not). Not included in these groups are patients who have had a PE associated with a major transient risk factor. Occasionally, these patients may undergo further imaging and be noted to have features of organised thrombus on CTPA or persistent defects on VQ imaging. For patients with minor residual CTEPD and a low probability of PH, the authors would usually recommend stopping anticoagulation. For patients with more extensive residual thromboembolism following a major transient risk factor and a low probability of PH, there is currently no evidence on the optimal anticoagulation strategy and this decision should be made on a case-by-case basis. However, we would usually favour ongoing anticoagulation in symptomatic patients with CTEPD and no PH if the bleeding risk is low.

### Prospective multicenter evaluation of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria [^117PqqbZ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Over-investigation of low-risk patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) represents a growing problem. The combination of gestalt estimate of low suspicion for PE, together with the PE rule-out criteria [PERC(-): age < 50 years, pulse < 100 beats min(-1), SaO(2) ≥ 95%, no hemoptysis, no estrogen use, no surgery/trauma requiring hospitalization within 4 weeks, no prior venous thromboembolism (VTE), and no unilateral leg swelling], may reduce speculative testing for PE. We hypothesized that low suspicion and PERC(-) would predict a post-test probability of VTE(+) or death below 2.0%.

Methods

We enrolled outpatients with suspected PE in 13 emergency departments. Clinicians completed a 72-field, web-based data form at the time of test order. Low suspicion required a gestalt pretest probability estimate of < 15%. The main outcome was the composite of image-proven VTE(+) or death from any cause within 45 days.

Results

We enrolled 8138 patients, 85% of whom had a chief complaint of either dyspnea or chest pain. Clinicians reported a low suspicion for PE, together with PERC(-), in 1666 patients (20%). At initial testing and within 45 days, 561 patients (6.9%, 95% confidence interval 6.5–7.6) were VTE(+), and 56 others died. Among the low suspicion and PERC(-) patients, 15 were VTE(+) and one other patient died, yielding a false-negative rate of 16/1666 (1.0%, 0.6–1.6%). As a diagnostic test, low suspicion and PERC(-) had a sensitivity of 97.4% (95.8–98.5%) and a specificity of 21.9% (21.0–22.9%).

Conclusions

The combination of gestalt estimate of low suspicion for PE and PERC(-) reduces the probability of VTE to below 2% in about 20% of outpatients with suspected PE.

### Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^1176dRcj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have improved diagnostic accuracy and made management algorithms safer, easier to use, and well standardized. These diagnostic algorithms are mainly based on the assessment of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer measurement, and imaging tests-predominantly computed tomography pulmonary angiography. These diagnostic algorithms allow safe and cost-effective diagnosis for most patients with suspected PE. In this review, we summarize signs and symptoms of PE, current existing evidence for PE diagnosis, and focus on the challenge of diagnosing PE in special patient populations, such as pregnant women, or patients with a prior VTE. We also discuss novel imaging tests for PE diagnosis and highlight some of the additional challenges that might require adjustments to current diagnostic strategies, such as the reduced clinical suspicion threshold, resulting in a lower proportion of PE among suspected patients as well as the overdiagnosis of subsegmental PE.

### High-pitch CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) with ultra-low contrast medium volume for the detection of pulmonary embolism: a comparison with standard CTPA [^112xxCeW]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arterial embolism (PE) is the third most frequent acute cardiovascular disease (estimated annual incidence: 39–200 per 100,000 inhabitants), being second only to myocardial infarction and stroke. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of this potentially acutely or chronically life-threatening disease is crucial for the adequate management in order to improve patients' prognosis. However, over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment needs to be avoided.

For several decades, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature in patients with suspected PE due to its high sensitivity (83%) and specificity (96%), availability, and short examination time. Additionally, CTPA may render an alternative diagnosis, if PE is ruled out.

It is well known that ionizing radiation may be harmful and 2% of all newly diagnosed neoplasia have been reported to be a result of radiation exposure from computed tomography (CT). Intravenous iodinated contrast medium may cause contrast-induced nephropathy and has been reported to amplify DNA radiation damage during CT. Despite the potential risks, CT imaging with iodinated contrast medium is indispensable for many CT applications, including vascular CT angiography and CTPA in particular.

So far, there have been numerous studies investigating scan protocols to optimize radiation dose or contrast medium volume without compromising image quality or diagnostic feasibility. For radiation dose, the most effective strategy has been to decrease tube potential, but also lowering tube current and using the high-pitch mode in dual-source CT scanners have been explored. Scanning in high-pitch mode may reduce oversampling and shortens image acquisition time. Furthermore, image acquisition in high-pitch mode may mitigate or avoid motion artifacts without compromising image quality.

Motion artifacts frequently occur in patients with shortness of breath or chest pain, who have difficulty holding their breath. Elderly individuals frequently have hearing or visual impairments that may also lead to a limited compliance during examination.

To mitigate the outlined challenges and risks during CTPA, some studies have combined more than one of these approaches (low tube voltage, high-pitch, low contrast medium volume) for the detection of PE.

In this study, we investigated a CTPA protocol using ultra-fast high-pitch mode (pitch: 3.2), ultra-low contrast volume administration (20 mL), with kVp and tube current adaptation in normal weight, free-breathing patients for the detection of PE. The aim of the study was to explore the feasibility of this protocol in comparison to a standard CTPA in an emergency care setting.

### Prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients presenting to the emergency department with syncope [^11625cV7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

A recent study reported a high prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients admitted with syncope. We sought to determine whether these findings were validated in our patient population.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, secondary analysis of prospectively gathered data from patients presenting with syncope to an academic emergency department (ED) from July 2010 to December 2015. We analyzed baseline information from the time of the ED visit, recorded outcomes during the hospital stay, and contacted patients by phone at least 30days after the ED visit. The primary study outcome was the diagnosis of acute PE in the ED, during inpatient admission or ED observation unit stay, or by patient report over a 30-day follow-up period.

Results

Over the 5.5-year study period, 348 patients with syncope agreed to participate in the study. 52% of patients were female [95% confidence interval (CI): 46.6–57.4] and the average age was 48.4years. Of the enrolled patients, 50.1% (CI: 44.8–55.2) underwent further evaluation for syncope beyond the ED stay: 27% (CI: 22.6–31.9) of patients were admitted to an inpatient unit for further work-up and 23.9% (CI: 19.7–28.6) of patients were placed in the ED observation unit. The overall rate of PE among patients presenting to the ED with syncope was 1.4% (CI: 0.6–3.3%). 2 patients (0.6%, CI: 0.2–2.1) were diagnosed with a PE while in the ED. None of the patients were diagnosed with a PE during hospital admission or the observation stay associated with the index ED visit. 3 patients (0.9%, CI: 0.3–2.5) reported they had been diagnosed with a PE during the 30days following their ED visit, two of whom had been admitted to the hospital at the index ED visit but were not diagnosed with a PE at that time. All patients diagnosed with a PE at the time of the ED visit or during the follow-up period were Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC) positive and reported shortness of breath in the ED.

Conclusion

In contrast to a previous study, our findings do not support a high rate of PE among ED patients presenting with syncope.

### Use of the D-dimer for detecting pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^1158jGqr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED) remains complex, involving clinical decision tools, blood tests, and imaging.

Objective

Our objective was to examine the test characteristics of the high-sensitivity d-dimer for the diagnosis of PE at our institution and evaluate use of the d-dimer and factors associated with a falsely elevated d-dimer.

Methods

We retrospectively collected data on adult patients evaluated with a d-dimer and computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram or ventilation perfusion scan at two EDs between June 4, 2012 and March 30, 2016. We collected symptoms (dyspnea, unilateral leg swelling, hemoptysis), vital signs, and medical and social history (cancer, recent surgery, medications, history of deep vein thrombosis or PE, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking). We calculated test characteristics, including sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for the assay using conventional threshold and with age adjustment, and performed a univariate analysis.

Results

We found 3523 unique visits with d-dimer and imaging, detecting 198 PE. Imaging was pursued on 1270 patients with negative d-dimers, revealing 9 false negatives, and d-dimer was sent on 596 patients for whom negative Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) were documented with 2% subsequent radiographic detection of PE. The d-dimer showed a sensitivity of 95.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91–98%), specificity of 40.0% (95% CI 38–42%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.11 (95% CI 0.06–0.21), and positive likelihood ratio of 1.59 (95% CI 1.53–1.66) for the radiographic detection of PE. With age adjustment, 347 of the 2253 CT scans that were pursued in patients older than 50 years with an elevated d-dimer could have been avoided without missing any additional PE. Many risk factors, such as age, history of PE, recent surgery, shortness of breath, tachycardia and hypoxia, elevated the d-dimer, regardless of the presence of PE.

Conclusions

Many patients with negative d-dimer and PERC still received imaging. Our data support the use of age adjustment, and perhaps adjustment for other factors seen in patients evaluated for PE.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with acute pulmonary embolism: data from PIOPED II [^111YFwjf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Selection of patients for diagnostic tests for acute pulmonary embolism requires recognition of the possibility of pulmonary embolism on the basis of the clinical characteristics. Patients in the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II had a broad spectrum of severity, which permits an evaluation of the subtle characteristics of mild pulmonary embolism and the characteristics of severe pulmonary embolism.

Methods

Data are from the national collaborative study, Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II.

Results

There may be dyspnea only on exertion. The onset of dyspnea is usually, but not always, rapid. Orthopnea may occur. In patients with pulmonary embolism in the main or lobar pulmonary arteries, dyspnea or tachypnea occurred in 92%, but the largest pulmonary embolism was in the segmental pulmonary arteries in only 65%. In general, signs and symptoms were similar in elderly and younger patients, but dyspnea or tachypnea was less frequent in elderly patients with no previous cardiopulmonary disease. Dyspnea may be absent even in patients with circulatory collapse. Patients with a low-probability objective clinical assessment sometimes had pulmonary embolism, even in proximal vessels.

Conclusion

Symptoms may be mild, and generally recognized symptoms may be absent, particularly in patients with pulmonary embolism only in the segmental pulmonary branches, but they may be absent even with severe pulmonary embolism. A high or intermediate-probability objective clinical assessment suggests the need for diagnostic studies, but a low-probability objective clinical assessment does not exclude the diagnosis. Maintenance of a high level of suspicion is critical.

### Targeting the initial investigation and management in cases of acute pulmonary embolism [^116VPpG9]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptomatic pulmonary embolism has a > 10% mortality rate in the early stages if left untreated. Patients presenting with the symptom complex including pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and evidence of venous thromboembolic disease may warrant investigation. A serum d-dimer measurement has high sensitivity and low specificity and thus is useful for ruling out PE as a cause of these symptoms if the diagnosis is unlikely. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is both sensitive and specific and is thus ideal for definitive diagnosis of PE. CTPA is limited by a lack of resources and the high dose of radiation required for this test.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases (published June 2012) advises the use of a 2-level Well's score to determine which of these diagnostic tests is required. A low score (unlikely PE) should be investigated with d-dimer first, and CTPA in the event of a positive d-dimer. A high score (likely PE) should be investigated with a CTPA as soon as possible. In either case, if a CTPA is indicated but has been delayed, an interim therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be given.

Close adherence to this guideline is important for quality of care for several reasons:

Patients with likely PE who have an inappropriate d-dimer test will delay treatment with LMWH significantly. Urgent blood tests can take more than one hour from deciding to take the sample to having the result
Efficiently ruling out PE in patients allows for timely investigation of alternative diagnoses
Needless d-dimer tests in patients with high Well's scores is a waste of resources. Likewise, any CTPA without preceding d-dimer test in cases of low likelihood PE is both a waste of resources and a large inappropriate dose of radiation.

### Emergency evaluation for pulmonary embolism, part 2: diagnostic approach [^115cfMiL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In part 1 of this two-part review, we discussed which risk factors, historical features, and physical findings increase risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) in symptomatic emergency department (ED) patients.

Objectives

Use published evidence to describe criteria that a reasonable and prudent clinician can use to initiate and guide the process of excluding and diagnosing PE.

Discussion

The careful and diligent emergency physician can use clinical criteria to safely obviate a formal evaluation of PE, including the use of gestalt reasoning and the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC rule, Table 2, part 1). We present published clinical and radiographic features of patients with PE who eluded diagnosis in the ED. D-dimer can be used to exclude PE in many patients, and employing age-based adjustments to the threshold to define an abnormal value can further reduce patient exposure to pulmonary vascular imaging. Moreover, we discuss benefits, limitations, and potential harms of computed tomographic pulmonary vascular imaging relevant to patients and the practice of emergency care. We present algorithms to guide exclusion and diagnosis of PE in patients with suspected PE, including those who are pregnant.

Conclusions

Reasonable and prudent emergency clinicians can exclude PE in symptomatic ED patients on clinical grounds alone in many patients, and many more can have PE ruled out by use of the D-dimer.

We are reporting a middle-aged male patient with polycythaemia vera comorbidity. The patient was exhibiting symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath and was found to have acute pulmonary embolism. He was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. This case suggests that a high index of suspicion should be taken into consideration for thromboembolic events, when treating patients with COVID-19 with breathing difficulty and low oxygen saturation levels, especially in those who have underlying predisposing conditions for coagulopathy.

### Prevalence of pulmonary embolism among patients with recent onset of dyspnea on exertion. A cross-sectional study [^113xvmpr]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Exertional dyspnea is a frequently encountered complaint in clinical practice. However, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with dyspnea on exertion has not been reported.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of objectively confirmed PE among consecutive patients visiting an emergency department because of recent onset of exertional dyspnea.

Methods

Patients aged ≤ 75 years with recent (< 1 month) marked exertional dyspnea had a systematic workup for PE, irrespective of concomitant signs or symptoms of venous thromboembolism and alternative explanations for dyspnea. PE was excluded on the basis of a low pretest clinical probability and normal age-adjusted D-dimer. All other patients had computed tomography pulmonary angiography. An interim analysis after inclusion of 400 patients would stop recruitment if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the PE prevalence had a lower limit exceeding 20%.

Results

The study was prematurely terminated after the inclusion of 417 patients. In 134 patients (32.1%), PE was excluded based on low clinical probability and normal D-dimer. PE was found in 134 (47.3%) of the remaining 283 patients, for an overall prevalence of 32.1% (95% CI, 27.8–36.8). PE was present in 40 of 204 (19.6%) patients without other findings suspicious for PE and in 94 of 213 patients (44.1%) with such findings. PE involved a main pulmonary artery in 37% and multiple lobes in 87% of the patients.

Conclusion

The angiographic demonstration of PE is common in patients presenting with recent onset of marked exertional dyspnea, including 20% without other findings suggesting pulmonary embolism.

### The mcConnell sign is seen in patients with acute chest syndrome [^11241hWY]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bedside ultrasound is often used as a part of the evaluation of patients who are critically ill. The McConnell sign is an important echocardiographic finding in some critically ill patients with pulmonary embolism and an acute right ventricular infarct. We present 3 critically ill patients with confirmed acute chest syndrome who showed the McConnell sign on echocardiography. In patients with sickle cell disease presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath, the presence of the McConnell sign does not narrow the differential diagnosis between pulmonary embolism, an acute right ventricular infarct, and acute chest syndrome.

### Pulmonary embolism [^115V5a3a]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common illness that can cause death and disability. It is difficult to detect because patients present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. The clinical setting can raise suspicion, and certain inherited and acquired risk factors predispose susceptible individuals. D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism.

### Defying occam's razor: a case of pulmonary embolism masked by cardiac tamponade [^115uXkKq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Occam's razor instructs physicians to assume one single cause for multiple symptoms, whereas Hickam's dictum encourages them to suspect multiple concurrent pathologies. Although the general practice is to follow Occam's razor, occasionally Hickam's dictum reigns supreme. Here we present one such case, where the concurrent presence of two life-threatening pathologies posed clinical challenges in diagnosis and management.

Case Report

Although cardiac tamponade and pulmonary embolism (PE) are known complications of malignancy, their concomitant existence is rare. Here we report a patient who presented with shortness of breath found to have both cardiac tamponade and submassive PE. Although the cardiac tamponade was initially diagnosed in the Emergency Department by bedside ultrasound and treated with pericardiocentesis, only a few hours later, when she deteriorated, the submassive PE was diagnosed, which was treated with heparin infusion and subsequently transitioned to a newer oral anticoagulant. The patient was later diagnosed as having primary breast cancer and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? This raised unique diagnostic challenges, as both cardiac tamponade and PE present with obstructive shock. The increased right heart pressure from the PE could have paradoxically protected the patient from the tamponade effects of the pericardial effusion. Furthermore, the presence of cardiac tamponade may also mask the typical echocardiographic features of PE. The concurrent presence of two pathologies raised challenges and dilemmas in management. This case shows that physicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion of two pathologies when the patient deteriorates after the first pathology has been appropriately treated.

### Triage for suspected acute pulmonary embolism: think before opening pandora's box [^115xUb72]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

This is a review of the current strengths and weaknesses of the various imaging modalities available for the diagnosis of suspected non-massive Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Without careful consideration for the clinical presentation, and the timely application of clinical decision support (CDS) methodology, the current overutilization of imaging resources for this disease will continue. For a patient with a low clinical risk profile and a negative D-dimer there is no reason to consider further workup with imaging; as the negative predictive value in this scenario is the same as imaging. While the current efficacy and effectiveness data support the continued use of Computed Tomographic angiography (CTA) as the imaging golden standard for the diagnosis of PE; this test does have the unintended consequences of radiation exposure, possible overdiagnosis and overuse. There is a persistent lack of appreciation on the part of ordering physicians for the effectiveness of the alternatives to CTA (ventilation-perfusion imaging and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography) in these patients. Careful use of standardized protocols for patient triage and the application of CDS will allow for a better use of imaging resources.

### Clinical suspicion of fatal pulmonary embolism [^111H6w1Y]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Less than one third of patients with fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) are identified prior to autopsy.

Objective

To determine whether the clinical syndromes of acute PE are effective at identifying patients who die of this condition.

Method

Seven hundred seventy-eight autopsy reports at the Buffalo General Hospital from 1991 to 1996 inclusive were reviewed. Inpatient medical records of 67 patients who were identified as having PE as the primary or major cause of death then were analyzed.

Results

Thirty patients (45% [95% confidence interval, 33 to 57%]) had received a diagnosis of PE prior to death, which was marginally higher than the number previously reported (p < 0.05). The diagnosis of PE was significantly lower (13%; p < 0.01) in patients with COPD or coronary artery disease (33%; p < 0.01). In contrast to the prospective investigation of PE diagnosis data, only a minority of patients (6%) presented with pleuritic pain or hemoptysis, while a significantly larger proportion (24%; p < 0.01) of our patients experienced circulatory collapse. Only 55% were identified as having PE from the following clinical syndromes of PE: isolated dyspnea; pleuritic pain and/or hemoptysis; and circulatory collapse. Among the 30 patients suspected of having PE, only 14 (47%) received IV heparin in therapeutic doses, despite clinical suspicion.

Conclusion

Our results show a modest increase in the correct antemortem diagnosis of fatal PE. The current clinical syndromes used as markers for suspecting PE are not sufficient to detect patients who ultimately die of PE. Physicians should maintain a higher index of suspicion since fatal PE does not always present as one of the three clinical syndromes of PE. Once PE is suspected, heparin therapy should be started early.

### Diagnosing pulmonary embolism… [^115kods3]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Mr. Smith is a 62-year-old patient who complains of increasing shortness of breath over the past 24 hours. He has no swelling of the legs, no pain in the calves on palpation and no cough, fever or other symptoms consistent with an alternate diagnosis such as pneumonia. He denies hemoptysis and has no history of malignancy or previous venous thromboembolism. What is the patient's risk. One of the first steps in diagnosing PE, or any other condition, is to assess the patient's risk level for the condition based on his or her signs and symptoms. Because individual signs and symptoms are often not accurate enough to estimate a patient's risk level, combining them into a "clinical decision rule" can be very helpful. 1 requires only a careful history and physical examination. The PE encounter form uses the seven elements of the Wells rule in the "symptom" section to help you estimate a patient's risk of PE and then guides you through a diagnostic protocol. An experienced clinician's estimate of the likelihood of PE without using any clinical decision rule is also reasonably accurate. 2, 3. What tests should I order. Once you have determined a patient's risk for PE, the next questions are "What tests should I order to rule in or rule out the condition. " and "How should I interpret them". One of the strengths of an evidence-based approach to diagnosis is that it allows you to tailor the diagnostic strategy to the patient. Rather than taking a "one size fits all" approach that over-investigates patients who are at low risk and may miss disease in patients who are at high risk, you can use the information from your clinical evaluation to guide the selection of tests and their interpretation.

Several groups have developed and validated protocols for the diagnosis of PE that rely on the clinical assessment, D-dimer test, ventilation-perfusion scan, ultrasound of the proximal leg veins and helical computed tomography scanning. The protocol is based on the finding that patients with a low clinical probability and a negative noninvasive test almost certainly do not have PE, while patients with a high clinical probability and a positive noninvasive test almost certainly do. Those with an intermediate clinical probability or an indeterminate noninvasive test require further rounds of testing and closer follow-up.

### Acute venous thromboembolism: diagnostic guidelines… [^111R3pf5]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Thus, a high index of suspicion is crucial for patients who are deemed to be at risk. Because of the magnitude of this problem and the varying diagnostic approaches available, the American Thoracic Society developed a consensus statement to outline appropriate strategies to consider in patients with suspected DVT and PE. Importantly, the medical literature was reviewed and an evidence-based approach was devised. The diagnostic approach to DVT and PE requires careful attention to the presence of risk factors. Although a patient who develops shortness of breath during bedrest for a hip fracture might have aspiration pneumonia, a flare of obstructive lung disease or atelectasis causing dyspnea, PE should always be included in the differential diagnosis.

Even when a patient is admitted to the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia, congestive heart failure or emphysema, the development of worsening dyspnea always merits consideration of PE despite another strong explanation for the symptoms. The presence of symptoms such as leg pain or swelling, dyspnea, chest pain, syncope or hemoptysis, particularly in the setting of risk factors for DVT, should always lead to suspicion of DVT and PE. At the present time, the standard approach to patients with suspected acute PE should include a history, physical examination, arterial blood gas analysis, chest radiography and electrocardiography. The chest radiography and electrocardiography may be useful in proving alternative diagnoses but rarely are diagnostic of PE. Unexplained hypoxemia may suggest PE but is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis. The ventilation perfusion scan has long been the diagnostic cornerstone.

However, this technique is usually not definitively negative or positive and, generally, additional testing is indicated. Even when PE is ultimately proved by pulmonary angiography, the V/Q scan is commonly nondiagnostic. 4 The V/Q scan is useful, however, when results are normal or high probability. Caution is recommended with interpretation of CT studies, and the threshold for pulmonary arteriography should be low. The quality of the CT images must be optimal. Some experts, however, are still reluctant to rely on CT in the absence of additional clinical research trials. 8 When the diagnosis is uncertain after chest CT or a V/Q scan, or both, evaluation of the lower extremities appears to be a useful option. 9 If DVT is present, the treatment is generally the same as if PE is diagnosed.
