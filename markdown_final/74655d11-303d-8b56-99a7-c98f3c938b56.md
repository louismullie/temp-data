## Question

Why are the results of duodenal donor-feces infusion for recurrent C. difficile clinically and mechanistically significant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the results of duodenal donor-feces infusion for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection are clinically and mechanistically significant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pivotal randomized trial and its design. Then, I should verify the magnitude and statistical robustness of clinical efficacy. Next, I will examine the mechanistic microbiome data and how they align with pathophysiology. After that, I need to consider durability and recurrence outcomes. I should also review safety signals and limitations. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and the broader impact on the field to synthesize why these findings matter both clinically and scientifically.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal evidence base. The van Nood et al. randomized controlled trial in the New England Journal of Medicine directly compared nasoduodenal donor-feces infusion following a short vancomycin lead-in versus vancomycin alone or vancomycin plus bowel lavage, and it was stopped early for efficacy, which is a strong signal of clinical significance [^169f6e55] [^169f6e55] [^169f6e55].

> I should double-check the magnitude of benefit. After a single infusion, 13 of 16 patients (81%) in the FMT arm achieved sustained resolution versus 4 of 13 (31%) with vancomycin alone and 3 of 13 (23%) with vancomycin plus lavage, with P < 0.001 for both comparisons; this corresponds to a relative risk of cure around 2.6–3.5, which is clinically large and statistically robust, and it has been repeatedly cited in subsequent meta-analyses and guidelines as a benchmark for FMT efficacy in rCDI [^169f6e55] [^552f7c88] [^a7235d54].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic data tied to clinical outcomes. The trial showed that after donor-feces infusion, recipients' fecal microbiomes rapidly normalized toward donor-like diversity, with increases in Bacteroidetes and Clostridium clusters IV/XIVa and a decrease in Proteobacteria; this pattern aligns with restoration of colonization resistance, a core pathophysiologic deficit in rCDI that antibiotics alone fail to correct [^169f6e55] [^2a92308f] [^58f244b5].

> Hold on, I should verify durability and retreatment. Two of the three initial FMT nonresponders were retreated with a different donor and achieved resolution, yielding an overall success exceeding 90% in the trial; moreover, longer-term observational and controlled data demonstrate persistent microbiome shifts and low recurrence after successful FMT, supporting durable clinical benefit beyond the immediate post-infusion window [^169f6e55] [^0aadaefe] [^eadf8c46].

> I need to check safety signals and limitations. The trial reported only mild, transient abdominal cramping and diarrhea on the infusion day, with no significant differences in serious adverse events versus controls; however, later real-world and regulatory alerts highlight rare but serious risks from transmitted pathogens, underscoring the need for rigorous donor screening and standardized protocols, which the trial itself did not fully standardize across centers [^169f6e55] [^a41f7324] [^08537065].

> Next, I should review guideline uptake to gauge clinical impact. IDSA/SHEA and ACG guidelines endorse FMT for patients with multiple recurrences after appropriate antibiotics, citing the NEJM RCT and subsequent evidence; contemporary guidance also supports capsule formulations and extends consideration to mildly immunocompromised hosts, reflecting how the duodenal infusion trial catalyzed route diversification and broader eligibility while maintaining safety guardrails [^a7235d54] [^a41f7324] [^a730d060].

> Let me consider the broader scientific significance. This was the first rigorously conducted RCT to demonstrate that microbiome restoration via FMT outperforms antibiotics in a microbiome-driven disease, establishing a proof-of-concept for microbiome therapeutics and spurring development of defined live biotherapeutic products; mechanistic work since then has linked FMT success to restoration of secondary bile acids and immune modulation, including Treg-dependent effects, building on the initial observation that diversity recovery tracks with cure [^2a92308f] [^e00f752f] [^164f9cf5].

> But wait, what if the duodenal route itself was critical to the signal. I should confirm comparative effectiveness across routes. Subsequent trials and meta-analyses show high efficacy with multiple delivery methods, including colonoscopy and capsules, indicating that the central driver is microbiome restoration rather than the specific upper GI route; nonetheless, the NEJM trial's nasoduodenal approach validated feasibility and efficacy of upper GI delivery, informing protocol flexibility in practice [^552f7c88] [^17acc869] [^e58e2e1e].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise. The duodenal donor-feces infusion results are clinically significant because they demonstrate a large, rapid, and durable superiority of FMT over antibiotics in rCDI with a favorable safety profile in the trial setting, and mechanistically significant because they provide causal evidence that restoring a healthy, diverse microbiome reverses the dysbiosis-driven vulnerability to C. difficile, thereby establishing FMT as a foundational therapy and accelerating the evolution toward standardized, and increasingly defined, microbiome-based treatments [^169f6e55] [^552f7c88] [^2a92308f].

The duodenal infusion of donor feces for recurrent C. difficile infection is **clinically significant** because it achieves markedly higher cure rates (81% after one infusion, > 90% with repeat) [^169f6e55] than vancomycin alone (31%) or vancomycin plus lavage (23%) [^49aaedc6], and this benefit is durable with low recurrence [^0aadaefe]. Mechanistically, it is **significant** because it restores microbial diversity and colonization resistance [^2a92308f], increases protective Bacteroidetes and Clostridium clusters IV/XIVa, and reduces Proteobacteria, thereby suppressing C. difficile and breaking the cycle of recurrence [^169f6e55] [^58f244b5]. These findings underpin current guidelines recommending FMT for recurrent C. difficile infection [^a7235d54] [^d4f9ed08].

---

## Clinical significance

### Superior efficacy compared to standard antibiotic therapy

- **High cure rates**: 81% after a single nasoduodenal infusion, rising to > 90% with a second infusion if needed [^169f6e55].
- **Comparison with antibiotics**: Vancomycin alone achieved 31% cure, and vancomycin plus bowel lavage achieved 23% cure (P < 0.001 vs FMT) [^169f6e55] [^a787fa59].
- **Durability**: Low recurrence and sustained clinical resolution in follow-up [^0aadaefe].

---

### Impact on clinical guidelines and practice

Guideline endorsement by IDSA/SHEA and ACG for **recurrent C. difficile infection** reflects these results [^a7235d54] [^d4f9ed08]. Regulatory approval of **live biotherapeutics** was catalyzed by FMT's success, leading to FDA-approved products for rCDI [^e00f752f] [^20fb7225].

---

## Mechanistic significance

### Restoration of gut microbiota diversity and composition

- **Microbiome restoration**: FMT restores diversity and composition to a donor-like state, reversing dysbiosis [^169f6e55] [^564c9b2d].
- **Key taxa**: Increases in Bacteroidetes and Clostridium clusters IV/XIVa, with decreases in Proteobacteria, correlate with clinical cure [^169f6e55] [^0155f7fc].
- **Colonization resistance**: Restored microbiota re-establishes resistance to C. difficile, preventing recurrence [^2a92308f] [^58f244b5].

---

### Functional and metabolic restoration

Bile acid metabolism is restored as donor microbiota reactivate **secondary bile acids** that inhibit C. difficile germination and growth [^2a92308f] [^e00f752f]. Immune modulation likely involves **Treg cells**, which contribute to resolution and sustained cure [^164f9cf5].

---

## Safety considerations

FMT is generally safe, with **mostly mild, transient GI symptoms**; serious adverse events are rare but can occur, including transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms, underscoring the need for rigorous donor screening [^a41f7324] [^08537065].

---

## Limitations and future directions

- **Standardization**: Optimal donor selection, preparation, and delivery methods need refinement [^2c4706e2].
- **Long-term effects**: More data are needed on durability and potential off-target effects [^552f7c88].
- **Next-generation therapies**: Defined microbial consortia and live biotherapeutics aim to improve safety and efficacy [^56167e76].

---

The duodenal infusion of donor feces is **clinically and mechanistically significant** because it achieves high, durable cure rates in rCDI by restoring a healthy, diverse microbiome and colonization resistance, thereby transforming management and guiding the development of microbiome-based therapeutics [^169f6e55] [^2a92308f].

Background

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection is difficult to treat, and failure rates for antibiotic therapy are high. We studied the effect of duodenal infusion of donor feces in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients to receive one of three therapies: an initial vancomycin regimen (500 mg orally four times per day for 4 days), followed by bowel lavage and subsequent infusion of a solution of donor feces through a nasoduodenal tube; a standard vancomycin regimen (500 mg orally four times per day for 14 days); or a standard vancomycin regimen with bowel lavage. The primary end point was the resolution of diarrhea associated with C. difficile infection without relapse after 10 weeks.

Results

The study was stopped after an interim analysis. Of 16 patients in the infusion group, 13 (81%) had resolution of C. difficile-associated diarrhea after the first infusion. The 3 remaining patients received a second infusion with feces from a different donor, with resolution in 2 patients. Resolution of C. difficile infection occurred in 4 of 13 patients (31%) receiving vancomycin alone and in 3 of 13 patients (23%) receiving vancomycin with bowel lavage (P < 0.001 for both comparisons with the infusion group). No significant differences in adverse events among the three study groups were observed except for mild diarrhea and abdominal cramping in the infusion group on the infusion day. After donor-feces infusion, patients showed increased fecal bacterial diversity, similar to that in healthy donors, with an increase in Bacteroidetes species and clostridium clusters IV and XIVa and a decrease in Proteobacteria species.

Conclusions

The infusion of donor feces was significantly more effective for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection than the use of vancomycin.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review [^49f9cbce]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Goal

By systematic review, we assessed the impact of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of Clostridium difficile (CD)-associated diarrhea.

Background

Fecal microbiota microbiota transplantation from a healthy donor into an individual with CD infection (CDI) can resolve symptoms.

Study

We conducted systematic searches in PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The last search was run on February 8, 2013. The following Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords were used alone or in combination: Clostridium difficile; Clostridium infection; pseudomembranous colitis; feces; stools; fecal suspension; fecal transplantation; fecal transfer; fecal infusion; microbiota; bacteriotherapy; enema; nasogastric tube; colonoscopy; gastroscopy; fecal donation; donor. A critical appraisal of the clinical research evidence on the effectiveness and safety of FMT for the treatment of patients with CD-associated diarrhea was made.

Results

Twenty full-text case series, 15 case reports, and 1 randomized controlled study were included for the final analysis. Almost all patients treated with donors' fecal infusion experienced recurrent episodes of CD-associated diarrhea despite standard antibiotic treatment. Of a total of 536 patients treated, 467 (87%) experienced resolution of diarrhea. Diarrhea resolution rates varied according to the site of infusion: 81% in the stomach; 86% in the duodenum/jejunum; 93% in the cecum/ascending colon; and 84% in the distal colon. No severe adverse events were reported with the procedure.

Conclusions

FMT seems efficacious and safe for the treatment of recurrent CDI. Hospitals should encourage the development of fecal transplantation programs to improve therapy of local patients.

Randomized trial outcomes for FMT versus vancomycin in recurrent CDI are summarized as follows: investigators "randomly assigned 43 patients with ≥ 2 recurrent episodes of CDI" to either "a standard 14-day course of oral vancomycin (13 patients), vancomycin with bowel lavage (13 patients), or a 4-day course of vancomycin followed by bowel lavage and subsequent FMT infusion administered through a nasoduodenal tube (17 patients)". The "primary endpoint was initial response without relapse for 10 weeks", the study "was terminated early", and outcomes showed "Thirteen of the 16 (81%) patients in the FMT arm" achieved sustained resolution after the first FMT infusion versus "7 of the 26 (27%)" treated with vancomycin.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation in relapsing Clostridium difficile infection [^d634f9c3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection rates are Climbing in frequency and severity, and the spectrum of susceptible patients is expanding beyond the traditional scope of hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. Fecal microbiota transplantation is becoming increasingly accepted as an effective and safe intervention in patients with recurrent disease, likely due to the restoration of a disrupted microbiome. Cure rates of > 90% are being consistently reported from multiple centers. Transplantation can be provided through a variety of methodologies, either to the lower proximal, lower distal, or upper gastrointestinal tract. This review summarizes reported results, factors in donor selection, appropriate patient criteria, and the various preparations and mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplant delivery available to clinicians and patients.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^248c166a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently a recommended therapy for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The success of FMT for CDI has led to interest in its therapeutic potential in many other disorders. The mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT are not fully understood. Importantly, FMT remains a crucial treatment in managing CDI and understanding the mechanisms that underpin its success will be critical to improve its clinical efficacy, safety and usability. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of this may allow us to expose FMT's full potential as a therapeutic tool for other disease states. This review will explore the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of FMT across a variety of diseases.

### WSES guidelines for management of Clostridium difficile infection in surgical patients [^e33265f2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Recently a systematic review was published by Cammarota et al. Twenty full-text case series, 15 case reports, and 1 randomized controlled study were included for the final analysis. Almost all patients treated with donors' fecal infusion experienced recurrent episodes of CD-associated diarrhea despite standard antibiotic treatment. Of a total of 536 patients treated, 467 (87%) experienced resolution of diarrhea. Diarrhea resolution rates varied according to the site of infusion: 81% in the stomach; 86% in the duodenum/jejunum; 93% in the cecum/ascending colon; and 84% in the distal colon. No severe adverse events were reported with the procedure.

In a recently published randomized clinical trial by van Nood et al. patients with RCDI were randomised to three groups; 1) vancomycin regime only; 2) vancomycin with duodenal infused FMT and 3) vancomycin and bowel lavage. In the FMT treated group an 81% reduction in diarrhoea was observed. The FMT group were observed to have normalization of their intestinal bacterial composition which was similar to that of the donor. Although, this trial has shown exciting results, these need to be interpreted with caution as the trial included only small number of patients, was not blinded, and was aborted early due to profound differences in the groups. It has also been criticised for potentially having several potential biases.

FMT may be administered via enemas or as a slurry given via a nasogastric tube. In the fall of 2014, Youngster et al. reported their experience on utilizing frozen FMT capsules in 20 patients who had RCDI. Fourteen patients (70%) had resolution of diarrhea after the first treatment, and an additional 4 patients responded after a second treatment, for a clinical resolution rate of 90%.

29) FMT may be effective in immunocompromised patients and patients who have had solid organ transplants (Recommendation 2 B).

Patients who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of CDI. During the last two years the first data on FMT in immunocompromised patients began to appear in the medical literature.

A multicenter retrospective series on the use of FMT in immunocompromised (IC) patients with CDI that was recurrent, refractory, or severe was published in 2014. Reasons for IC included: HIV/AIDS (3), solid organ transplant (19), oncologic condition (7), immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; 36), and other medical conditions/medications (15).

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridioides difficile: mechanisms and pharmacology [^2a92308f]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a remarkably successful treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection that cannot be cured with antibiotics alone. Understanding the complex biology and pathogenesis of C. difficile infection, which we discuss in this Perspective, is essential for understanding the potential mechanisms by which FMT cures this disease. Although FMT has already entered clinical practice, different microbiota-based products are currently in clinical trials and are vying for regulatory approval. However, all these therapeutics belong to an entirely new class of agents that require the development of a new branch of pharmacology. Characterization of microbiota therapeutics uses novel and rapidly evolving technologies and requires incorporation of microbial ecology concepts. Here, we consider FMT within a pharmacological framework, including its essential elements: formulation, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. From this viewpoint, multiple gaps in knowledge become apparent, identifying areas that require systematic research. This knowledge is needed to help clinical providers use microbiota therapeutics appropriately and to facilitate development of next-generation microbiota products with improved safety and efficacy. The discussion here is limited to FMT as a representative of microbiota therapeutics and recurrent C. difficile as the indication; however, consideration of the intrinsic basic principles is relevant to this entire class of microbiota-based therapeutics.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) [^552f7c88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) is a bacterium that can cause potentially life-threatening diarrheal illness in individuals with an unhealthy mixture of gut bacteria, known as dysbiosis, and can cause recurrent infections in nearly a third of infected individuals. The traditional treatment of recurrent C difficile infection (rCDI) includes antibiotics, which may further exacerbate dysbiosis. There is growing interest in correcting the underlying dysbiosis in rCDI using of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT); and there is a need to establish the benefits and harms of FMT for the treatment of rCDI based on data from randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of donor-based fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompetent people.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials of adults or children with rCDI for inclusion. Eligible interventions must have met the definition of FMT, which is the administration of fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a person with rCDI. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, no intervention, or antibiotics with activity against C difficile.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. proportion of participants with resolution of rCDI and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. treatment failure, 4. all-cause mortality, 5. withdrawal from study, 6. rate of new CDI infection after a successful FMT, 7. any adverse event, 8. quality of life, and 9. colectomy. We used the GRADE criteria to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included six studies with 320 participants. Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single-center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I² = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation probably results in a slight reduction in serious adverse events; however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; P = 0.24, I² = 26%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation may result in a reduction in all-cause mortality; however, the number of events was small, and the CIs of the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.45; P = 0.48, I² = 0%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 20; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported colectomy rates.

Authors' Conclusions

In immunocompetent adults with rCDI, FMT likely leads to a large increase in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection compared to alternative treatments such as antibiotics. There was no conclusive evidence regarding the safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI as the number of events was small for serious adverse events and all-cause mortality. Additional data from large national registry databases might be required to assess any short-term or long-term risks with using FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Elimination of the single study that included some immunocompromised people did not alter these conclusions. Due to the low number of immunocompromised participants enrolled, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risks or benefits of FMT for rCDI in the immunocompromised population.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^393b6661]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

CDI is mediated through antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis that is exacerbated by current recommended first-in-line antibiotic therapy options, leading to high rates of CDI recurrence. The success of FMT therapy for multiply recurrent CDI has paved the way for next generation live biotherapeutics. Therapies targeted at microbiome restoration as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy can significantly improve treatment success and reduce the risk of disease recurrence. However, evidence suggests survival of C. difficile spores within mucosal biofilm populations, which could have implications for extended treatment success, emphasizing the need for biofilm targeted therapies. The long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics are still mostly unknown, but efforts to expand the options for CDI treatment can offer multiple alternative solutions to treat this multifaceted infectious disease.

Prevention of CDI recurrence with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) — indications, delivery, and efficacy: We recommend for patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) or capsules (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) for treatment of rCDI; delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 weeks of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Most studies of rCDI have defined eligibility as 3 or more confirmed episodes, and the first randomized controlled trial reported cure with nasoduodenal FMT after vancomycin of 81% vs 31% with standard‑of‑care vancomycin.

### Clostridioides difficile: treating sustained antibiotic responders with fecal microbiota transplantation does not improve efficacy [^c8903d62]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

In short, the trial population does not reflect most patients with rCDI. The study investigates the use of FMT in the small subset of patients with a sustained response to antibiotics — a response that clinicians have no chance of reliably predicting. We find the trial incomparable to previous randomized controlled trials and literature that included all patients regardless of antibiotic response. Clinical decisions to minimize recurrence risk should necessarily be made during and not after acute antibiotics therapy. Given the severity of rCDI, this includes considering timely FMT as an exit strategy. The present study should not change clinical guidelines as the existing literature establishes FMT as the most effective treatment of rCDI.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^22e91258]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently a recommended therapy for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). – It is also being explored in the research setting for many other indications. However, there are a number of associated concerns regarding its use, including the unpleasant prospect of the procedure, the potential need for invasive administration, the small, but recognised risk of transmission of infection, and the complex regulation associated with its use. The COVID-19 pandemic and potential risk of viral transmission through donor stool samples has brought its limitations to the fore. As such, from a therapeutic perspective, understanding the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT may enable us to refine FMT from its current relatively crude state to a more refined 'microbiome therapeutic', which is no longer FMT, but could have a greater overall safety profile. This review will explore the current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT across a variety of diseases.

Current indications for FMT

There has been a wealth of evidence demonstrating that FMT for CDI is effective for recurrent and refractory CDI, and the treatment has therefore been adopted in national and international guidelines. – A meta-analysis of all these studies highlights clinical resolution in 92% (95% CI 89–94%) of cases. The success of FMT for CDI has led to interest in its therapeutic potential in many other disorders, but a report on these is beyond the scope of this review.

### Resolution rates in clinical trials for microbiota restoration for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^fe3d3cf1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct this meta-analysis.

Selection criteria and data search

A systematic search of electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and Scopus, along with abstracts and press releases from major gastroenterology and infectious diseases conferences, was performed up to July 2022. The search strategy was designed and conducted independently by Mayo Clinic library staff and two study investigators (S.K. and R.T.). A controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies that used FMT for CDI. Main keywords used in the search were the following: Clostridium difficile, C diff, C difficile, Clostridium difficile infection, CDI, Clostridium difficile –associated diarrhea or CDAD, AND faecal or faeces or fecal or feces or stool or microbiota, with infusion or transplant or transfer or instill or reconstitute or donor or bacteriotherapy. The search was limited to English-language publications.

Studies considered in this meta-analysis were prospective clinical trials that included a study population of patients with recurrent CDI who were treated with microbiota restoration via any delivery modality.

Data abstraction

Two investigators independently abstracted data to a predetermined collection form (S.K. and R.T.). Data collected for each study included study setting and design, year of publication, number of patients, patient characteristics, indication for FMT, FMT route, type of donor used for FMT, duration of follow-up, and outcomes. Discrepancies in data collection were resolved by consensus, referring to the original article.

Outcomes assessed

In our primary analysis, we calculated the clinical resolution rate with single microbiota restoration treatment with stool transplant or a live biotherapy in a controlled setting. We did not include patients treated with multiple MRTs after clinical failure with initial MRT in our primary analysis.

### Fecal flora reconstitution for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: results and methodology [^c740378c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Goals

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI) is an increasingly common clinical problem without ideal treatment options. Our aim was to evaluate our results using Fecal Flora Reconstitution (FFR), and promulgate our methodology to the GI community to foster its more widespread use in appropriate candidates.

Background

FFR, sometimes termed "fecal transplantion" has been shown in numerous reports to be an effective treatment of RCDI, however, most of these studies have small sample sizes and few focus specifically on the methodology used in colonoscopic preparation and delivery of donated stool.

Study

Nineteen patients with confirmed multiply recurrent CDI were treated by infusing donor stool through a colonoscope.

Results

Out of 19 patients, 18 initially responded to treatment with a single FFR treatment, 1 patient responded after a second FFR infusion. All 19 patients maintained prolonged cured status followed until submission, ranging from 6 months to 5 years. Three patients were presumed reinfected after remaining symptom free for a period spanning from 6 months to 4 years. These patients tested positive for C. difficile after prescription of additional antibiotics for unrelated infections.

Conclusions

Fecal Flora Reconstitution is an effective, viable, and simple method of treatment for the difficult to treat patients with RCDI who fail standard therapy.

### Fecal microbiota transplant for relapsing Clostridium difficile infection using a frozen inoculum from unrelated donors: a randomized, open-label, controlled pilot study [^785fa134]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with poor response to standard antimicrobial therapy is a growing medical concern. We aimed to investigate the outcomes of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for relapsing CDI using a frozen suspension from unrelated donors, comparing colonoscopic and nasogastric tube (NGT) administration.

Methods

Healthy volunteer donors were screened and a frozen fecal suspension was generated. Patients with relapsing/refractory CDI were randomized to receive an infusion of donor stools by colonoscopy or NGT. The primary endpoint was clinical resolution of diarrhea without relapse after 8 weeks. The secondary endpoint was self-reported health score using standardized questionnaires.

Results

A total of 20 patients were enrolled, 10 in each treatment arm. Patients had a median of 4 (range, 2–16) relapses prior to study enrollment, with 5 (range, 3–15) antibiotic treatment failures. Resolution of diarrhea was achieved in 14 patients (70%) after a single FMT (8 of 10 in the colonoscopy group and 6 of 10 in the NGT group). Five patients were retreated, with 4 obtaining cure, resulting in an overall cure rate of 90%. Daily number of bowel movements changed from a median of 7 (interquartile range [IQR], 5–10) the day prior to FMT to 2 (IQR, 1–2) after the infusion. Self-ranked health score improved significantly, from a median of 4 (IQR, 2–6) before transplant to 8 (IQR, 5–9) after transplant. No serious or unexpected adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

In our initial feasibility study, FMT using a frozen inoculum from unrelated donors is effective in treating relapsing CDI. NGT administration appears to be as effective as colonoscopic administration.

Clinical Trials Registration

NCT01704937.

### Gaps in knowledge and future directions for the use of faecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^0985b21d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has now been established into clinical guidelines for the treatment of recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Its therapeutic application in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is currently at an early stage. To date, there have been four randomized controlled trials for FMT in IBD and a multitude of observational studies. However, significant gaps in our knowledge regarding optimum methods for FMT preparation, technical aspects and logistics of its administration, as well as mechanistic underpinnings, still remain. In this article, we aim to highlight these gaps by reviewing evidence and making key recommendations on the direction of future studies in this field. In addition, we provide an overview of the current evidence of potential mechanisms of FMT in treating IBD.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on fecal microbiota-based therapies for select gastrointestinal diseases [^691d717a]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in immunocompetent adults — The AGA suggests the use of fecal microbiota–based therapies upon completion of standard of care antibiotics over no fecal microbiota–based therapies (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), with implementation considerations specific to outpatient, nonsevere, nonfulminant recurrent CDI. Diagnosis requires acute-onset, clinically significant, new-onset diarrhea (eg, 3 or more unformed stools in 24 hours) with appropriate testing, and recurrent CDI is typically defined by a confirmatory positive test within 8 weeks after completing CDI antibiotics. Fecal microbiota–based options include conventional fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), fecal microbiota live-jslm, and fecal microbiota spores live-brpk; prevention can be considered after the second recurrence (third episode) or in select high-risk patients, including those who have recovered from severe, fulminant, or treatment-refractory CDI or who have significant comorbidities, and careful consideration is recommended when frequent or long-term antibiotics are required. For conventional FMT administration, antibiotics for CDI should be stopped 1–3 days beforehand; if a bowel purge is used FMT can be given 1 day after stopping, otherwise allow 3 days off antibiotics, and note that some patients recur within 1–2 days of stopping CDI antibiotics. Conventional FMT should use appropriately screened donor stool, may be delivered via multiple routes with insufficient evidence to recommend a specific route, and reasonable alternatives for those not pursuing fecal microbiota–based therapies include a vancomycin taper, tapered-pulsed fidaxomicin, or bezlotoxumab.

### Long-term effects on luminal and mucosal microbiota and commonly acquired taxa in faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^eadf8c46]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) has increased, with up to 50% of patients developing recurrent infections. The bacterium is the main etiological agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, causing a major burden to the healthcare system. Diverse intestinal microbiota provides colonisation resistance against pathogens and perturbations to the normal microbiota introduced by an antibiotic treatment is a key step in CDI pathogenesis. Traditionally, CDI is treated with metronidazole or vancomycin and, more recently, with fidaxomicin and rifaximin. These antimicrobials devastate the intestinal microbiota even further. If C. difficile spores persist after antibiotic treatment they can germinate and proliferate in the absence of suppressing microbiota and, as a consequence, the patient may enter a vicious cycle of recurrent CDI (rCDI) infections. Further, the emerging antibiotic-resistant variants of C. difficile call for alternative treatment options.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective in treating rCDI. FMT from a healthy, pre-screened donor is placed into the patient's duodenum, cecum or rectum where it restores the diversity and composition of the disrupted microbiota and subsequently suppresses C. difficile. Emerging evidence suggests that FMT also restores secondary bile acid metabolism, which is impaired in rCDI and possibly has a role in disease development. Several studies have followed the short-term stability of the transplanted microbiota and constituted that, overall, FMT-induced changes tend to persist over time. Further, FMT's long-term clinical efficacy and safety have been demonstrated. However, the long-term effects of FMT on microbiota have not been previously addressed, with prior work focusing on the effects on faecal microbiota rather than on the distinct ecosystem of mucosa.

### Microbiome therapeutics for the treatment of recurrentinfection [^b76d948b]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The gut microbiome is implicated in Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and recurrent CDI (rCDI).

Areas Covered

This review covers the mechanisms by which microbiome therapeutics treat rCDI, their efficacy and safety, and clinical trial design considerations for future research.

Expert Opinion

Altering the chemical environment of the gut and reconstituting colonization resistance is a promising strategy for preventing and treating rCDI. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is safe and effective for the treatment of rCDI. However, limitations of FMT have prompted investigation into alternative microbiome therapeutics. These alternative microbiome therapies require further evaluation, and adaptive trial designs should be strongly considered to more rapidly discern variables including the need for bowel preparation, timing and selection of pre-treatment antibiotics, and dose and duration of microbiome therapeutics. A broad range of adverse events must be prospectively evaluated in these controlled trials, as microbiome therapeutics have the potential for numerous effects. Future studies will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which microbiome therapies can break the cycle of rCDI, which should ultimately yield a personalized approach to rCDI treatment that restores an individual's specific deficit(s) in colonization resistance to C. difficile.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and other conditions in children: a joint position paper from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^fe692c6c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation preparation and delivery — pediatric recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: Donor stool should be prepared for infusion via enema, biopsy channel, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube, or nasogastric (NG), nasoduodenal (ND), or nasojejunal (NJ) tube, with reports mixing stool with saline or water, blending, and filtering through gauze, sieves, or coffee filters. Recommended preparation volumes range from 50 to 100 g of stool diluted in 300 to 700 mL of solution; for upper gastrointestinal delivery, typical volumes are 30 to 100 mL with smaller volumes in children. To reduce aspiration risk with NG/NJ delivery, practitioners may consider keeping patients nil per os for 1 to 2 hours, and one case of aspiration during endoscopic duodenal delivery resulted in death. Evidence comparing routes is mixed: a meta-analysis found no significant outcome differences between colonoscopy and NG tube for rCDI, a recent multicenter review found colonoscopy significantly more effective than other routes in pediatric patients, and in adults enema delivery has a similar success rate to colonoscopic delivery. Some centers use rectal Foley catheter balloons or loperamide to increase post-FMT retention time, but specific studies or clinical data on the utility of these practices are lacking. FMT via capsules appears to be as efficacious as other delivery routes; in a prospective study of 180 patients aged 7 to 95 years, 82% achieved cure after a single course of 15 capsules over 2 days and 91% were cured after a second course, the primary side effects were headache, abdominal pain, and nausea, capsule FMT should be considered in patients who can accept and tolerate it and when colonoscopic evaluation is unwarranted, and due to the number and size of capsules it may be particularly challenging or not feasible in younger children.

### Expert opinion on fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment ofinfection and beyond [^640811d9]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a procedure involving transfer of stool from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of a diseased recipient to restore intestinal microbial composition and functionality. FMT's tremendous success in recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) catalyzed gut microbiota research and opened the door to microbiome-based therapy for various gastrointestinal and other disorders. Areas covered: We used PubMed search engine to identify significant publications in the field of CDI and FMT. Here we present an overview of the current literature on FMT's use for recurrent, non-severe, severe, and fulminant CDI and on promising future application. Expert opinion: FMT as the best tool for treatment of antibiotic-refractory CDI has gained immense popularity over the last decade. The future of gut microbiota-based therapy should include oral formulations that contain well-described ingredients in effective doses, clear mechanism of action, and excellent safety profile.

FAECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION

Primary insights into the efficacy of gut microbiota restoration came from faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments, where the delivery of minimally manipulated faeces from a healthy donor to a recipient with recurrent CDI can restore colonization resistance leading to clinical cure rates of 76.1%. The mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of FMT are largely unknown but likely to be multifactorial, combining the restoration of microbial diversity and the metabolic landscape. Bile acids have been shown to affect C. difficile germination and vegetative cell growth; therefore, restoration of bile acid metabolism through the reconstitution of bile salt hydrolases has been implicated in FMT efficacy. FMT has been recommended to treat multiply recurrent CDI (second or subsequent recurrence) after treatment with either fidaxomicin or vancomycin. More recent studies have demonstrated a potential role for FMT in treating a first or second CDI episode, severe and severe-complicated CDI. Despite the efficacy of FMT against recurrent CDI, safety concerns have been raised over the potential transmission of pathogens after the transfer of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli resulted in recipient fatalities. With the gut microbiota being linked to other extra-intestinal diseases, the application of an undefined microbiota could have unknown long-term health implications, highlighting the need for standardized procedures for screening and processing and a move towards a more defined and characterized intervention. In 2022–2023, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized two first-in-class live biotherapeutics for the treatment of recurrent CDI.

### Bacteriotherapy for the treatment of intestinal dysbiosis caused by Clostridium difficile infection [^0155f7fc]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI

Because of the recent increase in the rates of recurrence and severity from epidemic C. difficile strains, there has been renewed interest in the use of FMT for the treatment of recurrent CDI. In this process, homogenized faeces from a healthy donor is infused through colonoscopy, enema or nasogastrically to an individual with C. difficile disease to restore the intestinal microbiota and thereby eradicate CDI (Figure 1). The donor, usually a healthy individual/relative, is screened for contagious pathogenic agents such as Salmonella spp. Staphylococcus aureus, C. difficile and HIV and other infections or inflammatory conditions as previously described.

The intestinal microbiota of C. difficile patients treated with FMT is characterized by expansions in species diversity characterized by an increase in Bacteroides, Roseburia and Faecalibacterium and a reduction in Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 1). Recently, Hamilton and co-workers analysed the faecal microbiota of 3 patients treated by FMT using frozen donor sample from the same individual and an increase in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was observed. The Bacteroidetes were represented by greater abundance of the families Bacteroidaceae, Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae and members of the Firmicutes were represented by Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and unclassified Firmicutes. These families are typically found in abundant numbers in the intestines of healthy individuals, suggesting that key groups of health-promoting bacteria are associated with the displacement of CDI and restoration of homeostasis in treated patients.

Several studies that employed FMT for the treatment of recurrent CDI have reported success rates of 86–100%. van Nood and colleagues recently published the first clinical trial to directly compare FMT with vancomycin only or vancomycin with bowel lavage for the treatment of recurrent CDI. Remarkably, FMT resolved 13 of the 16 cases (81%) after first infusion compared to only 31% for vancomycin and 23% for vancomycin with bowel lavage. On second infusion, 2 of the 3 failed cases had resolution of CDI leading to an overall success rate of > 90% in this trial. The success rates observed in these studies highlight the importance of having a healthy and diverse intestinal microbiota and should establish FMT as a viable clinical option for diseases associated with intestinal dysbiosis.

Presently, there is no global standardized protocol for FMT as the process is largely dependent on the centre performing the FMT. However, it is pertinent to note that in 2011, the Faecal Microbiota Transplantation Workgroup proposed standard guidelines for treatment of CDI with FMT such as patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, donor selection and screening, preparation and administering of faecal samples.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent, safety, and pitfalls [^a693c46a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is recognized as an urgent public health threat by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contributing to 223,900 hospitalizations, 12,800 associated deaths in the United States, and approximately US$1 billion in attributable health care cost in 2017. A population-based surveillance study conducted by CDC emerging infection program in 10 sites within United States from 2011 to 2017 reported a 24% decrease in hospital onset C. difficile but found no decrease in community onset or first recurrence of C. difficile.

Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is defined as CDI that relapses after initial successful treatment; rCDI is associated with an annual cost of approximately US$2.8billion. Nearly, one in six patients with CDI will experience recurrent infection in the following 2 to 8 weeks. Patients with rCDI often experience additional recurrences, with reports estimating that 50–65% of patients have at least two or more incidence of rCDI. Increased incidence of rCDI was noted from 2001 to 2012; 1.07 to 3.09 cases per 100,000 person-years. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) poses a significant treatment challenge, given it is difficult to eradicate and often require escalation in treatment.

### The role of the gut microbiome in colonization resistance and recurrentinfection [^58f244b5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A healthy gut microbiome consists of a broad consortium of microorganisms that compete against potential pathogens and each other for resources such as nutrients and adhesion receptors on gut epithelium, and are able to produce antibacterial substances.– Disruption of the diversity and abundance of the gut microbiota lead to dysbiosis and a lack of colonization resistance, that make the gut more susceptible to colonization by pathogenic organisms such as C. difficile. Treatment of acute and recurrent CDI often presents a clinical dilemma, as standard-of-care antibiotics do not restore the intestinal microbiota or colonization resistance and may select for development of antimicrobial resistance. Restoration of a healthy microbiome is critical to break the vicious cycle of recurrent CDI. Although effective as a treatment option to prevent recurrent CDI, current FMT processes for donor recruitment, stool selection, and processing are not standardized. Newer biotherapeutic formulations currently in development have more standardized manufacturing processes, and have shown promising results in phase III clinical studies in preventing C. difficile recurrence and restoring the gut microbiome, paving the way forward for the reduction of recurrent CDI.

### Variability of strain engraftment and predictability of microbiome composition after fecal microbiota transplantation across different diseases [^564c9b2d]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the medical procedure of transferring human fecal matter from a healthy donor to a recipient to treat a disease related to microbiome imbalance. FMT has shown nearly 90% success rate for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), for which it is approved in clinical practice. FMT has been explored more recently for other diseases associated with microbiome alterations – or to support other therapies –, but its efficacy is usually lower and less consistent over cohorts than for rCDI. Some factors that may explain this variability include the presence or abundance of single bacteria and the diversity of the patient microbiome at baseline, clinical characteristics of the disease, the composition of the donor's gut microbiome, specific aspects of the FMT working protocols (for example route of delivery, amount of infused feces)and differential engraftment among species. Yet, it is generally unknown how strain engraftment might be linked with clinical remission after FMT.

The mechanisms and dynamics dictating which donor microbes can engraft in the recipient are poorly understood. Initial studies able to track the transmission of donor strains to the recipient have been performed on very few donor–recipient pairs. Availability of larger FMT trials and the advances in strain-resolved metagenomics enabled deeper analyses that started unraveling the engraftment efficiency of FMT across diseases and led to the development of statistical models to predict the post-FMT microbiome composition. Such investigations remained confined to single cohorts –, with unanswered questions about cross-cohort and cross-condition generalizability. As deeper strain-level metagenomics is possible – and not limited to well characterized microbial taxa, and as more metagenomic datasets are becoming available. an integrative metagenomic analysis may allow uncovering general patterns of microbial engraftment and connected clinical outcomes.

Here, we present a systematic meta-analysis of 24 studies that investigated FMT in different clinical settings for which we employed new strain-resolved metagenomic approaches to unravel the dynamics of FMT engraftment and its links with clinical outcomes.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2d10d42e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has emerged as a significant cause of human morbidity and mortality. It is now estimated that CDI has an incidence up to 32.6 per 100,000 person-years, with a direct care cost of $4.8 billion per year in the USA alone. This gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe is the most common cause of pseudomembranous colitis — a condition characterized by intractable diarrhea with the formation of intestinal pseudomembranes of cellular material in the colon. As a result of these physical characteristics, as well as the development of multidrug resistance, the challenge of effectively treating CDI continues to grow.

Given the prevalence and increasing antibiotic resistance of CDI, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is emerging as an exciting alternative to antibiotic therapies in preventing recurrent and complicated CDI. Since its initial implementation, the frequency of use has grown significantly. Current guidelines recommend FMT for patients with multiple recurrences of antibiotic-treated CDI. Accurate study of FMT is challenging, given the heterogeneity of administration protocols. One issue that arises is the variation in stool preparation — studies have described usage of both fresh and frozen stool, various sources of stool (family, pooled, or standardized preparation), and inconsistent donor and stool screening protocols. An additional challenge has been the quality of these studies; many of the randomized controlled trials that have compared FMT to antibiotic therapy have limited follow up as well as antibiotic protocols not within the standard of care. Regardless, FMT has been shown to be of comparable efficacy to standard medical management. Evidence regarding its efficacy with various routes of administration shows inconsistent results, but has widely demonstrated significant efficacy.

### Effects of lyophilised faecal filtrate compared with lyophilised donor stool on Clostridioides difficile recurrence: a multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, non-inferiority trial [^a415c969]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective in preventing recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. However, it is not known whether live microbes are necessary in mediating FMT efficacy. This study aims to determine whether lyophilised sterile faecal filtrate (LSFF), free of live bacteria, is non-inferior to lyophilised donor stool (LFMT) in efficacy.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, non-inferiority trial was done at four academic centres in Canada. Eligible patients were adults aged 18 years or older with recurrent C difficile infection (at least two recurrences). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1 using a prespecified computer-generated randomisation list with permutation blocks of 2 and 4, stratified by age > 65 years or < 65 years) to receive oral LSFF or LFMT. Each treatment dose consisted of 15 capsules that appeared identical. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants without recurrent C difficile infection (absence of more than three Bristol type 6 or 7 bowel movements per 24 h persisting more than 2 consecutive days) at 8 weeks. Analysis was done in the per protocol population, in which participants with unknown outcome status at 8 weeks due to death or loss to follow-up were excluded. Non-inferiority was established if the lower bound of the one-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions of participants without recurrent C difficile between the LSFF and LFMT groups was above the non-inferiority margin of -10%. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03806803, and is complete.

Findings

Between March 27, 2019, and Nov 6, 2023, we assessed 409 patients for eligibility. 271 were excluded and the remaining 138 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive LSFF (n = 72) or LFMT (n = 66). Participants' mean age was 61.2 years (SD 18.6); 91 (66%) of 138 patients were women and 47 (34%) were male. 127 participants (92%) were White. 130 (94%) of 138 participants completed the trial. At the planned interim analysis, 47 (65%) of 72 participants in the LSFF group and 57 (88%) of 65 participants in the LFMT group did not have C difficile recurrence at 8 weeks (difference -23%, one-sided 95% CI -33.8% to infinity; p = 0.96). Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, non-inferiority of LSFF to LFMT could not be established and the study was terminated at the recommendation of the data safety monitoring board. Serious adverse events included one death (LFMT group) and five hospitalisations (four unrelated, one possibly related to interventions [LSFF group]). One event occurred before treatment and all others 2–20 weeks after study intervention. The most common adverse events were abdominal discomfort (48 [67%] of 72 patients in the LSFF group and 36 (55%) of 66 patients in the LFMT group) and nausea (13 [18%] in the LSFF group and 21 [32%] in LFMT group).

Interpretation

Among adults with recurrent C difficile infection, non-inferiority of LSFF to LFMT was not established for the prevention of recurrent C difficile infection over 8 weeks, supporting the crucial role of live microbes in mediating clinical efficacy.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) FMT early failure and risk factors — Among 167 patients with recurrent CDI, 16.7% experienced early FMT failure, with most (86%) within 4 weeks and 14% between 4 and 8 weeks; in a multicenter cohort of 328 patients, early FMT failure (within 1 month) was 18.6%. Risks of failure included FMT for severe or fulminant CDI, inpatient status, and complicated psychiatric hospitalization; previous CDI-related hospitalization predicted failure, and patients with severe CDI were more likely to require multiple FMTs to achieve cure.

### European consensus conference on faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice [^605e8e83]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) consists of the infusion of faeces from a healthy donor to the GI tract of a recipient patient, in order to treat a specific disease associated with alteration of gut microbiota. A large body of evidence, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses, proved clear evidence that FMT is a highly effective treatment against recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI). Due to the rising prevalence, severity and mortality of this infection, the therapeutic role played by FMT is therefore important to save human lives and to decrease the economic burden on healthcare systems. Based on these data, both the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Disease and the American College of Gastroenterology recommend FMT as a treatment for rCDI.

Beyond the treatment of CDI, FMT has also been investigated in other disorders associated with the alteration of gut microbiota. In particular, studies in humans include RCTs in patients with UC and metabolic syndrome (MS).

The global interest in FMT is increasing, and both doctors and patients are increasingly aware and informed. Although the dissemination of FMT in the clinical practice is restricted by regulatory and bureaucratic issues (principally related to costs, donor programme, safety control), the FMT practice is booming, ranging from highly organised stool banking programmes to individual treatments with patient-identified directed donors, and even to individual and harmful do-it-yourself practices. Working groups (WGs) from the USA, Austria and France released recommendations on indications and methods of FMT. Authoritative published guidelines and recommendations have been released as expert opinions rather than evidence-based consensus reports. A rigorous and formal evidence-based process to drive the wide range of FMT practice has not been performed yet.

The aim of this evidence-based consensus report is to define indications and methodology for the use of FMT in the treatment of CDI, to discuss the suitability of FMT for indications other than CDI and to address the minimum requirements needed to implement a FMT centre. The final aim is to encourage and drive the dissemination of the procedure and to promote further clinical research in the area.

### Clinical practice and infrastructure review of fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection [^a0a9a039]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) cases recur after completion of antibiotic therapy, and antibiotic cure rates diminish with each recurrence of CDI. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapy for recurrent FMT, which otherwise requires prolonged or indefinite antibiotic treatment. FMT is performed by introducing the fecal microbial community obtained from a healthy donor or pool of donors into the stomach, small intestine, or colon of a patient with CDI. Multiple clinical trials support the usefulness of FMT in treating recurrent CDI, and CDI treatment guidelines now include consideration of FMT at the third CDI recurrence. However, there remain challenges to incorporating FMT into clinical practice. First, methods of fecal bacterial community processing vary, as do methods of FMT administration. Second, the optimal dosing strategy and expected benefit of FMT for refractory CDI, particularly for severe and severe complicated cases, are uncertain. Third, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers FMT an investigational treatment. Fourth, insurance reimbursement for FMT usually falls short of FMT administration costs. In the setting of rising C difficile incidence and growing evidence for FMT efficacy, the demand for FMT has increased. However, uncertainty surrounding optimal FMT preparation and administration methods, FDA oversight, and insurance reimbursement presently limits the clinical practice of FMT.

### The evolving landscape of fecal microbial transplantation [^53bcf6bb]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The human gastrointestinal tract houses an enormous microbial ecosystem. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota plays significant physiological roles and maintains immune homeostasis in the human body. Dysbiosis, an imbalanced gut microbiome, can be associated with various disease states, as observed in infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Modulation of the gut microbiome has become a therapeutic target in treating these disorders. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor restores the normal gut microbiota homeostasis in the diseased host. Ample evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of FMT in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). The application of FMT in other human diseases is gaining attention. This review aims to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of FMT and its efficacies in human diseases. We discuss the application, route of administration, limitations, safety, efficacies, and suggested mechanisms of FMT in rCDI, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Finally, we address the future perspectives of FMT in human medicine.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 CDI focused update — fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) safety and use: Although the recommendation for use of FMT has not been changed, 3 separate safety alerts have been published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since June 2019 on potential adverse events among recipients of FMT. Two alerts document transmission of pathogenic Escherichia coli from donor to FMT recipients, some of whom became ill and some of whom died, and the other alert concerns the potential for transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). FMT is recommended only for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments and where appropriate screening of donor and donor fecal specimens has been performed, in accordance with these newer FDA recommendations.

### SER-109, an investigational microbiome drug to reduce recurrence after Clostridioides difficile infection: lessons learned from a phase 2 trial [^d610ea55]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) is associated with loss of microbial diversity and microbe-derived secondary bile acids, which inhibit C. difficile germination and growth. SER-109, an investigational microbiome drug of donor-derived, purified spores, reduced recurrence in a dose-ranging, phase (P) 1 study in subjects with multiple rCDIs.

Methods

In a P2 double-blind trial, subjects with clinical resolution on standard-of-care antibiotics were stratified by age (< or ≥ 65 years) and randomized 2:1 to single-dose SER-109 or placebo. Subjects were diagnosed at study entry by PCR or toxin testing. Safety, C. difficile-positive diarrhea through week 8, SER-109 engraftment, and bile acid changes were assessed.

Results

89 subjects enrolled (67% female; 80.9% diagnosed by PCR). rCDI rates were lower in the SER-109 arm than placebo (44.1% vs 53.3%) but did not meet statistical significance. In a preplanned analysis, rates were reduced among subjects ≥ 65 years (45.2% vs 80%, respectively; RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11–2.81), while the < 65 group showed no benefit. Early engraftment of SER-109 was associated with nonrecurrence (P < .05) and increased secondary bile acid concentrations (P < .0001). Whole-metagenomic sequencing from this study and the P1 study revealed previously unappreciated dose-dependent engraftment kinetics and confirmed an association between early engraftment and nonrecurrence. Engraftment kinetics suggest that P2 dosing was suboptimal. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Early SER-109 engraftment was associated with reduced CDI recurrence and favorable safety was observed. A higher dose of SER-109 and requirements for toxin testing were implemented in the current P3 trial.

As microbiome research has moved from associative to mechanistic studies, the activities of specific microbes and their products have been investigated in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Findings from microbiome research have already been applied to the clinic, such as in fecal microbiota transplantation for treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. We review the evidence for associations between alterations in the intestinal microbiome and gastrointestinal diseases and findings from clinical trials of fecal microbiota transplantation. We discuss opportunities for treatment of other diseases with fecal microbiota transplantation, based on findings from small clinical and preclinical studies.

### Antimicrobial resistance gene acquisition and depletion following fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^c572f76b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Globally, the incidence of antimicrobial resistant infections is growing. The cupboard of available and efficacious antimicrobial agents is becoming increasingly bare, few new agents exist in the developmental pipeline, and the time lag to drug accessibility is long. There is an urgent need to consider novel interventions, including nonpharmacologic approaches to preventing colonization and possibly treating infection from multiply drug-resistant bacteria.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a nonpharmacologic treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in hospitalized patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea. FMT involves the infusion of healthy donor feces into the intestinal tract of patients with recurrent CDI via a nasojejunal/nasoduodenal tube or via colonoscope or retention enema. FMT has been shown to be highly effective for treating CDI and has led to the elimination of C. difficile from the intestinal tract of infected patients. Engraftment of the donor's intestinal microbiota and microbiota recovery in the recipient have been demonstrated. Following treatment of recurrent CDI with FMT, investigators began to notice that other highly drug-resistant bacteria were also disappearing along with C. difficile. Initial case reports indicated that several types of multidrug-resistant opportunistic organisms such as carbapenemase- and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were being eliminated in patients undergoing FMT for recurrent CDI. Shortly thereafter, case reports began emerging using FMT to directly decolonize non-CDI patients with resistant infections or patients at risk of infection. A recent study showed complete decolonization of various organisms in 15 of 20 (70%) patients. Finally, a study by Millan et al showed that FMT may contribute to the reduction of antimicrobial-resistant genes in FMT recipients. In this study, we sought to replicate these findings and to ask whether FMT recipients could also acquire antimicrobial resistance genes as the result of FMT. We sought to characterize changes to microbiota composition and antimicrobial resistance gene carriage as the result of FMT.

### The first international Rome consensus conference on gut microbiota and faecal microbiota transplantation in inflammatory bowel disease [^934b939e]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is defined as the infusion of faeces from healthy donors into the gastrointestinal tract of recipients to treat disease-associated gut dysbiosis. It is an established and highly effective treatment option for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, as reported by several randomised controlled trials (RCTs)and meta-analyses, which has culminated in the establishment of international guidelines to standardise its use as a viable therapeutic modality for C. difficile infection.

Following its success for the treatment of C. difficile infection, FMT has also been investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), first in non-randomised studies, and subsequently, in RCTs, both showing promising results, although with significant differences in FMT protocols and procedures. In fact, the adoption of FMT for the treatment of IBD is compromised by several limitations, including recruitment of donors, preparation of faecal material, determining the optimal route of administration and lack of a clear and established regulatory framework. Potential strategies to deal with these problems include the identification and use of sustainable, reproducible and standardised protocols, with the ultimate goal of altering gut microbiome composition. Consequently, establishing an optimal FMT framework is important for the future management of IBD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide consensus-based statements and recommendations regarding the general organisation and criteria required to promote FMT as a recognised strategy for the treatment of IBD.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: benefits and barriers [^69fe9631]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) have increased worldwide in the past two decades. A principal function of the gut microbiota is to protect the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens. Increasingly, the gut microbiota have been shown to influence susceptibility to other genetic and environmentally acquired conditions. Transplantation of healthy donor fecal material in patients with CDI may re-establish the normal composition of the gut microbiota and has been shown to be effective in recurrent CDI. We intend to review the most recent data on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and critically discuss potential advantages and handicaps of this new therapeutic approach.

Recent Findings

Evidence from case series and only one randomized clinical trial suggests that FMT is able to restore the wide diversity of microflora, improve C. difficile-related symptoms and prevent CDI recurrence.

Summary

FMT is a promising treatment option for serious and recurrent CDI, and current evidence (although weak) demonstrates consistent and excellent efficacy in clinical outcomes. However, many questions should be answered before it may be recommended as routine standard treatment. Mechanisms of action need to be better understood. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine long-lasting effects (including the association with autoimmune diseases).

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^de10b297]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As highlighted in this review, much of our current understanding of mechanistic insights into the efficacy of FMT are extended from what we have found from CDI studies. Certain mechanistic theories with circumstantial data to support them but no direct investigation as yet, for example, restored microbiota outcompeting C. difficile for the scavenging of carbon sources. Future studies should help test some of these mechanistic insights and attempt to understand the mechanisms that underpin successful FMT for specific disease indications. This may allow us to personalise FMT to not only disease states but to an individual and possibly refine FMT into a more targeted, efficacious, safer therapy.

### Donor human stool (Rebyota) [^6e394e0d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most commonly reported (≥ 3%) adverse reactions occurring in adults following a single dose of REBYOTA were abdominal pain, (8.9%), diarrhea (7.2%), abdominal distention (3.9%), flatulence (3.3%), and nausea (3.3%).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of REBYOTA was evaluated in 2 randomized, double-blind clinical studies (Study 1: NCT03244644 and Study 2: NCT02299570) and 3 open-label clinical studies (NCT01925417, NCT02589847, NCT03931941) conducted in the United States and Canada. A total of 978 adults 18 years of age and older with a history of 1 or more recurrences of Clostridioides difficile (CDI) infection and whose symptoms were controlled 24–72 hours post-antibiotic treatment were enrolled and received 1 or more doses of REBYOTA; 595 of whom received a single dose of REBYOTA. In the 2 randomized, double-blind clinical studies, 131 adults were originally randomized to receive placebo and 48 crossed over to receive an open-label dose of REBYOTA after additional CDI recurrence. Overall, across the 5 studies, the median age of participants was 64 years and 67.2% were female. The racial and ethnic distribution was as follows: 93.8% were white, and 2.4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. No meaningful differences in demographic characteristics occurred across the treatment groups. Study 1 and Study 2 excluded individuals with celiac disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and chronic diarrhea. Individuals with these conditions were not excluded from one of the open-label studies (NCT03931941), and individuals with food allergies were not excluded from any of the 5 clinical studies.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent, safety, and pitfalls [^2c4706e2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infection attributing to substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is common and occurs after effective treatment of first episode. Treatment of rCDI is based on accurate diagnoses, due to difficulty in distinguishing between colonization of C. difficile spores or CDI; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) added to the complexity of diagnoses as both entities can co-occur. It is difficult to eradicate rCDI, and there remains a critical gap regarding treatment of rCDI. The treatment goal of rCDI is to reestablish normal microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is suggested as a treatment for second episode of rCDI. Based on the collective evidence of all randomized controlled trials, FMT was reported more efficacious compared with vancomycin or fidaxomicin; however, these trials had limited number of patients and all patients were pre-treated with vancomycin prior to FMT. Furthermore, when comparing various routes of instillation and types of preparation of fecal microbiota, no difference was observed in cure rate. Despite the success rate of FMT, there remains a concern for transmission of infectious agents, such as Gram negative bacteremia or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adverse events (diarrhea and abdominal pain), and reports of new diagnoses (inflammatory bowel disease, weight gain and irritable bowel syndrome). To lessen the risk of transmissible infections, donor screening should be performed, which includes screening for medical comorbidities and infectious pathogens in blood and feces. Scheduling complexities and reimbursement places an additional roadblock for using FMT. Microbiome-based therapies are being developed to eliminate the logistical challenges related to FMT. Large prospective and placebo-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of FMT, so its use can be justified in clinical practice.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^78f27519]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The microbiota, consisting of the community of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoa organisms that inhabit a mammalian host, can impact susceptibility to a range of diseases including cancer, diabetes, allergy, obesity, and infection –. An altered or dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is observed in all of these disease states suggesting that resetting the intestinal microbiota with a composition of bacteria from healthy individuals could treat disease. This theory is supported by animal studies demonstrating alleviation of disease through transplantation of bacteria into the diseased host's intestinal tract –. Significant advancements have been made in defining the community of microbial species that are important in supporting human health –. Translating these findings into viable microbiota-based therapies has had limited success in the clinic, however, and is not yet considered a treatment option for most diseases impacted by microbial dysbiosis. One notable exception is the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT treatment of C. difficile infection is the first microbiota-based therapy clinically proven to ameliorate disease. Before such treatment strategies can be broadly implemented, the underlying principles determining success for microbiota-based therapy need to be elucidated.

C. difficile, a gram positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe is currently the most common nosocomial infection encountered by hospitalized patients, with nearly a half million patients infected and an estimated 13,000–30,000 deaths annually in the USA alone –. This opportunistic pathogen infects the large intestine following perturbation of the intestinal microbiota. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin are first line treatment options that effectively target the vegetative form of C. difficile, but fail to resolve the underlying condition that promotes infection, a dysbiotic microbiota. Recurrence of C. difficile infection due to repeated failed antibiotic treatments is estimated as high as 25–35% and can cause potentially lethal fulminant colitis. The high recurrence rate following standard antibiotic treatment has spurred the development of new treatment modalities such as FMT. In 2013, the first controlled, double-blinded study reported the superior efficacy of FMT compared to antibiotics in treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. Subsequent studies demonstrate FMT has an 80–90% cure rate in individuals and this treatment option is now incorporated as standard care for recurrent disease in both Europe and the USA –.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^71bfd261]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

Fecal microbiota therapy practical guidance — conventional fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) administration and alternatives: Conventional FMT should be performed with appropriately screened donor stool. Conventional FMT can be delivered via multiple routes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific route. When administering fecal microbiota spores live-brpk and fecal microbiota live-jslm, refer to the manufacturer's package insert for instructions. For patients not interested in fecal microbiota–based therapies, a vancomycin taper, tapered-pulsed fidaxomicin, or bezlotoxumab are reasonable alternative therapies to prevent recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review [^8e0566a1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The role of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is not well-known.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and harms of FMT for CDI.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1980 to January 2015), Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by hand-searching references from systematic reviews and identified studies.

Study Selection

Any study of FMT to treat adult patients with CDI; case reports were only used to report harms.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by 1 author and verified by another; 2 authors independently assessed risk of bias and strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Two randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); 28 case-series studies; and 5 case reports were included. Two RCTs and 21 case-series studies (516 patients receiving FMT) reported using FMT for patients with recurrent CDI. A high proportion of treated patients had symptom resolution; however, the role of previous antimicrobials is unclear. One RCT comparing FMT with 2 control groups (n = 43) reported resolution of symptoms in 81%, 31%, and 23% of the FMT, vancomycin, or vancomycin-plus-bowel lavage groups, respectively (P < 0.001 for both control groups vs. FMT). An RCT comparing FMT route (n = 20) reported no difference between groups (60% in the nasogastric tube group and 80% in the colonoscopy group; P = 0.63). Across all studies for recurrent CDI, symptom resolution was seen in 85% of cases. In 7 case-series studies of patients with refractory CDI, symptom resolution ranged from 0% to 100%. Among 7 patients treated with FMT for initial CDI, results were mixed.

Limitation

Most studies were uncontrolled case-series studies; only 2 RCTs were available for analysis.

Conclusion

Fecal microbiota transplantation may have a substantial effect with few short-term adverse events for recurrent CDI. Evidence is insufficient on FMT for refractory or initial CDI treatment and on whether effects vary by donor, preparation, or delivery method.

### Gaps in knowledge and future directions for the use of faecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^43e3c7cc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The potential role of faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been explored in the treatment of a multitude of diseases, both gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI, structural and functional in nature. A significant proportion of the initial evidence for its efficacy was derived from observational studies, primarily in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). – Despite the small size and heterogeneity of early studies, the consistently positive findings led to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which confirmed the therapeutic role of FMT for this indication. It is recognized that distinctive alterations of both the composition and function of the gut microbiota characterize other GI diseases as well as other non-GI conditions. In particular, some of the initial evidence for its utility in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) came from subgroup analysis of RCTs of CDI and a handful of observational studies. – Although we may be able to translate our knowledge around principles and methodology from FMT studies in CDI, there are specific uncertainties and challenges for the therapeutic use of FMT for IBD that need to be addressed. In this review, we aim to summarize the current gaps in our knowledge regarding FMT in IBD from a clinical and mechanistic perspective, and to highlight potential areas to target and optimize in future studies.

Management of subsequent recurrences of CDI

A second recurrence of CDI can be treated with fidaxomicin (200 mg b.i.d. for 10 days) or by a pulsed or tapping dose of oral vancomycin. Intermittent and tapered vancomycin regimens have been evaluated in an observational study in a cohort of 163 with active recurrent CDI. Of the 163 cases, 44.8% had a recurrence of CDI. A tapering course of vancomycin yielded fewer recurrences (31%, P = 0.01) as did pulsed dosing of vancomycin (14.3%, P = 0.02) compared with a recurrence rate of 45% in patients on other regimens. The data shows that tapered or pulsed dosing regimens of vancomycin leads to an apparent better cure of recurrent CDI.

Bacteriotherapy

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) refers to the infusion of fecal suspension from a healthy donor with the aim of reinstating the gut microbiota of the recipient for curative purposes. The continuous use of antibiotics leads to the suppression of the host gut microbiota leading to a deficiency in microbes, which generally dominate within the gut microbiota and a decrease in the overall microbiome diversity. Less diversity in colonic microbiota in patients with recurrent CDI compared to healthy individuals has also been demonstrated in some studies. The resultant effect allows the overgrowth of C. difficile and the production of toxins leading to CDI and recurrent CDI. Essentially, the role of fecal transplantation of stool from healthy individuals is to reestablish the diverse, "normal" gut microbiome within the colon breaking the cycle of recurrence.

Multiple studies support the safety and efficacy of FMT in the treatment of C. difficile -associated diarrhea in patients with recurrent disease after initial antibiotic therapy. There is also mounting evidence in the efficacy of FMT in severe C. difficile - associated diarrhea. The Food and Drug Administration has approved FMT as an investigational new drug for use in refractory or re-current CDI after failure of standard treatment regimens. Surawicz et al recommend FMT in recurrent or relapsing CDI characterized by at least three episodes of mild-to-moderate CDI with lack of clinical response to a 6–8 week taper with vancomycin with or without an alternative antibiotic. Additionally, Bakken et al have proposed the use of FMT in moderate CDI not responding to standard therapy (vancomycin) for at least a week and severe CDI with no response to standard therapy after 48 h (Table 2).

### Long-term effects on luminal and mucosal microbiota and commonly acquired taxa in faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^0aadaefe]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The microbiota changes both in faeces and mucosa explain the rapid clinical recovery of all patients and the superior long-term efficacy over previous antibiotic treatments. Our results indicate that a specific combination of bacterial taxa seems to underlie the treatment efficacy of FMT for rCDI. This is the first study to show that subject's microbiota could be modified in the long-term to resemble that of the donor. Currently, FMT treatment is considered for several other indications than just the treatment of rCDI. Therefore, our findings give insights into the possibilities of reshaping patients' microbiota relatively permanently.

### Comparing fecal microbiota transplantation to standard-of-care treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6ee6fb72]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a treatment option for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) is well established. Various studies have used different forms and administration routes for FMT. We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to update the clinical knowledge about different FMT modalities for curing rCDI compared with medical treatment (MT).

Patients and Methods

We searched PubMed and Medline from inception through 10 May 2018 for randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing FMT (fresh or frozen) versus MT. We used Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool to assess bias in the RCTs. We estimated odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome using a random effects model. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Results

We included seven RCTs comprising a total of 543 patients with recurrent CDI. There was a nonsignificant trend toward resolution of diarrhea following a single fresh FMT infusion compared with frozen FMT and MT (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 0.78–7.71, P = 0.12, I = 69%). Subgroup analysis of fresh FMT vs. frozen FMT showed no difference between the two groups (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 0.22–20.41, P = 0.51, I = 61%). Frozen FMT infusion through upper route versus lower route showed no difference (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.15–2.54, P = 0.51, I = 0%). There was a nonsignificant trend favoring multiple treatments with FMT versus multiple courses of MT (OR = 3.68, 95% CI = 0.74–18.22, P = 0.11, I = 0%).

Conclusion

FMT is a promising treatment modality for rCDI compared with MT alone. Different forms and routes of FMT administration seem to be equally efficacious. In future, more well-designed RCTs directed at homogenous FMT preparation and delivery methods are required to validate these findings.

### Clostridioides difficile: treating sustained antibiotic responders with fecal microbiota transplantation does not improve efficacy [^4b26b02c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

 — Drekonja et al describe a randomized placebo-controlled trial with lyophilized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) capsules to prevent recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). We believe the results should be interpreted cautiously due to trial design aspects, such as the exclusion criteria and primary endpoint.

Patients with rCDI face high morbidity and mortality, are notoriously difficult to treat with antibiotics alone, and often require additional therapies such as FMT. Given the high risk of rapid recurrence, current guidelines recommend initiating FMT within 4 days after completing antibiotic treatment for rCDI.

Inclusion in the trial required successful antibiotic treatment of rCDI and no signs of recurrence 2–14 days after antibiotics completion. This made patients with refractory disease or early recurrence ineligible, and 2563 (87%) of 2931 potential participants were not included. This likely caused a serious selection bias that severely limits the generalizability of the results. In essence, the study reports the effect of FMT versus placebo in a small subset of patients responding to antibiotics and without early recurrence. If patients had been included regardless of their response to antibiotics or symptom recurrence following its cessation, the results would reflect real-world clinical practice and would have provided valuable data for comparing FMT and placebo for recurrence prevention. The conclusion might even have aligned with the multiple previous studies demonstrating the superiority of FMT.

The primary endpoint was definite or possible rCDI or death within 56 days of randomization. While we agree with the authors that a pragmatic study with patient-centered outcomes is desirable, we find the broad definition of possible recurrence problematic. This definition included all patients with symptoms (diarrhea) regardless of test results, and also patients with no stool samples and patients with negative tests using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) toxin tests.

Factors such as FMT dosing, processing, and donor potentially influenced the observed outcomes. The dosing regimen of 5 FMT capsules administered once was much lower than in previous studies. Unlike most studies using frozen FMT capsules, this study used lyophilized FMT capsules, highlighting the need to evaluate new processing methods. The study included only 4 donors, and if the fecal donations of only 1 or 2 of these were associated with low cure rates, this could contribute to the lack of efficacy.

Statement C1

Previously performed RCTs are, in general, small and methodologically heterogeneous; thus, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at the present time.

Comment: After being successfully used for the treatment of C. difficile infection, FMT has also been investigated in patients with UC, first in non-randomied studies, and then in RCTs, both with promising results, although there were substantial differences in FMT procedures and measured outcomes. Indeed, although these studies and subsequent meta-analyseshighlight satisfactory remission rates following donor FMT administration, published and/or available RCTs are generally small and methodologically heterogeneous, as they differ in timing, number and route of faecal infusions, characteristics of donor faeces versus controls (shams) for FMT, making the resulting outcomes difficult to interpret as a whole, with definitive conclusions unable to be drawn.

Statement C2

FMT is recommended as a treatment option for both mild and severe recurrent or refractory C. difficile infection in patients with IBD.

Comment: FMT is effective for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection in patients without IBD, as well as in patients with UC and CD. However, studies in patients with UC report that UC flares could not be prevented by single-dose FMT. There is insufficient evidence to recommend FMT as a treatment for the first episode of C. difficile infection in IBD.

Statement C3

FMT may be effective in the induction of remission in mild to moderate UC; however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend FMT as a treatment for UC in routine clinical practice and its use should generally be limited to the research setting.

Comment: To date, FMT has shown promising results for the induction of remission in mild to moderate patients with UC. However, these studies were performed in cohorts of patients with UC with a relatively small sample size, as well as variations among study designs, making comparisons among studies difficult to reconcile. For this reason, there are insufficient available data to support the routine clinical use of FMT to induce remission in patients with UC. However, the experts agreed that FMT might be used under specific circumstantial conditions, which should be considered on a case-by-case basis and discussed in detail with all parties concerned.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of REBYOTA was evaluated using a Bayesian analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 study (Study 1), which formally integrated treatment success rates from a placebo-controlled Phase 2 study (Study 2). Enrolled adults in both studies were 18 years of age or older and had a confirmed diagnosis of recurrent CDI (one or more episodes in Study 1; two or more episodes in Study 2) which was defined as diarrhea (passage of 3 or more loose bowel movements within a 24-hour period for 2 consecutive days) and a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin or toxigenic C. difficile, or had at least two episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization within the last year. Enrolled adults were required to have completed at least 10 consecutive days of antibiotic therapy and have their CDI under control (< 3 unformed/loose, i.e. Bristol Stool Scale type 6–7, stools/day for 2 consecutive days). A minimum of 24 hours to a maximum of 72 hours (Study 1) or 24 hours to a maximum of 48 hours (Study 2) antibiotic washout period was required prior to administration of the assigned study treatment. In Study 1, enrolled adults were randomized 2:1 to a single dose of REBYOTA or placebo respectively. In Study 2, randomization was 1:1:1 to receive two doses of REBYOTA, two doses of placebo, or one dose of REBYOTA and one dose of placebo, administered 7 ± 2 days apart. Only data from the REBYOTA one-dose group and the placebo group are described below and were integrated in the Bayesian analysis.

Clostridioides difficile infection — Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) indications, delivery, efficacy, and safety are as follows: In general, conventional antibiotic treatment should be used for at least 2 recurrences (ie, 3 CDI episodes) before offering fecal microbiota transplantation, and randomized, controlled trials have shown similar CDI cure rates after fecal transplants performed with fresh and frozen fecal samples. Although a number of methods of administration have been described, the most common transplant delivery route is via colonoscopy; however, oral capsules were found to be noninferior to colonoscopic delivery for preventing recurrent infection, and overall success rates for fecal transplantation, regardless of the delivery mode, are reported to be between 60% and 90% after a single treatment. A small, randomized, controlled trial compared primary fecal transplant (n = 9) with metronidazole therapy (n = 11) and suggested that transplant may be an alternative to antibiotics in this setting. There have been recent reports of fecal transplantation transmitting infectious agents, and prospective donors should be screened for colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms in addition to more typical infections; furthermore, in June 2019, in response to 2 fecal transplant-related deaths in immunosuppressed patients, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning detailing the importance of obtaining proper patient consent, including a discussion regarding risks related to the therapy.

### Effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on recurrence in multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a randomized trial [^99c21a0f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To date, evidence for the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been limited to case series and open-label clinical trials.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI.

Design

Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01703494).

Setting

Two academic medical centers.

Patients

46 patients who had 3 or more recurrences of CDI and received a full course of vancomycin for their most recent acute episode.

Intervention

Fecal microbiota transplantation with donor stool (heterologous) or patient's own stool (autologous) administered by colonoscopy.

Measurements

The primary end point was resolution of diarrhea without the need for further anti-CDI therapy during the 8-week follow-up. Safety data were compared between treatment groups via review of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and new medical conditions for 6 months after FMT. Fecal microbiota analyses were performed on patients' stool before and after FMT and also on donors' stool.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, 20 of 22 patients (90.9%) in the donor FMT group achieved clinical cure compared with 15 of 24 (62.5%) in the autologous FMT group (P = 0.042). Resolution after autologous FMT differed by site (9 of 10 vs. 6 of 14 [P = 0.033]). All 9 patients who developed recurrent CDI after autologous FMT were free of further CDI after subsequent donor FMT. There were no SAEs related to FMT. Donor FMT restored gut bacterial community diversity and composition to resemble that of healthy donors.

Limitation

The study included only patients who had 3 or more recurrences and excluded those who were immunocompromised and aged 75 years or older.

Conclusion

Donor stool administered via colonoscopy seemed safe and was more efficacious than autologous FMT in preventing further CDI episodes.

### Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a review of risk factors, treatments, and outcomes [^a8eb1db1]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Episodes of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are difficult to treat for several reasons. Foremost, data are lacking to support any particular treatment strategy. In addition, treatment of recurrent episodes is not always successful, and repeated, prolonged treatment is often necessary. Identification of subgroups at risk for recurrent CDI may aid in diagnosing and treating these patients. Two likely mechanistic factors increasing the risk of recurrent CDI are an inadequate immune response to C. difficile toxins and persistent disruption of the normal colonic flora. Important epidemiologic risk factors include advanced age, continuation of other antibiotics, and prolonged hospital stays. Current guidelines recommend that the first recurrent episode be treated with the same agent (i.e., metronidazole or vancomycin) used for the index episode. However, if the first recurrence is characterized as severe, vancomycin should be used. A reasonable strategy for managing a subsequent episode involves tapering followed by pulsed doses of vancomycin. Other potentially effective strategies for recurrent CDI include vancomycin with adjunctive treatments, such as Saccharomyces boulardii, rifaximin "chaser" therapy after vancomycin, nitazoxanide, fecal transplantation, and intravenous immunoglobulin. New treatment agents that are active against C. difficile, but spare critical components of the normal flora, may decrease the incidence of recurrent CDI.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^164f9cf5]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a successful therapeutic strategy for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Despite remarkable efficacy, implementation of FMT therapy is limited and the mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for the immune system in supporting FMT using a murine C. difficile infection system. Following FMT, Rag1 heterozygote mice resolve C. difficile while littermate Rag1 −/− mice fail to clear the infection. Targeted ablation of adaptive immune cell subsets reveal a necessary role for CD4 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells, but not B cells or CD8 + T cells, in FMT-mediated resolution of C. difficile infection. FMT non-responsive mice exhibit exacerbated inflammation, impaired engraftment of the FMT bacterial community and failed restoration of commensal bacteria-derived secondary bile acid metabolites in the large intestine. These data demonstrate that the host's inflammatory immune status can limit the efficacy of microbiota-based therapeutics to treat C. difficile infection.

Pediatric fecal microbiota transplantation outcomes and risks — Limited evidence from case reports and case series in pediatric patients suggests that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via nasogastric tube or colonoscopy can be effective in children with multiply recurrent CDI who have failed standard antibiotic therapy, with follow-up periods up to 16 months. In most reported cases, fecal sample donation was from the child's mother or father. A survey of pediatric infectious diseases physicians revealed that 18% of respondents who reported using alternative therapies for CDI had recommended FMT, most commonly for the treatment of a third or later recurrence. Potential risks noted include procedure-related risks from nasogastric tube or colonoscopy, the potential for transmission of resistant organisms and blood-borne pathogens necessitating donor-screening protocols, and a general concern that FMT might ultimately lead to unexpected adverse events such as metabolic or immune-based disorders.

### Advancements in novel live biotherapeutic products for Clostridioides difficile infection prevention [^56167e76]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The profound impact of the human microbiome on health and disease has captivated the interest of clinical and scientific communities. The human body hosts a vast array of microorganisms collectively forming the human microbiome, which significantly influences various physiological processes and profoundly shapes overall well-being. Notably, the gut stands out as an exceptional reservoir, harboring the most significant concentration of microorganisms, akin to an organ in itself. The gut microbiome's composition and function are influenced by genetics, environment, age, underlying conditions, and antibiotic usage, leading to dysbiosis and pathogenesis, such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Conventional CDI treatment, involving antibiotics like oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin, fails to address dysbiosis and may further disrupt gut microbial communities. Consequently, emerging therapeutic strategies are focused on targeting dysbiosis and restoring gut microbiota to advance CDI therapeutics. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in treating recurrent CDI by transferring processed stool from a healthy donor to a recipient, restoring gut dysbiosis and enhancing bacterial diversity. Moreover, 2 newer Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved live biotherapeutic products (LBP), namely, Fecal Microbiota Live-JSLM and Fecal Microbiota Spores Live-BRPK, have shown promise in preventing CDI recurrence. This review explores the role of the gut microbiota in preventing and treating CDI, with an emphasis on gut-based interventions like FMT and fecal microbiota-based products that hold potential for gut restoration and prevention of CDI recurrence. Understanding the microbiome's impact on CDI prevention and treatment offers valuable insights for advancing future CDI therapeutics.
