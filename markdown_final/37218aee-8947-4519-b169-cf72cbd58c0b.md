## Question

Is it safe to do surgery if Tsh 0.1

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to proceed with surgery when the TSH is 0.1 mU/L, and what preparatory steps or exceptions apply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a TSH of 0.1 mU/L signifies clinically and how to distinguish overt from subclinical hyperthyroidism. Then, I should verify the perioperative guidance from major societies, especially whether euthyroidism is required and what exceptions exist. Next, I will examine the specific perioperative risks, notably thyroid storm, and the quality of evidence. After that, I need to separate thyroid surgery from non-thyroid surgery and consider urgency. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework and provide a direct answer with practical steps, anchored to authoritative guidelines and data.

> Let me first confirm what TSH 0.1 mU/L means physiologically; a TSH of 0.1 mU/L is suppressed below the reference range, which could reflect overt hyperthyroidism if free T4 and/or T3 are elevated, or subclinical hyperthyroidism if free hormones are normal, so I need to check FT4 and FT3 before deciding on risk and treatment implications. Hold on, I should verify thresholds; multiple guidelines flag "persistently < 0.1 mU/L" as a treatment trigger in subclinical hyperthyroidism due to cardiovascular and skeletal risks, especially in older or comorbid patients, so 0.1 mU/L sits at a critical boundary that warrants careful evaluation and likely intervention if persistent [^112EeB4A] [^1119USpW].

> Next, I should review core perioperative recommendations; the 2016 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidance states that patients should be rendered euthyroid with antithyroid drugs, with or without beta-adrenergic blockade, before thyroidectomy, and for Graves' disease a potassium iodide preparation should be added in the immediate preoperative period, whereas iodine should be avoided preoperatively in toxic nodular disease, which I should double-check in the differential [^113dNyXM] [^116sFuV9] [^111MrZSu]. I need to ensure I consider the ATA exception clause that allows proceeding in urgent situations or when antithyroid drugs cannot be used, but only with an experienced surgical and anesthesia team and aggressive preparation, so I should confirm urgency and team expertise if contemplating this path [^113zg7fW].

> I will now examine subclinical hyperthyroidism–specific risks because they often drive preoperative decision-making; when TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L, the ATA recommends treatment in adults ≥ 65 years, in those with cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis, in postmenopausal women not on bone-protective therapy, or in symptomatic patients, given increased risks of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, bone loss, and progression to overt hyperthyroidism, so I should risk-stratify along these axes before surgery [^112EeB4A] [^1119USpW] [^112DJd5K]. Wait, let me verify bone and cardiac data; yes, pooled observational evidence supports AF and HF increases in older adults and fracture risk in postmenopausal women, reinforcing preoperative optimization rather than proceeding while biochemically hyperthyroid [^112DJd5K].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering perioperative thyroid storm; cases of storm have been reported during non-thyroidal operations in undiagnosed or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism with substantial morbidity and mortality, which means I need to ensure vigilant preparation and monitoring if surgery cannot be deferred, and I should confirm an anesthesia plan that anticipates tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, and hyperthermia [^116yRRhR] [^113Vt6Vm]. I should double-check the evidence base; a systematic review suggests the quality of evidence on storm risk by preoperative regimen is low, yet given the severity of storm, guidelines appropriately err on the side of achieving euthyroidism and using multimodal blockade if urgent surgery is unavoidable [^1124cN4k] [^113zg7fW].

> But wait, what about studies suggesting surgery can be done without full biochemical control; one retrospective series reported similar overall complications when operating on uncontrolled versus controlled hyperthyroid patients, though uncontrolled patients had more intraoperative tachycardia, and the study did not focus on patients at the specific TSH threshold of 0.1 mU/L, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize and should weigh guideline consensus more heavily given study bias and heterogeneity [^115qP5MH]. Let me reconsider external validation; a separate analysis found that guideline-compliant preparation reduced tachycardia without clear differences in major complications, which suggests physiologic instability may be mitigated by prep even if composite outcomes were similar, supporting optimization as standard practice [^112pij5X].

> I need to distinguish surgery type because management differs by indication; for thyroidectomy to treat hyperthyroidism, rendering the patient euthyroid with thionamides and beta-blockade is the norm, adding potassium iodide immediately preop in Graves' disease and avoiding iodine in toxic nodular disease, while non-thyroid elective surgery should be postponed until hyperthyroidism is controlled unless there is true urgency requiring the ATA exception protocol with an experienced team, so I should confirm the indication and urgency explicitly [^113dNyXM] [^116sFuV9] [^111MrZSu] [^113zg7fW]. I should verify that all stakeholders agree on urgency and on intraoperative monitoring plans before proceeding outside a euthyroid state [^113zg7fW].

> Now, let me lay out a clinical decision framework and self-check each step; first, assess urgency, with elective cases deferred until control is achieved and urgent cases proceeding only after intensive preparation; second, risk-stratify by age, cardiac and bone health, and symptom burden given the threshold of TSH 0.1 mU/L; third, optimize preoperatively with methimazole (or propylthiouracil if indicated), beta-blockade, and in Graves' disease add potassium iodide in the immediate preop window, with consideration of corticosteroids and cholestyramine in severe thyrotoxicosis; initially, I was going to target a TSH of 0.5–2.5 mU/L, but wait, let me verify physiology because TSH can lag for weeks, so the safer, guideline-concordant target is normalization of FT4 and FT3 with clinical euthyroidism rather than insisting on a normalized TSH before proceeding, which I need to ensure I document clearly [^113dNyXM] [^116sFuV9] [^113zg7fW]. Next, I should review using the Burch–Wartofsky scale preoperatively in unstable patients to quantify storm risk and guide aggressiveness of blockade, and I must confirm anesthesia and surgical team experience and readiness for storm management if urgency compels surgery before full control [^1155Zeya] [^113zg7fW].

> Let me consider special populations; in adults ≥ 65 years, in patients with cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or in postmenopausal women not on estrogens or bisphosphonates, a TSH persistently < 0.1 mU/L pushes strongly toward treatment prior to any elective surgery due to excess AF, HF, and fracture risks, so I should double-check whether the patient falls into one of these groups and treat accordingly even if asymptomatic [^112EeB4A] [^1119USpW] [^112DJd5K]. In pregnancy, if thyroidectomy is absolutely necessary for hyperthyroidism, I need to ensure surgery is timed for the second trimester when feasible and that euthyroid status is targeted beforehand, which I should confirm with obstetric collaboration [^117GYwzY].

> Synthesis and direct answer time; no, proceeding with elective surgery at a TSH of 0.1 mU/L is not considered safe standard practice, because this level implies untreated or undertreated thyrotoxicosis that increases perioperative instability and thyroid storm risk, and the ATA recommends rendering patients euthyroid before thyroidectomy and controlling hyperthyroidism prior to non-thyroid elective procedures, reserving urgent exceptions for experienced teams using aggressive preoperative measures, which I should verify are in place if surgery cannot be delayed [^113dNyXM] [^113zg7fW]. Key nuance is that 0.1 mU/L is also the treatment trigger threshold for subclinical hyperthyroidism in many adults due to cardiac and bone risks, so deferral to achieve control is appropriate even when FT4 and FT3 are normal, particularly in older or comorbid patients [^112EeB4A] [^1119USpW].

> Practically, I would double-check the diagnosis and severity by obtaining free T4, total or free T3, ECG, and clinical assessment, start or optimize methimazole with beta-blockade aiming for normalization of FT4/FT3 and symptom control, add potassium iodide shortly before surgery if Graves' disease is the etiology, avoid preop iodine in toxic nodular disease, and incorporate steroids if severe, while coordinating with an experienced endocrine surgeon and anesthesiologist and using a storm risk score when instability is suspected, documenting informed consent about storm, arrhythmia, and hemodynamic risks if urgency necessitates proceeding prior to full biochemical control [^116sFuV9] [^111MrZSu] [^1155Zeya] [^113zg7fW]. Hold on, I should verify once more that FT4/FT3, not TSH, are my immediate perioperative biochemical targets given TSH lag, and adjust the plan accordingly before clearing the patient for surgery [^113dNyXM].

Elective surgery is generally deferred when TSH is 0.1 mIU/L, as this suggests **subclinical hyperthyroidism** [^113zg7fW]. This condition increases the risk of **perioperative complications**, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and thyroid storm, especially in patients ≥ 65 years or with cardiac risk factors. Postpone elective surgery until the patient is **euthyroid** [^113dNyXM] with antithyroid drugs and beta-blockers. If urgent, use beta-blockers, potassium iodide [^113zg7fW], and corticosteroids as needed, and monitor closely.

---

## Clinical significance of TSH 0.1 mIU/L

A TSH of 0.1 mIU/L indicates **subclinical hyperthyroidism**, defined by a suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and T3 [^112DJd5K]. It is associated with increased risks of **atrial fibrillation**, heart failure, osteoporosis [^112EeB4A], and progression to overt hyperthyroidism, particularly in older adults or those with cardiac risk factors [^1128JKhP].

---

## Perioperative risks associated with suppressed TSH

Patients with suppressed TSH face **significant perioperative risks**, including:

- **Cardiovascular complications**: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias, and heart failure exacerbation [^112DJd5K].

- **Thyroid storm**: A rare but life-threatening complication characterized by hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, and altered mental status [^1124cN4k].

- **Increased metabolic demand**: Hypermetabolic state leading to increased oxygen consumption and potential perioperative instability [^111Q7npZ].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) provide clear guidance on perioperative management of hyperthyroid patients: ATA guidelines (2016) recommend achieving **euthyroidism** [^113dNyXM] with antithyroid drugs (methimazole) and beta-blockers [^116sFuV9] before elective surgery and recommend potassium iodide in the immediate preoperative period for Graves' disease [^113zg7fW]. ETA guidelines (2018) similarly advise restoring **euthyroidism** with antithyroid drugs before surgery to avoid perioperative complications [^116ShVhC].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Clinical studies consistently show increased perioperative risks in patients with suppressed TSH: a systematic review underscores the **thyroid storm risk** [^1124cN4k] in untreated hyperthyroid patients undergoing surgery, highlighting the importance of preoperative preparation. Cardiovascular complications are more frequent in **subclinical hyperthyroidism**, with higher risks of atrial fibrillation [^112EeB4A] and cardiovascular events, particularly in older adults [^112DJd5K].

---

## Recommended preoperative management

To minimize perioperative risks, the following preoperative management strategies are recommended:

- **Antithyroid drugs**: Methimazole is the first-line treatment to normalize thyroid hormone levels [^113dNyXM].

- **Beta-blockers**: Propranolol or atenolol to control heart rate and reduce sympathetic symptoms [^113zg7fW].

- **Potassium iodide**: Administered preoperatively to reduce thyroid hormone release [^112P1UBU].

- **Corticosteroids**: Considered in specific cases to reduce peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require special consideration: Elderly patients have an increased risk of **cardiovascular complications** [^112EeB4A], making careful monitoring and aggressive preoperative management essential. Patients with cardiac risk factors face a higher risk of **perioperative arrhythmias** and **heart failure** [^112DJd5K]; thorough cardiac evaluation and optimization are necessary.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Surgery in patients with a TSH level of 0.1 mIU/L carries significant perioperative risks, including cardiovascular complications and thyroid storm. Elective surgery should be postponed until the patient is rendered **euthyroid** through appropriate medical management [^113dNyXM]. If surgery is urgent, aggressive perioperative management and close monitoring are essential to minimize complications [^113zg7fW].

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^113zg7fW]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for Graves' disease, more specifically with respect to preoperative care, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend adequately treating the patient with β-adrenergic blockers, potassium iodide, corticosteroids, and potentially cholestyramine in the immediate preoperative period. This is particularly important in exceptional circumstances when it is not possible to render a patient with GD euthyroid before thyroidectomy, the need for thyroidectomy is urgent, or when the patient is allergic to antithyroid drugs. It is crucial to ensure that the surgeon and anesthesiologist have experience in managing this situation.

The 2016 ATA guidelines recommend treating subclinical hyperthyroidism when TSH is persistently less than 0.1 mU/L in specific clinical settings. These include:

- **Patients aged 65 years or older**: Special consideration should be given to this age group due to associated risks.

- **Patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease, or osteoporosis**: Treatment is advised in the presence of these underlying health issues.

- **Postmenopausal women not on estrogens or bisphosphonates**: Attention is required as these patients may be at increased risk for bone-related complications.

- **Patients with symptoms**: Treatment is recommended when symptoms attributable to hyperthyroidism are present.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: When to consider treatment [^112DJd5K]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g. in Graves' disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), the administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive replacement therapy.

The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodine-deficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density with an increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear.

A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level.

### European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES) consensus statement on advanced thyroid cancer: Definitions and management [^116twX58]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Advanced thyroid cancer is a foreboding disease, characterized by locoregional infiltration of vital structures of the aerodigestive tract and/or distant metastases, and thus accompanied by high rates of morbidity, worsening of quality of life, and high risk of recurrence and death.

After completing the preoperative evaluation, diagnostic procedures, and MDT assessment, patients should be fully informed about expectations regarding possible complications, postoperative outcomes, and chances of disease-free survival and death. In general, patient information should include the type and extent of operation, use of neuromonitoring and autofluorescence, duration of hospital stay, rate of complications, and risk of recurrence or reoperation.

As advanced thyroid cancer may affect voice, breathing, and swallowing functions, the complications should be presented in detail, and the morbidity depending on operation extent should be clarified thoroughly. It is also of paramount importance to present the patient with the imminent risks of selecting a more conservative or neoadjuvant treatment, delaying surgery, or opting for no intervention at all.

The feasibility of achieving complete locoregional clearance of disease, and how it will be proven after operation, should also be included during the patient consent process. Treatment of advanced thyroid cancer may involve a long-term intertwined multidisciplinary process, and thus the potential postoperative types of treatment, depending on thyroid cancer histology, and their possible complications, should be addressed.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with unknown hyperthyroidism during nonthyroidal surgery-a case report and literature review [^116yRRhR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid storm (TS) is a critical manifestation of hyperthyroidism. In recent years, the risk of perioperative TS has significantly decreased in patients with hyperthyroidism undergoing thyroid surgeries with adequate preoperative preparations. However, those who undergo non-thyroidal operations have a higher risk of TS due to easily ignoring the evaluation of thyroid function. This case report presents a patient with TS during nonthyroidal surgery and reviews similar cases in the literature.

- **Case presentation**: A middle-aged female who received unilateral total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia developed refractory tachycardia during the operation and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism via laboratory tests after surgery. She was suggestive of TS based on the Burch and Wartofsky scoring system and was relieved after etiological treatments. She was discharged 10 days after surgery and continued to take antithyroid medication.

- **Conclusion**: We recommend that a comprehensive history collection is warranted. The clinical manifestations of TS during operations could be versatile and atypical. Any abnormalities, such as abnormal heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, or unusual anesthetics needed during an operation, should not be ignored. In surgeries with general anesthesia, it is necessary to be cautious about TS with an atypical manifestation of tachycardia. Once suspected, supportive and resuscitative treatment, along with antithyroid medication, should be promptly initiated.

### Recurrence after low-dose radioiodine ablation and recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone for differentiated thyroid cancer (HiLo): Long-term results of an open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial [^111wa6NU]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Two large randomized trials of patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer, reported in 2012 (HiLo and ESTIMABL1), found similar post-ablation success rates at 6–9 months between a low administered radioactive iodine (131 I) dose (1.1 GBq) and the standard high dose (3.7 GBq). However, recurrence rates following radioactive iodine ablation have previously only been reported in observational studies and recently in ESTIMABL1. This study aimed to compare recurrence rates between radioactive iodine doses in HiLo.

HiLo was a non-inferiority, parallel, open-label, randomized controlled factorial trial conducted at 29 centers in the UK. Eligible patients were aged 16–80 years with histological confirmation of differentiated thyroid cancer requiring radioactive iodine ablation (performance status 0–2, tumor stage T1–T3 with the possibility of lymph-node involvement, but no distant metastasis and no microscopic residual disease, and one-stage or two-stage total thyroidectomy). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to 1.1 GBq or 3.7 GBq ablation, each prepared with either recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) or thyroid hormone withdrawal. Patients were followed up at annual clinic visits. Recurrences were diagnosed at each hospital using a combination of established methods according to national standards. Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios (HRs) were used for time to first recurrence, which was a pre-planned secondary outcome.

Between January 16, 2007, and July 1, 2010, 438 patients were randomly assigned.

### Recurrence after low-dose radioiodine ablation and recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone for differentiated thyroid cancer (HiLo): Long-term results of an open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial [^117JG6Mg]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Patients were given an intramuscular injection of 0.9 mg rhTSH on each of the two days before ablation. In the thyroid hormone withdrawal group, thyroxine (200 μg per day as the average dose) was discontinued four weeks before ablation in 11 patients, and triiodothyronine (60 μg per day as the average dose) was discontinued for two weeks in 204 patients (the drug used was missing for four patients). Radioactive iodine ablation was administered one month to six months after surgery, at a dose of 1.1 GBq or 3.7 GBq depending on the study group allocation. Discharge from hospital isolation took place after satisfactory assessment of radiation risk and clinical conditions.

Following the assessment scan at 6–9 months after radioactive iodine ablation, all patients were meant to be seen in the clinic annually, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on head and neck cancers and British Thyroid Association (BTA) guidelines. Participating hospitals were actively contacted at least annually for patient outcomes. Data on adverse events were not collected during follow-up.

This report focuses on recurrence, which was a pre-specified secondary outcome of the HiLo trial, and was defined as any evidence of (usually structural) disease identified during follow-up. Patients were diagnosed according to national standards using serum thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin antibody, ultrasound, fine needle aspiration cytology, radioactive iodine scans, PET-CT scans, and MRI, as applicable. These tests were used either together or as individual methods.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Although there was no suggestion in the studies we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empirical evidence from various sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Although TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, bringing it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines and research.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1119USpW]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Graves' disease, particularly in relation to subclinical hyperthyroidism, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend considering treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism when TSH is persistently below the lower limit of normal (LLN) but greater than or equal to 0.1 mU/L. This recommendation applies to patients aged 65 years or older, as well as patients with cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

### Executive summary of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^113BLkVG]. Annals of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to develop evidence-based recommendations for safe, effective, and appropriate thyroidectomy. Surgical management of thyroid disease has evolved considerably over several decades, leading to variability in rendered care. Over 100,000 thyroid operations are performed annually in the United States.

The medical literature from January 1, 1985, to November 9, 2018, was reviewed by a panel of 19 experts in thyroid disorders representing multiple disciplines. The authors used the best available evidence to construct surgical management recommendations. Levels of evidence were determined using the American College of Physicians grading system, and management recommendations were discussed to consensus. Members of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of the content.

These clinical guidelines analyze the indications for thyroidectomy as well as its definitions, technique, morbidity, and outcomes. Specific topics include:

- **Pathogenesis and epidemiology**: initial evaluation, imaging, fine needle aspiration biopsy diagnosis, molecular testing
- **Surgical procedures**: indications, extent and outcomes of surgery, preoperative care, initial thyroidectomy, perioperative tissue diagnosis
- **Additional surgeries**: nodal dissection, parathyroidectomy
- **Conditions and treatments**: hyperthyroid conditions, goiter, adjuncts and approaches in laryngology
- **Special considerations**: familial thyroid cancer, postoperative care and complications, cancer management, reoperation

Evidence-based guidelines were created to assist clinicians in the optimal surgical management of thyroid disease.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^113pqc6f]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency.

Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Novel recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone in aiding postoperative assessment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer-phase I/II study [^1129ha7c]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH, ZGrhTSH) as an alternative to thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW), which inevitably induces hypothyroidism in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in China.

- **Methods**: A total of 64 DTC patients were enrolled. The dose-escalation cohort included 24 patients equally grouped into four dosage categories: 0.9 mg×1 day, 0.9 mg×2 days, 1.8 mg×1 day, and 1.8 mg×2 days. Additionally, 40 patients were enrolled in the dose-expansion cohort receiving 0.9 mg×2 days. All patients underwent both the ZGrhTSH phase and a levothyroxine (L-T4) withdrawal phase for self-comparison in terms of TSH levels, radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake, stimulated thyroglobulin level, and quality of life (QoL).

- **Results**: During the ZGrhTSH phase, no major serious adverse events were observed. Mild symptoms such as headache occurred in 6.3% of patients, lethargy in 4.7%, and asthenia in 3.1%, all resolving spontaneously within 2 days. Concordant RAI uptake was observed in 89.1% (57/64) of patients between ZGrhTSH and L-T4 withdrawal phases. The concordant thyroglobulin level, with a cut-off of 1 μg/L, was noted in 84.7% (50/59) of patients without anti-thyroglobulin antibody interference. The QoL was significantly better during the ZGrhTSH phase compared to the L-T4 withdrawal phase, indicated by lower Billewicz (-51.30 ± 4.70 vs. -39.10 ± 16.61, P < 0.001) and POMS (91.70 ± 16.70 vs. 100.40 ± 22.11, P = 0.011) scores, where lower scores are better. Serum TSH levels rose from a basal level of 0.11 ± 0.12 mU/L to a peak of 122.11 ± 42.44 mU/L, 24 hours after the last dose of ZGrhTSH.

### Recurrence after low-dose radioiodine ablation and recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone for differentiated thyroid cancer (HiLo): Long-term results of an open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial [^111haWjE]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Two large randomised trials of patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer, reported in 2012 (HiLo and ESTIMABL1), found similar post-ablation success rates at 6–9 months between a low administered radioactive iodine (¹³¹I) dose (1.1 GBq) and the standard high dose (3.7 GBq). However, recurrence rates following radioactive iodine ablation have previously only been reported in observational studies, and recently in ESTIMABL1. We aimed to compare recurrence rates between radioactive iodine doses in HiLo.

- **Methods**: HiLo was a non-inferiority, parallel, open-label, randomised controlled factorial trial conducted at 29 centres in the UK. Eligible patients were aged 16–80 years with histological confirmation of differentiated thyroid cancer requiring radioactive iodine ablation. They had a performance status of 0–2, tumour stage T1-T3 with the possibility of lymph-node involvement but no distant metastasis, no microscopic residual disease, and one-stage or two-stage total thyroidectomy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to 1.1 GBq or 3.7 GBq ablation, each prepared with either recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) or thyroid hormone withdrawal. Patients were followed up at annual clinic visits, where recurrences were diagnosed at each hospital using a combination of established methods according to national standards. Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios (HRs) were used for time to first recurrence, which was a pre-planned secondary outcome. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00415233.

- **Results**: Between Jan 16, 2007, and July 1, 2010, 438

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115fEw2k]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Graves' disease, specifically in the context of subclinical hyperthyroidism, the 2016 ATA guidelines recommend considering treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism if the TSH level is persistently below 0.1 mU/L in asymptomatic patients under 65 years of age.

### A clinical risk score for thyroid hormone therapy after partial thyroidectomy [^117EkdMP]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). High credibility.

The need for thyroid hormone therapy (levothyroxine [LT4]) after partial thyroidectomy varies with clinical factors, including the preoperative thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and diagnosis. The goal of this study was to develop an easy-to-use clinical risk score to predict the need for LT4 after partial thyroidectomy.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent partial thyroidectomy between 2013 and 2020 at a single institution. The primary outcome was postoperative LT4 therapy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression evaluated the relationship between covariates and LT4 therapy. Covariates selected by lasso regression as significantly associated with LT4 therapy were incorporated into a weighted risk score. Performance characteristics for the risk score were assessed.

- **Results**: Of 425 patients, the median preoperative TSH was 1.4 uIU/mL (interquartile range: 0.9–2.0), and 101 patients (23.8%) had a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. In total, 41.9% (n = 178) of patients required LT4 supplement after partial thyroidectomy. On multivariable logistic regression, non-Black race (odds ratio [OR]: 3.40, P < 0.001), preoperative TSH ≥ 1.59 (OR: 3.51, P < 0.001), and cancer diagnosis (OR: 2.08, P < 0.001) remained significantly associated with LT4 therapy and were incorporated into a clinical risk score. Rates of LT4 use increased with risk score points (0–2: 14%; 3–4: 34%; 5–6: 58%; 7–8: 75%). The model had a negative predictive value of 75% for LT4 therapy.

- **Conclusions**: This simple risk score can be easily derived from data.

### Prediction of thyroid hormone supplementation after thyroid lobectomy [^117TTrc1]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Thyroid function, as assessed by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, was evaluated in patients after thyroid lobectomy. These assessments were analyzed against perioperative measurements to determine if any of these preoperative values were predictive of postoperative hypothyroidism and the need for postoperative levothyroxine treatment.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study, data from 276 thyroid lobectomy patients were examined. These surgeries occurred over the period from January 2003 to December 2012. Age, sex, volume of resected thyroid, thyroiditis, preoperative free T4, TSH, and microsomal antibody levels were analyzed for correlation with postoperative levothyroxine supplementation.

- **Results**: The overall percentage of the patients taking postoperative levothyroxine was 23.6%. The preoperative TSH level showed strong correlation with TSH levels measured one month postoperatively (P < 0.001). Patients with preoperative TSH > 2.5 mIU/L and positive microsomal antibody showed significant correlation with postoperative levothyroxine supplementation. Among individuals with TSH > 2.5 mIU/L and positive microsomal antibody, 77.8% required levothyroxine replacement (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The most significant preoperative predictors for levothyroxine supplementation are high preoperative TSH levels and positive microsomal antibody status.

### Thyroid-stimulating hormone, age, and tumor size are risk factors for progression during active surveillance of low-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma in adults [^112Qx8ju]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Establishment of the detailed TSH score, TSH level was measured using an Architect TSH (Abbott, Japan LLC, Tokyo, Japan) until December 2018 and an Elecsys TSH (Roche Diagnostics KK, Tokyo, Japan) after January 2019, according to the manufacturers' recommendations. These assays are well approved and used in many countries. However, there are differences between them. Specifically, the lowest detection levels were < 0.003 mIU/mL until 2018 (Architect) and < 0.005 mIU/mL after 2019 (Elecsys), and the ranges of normal values were 0.3–5 mIU/mL until 2018 (Architect) and 0.5–5 mIU/mL after 2019 (Elecsys).

Cooper et al. created a TSH score system for the evaluation of the possible effects of TSH on disease progression in differentiated thyroid cancer, which has been used by others. To minimize the bias of the different measurement values, we adopted the TSH score instead of actual TSH values. Since we wanted to analyze the possible effect of TSH in detail, we modified the original score system into a novel detailed TSH score system.

For the new system, TSH scores are defined as the following:

- **Lower than the detection limit**.
- **Detectable and < 0.05 mIU/mL**.
- **2.5, ≥ 0.05 mIU/mL and less than the lower normal limit**.
- **Within the normal range and lower than the mean of the normal ranges**.
- **3.5, within the normal range and higher than the mean of the normal ranges**.
- **Higher than the upper normal limit**.

Since the intervals between patients' visits were uneven, they were considered when the average TSH score was calculated. This was done using the following formula:

### Thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression in low-risk papillary thyroid cancer: A large-scale retrospective analysis of real-world data [^1172Eb2M]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Over 500,000 new cases of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) are diagnosed globally each year, the vast majority of which are classified as low-risk. Although thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression is traditionally recommended for all postoperative PTCs in guidelines, its necessity remains highly controversial in low-risk patients. Since relevant recommendations in guidelines are still empirical, this study aims to provide direct, large-scale, real-world evidence.

- **Methods**: This large-scale, real-world, retrospective study included 11,140 low-risk PTC patients from two Chinese large-volume centers: Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) and Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CH-CAMS). These patients were treated from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2022. The mean TSH level was calculated based on postoperative serum TSH values during follow-up. The primary outcome was the association between postoperative TSH level and structural recurrence assessed by Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, multivariate Cox regression analyses, and equivalence testing by the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for confounders among groups.

- **Findings**: A total of 11,140 patients with low-risk PTC were included, with a median follow-up of 70 months. Based on the mean TSH level, patients were classified into the following groups: ≤ 0.5 mU/L (n = 1,504, 13.5%), 0.5–1 mU/L (n = 4,336, 38.9%), 1–2 mU/L (n = 4,285, 38.5%), 2–3 mU/L (n = 704, 6.3%), and > 3 mU/L (n = 311, 2.8%). Following PSM adjustment for age, sex, T and N stage, 8,991 patients were included for further analysis.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have provided guidance on when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for detecting thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction due to a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation.

- **Thyroid scientific committee statement**: The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE highlights the difference between screening and case-based testing in clinical practice. Thyroid dysfunction should frequently be considered as a potential etiology for many nonspecific complaints physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions depend on accurate diagnosis. Therefore, we advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, identifying persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from treatment.

The American Thyroid Association's 2016 guidelines address perioperative care for hyperthyroidism, specifically concerning pre-radioactive iodine (RAI) corticosteroid coverage. The guidelines suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of prophylactic corticosteroids in smokers who receive radioactive iodine and do not have evidence of Graves' ophthalmopathy.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^116Q5nJk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a one-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of FNAB samples; for the vast majority, a systematic cervical US examination with assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy.

After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced in comparison with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery.

When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient, in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For health professionals, this means learning to work with…

### 2016 American thyroid association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1155Zeya]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for thyroid storm, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend stratifying patients using a validated scale. Patients with a Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale of ≥ 45 and evidence of systemic decompensation require aggressive therapy. The decision to use aggressive therapy in patients with a Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale of 25–44 should be based on clinical judgment.

### Assessing American Thyroid Association guidelines for total thyroidectomy in Graves' disease [^112pij5X]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Low credibility.

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) issued specific preoperative preparatory guidelines for patients undergoing thyroidectomy for the treatment of Graves' disease. Our goal is to determine if compliance with these guidelines is associated with better outcomes.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database identified 228 patients with Graves' disease who underwent total thyroidectomy between August 2007 and May 2015. Patients treated in compliance with ATA guidelines were compared with those not in full compliance with the preparatory guidelines.

- **Results**: At the time of surgery, 52% of all patients followed ATA guidelines. Patients who were prepped per ATA guidelines had fewer episodes of intraoperative tachycardia (0.3 versus 4.5, P = 0.04) but had no difference in peak systolic blood pressure or in the number of episodes of systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg. ATA prepped and non-prepped patients had similar mean operating room time and length of stay. They also had similar complication rates, including transient hypocalcemia (30.4% versus 25.5%, P = 0.45), prolonged hypoparathyroidism (0.98% versus 4.3%, P = 0.15), hoarse voice (10.8% versus 7.5%, P = 0.42), permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (2.9% versus 2.1%, P = 0.71), and hematoma (2.9% versus 0%, P = 0.09).

- **Conclusions**: Our data suggest that compliance with ATA guidelines for thyroidectomy preparation is not essential for a successful surgical outcome. Although preparation per the guidelines decreased the frequency of intraoperative tachycardia, it did not significantly impact other surgical outcomes.

### Is thyroidectomy in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis more risky [^111UEfWq]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2012). Low credibility.

Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies, such as antithyroperoxidase, which leads to the destruction of the thyroid gland and a decrease in normal thyroid function. Thyroidectomy is performed when the patient presents with symptoms or potential neoplastic degeneration occurs; however, surgery can be difficult because of the dense inflammatory process around the thyroid gland. We hypothesized that patients with HT may have a higher rate of complications after thyroid surgery.

- **Methods**: We identified 1791 consecutive patients who underwent thyroidectomy from May 1994 to December 2009. Patients with HT were compared with those without HT regarding outcomes, using analysis of variance and chi-square test (SPSS, Inc).

- **Results**: Patients with HT were significantly younger and more likely to be female. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of malignancy; however, patients undergoing thyroidectomy with HT had a significantly higher postoperative complication rate. Specifically, the rates of overall, transient, and permanent complications were all increased in HT patients.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with HT had a higher rate of complications after thyroidectomy compared with those without HT. Therefore, careful consideration must be taken before pursuing operative treatment in patients with HT, including providing adequate informed consent regarding the increased risks of surgery.

### Recurrence after low-dose radioiodine ablation and recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone for differentiated thyroid cancer (HiLo): Long-term results of an open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial [^1165ErDL]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Results excluding the potential secondary malignancy are presented in the appendix (pp 4–6). Among the 147 intermediate-risk patients, defined as either T3 or N1 according to the ATA 2015 risk classification system, there were 12 recurrences: five (7.1%) of 70 in the low-dose group and seven (9.1%) of 77 in the high-dose group (p = 0.67). In the remaining 287 low-risk patients, there were nine recurrences: six (4.1%) of 147 in the low-dose group and three (2.1%) of 140 in the high-dose group (p = 0.35).

A further dose of radioactive iodine, usually greater than 3 GBq with a mean dose of approximately 5 GBq, was administered to 22 (10%) of 217 patients in the low-dose (1.1 GBq) group and nine (4%) of 217 in the high-dose (3.7 GBq) group (p = 0.02), due to thyroid remnant in 16 patients in the low-dose group and five in the high-dose group. No re-ablations were done for recurrence according to information provided by the centres. These data were nearly the same as those in the original report (21 patients in the 1.1 GBq group vs nine in the 3.7 GBq group); no other additional doses were reported by the centres.

Some of these further doses were due to overtreatment by some clinicians for faint temporary neck uptake following low-dose radioactive iodine treatment, which is known to disappear with time and is of no clinical significance. In a sensitivity analysis excluding the 31 patients with further ablations, six recurrences were reported in the low-dose group and seven in the high-dose group.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^116tzkNS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly concerning parathyroidectomy, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend surgery for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism when one or more of the following conditions are present. This includes asymptomatic patients if there are no contraindications:

- **Serum calcium levels**: Serum calcium levels are ≥ 1 mg/dL (≥ 0.25 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal (ULN).

- **Skeletal involvement**: This includes conditions such as fractures identified by vertebral fracture assessment or vertebral X-ray, or bone mineral density with a T-score ≤ -2.5 at any site.

- **Renal involvement**: This is indicated by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance (CrCl), or hypercalciuria (urinary calcium > 250 mg/day in women; > 300 mg/day in men).

- **Age consideration**: Patients younger than 50 years do not require any other indications; age < 50 years is a sufficient indication for surgery.

### Surgical treatment of hyperthyroidism can be performed safely before a euthyroid state is achieved [^115qP5MH]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

The 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend that hyperthyroid patients should be euthyroid before thyroidectomy. This recommendation is based on low-quality evidence. In this retrospective cohort study, we compare peri- and post-operative outcomes of patients with hyperthyroidism who were controlled versus uncontrolled at the time of thyroidectomy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed on 275 hyperthyroidism patients at a single institution from December 2015 to November 2022. Patients were defined as hyperthyroid if they had a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism with at least one suppressed thyrotropin (TSH). Patients were considered uncontrolled if triiodothyronine or thyroxine (T4) was elevated immediately before surgery. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes were compared with Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, as appropriate.

- **Results**: Of the 275 patients, 84.3% were women and 51.3% were uncontrolled at the time of surgery. Controlled patients had higher median [interquartile range] TSH (0.4 [0.0, 2.4] mIU/L vs. 0.0 [0.0, 0.0] mIU/L, p < 0.001) and lower free T4 (fT4) (0.9 [0.7, 1.1] ng/dL vs. 3.1 [1.9, 4.4] ng/dL, p < 0.001), respectively. Uncontrolled patients were more likely to be diagnosed with Grave's disease (85.1% vs. 67.9%, p < 0.001) and to undergo surgery due to medication intolerance (12.1% vs. 6%) or history of thyroid storm (6.4% vs. 1.5%) (p = 0.008). Uncontrolled patients were also more likely to take a larger number of preoperative medications (2.3 vs. 1.4, p < 0.001).

### Treatment and follow-up of low-risk patients with thyroid cancer [^115BNsZm]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

The postoperative administration of radioiodine can be avoided in low-risk patients with undetectable TSH-stimulated serum thyroglobulin and no lymph-node metastases detected at surgery. Sensitive methods for serum thyroglobulin determination can be used to avoid TSH stimulation 9–12 months after surgery in low-risk patients who have an undetectable serum thyroglobulin on levothyroxine treatment; the role of these sensitive assays in the period immediately after surgery needs to be established by further studies. Finally, a low activity of radioiodine (1.1 GBq) should be administered selectively in low-risk patients receiving levothyroxine treatment following injections of recombinant human TSH. These modifications of protocols will improve the quality of life of patients, potentially decrease morbidity, and considerably reduce the cost of treatment and follow-up.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with unknown hyperthyroidism during nonthyroidal surgery-a case report and literature review [^113Vt6Vm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

When considering the possibility of hyperthyroidism, thyroid hormone level is the best indicator for detecting thyroid dysfunction. Once hyperthyroidism is confirmed, the etiology should be explored. Graves' disease (GD) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, followed by toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) and single toxic adenoma (TA). Guidelines recommend measuring TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) as the initial step in differentiating GD from other causes of thyrotoxicosis. In our case, the endocrinologist recommended the TRAb test; unfortunately, it was not available in our center at that time. If the etiology is unclear after TRAb testing, radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) can be used. RAIU and thyroid scan are usually done together to measure overall thyroid function in hyperthyroidism and to help differentiate among different causes. High uptake with a diffused homogeneous pattern usually suggests GD. TMNG will have high or normal uptake in a patchy pattern, and TA will have a solitary area of high uptake with low uptake in the remainder. High uptake with a diffused pattern and no nodule palpated in the thyroid suggested GD for our patient. Thyroid uptake (lasting 24 hours) takes a relatively long time and can be chosen for preoperative assessment. However, in an emergency, thyroid ultrasound with color flow Doppler is recommended. Gland vascularity is generally increased in GD, indicating increased gland activity. For our patient, we failed to use ultrasound to promptly ascertain the etiology due to inexperience, resulting in a delay in initiating etiological treatment.

### Clinical features of early and late postoperative hypothyroidism after lobectomy [^117T3vk8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Lobectomy is preferred in thyroid cancer to decrease surgical complications and avoid lifelong thyroid-hormone replacement. However, postoperative hypothyroidism, requiring thyroid-hormone replacement, may occur.

- **Objective**: We aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors of postoperative hypothyroidism to develop a surveillance strategy after lobectomy for papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).

- **Methods**: This historical cohort study involved 335 patients with PTMC treated by lobectomy. Postoperative thyroid functions were measured regularly, and patients were prescribed levothyroxine according to specific criteria. Patients not satisfying hormone-replacement criteria were closely followed up.

- **Results**: Postoperative hypothyroidism occurred in 215 patients (64.2%), including 5 (1.5%) with overt hypothyroidism and 210 (62.7%) with subclinical hypothyroidism. Forty patients (11.9%) required thyroid hormone replacement. One hundred nineteen patients (33.5%) experienced temporary hypothyroidism and spontaneously recovered to a euthyroid state. High preoperative thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was the most important factor predicting postoperative hypothyroidism and failure to recover from hypothyroidism (odds ratio [OR], 2.82 and 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 2.07 to 3.95 and 1.22 to 2.63; P < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Of the 215 patients eventually developing postoperative hypothyroidism, 70 (32.6%) developed hypothyroidism after the first postoperative year. Postoperative 1-year TSH levels were able to differentiate patients developing late hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression in low-risk papillary thyroid cancer: A large-scale retrospective analysis of real-world data [^1178tAU3]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Over 500,000 new cases are diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) globally per year, most of which are in the low-risk stratification. Although thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression is traditionally recommended for all postoperative PTCs in guidelines, its necessity remains highly controversial in low-risk patients. Since relevant recommendations in guidelines are still empirical, the study aims to provide direct, large-scale, real-world evidence.

This large-scale real-world retrospective study included 11,140 low-risk PTC patients from two Chinese large-volume centers: Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) and Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CH-CAMS), treated from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2022. The mean TSH level was calculated based on postoperative serum TSH values during follow-up. The primary outcome was the association between postoperative TSH level and structural recurrence, assessed by Kaplan–Meier, log-rank, multivariate Cox regression analyses, and equivalence testing by the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for confounders among groups.

A total of 11,140 patients with low-risk PTC were included with a median follow-up of 70 months. Based on the mean TSH level, these patients were classified into the following groups: ≤ 0.5 (n = 1,504, 13.5%), 0.5–1 (n = 4,336, 38.9%), 1–2 (n = 4,285, 38.5%), 2–3 (n = 704, 6.3%), and > 3 (n = 311, 2.8%) mU/L groups. After PSM adjusting for age, sex, and T and N stage, results showed significant findings.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^111Fw7cK]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

Decisions concerning treatment beyond local measures are guided by several factors, including patient symptoms, quality of life, disease activity and severity, risk of deterioration, duration of thyroid eye disease (TED), patient age and comorbidity, and patient preference. Sight-threatening TED requires urgent treatment, close monitoring of response, and often multimodal treatments. In general, treatments during the active phase of TED are aimed at suppressing inflammation and preventing complications and are largely medical. Immunomodulatory treatments are most effective in patients with a short duration of TED, optimally being less than 6–9 months.

Surgical rehabilitation for proptosis, chronic congestion, strabismus, or lid malposition is typically delayed until the quiescent phase; however, urgent surgery may be necessary during the active/progressive phase for dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON), severe corneal exposure, or globe subluxation. Systemic medical and surgical treatment for TED are discussed in Sections 6–8.

- **Setting for TED care**: Optimal management of moderate-to-severe and sight-threatening TED requires a collaborative approach from endocrinologists and ophthalmologists. Infusion centers, where immunomodulatory therapy may be safely delivered in a controlled setting, vary widely from one institution to the next but share the common elements of an ability to monitor for and respond rapidly to infusion-related adverse events.

### Advancements in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer [^115TyvGr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The postoperative course for differentiated thyroid cancer involves several evaluation methods. Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements, ultrasonography, and iodine radioisotope scanning are typically employed to assess postoperative disease status. Initial thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression to 2.5 mIU/l and the presence of microsomal antibodies were significant predictors of levothyroxine use after lobectomy. In a cohort of 276 patients, 23.6% required levothyroxine an average of 3.2 months after surgery. However, 26.2% of these patients were able to discontinue its use after an average of 16.4 months.

While serum Tg values are expected to reach their nadir 3–4 weeks post-surgery, there is no set target cutoff for serum Tg measurements. It is also critical to note that 25% of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) develop antibodies to Tg. Additionally, Tg production varies depending on tumor subtype, and assay results can differ across laboratories. These variables limit the efficacy of Tg as a marker for disease recurrence.

### Higher serum thyroid stimulating hormone level in thyroid nodule patients is associated with greater risks of differentiated thyroid cancer and advanced tumor stage [^116zcewV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

TSH is a known thyroid growth factor, but the pathogenic role of TSH in thyroid oncogenesis is unclear. The aim was to examine the relationship between preoperative TSH and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The design was a retrospective cohort study.

Between May 1994 and January 2007, 1198 patients underwent thyroid surgery at a single hospital. Data from the 843 patients with preoperative serum TSH concentration were recorded. Serum TSH concentration was measured with a sensitive assay. Diagnoses of DTC vs. benign thyroid disease were based on surgical pathology reports.

Twenty-nine percent of patients (241 of 843) had DTC on final pathology. On both univariate and multivariable analyses, risk of malignancy correlated with higher TSH level (P = 0.007). The likelihood of malignancy was 16% (nine of 55) when TSH was less than 0.06 mIU/liter vs. 52% (15 of 29) when 5.00 mIU/liter or greater (P = 0.001). When TSH was between 0.40 and 1.39 mIU/liter, the likelihood of malignancy was 25% (85 of 347) vs. 35% (109 of 308) when TSH was between 1.40 and 4.99 mIU/liter (P = 0.002). The mean TSH was 4.9 ± 1.5 mIU/liter in patients with stage III/IV disease vs. 2.1 ± 0.2 mIU/liter in patients with stage I/II disease (P = 0.002).

The likelihood of thyroid cancer increases with higher serum TSH concentration. Even within normal TSH ranges, a TSH level above the population mean is associated with a significantly greater likelihood of thyroid cancer than a TSH below the mean. Shown for the first time, this correlation underlines the importance of monitoring serum TSH levels in thyroid nodule patients.

### Does postoperative thyrotropin suppression therapy truly decrease recurrence in papillary thyroid carcinoma? A randomized controlled trial [^111rjh9S]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). High credibility.

This single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial sought to test the hypothesis that disease-free survival (DFS) for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in patients without TSH suppression is not inferior to that in patients with TSH suppression. TSH suppression therapy has been used to decrease thyroid cancer recurrence; however, validation of effects through studies providing a high level of evidence has been lacking.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive postoperative TSH suppression therapy (group A) or not (group B). Before assignment, patients were stratified into groups with low- and high-risk PTC according to the AMES (age, metastasis, extension, size) risk-group classification.

- **Interventions and outcome measures**: For patients assigned to group A, L-T(4) was administered to keep serum TSH levels below 0.01 μU/ml. TSH levels were adjusted to within normal ranges for patients assigned to group B. Recurrence was evaluated by neck ultrasonography and chest computed tomography.

Eligible participants were recruited from 1996–2005, with 218 patients assigned to group A and 215 patients to group B. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. DFS did not differ significantly between groups. The 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio for recurrence was 0.85–1.27 according to Cox proportional hazard modeling, within the margin of 2.12 required to declare 10% noninferiority.

The conclusion drawn was that DFS for patients without TSH suppression was not inferior by more than 10% to DFS for patients with TSH suppression.

### The landmark series: Extent of surgery for low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer [^113qb1kM]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

In addition to oncologic outcomes, other indications for thyroidectomy such as the presence of concerning contralateral nodules, hyperthyroidism (specifically, Graves' disease or a toxic multinodular goiter), family history or the presence of a known genetic predisposition, and exposure to carcinogens such as ionizing radiation may favor total thyroidectomy over thyroid lobectomy. Whether certain genetic alterations predispose patients to more aggressive disease and therefore should push patients and surgeons toward total thyroidectomy remains controversial. In particular, the loss of tumor suppressor gene function, such as TP53, and combinations of genetic mutations, such as BRAF V600E with TERT promoter mutations, or BRAF V600E with mutations in the PI3K pathway, have been associated with more aggressive disease.

A recent study using ThyroSeq version 3 found that its Cancer Risk Classifier molecular risk groups were able to accurately predict the risk of recurrent disease after surgery based on molecular testing of fine-needle aspirate biopsy samples. Molecular testing also can identify targetable mutations for patients with advanced disease. It is possible that in the future, tumor genotype may play an important role in determining the optimal extent of surgery for otherwise low-risk thyroid cancer patients.

- **Radioactive iodine**: The rationale for using total thyroidectomy to treat unilateral non-metastatic thyroid cancers typically is to allow for effective remnant ablation with radioactive iodine (RAI). However, RAI is used less and less frequently for low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), and it is no longer routinely recommended for all cases.

### American thyroid association statement on optimal surgical management of goiter [^116iitc4]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Goiter, or benign enlargement of the thyroid gland, can be asymptomatic or can cause compression of surrounding structures such as the esophagus and/or trachea. The options for medical treatment of euthyroid goiter are short-lived and are limited to thyroxine hormone suppression and radioactive iodine ablation. The objective of this statement article is to discuss optimal surgical management of goiter.

- **Methods**: A task force was convened by the Surgical Affairs Committee of the American Thyroid Association and was tasked with writing this article.

- **Results/conclusions**: Surgical management is recommended for goiters with compressive symptoms. Symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and dysphagia are more commonly associated with thyromegaly, particularly substernal goiters. Several studies have demonstrated improved breathing and swallowing outcomes after thyroidectomy. With careful preoperative testing and thoughtful consideration of the type of anesthesia, including the type of intubation, preparation for surgery can be optimized. In addition, planning the extent of surgery and postoperative care are necessary to achieve optimal results. Close collaboration of an experienced surgical and anesthesia team is essential for induction and reversal of anesthesia. This team must also be cognizant of complications from massive goiter surgery such as bleeding, airway distress, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and transient hypoparathyroidism. With careful preparation and teamwork, successful thyroid surgery can be achieved.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with unknown hyperthyroidism during nonthyroidal surgery-a case report and literature review [^111LMHWe]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid storm (TS) is a critical manifestation of hyperthyroidism. In recent years, the risk of perioperative TS has significantly decreased in patients with hyperthyroidism undergoing thyroid surgeries with adequate preoperative preparations. However, those who undergo non-thyroidal operations have a higher risk of TS due to the oversight of evaluating thyroid function. The purpose of this case report is to present a patient with TS during nonthyroidal surgery and review similar cases in the literature.

- **Case presentation**: A middle-aged female who received unilateral total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia developed refractory tachycardia during the operation and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism via laboratory tests after surgery. She was suggestive of TS based on the Burch and Wartofsky scoring system and relieved after etiological treatments. She was discharged 10 days after surgery and continued to take antithyroid medication.

- **Conclusion**: We recommend that a comprehensive history collection is warranted. The clinical manifestations of TS during operation could be versatile and atypical. Any abnormalities during an operation like abnormal heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, or even the unusual anesthetics needed, should not be ignored. In surgeries with general anesthesia, it is necessary to be cautious about TS with an atypical manifestation of tachycardia. Once suspected, supportive and resuscitative treatment along with antithyroid medication should be promptly initiated.

Regarding surgical interventions for hyperthyroidism, particularly thyroidectomy for toxic multinodular goiter, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend rendering patients with overt hyperthyroidism euthyroid prior to the procedure. This should be achieved using methimazole pretreatment, with or without β-adrenergic blockade, if surgery is chosen as the treatment for toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma. The guidelines advise against the use of preoperative iodine in this context.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. In most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency.

Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician, as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^114Xo7vx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone, as seen in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter, administration of thyroid hormone for the treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in individuals with suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared to those with low but detectable levels.

- **Increased risk factors**: Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults and decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting associations with other cardiovascular effects, such as increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, as well as increased bone turnover markers.

- **Controversial associations**: Possible links between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates remain controversial.

Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities, which would help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^116tpVuK]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Concerning thyroid surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), patients with node-negative cancer 1 cm in diameter or more should be treated with total or near-total thyroidectomy, except where contraindications prevent this surgery. However, the NCCN and SEOM clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend total or subtotal thyroidectomy in tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter. In contrast, the LATS guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy for DTC, regardless of tumor size. An additional surgical consideration is cervical lymph node dissection for patients with DTC. Three CPGs recommend that prophylactic central-compartment neck dissection may be performed in patients who present with DTC with clinically uninvolved central-neck lymph nodes, especially for advanced primary tumors (nodule > 4 cm).

Recommendations for the postoperative care of DTC are varied. First, radioiodine ablation is recommended for all high-risk patients, as determined by the presence of metastases, incomplete excision, or gross extrathyroidal extension of the tumor regardless of tumor size, or a primary tumor larger than 4 cm, even in the absence of other higher-risk factors. However, the NCN guidelines mention that routine postoperative I 131 ablation of thyroid remnants has been shown to reduce local recurrence and improve patient survival when they have tumors more than 1 cm in diameter. Moreover, the NCCN guidelines recommend that I 131 ablation be performed in patients with thyroglobulin levels greater than 1 ng/ml. Second, all CPGs emphasized the need for TSH suppression therapy following DTC surgery. However, the target levels of the TSH varied across the guidelines.

### Hyperthyroidism: A review [^111Q7npZ]. JAMA (2023). Low credibility.

Overt hyperthyroidism, defined as suppressed thyrotropin (previously thyroid-stimulating hormone) and high concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free thyroxine (FT4), affects approximately 0.2% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined as low concentrations of thyrotropin and normal concentrations of T3 and FT4, affects approximately 0.7% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, osteoporosis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It may lead to unintentional weight loss and is associated with increased mortality.

- **Observations**: The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, with a global prevalence of 2% in women and 0.5% in men. Other causes of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis include toxic nodules and the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis. Common symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Patients with Graves disease may have a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, stare, or exophthalmos on examination. Patients with toxic nodules (i.e. in which thyroid nodules develop autonomous function) may have symptoms from local compression of structures in the neck by the thyroid gland, such as dysphagia, orthopnea, or voice changes. Etiology can typically be established based on clinical presentation, thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin-receptor antibody status. Thyroid scintigraphy is recommended if thyroid nodules are present or the etiology is unclear.

Regarding perioperative care for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to pre-thyroidectomy care for Graves' disease, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend rendering patients euthyroid prior to the procedure using antithyroid drug pretreatment, with or without ß-adrenergic blockade if surgery is chosen as treatment for Graves' disease. Additionally, a potassium iodide-containing preparation should be given in the immediate preoperative period.

### Effects of preoperative iodine administration on thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112P1UBU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The guidelines recommend that potassium iodide be given in the immediate preoperative period for patients with Graves' disease who are undergoing thyroidectomy. Nonetheless, the evidence behind this recommendation is tenuous. The purpose of this study is to clarify the benefits of preoperative iodine administration from published comparative studies.

- **Data sources**: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL from 1980 to June 2018.

- **Review methods**: Studies were included that compared preoperative iodine administration and no premedication before thyroidectomy. For the meta-analysis, studies were pooled with the random-effects model.

- **Results**: A total of 510 patients were divided into the iodine (n = 223) and control (n = 287) groups from 9 selected studies. Preoperative iodine administration was significantly associated with decreased thyroid vascularity and intraoperative blood loss. Significant heterogeneity was present among studies. We found no significant difference in thyroid volume or operative time. Furthermore, the meta-analysis showed no difference in the risk of postoperative complications, including vocal cord palsy, hypoparathyroidism/hypocalcemia, and hemorrhage or hematoma after thyroidectomy.

- **Conclusion**: Preoperative iodine administration decreases thyroid vascularity and intraoperative blood loss. Nonetheless, it does not translate to more clinically meaningful differences in terms of operative time and postoperative complications.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as having normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured using a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L).

Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism.

A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed, and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment for subclinical hyperthyroidism, also to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs such as the heart and bone. A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to twelve months in an effort to induce remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Postoperative unstimulated thyroglobulin accurately predicts outcomes in high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer: A retrospective cohort study [^115cWExD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) generally has an excellent prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of about 98.5% in the United States. However, up to 15% of cases are diagnosed with local invasion, and the incidence of advanced cases and mortality directly attributed to DTC has risen. These trends highlight the necessity of identifying patients at risk for developing advanced disease to optimize treatment strategies.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC/TNM) staging system categorizes DTC into stages based on tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) criteria. While stage I patients over 55 years have a 10-year survival rate of 98%–100%, stage IV patients experience significantly poorer outcomes, with survival rates below 50%. Various factors, not considered by this staging system — including specific histological types, thyroglobulin (Tg) levels, molecular profiles, and metastases' location and functional status — significantly impact prognosis, emphasizing the importance of investigating these variables.

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification system is a widely used tool to predict recurrence. However, 10%–30% of high-risk patients achieve excellent outcomes within 5–10 years, highlighting the heterogeneity of this group. Identifying high-risk patients likely to respond favorably could reduce overtreatment and its associated risks, such as adverse effects of high-dose RIT and TSH suppression therapy.

Tg is a highly specific tumor marker in DTC management. Its serum levels reflect thyroid tissue mass and TSH receptor stimulation.

### Risk of perioperative thyroid storm in hyperthyroid patients: a systematic review [^1124cN4k]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2021). Low credibility.

Thyroid storm is a feared complication in patients with hyperthyroidism undergoing surgery. We assessed the risk of thyroid storm for different preoperative treatment options for patients with primary hyperthyroidism undergoing surgery.

- **Methods**: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for all studies reporting on adult hyperthyroid patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. Selected studies were categorized based on preoperative treatment: no treatment, antithyroid medication (thionamides), iodine, β-blocking medication, or a combination thereof. Treatment effect, that is restoring euthyroidism, was extracted from the publications if available. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) or the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized studies.

- **Results**: The search yielded 7,009 articles, of which 26 studies published between 1975 and 2020 were selected for critical appraisal. All studies had a moderate to critical risk of bias, mainly attributable to risk of confounding, classification of intervention status, and definition of the outcome. All studies reported on thyroidectomy patients. We found no randomized studies comparing the risk of thyroid storm between treated and untreated patients. Cases of thyroid storm were reported in all treatment groups, with incidences ranging from 0% to 14%.

- **Conclusion**: Evidence assessing the risk of perioperative thyroid storm is of insufficient quality. Given the seriousness of this complication and the impossibility of obtaining conclusive data…
