## Question

percent iron saturation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about percent iron saturation, also known as transferrin saturation (TSAT), including its definition, calculation, normal ranges, interpretation across diseases, and practical testing considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining TSAT and how it is calculated. Then, I should verify physiologic normal ranges and how they vary by age and sex. Next, I will interpret what low and high TSAT mean clinically, including functional iron deficiency and iron overload states. After that, I should review disease-specific thresholds and guideline-based applications in iron deficiency anemia, CKD, heart failure, hereditary hemochromatosis, and cancer-related anemia. Finally, I will consider testing logistics, limitations, and a concise synthesis of key takeaways anchored to guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the definition and calculation so I don't gloss over basics. Transferrin saturation is the percentage of iron-binding sites on transferrin that are occupied by iron, calculated as serum iron divided by total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) times 100, or equivalently as serum iron divided by transferrin concentration times a correction factor of about 1.42, reflecting transferrin's iron-binding stoichiometry; I should double-check that both formulas are acceptable and that the correction factor is indeed 1.42, which it is in contemporary reviews and guidelines [^112KTP8q].

> Now, I need to verify the normal range. Under physiologic conditions, TSAT typically falls between about 20% and 45%, with some pediatric sources citing 16% to 45% as a reference interval. Wait, let me verify the lower bound because different labs and populations vary, and yes, 16% to 45% is a commonly cited pediatric and adult range, while many adult references anchor 20% to 45% as typical, so I should present both and note context dependence [^1154eFBy] [^112KTP8q] [^113mkEGc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single number. I should confirm how inflammation and circadian variation affect TSAT. Transferrin is a negative acute-phase reactant, so in inflammatory states transferrin falls, which can artifactually raise TSAT even when iron supply is limited; conversely, diurnal variation in serum iron can bias TSAT if samples are not drawn consistently, so timing and context matter for interpretation and longitudinal comparison [^114JLXDd].

> Next, I will interpret low TSAT. A TSAT less than about 20% generally indicates insufficient circulating iron available for erythropoiesis and is widely used to define iron-restricted states, including absolute and functional iron deficiency. I should confirm that major guidelines converge on this threshold, and yes, BSG, AGA, and nephrology guidance all operationalize TSAT less than 20% as indicative of iron restriction, particularly when ferritin is normal or elevated due to inflammation [^111gPYEe] [^111CX2fR].

> But wait, what if ferritin is high and TSAT is low? Does that exclude iron deficiency? No, that pattern is classic for functional iron deficiency, where iron is trapped in stores due to hepcidin-mediated restriction despite adequate or high ferritin; I should confirm that ECCO and UKKA endorse using TSAT less than 20% with ferritin greater than 100 ng/mL to define functional iron deficiency in inflammatory disease and CKD, which they do [^1162718v] [^111CX2fR].

> I will now examine high TSAT. Values above about 45% to 50% raise concern for iron overload, and levels above roughly 60% to 75% correlate with increased non–transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which is redox-active and toxic to tissues. Let me verify that hepatology guidelines and translational reviews align here, and yes, EASL and recent reviews emphasize that TSAT elevation precedes ferritin rise in hemochromatosis and that TSAT above 75% signals potentially harmful NTBI [^116zw5Qp] [^112KTP8q] [^113Gvcb6].

> Next, I should review disease-specific diagnostic thresholds so I don't overgeneralize. For hereditary hemochromatosis, a TSAT greater than 45% is highly sensitive for C282Y homozygosity, though specificity improves with higher cutoffs. EASL uses sex-specific thresholds of greater than 45% in females and greater than 50% in males alongside elevated ferritin to support a provisional diagnosis, and ACG notes that fasting is not required for accurate TS determination, though repeating an elevated value is prudent [^116AdNiR] [^116zw5Qp] [^112ubnkW].

> For iron deficiency anemia, I should confirm the ferritin threshold that maximizes sensitivity and when to add TSAT. The AGA recommends a ferritin cutoff of 45 ng/mL rather than 15 ng/mL to diagnose IDA in anemic adults, and advises adding TSAT and other markers when inflammation or CKD may confound ferritin; BSG similarly recommends TSAT when ferritin may be falsely normal, reinforcing that TSAT less than 20% supports iron restriction in this context [^116PBzzy] [^111gPYEe].

> In CKD, let me verify how guidelines operationalize functional iron deficiency. UKKA 2025 defines functional iron deficiency as TSAT less than 20% with normal or elevated ferritin in non-dialysis CKD and dialysis patients, and NICE previously cautioned that ferritin or TSAT alone are insufficient, favoring reticulocyte hemoglobin content or percent hypochromic red cells when available. I should also note that some nephrology literature argues serum iron may outperform TSAT in inflamed CKD, but guidelines still widely use TSAT less than 20% as a practical threshold [^111CX2fR] [^11536fLC] [^113MtQ4x].

> For heart failure, I need to check whether the traditional ferritin less than 100 ng/mL or TSAT less than 20% rule remains valid. The 2016 ESC guidance adopted ferritin less than 100 µg/L or ferritin 100–299 µg/L with TSAT less than 20% to define iron deficiency, but emerging analyses suggest low TSAT is the stronger predictor of benefit from IV iron, prompting proposals to prioritize TSAT less than 20% with ferritin less than 400 µg/mL as a mechanism-based definition pending further validation; I should flag this as evolving evidence [^114L59rA] [^111Ws2Lt].

> In cancer-related anemia and ESA-treated patients, I should confirm that functional iron deficiency is recognized and that iron therapy is recommended when TSAT is low despite adequate ferritin. ASCO/ASH guidance supports baseline and periodic monitoring of iron indices and administering iron to improve hemoglobin response and reduce transfusions, with functional iron deficiency commonly defined as TSAT less than 20% and ferritin greater than 100 ng/mL in this setting [^116F4kbE] [^1155uzVL].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases so I don't miss important nuances. In cyanotic congenital heart disease, iron deficiency is common and harmful, and guidelines recommend assessing iron, ferritin, and transferrin, treating when TSAT is less than 20% until repletion. In restless legs syndrome, AASM recommends morning iron studies including ferritin and TSAT after avoiding iron for 24 hours to improve interpretability. And in pediatrics, TSAT less than 16% is often used to indicate suboptimal iron supply for erythropoiesis, with awareness of age-specific norms [^112m39Km] [^113hLU7z] [^1154eFBy].

> I should double-check testing logistics because pre-analytical and analytical factors can mislead. Serum iron and TSAT exhibit circadian variation, so serial measurements should be drawn at a consistent time. Transferrin falls with inflammation and oral estrogens, which can distort TSAT, and although fasting TS was historically recommended, ACG notes fasting is not strictly required for accurate TS determination, though confirming an elevated value is sensible. For restless legs syndrome, avoiding iron for 24 hours before sampling is advised to reduce assay interference [^114JLXDd] [^116AdNiR] [^113hLU7z].

> Next, I should review limitations and alternatives so we don't over-rely on TSAT. In inflammatory states, ferritin rises and transferrin falls, making TSAT a poorer index of marrow iron supply. In such cases, reticulocyte hemoglobin content or percent hypochromic red cells can better predict response to IV iron, and some guidelines discourage using TSAT in isolation to predict IV iron responsiveness in CKD, emphasizing integrated markers instead [^112KFCtq] [^11536fLC].

> Finally, I will synthesize the clinical takeaways and make sure they align with high-quality guidance. TSAT is a dynamic marker of circulating iron availability, with less than 20% indicating iron-restricted erythropoiesis across multiple settings, and greater than 45% to 50% raising concern for iron overload; interpretation must be contextualized with ferritin, inflammatory markers, and the clinical scenario, and disease-specific thresholds from BSG, AGA, EASL, and oncology/CKD guidance should guide diagnosis and treatment decisions, including when to pursue IV iron, phlebotomy, or further genetic testing for hemochromatosis [^116qgPPz] [^116zw5Qp] [^111CX2fR] [^116F4kbE].

Percent iron saturation, or transferrin saturation (TSAT), is the percentage of transferrin bound to iron, calculated as serum iron divided by total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) times 100. Normal TSAT is **20–45%**; values < 20% indicate iron deficiency [^1121jFZx], while > 45% suggest iron overload [^116AdNiR] and > 70% indicate high risk of tissue damage from non-transferrin-bound iron [^113Gvcb6]. TSAT is essential for diagnosing iron deficiency [^1121jFZx] and overload [^114Mor4a], guiding therapy, and monitoring response, but should be interpreted with ferritin and clinical context because inflammation and liver disease can alter transferrin and TIBC [^116c5dpZ] [^114JLXDd].

---

## Calculation and normal range

TSAT is calculated as **(serum iron / TIBC) × 100** [^1119Ki27]; normal is **20–45%** [^112KTP8q].

---

## Clinical significance

### Iron deficiency

In iron deficiency, **TSAT < 20%** indicates insufficient iron supply for erythropoiesis [^1121jFZx] and is a sensitive marker of iron deficiency anemia [^116c5dpZ]. In inflammation, **TSAT may be low despite normal or high ferritin** because transferrin falls as a negative acute-phase reactant [^116c5dpZ] [^1121jFZx].

---

### Iron overload

In iron overload, **TSAT > 45%** suggests increased iron load and is a hallmark of hereditary hemochromatosis [^116AdNiR] [^112ubnkW]. At **TSAT > 70%**, non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) rises and increases oxidative stress and tissue damage risk [^113Gvcb6].

---

## Clinical applications

| **Clinical scenario** | **Tsat role** | **Clinical actions** |
|-|-|-|
| Iron deficiency anemia | Diagnose and monitor | - Iron supplementation [^1121jFZx] <br/> - Treat cause [^115LH3LE] |
| Chronic kidney disease | Detect functional iron deficiency | - IV iron [^11536fLC] <br/> - ESA therapy [^112Mjn9Q] |
| Heart failure | Identify iron deficiency | - IV iron [^111Ws2Lt] <br/> - Improve outcomes [^111Ws2Lt] |
| Hereditary hemochromatosis | Screen and monitor | - Phlebotomy [^116zw5Qp] <br/> - Genetic testing [^112ubnkW] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Inflammation**: Lowers transferrin, potentially masking iron deficiency or falsely elevating TSAT [^116c5dpZ] [^114JLXDd].
- **Liver disease**: Alters transferrin synthesis, affecting TSAT interpretation [^notfound].
- **Diurnal variation**: Morning samples are preferred for consistency [^113hLU7z].

---

Percent iron saturation (TSAT) is a key marker of iron availability; **< 20% indicates deficiency** [^1121jFZx] and **> 45% suggests overload** [^116AdNiR]. It guides diagnosis and treatment across anemia, CKD, heart failure, and hemochromatosis, but must be interpreted with ferritin and clinical context due to inflammation and liver disease effects [^112KTP8q].

### Mortality and risk of diabetes, liver disease, and heart disease in individuals with haemochromatosisC282Y homozygosity and normal concentrations of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin: prospective cohort study [^113Vtpqf]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Iron homoeostasis is controlled by the master hormone hepcidin, a peptide synthesised in the liver and regulated through the homoeostatic iron regulator (HFE) protein. Hereditary haemochromatosis is caused by germline genetic variants, most commonly in the HFE gene, causing increased intestinal iron uptake that can lead to progressive iron accumulation in the body. Approximately 80–90% of patients with a diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis in northern Europe are homozygous for the C282Y (rs1800562) variant in the HFE gene, whereas less than 10% are compound heterozygous for the H63D (rs1799945) and C282Y variants. The C282Y variant is common in people of northern European descent, with homozygosity reported in 0.25–1% of the general population. However, estimates of penetrance vary markedly between studies, with clinically apparent haemochromatosis reported in between < 1% and 60% of C282Y homozygotes.

Previous studies have found increased risk of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and diabetes mellitus in people with C282Y homozygosity, but studies on risk of heart disease have shown conflicting results. Most clinical guidelines on hereditary haemochromatosis are based on the assumption that the increased risk of liver disease and diabetes is mechanistically caused by accumulation of iron in hepatocytes and pancreatic islets, reflected in high levels of transferrin saturation and ferritin. Hence, guidelines from several countries, including Denmark and the UK, recommend genetic testing for the two HFE variants C282Y and H63D only in individuals with a high transferrin saturation and a high ferritin concentration (except for genotyping close relatives of affected patients). On the basis of observational studies, therapeutic phlebotomy has been the cornerstone of treatment for hereditary haemochromatosis for many years. The effect of therapeutic phlebotomy in individual patients is typically assessed by measuring whether transferrin saturation and ferritin concentrations decrease sufficiently. However, randomised trials on risk of complications and death in people with hereditary haemochromatosis treated with phlebotomy have not been conducted, and whether individuals with hereditary haemochromatosis with normal levels of plasma iron, transferrin saturation, and/or ferritin are at increased risk of diabetes, liver disease, heart disease, and/or death is unknown.

### Transferrin saturation, dietary iron intake, and risk of cancer [^111BdAA2]. Annals of Family Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Transferrin saturation of more than 60% has been identified as a cancer risk factor. It is unclear whether dietary iron intake increases the risk of cancer among individuals with transferrin saturation of less than 60%. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of dietary iron intake and the risk of cancer among adults with increased transferrin saturation.

Methods

Analysis of a cohort study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study, was performed. US adults (aged 25 to 74 years at baseline) were followed up from baseline in 1971–1974 to 1992 (N = 6,309).

Results

A total of 7.3% of the US population had a serum transferrin saturation of more than 45% at baseline. Intake of dietary iron was essentially uncorrelated with transferrin saturation (r = 0.04). Compared with individuals who had normal serum transferrin saturation and low dietary iron intake, individuals whose serum transferrin saturation was more than 45% and who had high dietary iron intake also had an increased adjusted relative risk of cancer (2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–4.89). Increased risk was not found for individuals with a transferrin saturation of more than 45% but a normal dietary iron intake (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.69–1.49). Transferrin saturation levels could be set as low as 41%, and the individuals with high transferrin saturation and high dietary iron intake would still have an increased adjusted relative risk of cancer (hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.04–3.82).

Conclusions

Among persons with increased transferrin saturation, a daily intake of dietary iron more than 18 mg is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Future research might focus on the benefits of dietary changes in those individuals with increased serum transferrin saturation.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111BGSMm]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

Practical recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure

The current 2016 ESC HF guidelines 1 recommend that evaluation of iron status should be considered in the diagnostic work‐up of all newly diagnosed HF patients (class of recommendation I, level of evidence C). A practical recommendation of the working group is that iron status should also be evaluated in patients with existing CHF, particularly if they are symptomatic despite receiving optimal background HF medications. In addition, as part of routine follow‐up, consideration should be given to the re‐evaluation of iron status 1–2 times per year, as well as after hospitalization for HF.

Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are widely available blood markers for evaluating iron status. Their use for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is recommended by the 2016 ESC HF guidelines. 1 Ferritin is an intracellular iron‐storage protein secreted by iron‐storing tissues (e.g. liver and reticuloendothelial system). Serum ferritin concentrations are a surrogate marker of stored iron quantity. 9 TSAT (defined as % of transferrin that has iron bound to it) is used as a marker of the availability of circulating iron to supply metabolizing cells. 9 TSAT value is calculated by dividing the serum iron concentration by the total iron‐binding capacity (TIBC):

The 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend treating iron deficiency based on a serum ferritin level < 100 µg/L, or 100–299 µg/L when TSAT < 20%. Two different cut‐offs are used because ferritin levels may become elevated in the presence of inflammation and may, therefore, appear to be within the normal range (100–300 µg/L). As ferritin, an acute‐phase protein, is elevated as a result of inflammation, TSAT levels < 20% indicate that insufficient circulating iron is available to supply metabolizing cells (functional iron deficiency). 9 Therefore, in accordance with the 2016 ESC HF guidelines, it is important to ensure that both ferritin and TSAT testing is performed simultaneously and evaluated together when assessing iron status (Figure 1). Lower ferritin cut‐offs (e.g. < 30 µg/L) may be used to confirm the presence of iron deficiency in other disease settings and are often displayed on laboratory test results as the lower limit of normal. However, the thresholds defined above are recommended to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with CHF.

### Iron deficiency resolution and time to resolution in an American health system [^114qcnqh]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency (ID) is more prevalent and clinically important than currently appreciated. The global anemia burden was 33% in 2010, with half of cases driven by ID. In high-risk patients such as adolescent and young adult women, the prevalence of ID in the United States is ∼39%, comprised primarily of nonanemic ID (NAID).NAID is associated with fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. Yet despite this anemia-independent morbidity, up to 70% of ID goes undiagnosed in high-risk populations.

Underdiagnosis of ID has several possible driving factors. First, the clinical consequences of NAID are nonspecific, not well recognized, and thought to only be of clinical consequence when ID causes anemia. Second, ID can be challenging to diagnose. Failure to obtain and properly interpret all necessary laboratory parameters (for example, iron, transferrin saturation [TSAT], ferritin, etc) can lead to missed diagnoses. Furthermore, clinically actionable laboratory parameter values may fall within existing laboratory reference intervals and be falsely interpreted as normal. Third, oral iron is often poorly absorbed and limited by side effects, whereas the cost of IV iron and misconceptions over its safety limit its use.

These structural challenges likely contribute to a high prevalence of clinically significant ID that is either undiagnosed or incompletely treated. In this study, we sought to define both the proportion of resolution and time to resolution of ID in an American statewide health system.

### Management of anaemia and iron deficiency in patients with cancer: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^116F4kbE]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for cancer-related anemia, more specifically with respect to iron replacement, ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV iron without additional anemia therapy in patients with functional iron deficiency (transferrin saturation < 20% and serum ferritin > 100 ng/mL).

### Early detection of type 1 haemochromatosis: a case of normal ferritin levels with elevated transferrin saturation [^115oKwcQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Haemochromatosis is marked by excessive iron accumulation leading to damage to various organs. Although haemochromatosis dates to 1865, diagnosing the condition remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and due to its quiescent course, it often leads to significant delay in recognition. A woman in her 50s who presented with arthralgia was found to have raised transferrin saturation with normal ferritin. She underwent human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE) genetic screening test which showed H63D type 1 haemochromatosis. This report aims to draw attention to the pitfalls in diagnosing haemochromatosis as normal ferritin does not exclude hereditary haemochromatosis.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111LvPzd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

When adequate iron status is achieved, CKD patients on ESA therapy should be given maintenance iron treatment.
Several studies have reported that the dose of ESA required to achieve and maintain a given Hb level is inversely related to iron stores. Iron deficiency (absolute or functional) was the main cause of ESA resistance in the UK but this has now been solved by parenteral iron replacement strategies. The evidence behind the statement that TSAT generally should be maintained at greater than 20% stems from a single RCT comparing higher to lower TSAT targets; patients randomized to a target TSAT of 30% to 50% demonstrated a 40% reduction in ESA dose compared with those assigned to a target of 20% to 30%.
In a randomised controlled study involving 157 haemodialysis patients comparing iron management based on serum ferritin and transferrin saturation versus CHr, CHr was a markedly more stable analyte than serum ferritin or transferrin saturation. Iron management based on CHr resulted in similar haematocrit and epoetin dosing while significantly reducing IV iron exposure.
In another study involving 164 chronic haemodialysis patients, low CHr (< 26 pg) was suggestive of functional iron deficiency. When a subgroup of patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of IV iron dextran (1000 mg), A CHr < 26 pg at baseline predicted iron deficiency with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 80%. The serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells were all less accurate. The time to correction of iron deficiency at the level of the reticulocyte was found to be within 48 h as measured by correction of the mean CHr to > 26 pg, and by the shift of the vast majority of the reticulocyte population to CHr > 26 pg within this time span.
In a study comparing TSAT versus CHr as a guide of parenteral iron therapy in 197 Japanese peritoneal dialysis patients, although CHr reflected the iron status more sensitively, TSAT was a better clinical marker for iron supplementation therapy. A cross-sectional study of 72 haemodialysis patients was performed. Mean haemoglobin was 9.6 +/− 0.16 g/dl. Mean haemoglobin content of reticulocytes (CHr) was normally distributed and correlated with MCV, MCH and red cell ferritin. A low CHr identified patients with iron deficiency with normal serum ferritin or transferrin saturation.
Tessitore et al. compared the diagnostic efficiency of different iron markers in chronic haemodialysis patients. Although percentage hypochromia > 6% was the best marker to identify responsiveness to intravenous iron; CHr was 78% efficient at cut-off ≤ 29 pg.
TSAT and serum ferritin were evaluated in 47 chronic haemodialysis patients with baseline serum ferritin levels < 600 ng/ml. Patients were treated with IV dextran (1000 mg over ten haemodialysis treatments). Patients were classified as having iron deficiency if haematocrit value increased by 5% or if their erythropoietin dose decreased by 10% by 2 months. Receiver operator curves demonstrated that none of the iron indices had a high level of utility (both sensitivity and specificity > 80%). As such it was concluded that both tests should be interpreted in the context of the patient's underlying EPO responsiveness. In patients who are responsive to EPO, a transferrin saturation value < 18% or serum ferritin level < 100 ng/ml should be used to indicate inadequate iron. When EPO resistance is present, transferrin saturation of < 27% or serum ferritin < 300 microgram/L should be used to guide iron management.
NICE evaluation of iron therapy in CKD patients suggests that for haemodialysis patients, %HRC > 6 dominated all other iron evaluation strategies (it led both to more QALYs and lower cost). For the other patients, TSAT less than 20% alone or serum ferritin less than 100 micrograms/L alone were the least cost effective strategy, but %HRC was the most cost-effective.
NICE guidelines on anaemia management in CKD patients suggest to:

- Use percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC; > 6%), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h. Since a fresh blood sample is needed, this test may be difficult to use routinely in clinical practice.
- If using percentage of hypochromic red blood cells is not possible, use reticulocyte Hb content (CHr; < 29 pg) or equivalent tests – for example, reticulocyte Hb equivalent.
- If these tests are not available or the person has thalassaemia or thalassaemia trait, use a combination of transferrin saturation (less than 20%) and serum ferritin measurement (less than 100 microgram/L).

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on haemochromatosis [^116zw5Qp]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Haemochromatosis is characterised by elevated transferrin saturation (TSAT) and progressive iron loading that mainly affects the liver. Early diagnosis and treatment by phlebotomy can prevent cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes, arthropathy and other complications. In patients homozygous for p. Cys282Tyr in HFE, provisional iron overload based on serum iron parameters (TSAT > 45% and ferritin > 200 μg/L in females and TSAT > 50% and ferritin > 300 μg/L in males and postmenopausal women) is sufficient to diagnose haemochromatosis. In patients with high TSAT and elevated ferritin but other HFE genotypes, diagnosis requires the presence of hepatic iron overload on MRI or liver biopsy. The stage of liver fibrosis and other end-organ damage should be carefully assessed at diagnosis because they determine disease management. Patients with advanced fibrosis should be included in a screening programme for hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment targets for phlebotomy are ferritin < 50 μg/L during the induction phase and < 100 μg/L during the maintenance phase.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis [^1157Rj5X]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts the body's regulation of iron. It is the most common genetic disease in whites. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women. Persons who are homozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y comprise 85 to 90 percent of phenotypically affected persons. End-organ damage or clinical manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis occur in approximately 10 percent of persons homozygous for C282Y. Symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and typically absent in the early stages. If present, symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, arthralgias, and impotence. Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression. Serum ferritin measurement is the most useful prognostic indicator of disease severity. Liver biopsy is performed to stage the degree of fibrosis with severe ferritin elevation or transaminitis, or to diagnose nonclassical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with other genetic defects. Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires phlebotomy, and the frequency is guided by serial measurements of serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. Iron avidity can result from overtreatment. If iron avidity is not suspected, it may mimic undertreatment with persistently elevated transferrin saturation. Dietary modification is generally unnecessary. Universal screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended, but testing should be performed in first-degree relatives of patients with classical HFE-related hemochromatosis, those with evidence of active liver disease, and patients with abnormal iron study results. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is reserved for those with hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to genetic testing, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain genotyping for p.C282Y in HFE in patients of European origin with biochemical evidence of iron overload (females with transferrin saturation > 45% and serum ferritin > 200 mcg/L and males with transferrin saturation > 50% and ferritin > 300 mcg/L, or otherwise unexplained persistently elevated transferrin saturation) with or without clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hemochromatosis.

### Intravenous iron: from anathema to standard of care [^11552hUs]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

A growing body of literature supports the use of intravenous iron as a compliment to erythropoiesis stimulatory therapy and in a significant number of disease states where iron is necessary and oral iron is ineffective or not tolerated. The differences in efficacy, safety, and clinical nature of serious adverse events that occur with the various iron preparations are poorly understood. Misinterpretation of adverse events leads to underutilization of this important treatment modality. Understanding the history of the development and use of intravenous iron is crucial to appreciate its importance in the management of anemias of dialysis, cancer, and cancer chemotherapy and properly assess side effects and toxicity. The benefits seen with intravenous iron therapy are independent of the pretreatment levels of serum ferritin, iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent transferrin saturation. Intravenous iron has been shown to overcome hepcidin induced iron restricted erythropoiesis in iron-replete patients. Available clinical and experimental data suggest that increased utilization of intravenous iron should be considered.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to do not measure the percentage saturation of transferrin in isolation to predict responsiveness to IV iron therapy in patients with CKD. Consider assessing the percentage saturation of transferrin to monitor response to ESAs and/or iron therapy in patients with CKD. Consider measuring the percentage saturation of transferrin in combination with either the serum ferritin concentration or measurements such as the percentage of hypochromic red cells and reticulocyte hemoglobin content for the diagnosis of functional iron deficiency.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116AdNiR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron studies for diagnostic evaluation: Transferrin saturation (TS) is the preferred initial screening test, and fasting is not required to accurately determine TS. A TS of greater than 45% identifies 97.9%–100% of C282Y homozygotes, although a small proportion of patients with HH such as young individuals at an earlier stage may have TS of < 45%. Serum ferritin (SF) is an excellent predictor of advanced fibrosis; in C282Y homozygotes, a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL, in combination with elevated aminotransferase levels and/or low platelet count, predicts cirrhosis in more than 80% of patients. A normal SF, defined as less than 200 ng/mL in premenopausal women or 300 ng/mL in men and postmenopausal women, in combination with a TS of < 45%, has a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. A unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) below 26 μmol/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 50% for detecting C282Y homozygosity.

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^113NJ6DP]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Serum iron, ferritin and transferrin levels should all be measured to assess iron status in Gaucher patients. Perls' stain on bone marrow aspirate to assess available iron stores should be performed in all Gaucher patients undergoing bone marrow aspiration as part of the diagnostic work-up. Levels of serum soluble transferrin receptor are also valuable in assessing iron status in chronic disease. Serum iron alone is not a useful measurement parameter as it is too easily affected by diet. Similarly, serum ferritin alone cannot be used as a marker of iron status in Gaucher disease as ferritin is often elevated due to chronic inflammation and compromised iron mobilization. Indeed, ferritin levels can be very high in Gaucher patients, mimicking those seen in genetic haemachromatosis. However, in Gaucher disease, iron storage is confined to Gaucher cells and does not occur in other organs. Treatment of raised ferritin with phlebotomy (as in genetic haemachromatosis) in a Gaucher patient is likely, therefore, to exacerbate anaemia.

The percentage of transferrin saturation is the most reliable measure of iron status in Gaucher disease with c. 16% saturation considered normal and < 10% saturation observed in established iron deficiency. While high ferritin with normal serum iron and normal transferrin saturation is expected in Gaucher disease, the possibility of concurrent genetic haemachromatosis should be eliminated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the liver, heart and pancreas using validated software can be useful in quantitatively assessing iron burden either if Gaucher disease is suspected or has been conclusively established. A diagnosis of genetic haemachromatosis should be confirmed by genotyping. Routine laboratory criteria may be used to indicate when to screen for a mutation in HFE (ferritin > 500 μ g/l, % ferritin saturation > 50%).

Although ferritin levels would be expected to decrease with enzyme treatment, the response can be slow and cannot be used to monitor the effects of therapy. Other storage parameters, such as chitotriosidase and/or CCL18/PARC, provide more sensitive means of monitoring treatment response. Increased ferritin in an otherwise asymptomatic Gaucher patient is not sufficient, by itself, for initiating enzyme treatment. The patient should be assessed completely and monitored closely for manifestations of Gaucher disease, including MRI assessment of bone marrow infiltration.

### Common presence of non-transferrin-bound iron among patients with type 2 diabetes [^117LHDjg]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Recently, we reported increased cardiovascular disease mortality among supplemental vitamin C users with type 2 diabetes in a prospective cohort study. Because vitamin C may cause oxidative stress in the presence of redox active iron, we hypothesized that non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), a form of iron susceptible to redox activity, may be present in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We measured serum NTBI levels using high-performance liquid chromatography in 48 patients with known diabetes (at least 5 years duration since diagnosis), 49 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, and 47 healthy control subjects (frequency matched on age and sex).

Results

NTBI was commonly present in diabetes: 59% in newly diagnosed diabetes and 92% in advanced diabetes. Mean NTBI values varied significantly between the three groups, with the highest values being observed in patients with known diabetes and the lowest in the control subjects (0.62 ± 0.43 vs. 0.24 ± 0.29 vs. 0.04 ± 0.13 micromol/l Fe). Serum total iron or percent transferrin saturation were very similar among the three groups, yet NTBI was strongly associated with serum total iron (r = 0.74, P < 0.01) and percent transferrin saturation (r = 0.70, P < 0.01) among the patients with known diabetes.

Conclusions

Consistent with our hypothesis, these data demonstrate the common existence of NTBI in type 2 diabetic patients with a strong gradient with severity. Prospective cohort studies are required to clarify the clinical relevance of increased NTBI levels.

Functional iron deficiency

Absolute iron deficiency describes a situation where body iron stores are inadequate to meet demands, while in FID the supply of iron for erythropoiesis is inadequate despite apparently normal iron stores in cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. This restrictive effect is modulated by hepcidin, which also limits iron absorption through the gut mucosa.

A common clinical setting for FID is CKD, where parenteral iron therapy facilitates the response to administered erythropoietin to correct anaemia. FID is also one element of the anaemia of chronic disease, occurring in many chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and IBD. A detailed discussion of the complex pathogenesis of the anaemia of chronic disease is beyond the scope of these guidelines.

An area of difficulty is establishing whether patients with presumed FID (with raised inflammatory markers and an SF in the normal range) have reduced iron stores indicative of absolute deficiency. When attributing anaemia to FID, it is important to consider whether there is sufficient evidence of a chronic illness. Evidence from studies in CKD suggests that in the absence of thalassaemia, the percentage of hypochromic red cells and Retic-Hb are superior to transferrin saturation in predicting the response to intravenous iron therapy. A transferrin saturation of < 20% is indicative of iron restriction, particularly in thalassaemia carriers.

Similar evidence that low Retic-Hb is an independent marker of iron restriction in the non-CKD setting, and for example provides a reliable marker of iron stores in patients with IBD. A very low hepcidin level is more commonly seen in absolute than FID, and may therefore indicate the probability of a response to oral IRT, but few UK laboratories offer this test. A good haematological response to a trial of oral iron suggests absolute iron deficiency rather than FID.

Given that chronic inflammatory conditions are common and that SF values may therefore be difficult to interpret, it is important to use additional clinical and laboratory information when considering whether further GI investigations are warranted. Clinical features (eg, bowel-related symptoms), inflammatory markers (eg C-reactive protein (CRP)), transferrin saturation, red cell hypochromia and response to oral IRT can all be helpful in this complex clinical setting.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review [^116qgPPz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

Objective

We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

Design

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and in main professional association websites, limited to documents published between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2014.

Results

Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or postpregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 μg/L (n = 5) or 800 μg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%.

Conclusions

It appears that for the diagnosis of ID, a cutoff of 100 μg/L for serum ferritin concentration should be considered in most conditions and 20% for TSAT, except in particular situations, including young healthy women with heavy menstrual flow. New indications of intravenous iron supplementation are emerging.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a transferrin saturation < 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or maintained on peritoneal dialysis and in those receiving hemodialysis. Recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Predictors of the response to treatment in anemic hemodialysis patients with high serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation [^113WdYn3]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Treating hemodialysis patients to combat anemia corrects hemoglobin but exacerbates iron deficiency by utilizing iron stores. Patients needing iron should receive this by intravenous (i.v.) means. The Dialysis patients' Response to IV iron with Elevated ferritin (DRIVE) trial investigated the role of i.v. iron in anemic patients with high ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and adequate epoetin doses. We examined whether baseline iron and inflammation markers predict the response of hemoglobin to treatment. Patients (134) were randomized to no added iron or to i.v. ferric gluconate for eight consecutive hemodialysis sessions spanning 6 weeks with epoetin increased by 25% in both groups. The patients started with hemoglobin less than or equal to 11 g/dl, ferritin between 500 and 1200 ng/ml, and transferrin saturation of less than 25%. Significantly, patients with a reticulocyte hemoglobin content greater than or equal to 31.2 pg were over five times more likely to achieve a clinically significant increase in hemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dl. Lower reticulocyte hemoglobin contents did not preclude a response to i.v. iron. Significantly higher transferrin saturation or lower C-reactive protein but not ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor levels predicted a greater response; however their influence was not clinically significant in either group. We conclude that none of the studied markers is a good predictor of response to anemia treatment in this patient sub-population.

Adults with congenital heart disease — cyanosis, iron deficiency, and erythrocytosis management: The guideline clarifies usage that "cyanosis" is used to denote hypoxemia from right-to-left shunting and emphasizes hematologic assessment in cyanotic patients: "Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals", and "Iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels, because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test". Limited evidence supports iron repletion when "treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely". Regarding hyperviscosity management, "Phlebotomy is, therefore, rarely necessary in patients with secondary erythrocytosis, and routine phlebotomy is not supported by data".

### Screening of iron deficiency anaemia in early childhood [^113ppJQG]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

According to USPSTF review, there is a lack of data evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of other single tests for the detection of iron deficiency, such as serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and CRP. Serum ferritin and CRP are acute phase reactants, and should therefore be measured in absence of infection or inflammation to avoid false positive results. Serum ferritin is however considered as a 'useful laboratory measure of iron status, with a low value being diagnostic of iron deficiency'. In 2007, the WHO and the CDC published a report on the assessment of the iron status in populations. This document was the result of a consultation that aimed to review and select the best indicators available to assess the iron status of populations and to evaluate the impact of interventions to control ID. The authors reviewed the literature on indicators of iron status, 'including red blood cell parameters, ferritin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum and plasma iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation and serum transferrin receptor' and on the interpretation of indicators of iron status during an acute phase response. The authors reached the conclusions for recommendations that 'measurements of serum ferritin and transferrin receptor provide the best approach to measuring the iron status of populations', although 'in places where infectious diseases are common, serum ferritin is not a useful indicator because inflammation leads to a rise in the concentration of serum ferritin as a result of the acute phase response to disease'. Also, 'serum ferritin is the best indicator of a response to an intervention to control iron deficiency and should be measured with the haemoglobin concentration in all programme evaluations'. Although this review and recommendations were focused to assess the iron status in populations, findings might be considered for application to IDA screening.

### CASE STUDIES: using human genome epidemiology information… [^115cqZWG]. archive.cdc.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

HFE. Iron overload due to HHC can be detected before the appearance of organ damage. The most commonly used test to identify persons at risk of developing iron overload disease is the percent transferrin saturation. An elevated TS usually occurs well before HHC clinical symptoms. The first step for ascertaining HHC is measuring a non-fasting TS. If this results elevated, the test should be repeated after an overnight fast. If fasting TS is also elevated then more tests need to be performed to check for the presence of increased iron stores. First, serum ferritin levels should be measured. Serum ferritin levels above 300 μg/L in men and post-menopausal women and ≥ 200 μg/L in pre-menopausal women indicate primary iron overload.

In population-based intervention trials, the estimated prevalence of homozygosity based on phenotype, defined as biochemical evidence of iron overload, is 50 per 10, 000 for men and 62 per 10, 000 for women. Worldwide, among 2, 929 patients 6. 9 percent were homozygous for the wild allele. These findings suggest that non. genetic influences, additional HFE mutations; or variation at additional genes affecting iron metabolism, as recently reported, may also cause or modulate iron overload. The marker for serum iron status most used is percent transferrin saturation. This test can be used as a phenotypic screening test to identify persons with biochemical evidence of iron overload. The cutoff TS values recommended for screening have varied from 45 to 70 percent. HFE genotypes is estimated to be much lower than that of C282Y/C282Y.

Another 2 percent of the general population will have the compound heterozygous genotype, but only about 1 in a 100 of these persons would be expected to develop significant iron loading. If testing is limited to C282Y, about 10 percent of the northern European population would be identified as heterozygote, but only 0. 5 percent of the population homozygous for C282Y would be at high risk for iron overload.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Oral iron should be discontinued prior to administration of INFeD.

Dosage:

I. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Periodic hematologic determination (hemoglobin and hematocrit) is a simple and accurate technique for monitoring hematological response, and should be used as a guide in therapy. It should be recognized that iron storage may lag behind the appearance of normal blood morphology. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and percent saturation of transferrin are other important tests for detecting and monitoring the iron deficient state.

After administration of iron dextran complex, evidence of a therapeutic response can be seen in a few days as an increase in the reticulocyte count.

Although serum ferritin is usually a good guide to body iron stores, the correlation of body iron stores and serum ferritin may not be valid in patients on chronic renal dialysis who are also receiving iron dextran complex.

Although there are significant variations in body build and weight distribution among males and females, the accompanying table and formula represent a convenient means for estimating the total iron required. This total iron requirement reflects the amount of iron needed to restore hemoglobin concentration to normal or near normal levels plus an additional allowance to provide adequate replenishment of iron stores in most individuals with moderately or severely reduced levels of hemoglobin. It should be remembered that iron deficiency anemia will not appear until essentially all iron stores have been depleted. Therapy, thus, should aim at not only replenishment of hemoglobin iron but iron stores as well.

Iron (Fe) status

There are several parameters that can be measured to evaluate the the iron status of an individual, including Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) serum ferritin and transferrin saturation measurements.

The interpretation of all three parameters should be done with some caution. Measurement of iron status in samples with hypochromic, microcytic indices but with normal Hb A₂ and F is useful to distinguish between cases of iron deficiency and those with possible α -thalassaemia trait or certain form of 'silent' β -thalassaemia trait, the latter of which should have normal iron status. This distinction is useful to prevent unnecessary further investigation as well as inappropriate iron therapy. However, it is important to note that iron deficiency can co-exist with the thalassaemias, which could lead to misinterpretation. If an individual is found to be iron deficient, it is recommended to repeat the haematology screen once the individual is iron replete, although this may not always be practical or feasible in a couple with an on-going pregnancy.

Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Aranesp. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

Transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) — key diagnostic parameters: transferrin normal values can vary between 200 and 400 mg/dL, and TSAT reflects iron availability with normal transferrin saturation ranging from 16% to 45%; a saturation below 16% indicates suboptimal iron for erythropoiesis and levels above 50% suggest iron overload. TSAT performance for iron deficiency shows sensitivity of 50% to 88% and specificity of 63% to 78%. TIBC is the amount of iron needed to saturate plasma transferrin and, while high in functional or true iron deficiency, has reported diagnostic sensitivity of 34% and specificity of 97%.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^1119Ki27]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — definitions for key terms: Hepcidin is defined as a hormone synthesized and secreted by the liver in response to circulating iron levels, which inhibits iron absorption from the intestinal mucosal cells by degradation of ferroportin-1. Ferroportin-1 is a transmembrane protein found predominantly in the intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and macrophages, which facilitates iron export from the cells. Transferrin is a glycoprotein synthesized by the liver which exists in 3 forms (apo, monomeric, and dimeric); it carries iron in the circulation. Unsaturated iron-binding capacity is the portion of iron-binding sites on transferrin that are not occupied by iron, and a low unsaturated iron-binding capacity raises the suspicion for hemochromatosis. Total iron-binding capacity is the sum of the serum iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity. Transferrin saturation is the percentage of iron bound to transferrin and is calculated by dividing serum iron by total iron-binding capacity. Ferritin is an intracellular protein that stores and releases intracellular iron.

### The mortality risk of elevated serum transferrin saturation and consumption of dietary iron [^113653fg]. Annals of Family Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data shows an increased mortality risk associated with elevated transferrin saturation. Because ingestion of dietary iron may contribute to iron overload in persons with elevated transferrin saturation, we investigated the relationship between elevated transferrin saturation, ingestion of dietary iron and red meat, and mortality.

Methods

This 12-year cohort study used data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1976–1980 (NHANES II) and the NHANES II Mortality Study 1992. Population estimates were based on 9,229 persons aged 35 to 70 years at baseline. A Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed based on levels of transferrin saturation, intake of dietary iron, and intake of red meat. The analysis was conducted while controlling for demographics, severity of illness, body mass index, and smoking status.

Results

Unadjusted analyses indicated that those who had a high transferrin saturation and reported high dietary iron or red meat consumption had an increased mortality risk. The adjusted survival analysis indicated that persons with elevated transferrin saturation who reported high dietary iron intake had a hazard ratio for death of 2.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39–6.04) compared with those with normal transferrin saturation levels and reported low dietary iron intake. Persons who had a high transferrin saturation and reported high red meat consumption also had an increased hazard ratio for death (2.26; 95% CI, 1.45–3.52) compared with those who had normal transferrin saturation and reported low red meat consumption.

Conclusions

Ingestion of large quantities of dietary iron and red meat in persons with high transferrin saturation is associated with an increase in mortality. Simple dietary restrictions may reduce the mortality risk associated with high transferrin saturation.

### Mortality and risk of diabetes, liver disease, and heart disease in individuals with haemochromatosisC282Y homozygosity and normal concentrations of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin: prospective cohort study [^115qLRzM]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Possible explanations and implications for clinicians and policy makers

Several guidelines on testing for haemochromatosis recommend genotyping patients for the C282Y and H63D variants only when both transferrin saturation and ferritin concentrations are increased (except for genotyping close relatives of affected patients). In contrast to these guidelines, we found that even C282Y homozygotes with normal levels of transferrin saturation and/or ferritin had an increased risk of diabetes. Hence, our findings indicate that the recommended strategy for testing may fail to detect some C282Y homozygotes at increased risk of diabetes. Drawing any conclusions from our observational study about the mechanisms that cause increased risk of diabetes in C282Y homozygotes is not possible, but our findings might question the assumption that progressive systemic iron accumulation is the only mechanism causing increased risk of diabetes in C282Y homozygotes, as the risk of diabetes was increased in C282Y homozygotes with normal levels of transferrin saturation and/or ferritin. Our findings show some alignment with the HEIRS study, which reported increased insulin resistance in C282Y homozygotes when measured as the homoeostasis model assessment estimated insulin resistance (defined as the fasting serum glucose (mg/dL) multiplied by fasting serum insulin (mU/L) divided by 405). In that study, insulin resistance was not associated with serum ferritin concentrations, indicating that mechanisms unrelated to iron accumulation may cause insulin resistance. When interpreting the results on insulin resistance, we note that the HEIRS study did not find an increased prevalence of diabetes in C282Y homozygotes, implying that the potential clinical consequences of the higher estimates for insulin resistance could not be determined. Hypothetically, the high risk of diabetes may be due to decreased concentrations of hepcidin in C282Y homozygotes. Although primarily produced in the liver, hepcidin is synthesised locally in β cells of the pancreas, where it co-localises with insulin within their granules. Theoretically, if hepcidin had a non-iron mediated effect on either insulin production or insulin sensitivity, this might explain the increased risk of diabetes among C282Y homozygotes regardless of transferrin saturation and/or ferritin levels. Alternatively, the increased risk of diabetes might be due to a linked variant outside the HFE gene but in the same genomic neighbourhood, as the HFE gene maps within the HLA region encompassing the MHC antigens and tumour necrosis factor α. Specifically, the HFE gene is located in the class I region 6p21.3 in linkage disequilibrium with the HLA A and B loci and encodes a protein that binds β-2 microglobulin, as do other MHC class I proteins, but has lost antigen presenting properties. However, the HFE protein does inhibit antigen specific CD8+ T cell activation, and the C282Y variant may be associated with autoimmune diseases, suggesting that this variant may predispose to autoimmune forms of diabetes, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. However, these mechanisms and any potential therapeutic consequences are speculative and need further investigation.

### Elevated serum transferrin saturation and mortality [^112feMAD]. Annals of Family Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A large proportion of US adults have elevated transferrin saturation, an indicator of a predisposition for iron overload. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between elevated serum transferrin saturation and mortality.

Methods

This cohort study was conducted using data from the First Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1 (1971–1974) (NHANES I) merged with the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (1992) (N = 10,714). We used SUDAAN and appropriate weights to make population estimates for the adult US population (aged 25 to 74 years at baseline). All-cause mortality was evaluated in relation to serum transferrin saturation of greater than 45%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, and greater than 60% using Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

In a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for potential confounders, including comorbid diseases, smoking, and cholesterol, all-cause mortality is significantly greater for persons with a serum transferrin saturation of more than 55%, compared with those with saturations below this cutoff (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17–2.21). No one who died had hemochromatosis as any of the 20 listed causes of death. Many of the underlying causes of death for persons with serum transferrin saturation levels of more than 55% are common causes of death in the general population, although these persons were more likely to have died of cirrhosis and diabetes, a finding consistent with iron overload.

Conclusions

In this nationally representative cohort of adults, those with elevated serum transferrin saturation, more than 2% of the adult US population, were at increased risk for all-cause mortality.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

To examine whether current clinical guidelines on testing for haemochromatosis adequately identify C282Y homozygotes at increased risk of diabetes by recommending testing only in individuals with high transferrin saturation and/or high ferritin, we examined risk of diabetes stratified by levels of iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin. For this stratified analysis, we excluded individuals (n = 11 C282Y homozygotes) with a diagnosis of haemochromatosis at study enrolment to exclude that levels of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin in the blood samples obtained at study enrolment were affected by previous therapeutic phlebotomy. Importantly, we found an increased risk of diabetes even in C282Y homozygotes with normal levels of transferrin saturation (hazard ratio for diabetes 2.00 (95% CI 1.04 to 3.84) when comparing C282Y homozygotes with normal transferrin saturation and non-carriers with normal transferrin saturation), normal concentrations of ferritin (3.76, 1.41 to 10.05), or normal levels of both ferritin and transferrin saturation (6.49, 2.09 to 20.18) (fig 3). For C282Y homozygotes with normal iron, risk of diabetes was less pronounced (hazard ratio 1.38, 0.91 to 2.09). Results were similar to those described above if we excluded not only individuals with a diagnosis of haemochromatosis before study enrolment but instead those (n = 78 C282Y homozygotes) with a diagnosis of haemochromatosis at any time before or after study enrolment (data not shown). As diabetes could be diagnosed either before or after blood samples were obtained at study enrolment, figure 4 illustrates when diabetes was diagnosed and the median time between study enrolment and diagnosis of diabetes in C282Y homozygotes and non-carriers with normal levels of iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin. When we restricted the analysis to C282Y homozygotes, the median time from diabetes to study enrolment for C282Y homozygotes with a diagnosis of diabetes before study enrolment was 4.9 years and the median time from study enrolment to diabetes for C282Y homozygotes with a diagnosis of diabetes after study enrolment was 4.2 years.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^1121jFZx]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Assessment and diagnosis

The WHO defines anaemia as blood Hb level below 130 g/L in men and 120 g/L in women. In isolated iron deficiency, serum ferritin (the storage molecule for iron) should be less than 30 ug/L. However, ferritin is an acute phase protein and can be increased in the presence of inflammation. Thus, if there is evidence of concomitant inflammation, such as elevated C reactive protein, ferritin less than 100 ug/L is indicative of IDA. Transferrin, the iron transporter, is generally elevated; however, it is a negative acute phase protein and, therefore, can be normal or reduced in chronic inflammatory states. Serum iron and transferrin saturations (TSAT) will be reduced with TSAT less than 20% required for the diagnosis of IDA. See table 1 for the breakdown of diagnostic criteria for IDA. It is crucial to note that iron deficiency should not be excluded in the presence of a normal Hb as a significant amount of iron must be lost before the Hb levels begin to decline. Thus, a low mean corpuscular Hb with a normal Hb or an increase in red cell distribution width signifies mild iron deficiency without anaemia.

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anaemia

Management

Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the Hb to a normal level. This has been shown to improve QoL, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron replenishment can occur via three routes: oral iron, parenteral oral and transfusion of packed red cells. Each route has its benefits and limitations, which will be discussed below in greater detail.

We observed no convincing difference in relative risk estimates for diabetes between C282Y homozygotes aged 20–65 years and those aged ≥ 66 years (supplementary figure S9). Relative risk estimates were similar for men and women when we stratified the analysis on risk of diabetes according to sex by comparing C282Y homozygous men with non-carrier men and C282Y homozygous women with non-carrier women (supplementary figure S10).

As plasma iron and transferrin saturation can change over time, we examined levels of iron and transferrin saturation in 89 C282Y homozygotes who had plasma iron and transferrin saturation measured first in a blood sample obtained at the day of study enrolment and again in a second blood sample obtained for repeat measurements of plasma iron and transferrin saturation at a median of 10 years later. Of the 89 C282Y homozygotes with repeat samples, 76 had normal iron measured in the first blood sample; of these, 67 (88.2%) still had normal iron measured in the second blood sample. Of the 89 C282Y homozygotes, 24 had normal transferrin saturation measured in the first blood sample; of these, 15 (62.5%) still had normal transferrin saturation measured in the second blood sample (supplementary figure S11). No individuals had a repeat measurement of ferritin. Importantly, all analyses on risk of diabetes and other diseases were based on the first blood sample drawn at the day of study enrolment.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON society [^112KTP8q]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The current clinical scenario

Unlike in the past, fully expressed and potentially lethal HC (with liver cirrhosis, diabetes, endocrine dysfunction, and heart failure) is seen rarely in current clinical practice. This can be ascribed to increased awareness of the disease and, mostly, to the routine assessment of iron biomarkers, particularly serum ferritin. Unfortunately, this is counterbalanced by an increased diagnostic challenge for nonexperts in the iron field, primarily due to the lack of specificity of ferritin.

Ferritin is an essentially intracellular protein that serves to store iron safely. It is also present at very low concentrations (micrograms per liter) in serum, likely through secretion by macrophages. Normal values usually range from 30 to 200 µg/L or 300 µg/L in females and males, respectively. The function of secreted extracellular ferritin remains largely unknown. Several common conditions lead to increased serum ferritin levels, including virtually all inflammatory disorders, hepatic cytolysis (eg, during acute or chronic liver disease), or metabolic syndrome. This translates into a huge number of consultations, overuse of the "first-level" genetic test looking for the presence of the common variants in the HFE gene, and even misdiagnosis due to incorrect interpretation of the results.

The glycoprotein transferrin is the extracellular carrier of iron that is detectable at high concentrations in blood (grams per liter; the third most abundant protein after albumin). Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is calculated as the ratio between serum iron and transferrin (multiplied by the correction factor 1.42) or, less reliably, between serum iron and total iron-binding capacity and expressed as a percentage. TSAT is much less requested in clinical practice but is much more informative about a possible diagnosis of HC. Normal TSAT varies between 20% and 45%. It has been estimated that hyperferritinemia with normal TSAT is associated with increased iron stores in less than 10% of cases. Importantly, TSAT elevation is the hallmark of HC. In HC patients, high TSAT reflects the increased pool of circulating iron due to insufficient hepcidin production and typically precedes the rise of serum ferritin by several years.TSAT tends to remain elevated even in subjects effectively iron-depleted by phlebotomies. Occasional reports of normal TSAT in p. Cys282Tyr homozygotes with hyperferritinemia should always prompt the search for additional cofactors that raise ferritin, such as metabolic syndrome or alcohol intake.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^113mkEGc]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Iron metabolism and its regulation

Since most of the body iron is destined for hemoglobin synthesis, erythropoiesis and iron metabolism are inextricably linked. Iron must be tightly regulated to avoid shortfalls or excesses, which typically result in anemia or iron overload, respectively. The stable concentration of circulating iron, which enables erythropoiesis and other iron-requiring physiological processes, is maintained by baseline dietary absorption, storage, and recycling of iron. Recycled iron within bone marrow, spleen, and liver macrophages is either stored in cytosolic ferritin or exported to carrier proteins. Transferrin is the main iron carrier in circulation, and transferrin saturation of iron-binding sites, calculated as a ratio of serum iron to total transferrin iron-binding capacity, is approximately 20–45% under normal conditions. Iron deficiency is typically diagnosed on the basis of decreased transferrin saturation (i.e. < 15%) and serum ferritin (< 22 ng/mL), tests that effectively supplanted the historical gold standard for diagnosis, the absence of iron stores in bone marrow aspirate samples. Despite their ease of use, there are limitations to the sensitivity and specificity of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin in the diagnosis of iron deficiency. First, there is a lack of established cutoffs to confidently distinguish "iron depletion" from "absolute iron deficiency". Second, additional markers, such as serum soluble TfR1 (sTfR1) or zinc protoporphyrin IX, are in use to identify "iron restricted erythropoiesis". When sTfR1 is combined with serum ferritin (i.e. log(sTfR1/ferritin)) using internal cutoffs, corresponding with 95th or 97.5th percentile distribution within a study population, it is highly sensitive in identifying clinically relevant iron restricted erythropoiesis, but because sTfR1 and log(sTfR1/ferritin) are not standardized, its clinical utility is limited.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^114JLXDd]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Circulating iron bound to transferrin (TIBC, total iron binding capacity — by transferrin) reflects the amount of iron available for metabolizing target cells. Importantly, neither serum iron nor serum transferrin alone should be used as biomarkers of iron status. Instead, transferrin saturation (Tsat), the per cent of transferrin that has iron bound to it (ratio of serum iron and TIBC × 100), is recommended. Reduced Tsat (< 20%) is considered a surrogate of insufficient iron available for metabolizing cells. With malnutrition accompanying chronic diseases, liver synthesis and blood transferrin levels may be low, which can artificially increase Tsat disproportionate to the iron content.

When serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg/L (which is frequent in patients with chronic diseases with pro-inflammatory activation), the diagnosis of ID is more complex. Such values are usually associated with normal/slightly increased intracellular iron stores and the diagnosis of absolute ID cannot be made. If there is restricted iron delivery to target cells (reduced Tsat < 20%), functional ID can be diagnosed.

### How can sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors stimulate erythrocytosis in patients who are iron-deficient? Implications for understanding iron homeostasis in heart failure [^111114Y5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to their effects of hepcidin, activation of oxidative stress and proinflammatory pathways in heart failure can promote the synthesis of ferritin, independent of the level of cytosolic iron. Additionally, the suppression of sirtuin‐1 (SIRT1) in heart failurecan impair autophagic flux, thus limiting the ability of ferritinophagy to replete cytosolic Fe 2+ levels. As a result, the expected relationship between cytosolic Fe 2+ and ferritin levels is disrupted, leading to ferritin levels that are disproportionately higher than the level of cytosolic Fe 2+, and undermining their ability to identify patients with iron depletion. Accordingly, the threshold for serum ferritin used for the diagnosis of iron‐deficiency anaemia is shifted to a substantially higher level in patients with heart failure (to 300–600 ng/ml), and it is coupled with the requirement for a transferrin saturation < 20%. However, the adequacy of this criterion adjustment for serum ferritin has been questioned. In one study, patients with heart failure and an absolute iron deficiency often had normal serum levels of ferritin, and in other reports, myocardial (but not serum) levels of ferritin reflected the presence of cardiac iron deficiency in experimental and clinical heart failure. Furthermore, inflammation and nutritional status can influence transferrin levels, thus complicating the interpretation of transferrin saturation in heart failure.

Diabetes was defined as any hospital contact with diabetes (inpatient admission, emergency department visit, or outpatient visit) at any time before or after study enrolment. Analysis excludes individuals (n = 11 C282Y homozygotes) with diagnosis of haemochromatosis at study enrolment to exclude that levels of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin in blood samples obtained at study enrolment were affected by previous therapeutic phlebotomy. Normal iron was defined as iron 9–34 µmol/L and high iron as > 34 µmol/L. Normal transferrin saturation was defined as 10–45% for women aged ≤ 50 years and 15–45% for women > 50 and men regardless of age. High transferrin saturation was defined as > 45% for both sexes. Normal ferritin was defined as ferritin 12–200 µg/L for women and 12–300 µg/L for men and high ferritin as > 200 µg/L for women and > 300 µg/L for men. As very few C282Y homozygotes had low levels of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin, individuals with low levels of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin were excluded from analysis stratified for specific parameter that was low. Owing to Danish regulations on data privacy, fewer than 3 individuals with diabetes in a column is reported as " < 3" but risk estimates were calculated using exact numbers. CI = confidence interval

### Elevated transferrin saturation and risk of diabetes: three population-based studies [^112xGi5M]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Details are provided in the. Here we demonstrated that transferrin saturation ≥ 50% was associated with a two- to threefold increased risk of developing any form of diabetes, as well as type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes separately. This is the first and largest population-based study that consistently demonstrates transferrin saturation as a risk marker of any form of diabetes, and of type 1 and type 2 diabetes separately, in three independent studies. There was no overlap of individuals between the three studies, thus allowing independent confirmation of findings.

Because the risk of developing diabetes observed in this study increased with the degree of iron overload for which there is a simple treatment (phlebotomy), 1–3% of diabetes cases in the general population and 7% of cases in a diabetes population likely could be resolved if patients received such a treatment earlier in life, equal to ∼300 patients/million in Denmark. These findings reinforce the importance of investigating iron overload in the differential diagnosis of secondary causes of diabetes and support arguments in favor of screening for iron overload in the general population. A health-economic analysis of the cost/benefit ratio of screening for elevated iron saturation in the general or in diabetic populations may help to determine the public health consequences of this study (e.g. advice against iron supplements), and whether large prospective intervention studies should be initiated to show causality between elevated transferrin saturation and diabetes.

### Critical re-evaluation of the identification of iron deficiency States and effective iron repletion strategies in patients with chronic heart failure [^111Ws2Lt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

According to current guidelines, iron deficiency is defined by a serum ferritin level < 100ng/ml or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% if the serum ferritin level is 100–299μg/L. These criteria were developed to encourage the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of renal anaemia. However, in patients with heart failure, these criteria are not supported by any pathophysiological or clinical evidence that they identify an absolute or functional iron deficiency state. A low baseline TSAT-but not serum ferritin level-appears to be a reliable indicator of the effect of intravenous iron to reduce major heart failure events. In randomized controlled trials, intravenous iron decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalization in patients with a TSAT < 20% (risk ratio 0.67 [0.49–0.92]) but not in patients with a TSAT ≥ 20% (risk ratio 0.99 [0.74–1.30]), with the magnitude of the risk reduction being proportional to the severity of hypoferraemia. Patients who were enrolled in clinical trials solely because they had a serum ferritin level < 100μg/L showed no significant benefit on heart failure outcomes, and it is noteworthy that serum ferritin levels of 20–300μg/L lie entirely within the range of normal values for healthy adults. Current guidelines reflect the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, which inadvertently adopted unvalidated criteria to define iron deficiency. Reliance on these guidelines would lead to the treatment of many patients who are not iron deficient (serum ferritin level < 100μg/L but normal TSAT) and ignores the possibility of iron deficiency in patients with a low TSAT but with serum ferritin level of > 300μg/L. Importantly, analyses of benefit based on trial eligibility-driven guidelines substantially underestimate the magnitude of heart-failure-event risk reduction with intravenous iron in patients who are truly iron deficient. Based on all available data, we recommend a new mechanism-based and trial-tested approach that reflects the totality of evidence more faithfully than the historical process adopted by clinical investigators and by the guidelines. Until additional evidence is forthcoming, an iron deficiency state in patients with heart failure should be defined by a TSAT < 20% (as long as the serum ferritin level is < 400μg/L), and furthermore, the use of a serum ferritin level < 100μg/L alone as a diagnostic criterion should be discarded.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Screening primary care patients for hereditary hemochromatosis with transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level: systematic review for the American College of Physicians [^117BGjYx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic phlebotomy for hereditary hemochromatosis is relatively safe and presumably efficacious when offered before cirrhosis develops, so screening primary care patients is of substantial interest.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence on 1) the prevalence of the disease in primary care, 2) the risk for morbid or fatal complications for untreated patients, 3) the diagnostic usefulness of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level in identifying early disease, 4) the efficacy of early treatment, and 5) whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search from 1966 through April 2004, complemented by reference review of identified original studies and review articles published in English.

Study Selection

PubMed Clinical Queries filters search of prognosis, diagnosis, etiology, or treatment were used depending on the question. Two authors reviewed all titles and abstracts.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently reviewed extracted data.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis was 1 in 169 patients to 1 in 556 patients (n = 3 studies). Uncontrolled, prospective studies of genetic homozygous patients did not consistently identify a link to overt hereditary hemochromatosis. A serum ferritin level less than 1000 microg/L was predictive of absence of cirrhosis. Six studies demonstrated reduced survival in patients with cirrhosis. Diagnostic studies varied with respect to case definition. No blinded, independent comparisons of screening tests with the gold standard (biopsy or results of quantitative phlebotomy) or randomized, controlled trials of phlebotomy were identified. Cost-effectiveness analysis was limited by lack of prospective data on the natural history of the disease.

Limitations

Varied case definition and lack of prospective cohort studies or randomized trials.

Conclusions

The available evidence does not demonstrate that benefits outweigh the risks and costs of screening for hemochromatosis.

Cyanosis in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — definition, evaluation, and iron management: The definition of cyanosis is "bluish discoloration of the skin and/or mucous membranes resulting from inadequate oxygenation of the blood", and for cyanosis to be visible, at least 5 g/L of unsaturated hemoglobin in tissue is needed. Cyanotic heart disease encompasses a widely heterogeneous group; therefore, an individualized approach is needed for each patient according to the clinical details. Secondary erythrocytosis and polycythemia are fundamentally different conditions that require different treatments. Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals; consequences may include stroke and myocardial ischemia, and iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test. Limited data suggest that treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^116c5dpZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Transferrin saturation

Transferrin saturation (TfS) is a measure for the iron load of circulating transferrin. It says nothing, however, about the condition of the iron stores, providing only an indirect indication of the extent of iron utilization. Under physiological conditions, 16–45% of transferrin molecules in plasma are "loaded" with iron (3–4 mol of iron per mol of transferrin), and a saturation of < 16% is considered to represent a suboptimum iron supply for the erythropoietic process. While reduced transferrin saturation (< 20%) is accredited with a relatively high sensitivity (90%) for recognizing iron deficiency states, its specificity is poor (40–50%). Since measurements of both serum iron and serum transferrin are subject to quite significant circadian effects, blood samples should always be obtained at the same time of day and repeated frequently. Serum transferrin levels are increased in patients taking oral contraceptive steroids, but reduced in the presence of inflammation (negative APP), meaning that, in patients with acute or chronic inflammatory disorders, TfS may be reduced despite normal iron stores.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in CKD: a summary of the NICE guideline recommendations and their rationale [^11536fLC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The UK-based National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has updated its guidance on iron deficiency and anemia management in chronic kidney disease. This report outlines the recommendations regarding iron deficiency and their rationale. Serum ferritin alone or transferrin saturation alone are no longer recommended as diagnostic tests to assess iron deficiency. Red blood cell markers (percentage hypochromic red blood cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, or reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent) are better than ferritin level alone at predicting responsiveness to intravenous iron. When red blood cell markers are not available, a combination of transferrin saturation < 20% and ferritin level < 100ng/mL is an alternative. In comparisons of the cost-effectiveness of different iron status testing and treatment strategies, using percentage hypochromic red blood cells > 6% was the most cost-effective strategy for both hemodialysis and nonhemodialysis patients. A trial of oral iron replacement is recommended in people not receiving an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and not on hemodialysis therapy. For children receiving ESAs, but not treated by hemodialysis, oral iron should be considered. In adults and children receiving ESAs and/or on hemodialysis therapy, intravenous iron should be offered. When giving intravenous iron, high-dose low-frequency administration is recommended. For all children and for adults receiving in-center hemodialysis, low-dose high-frequency administration may be more appropriate.

### Mortality and risk of diabetes, liver disease, and heart disease in individuals with haemochromatosisC282Y homozygosity and normal concentrations of iron, transferrin saturation, or ferritin: prospective cohort study [^114psDHN]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective study of 132 542 individuals from the general population, we found that HFE C282Y homozygotes had a higher risk of diabetes and liver disease than did non-carriers, whereas risk of heart disease was not increased. Importantly and a novel finding, C282Y homozygotes had increased risk of diabetes even when they had normal levels of transferrin saturation and/or ferritin in a single blood sample obtained at study enrolment. Furthermore, C282Y homozygotes with diabetes had higher mortality from any cause than did non-carriers with diabetes, and as many as 27.3% of all deaths among C282Y homozygotes were potentially attributable to diabetes.

Strengths and weaknesses of study

Among the strengths of our study is the large general population cohort with 132 542 consecutive genotyped individuals, most of whom also had iron, transferrin saturation, and/or ferritin measured. Our comprehensive data on hospital contacts and deaths from the nationwide Danish registries without any loss to follow-up is also a strength.

Our study is limited by not being able to ascertain with certainty whether it is diabetes itself or hypothetically some other unknown associated condition that causes the increased mortality in C282Y homozygotes with diabetes. Additionally, plasma iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin were measured only at study enrolment, and we do not have data on the levels at the time of diagnosis of diabetes. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that iron overload occurred during the interval between study enrolment and the onset of diabetes. However, this possibility does not change our finding that even C282Y homozygotes with normal transferrin saturation and/or ferritin concentrations in a single blood sample were at increased risk of diabetes, indicating that the strategy outlined in most current guidelines, recommending genotyping for C282Y only in individuals with increased levels of transferrin saturation and/or ferritin, may fail to detect some C282Y homozygotes at increased risk of diabetes. As only 16 C282Y homozygotes with diabetes died during follow-up, we do not have sufficient statistical power to analyse the risk of specific causes of death. However, when excluding individuals with liver or heart disease, we still found increased mortality in C282Y homozygotes with diabetes, meaning that concomitant liver or heart disease is unlikely to explain the increased mortality in C282Y homozygotes with diabetes.

### Multivariate genomic scan implicates novel loci and haem metabolism in human ageing [^116iHUey]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Mendelian randomisation of iron traits

We hypothesised that the effect of haem metabolism and chemical homeostasis on healthspan, parental lifespan, and longevity may be mediated through the bioavailability of iron and investigated this hypothesis using MR of GWAS summary statistics of iron-related traits, i.e. serum iron, log ferritin, and transferrin (percentage saturation and absolute levels), against our GWAS results. In a univariate MR framework, we find evidence of a causal effect for serum iron (FDR < 5%), which appears to be consistent with the MR assumptions and is robust to outliers (Supplementary Fig. 11; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). We also find some evidence for an effect of transferrin saturation. However, this association is primarily driven by the well-known hereditary haemochromatosis locus and shows evidence of violating the pleiotropy assumption (i.e. non-zero MR-Egger intercept). We therefore tested all iron traits as exposures simultaneously in a multivariate MR analysis, with our GWAS as the outcome, finding more reliable evidence for causal effects (FDR < 5%; β intercept = 0.0012; 95% CI −0.0005 to 0.0029) of serum iron, transferrin levels, and transferrin saturation. These effects are not driven by only one of the loci, including the hereditary haemochromatosis locus, as confirmed by leave-one-out analyses (Supplementary Data 8). Although the units of the causal effects are consistent across exposures (and pertinent for P values), they are difficult to interpret. We therefore repeated the procedure for the individual component traits: healthspan, parental lifespan, and longevity, recognising the reduction in effective sample size was likely to yield underpowered effect size estimates, although these give a sense of direction and magnitude of the effect in measurable units (Table 3). The multivariate MR effect sizes appear larger than those of the univariate MR, likely due to homeostasis, i.e. variation in one exposure is normally buffered by another. For example, oxidative damage from serum iron may largely be prevented when the metal is bound to transferrin.

### GI cancer associated with iron deficiency anemia… [^111GYABY]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Are patients with iron deficiency anemia at increased risk of also having a gastrointestinal malignancy. Setting: Population-based Study Design: Cohort. Synopsis: The investigators started with 9, 024 adults who were enrolled in a general study of health and nutrition. Eight percent of these patients had iron deficiency, and 1. 6 percent of the total group also was anemic. A GI malignancy was identified during the following two years in 18 patients. None of the premenopausal women with iron deficiency was anemic. Among patients with iron deficiency anemia, one in 16 was diagnosed with a GI malignancy during the subsequent two years. Of patients older than 65 years, 9 percent with anemia had a malignancy.

Only 1 percent of the patients with iron deficiency but without anemia developed a malignancy. The rate of GI malignancy in patients without iron deficiency or anemia was 0. 3 percent. These numbers should be reassuring to clinicians who care for premenopausal women; a previous study has identified a risk of about 6 percent in a more highly selected population. The data confirm other research that has shown a high rate of malignancy in older patients. Bottom Line: Older patients with iron deficiency anemia are 31 times more likely than the general population to have a GI malignancy. Six percent of patients older than 50 years and one in 11 patients older than 65 years will be diagnosed with a malignancy within two years. Iron deficiency anemia in older patients should alert physicians to perform further GI testing.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111iUVEE]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

### The problem with transferrin saturation as an indicator of iron' sufficiency' in chronic kidney disease [^113MtQ4x]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

After a brief review of physiological iron metabolism, we describe diagnostic tests for iron status and iron deficiency anemia in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD) or inflammation. Thereafter we review the dysregulation of iron metabolism in CKD. Specific emphasis is placed on the role of the 'inflammatory' state that develops with the progression of CKD. It invokes changes in iron metabolism that are the exact opposite of those occurring during pure iron deficiency. As a result, transferrin saturation (TSAT) becomes a poorer index of iron availability to the bone marrow and serum ferritin no longer represents iron that can be used during erythropoiesis. We argue that serum iron may provide more information to guide iron therapy than TSAT. In other words, the emphasis on TSAT is misplaced. With the development of a number of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, which restore iron metabolism toward the 'physiologic state', the iron indices indicating sufficient iron availability to avoid functional iron deficiency during therapy of CKD-associated anemia are likely to change. We summarize these changes in the section 'A peek into things to come!', citing the available data.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1 Important Pre-Treatment Information

Discontinue administration of any iron-containing products prior to administration of INFeD.

Assess baseline hematologic (hemoglobin and hematocrit) and iron storage parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin) to monitor response to therapy.

Administer a test dose of INFeD prior to administration of therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Iron Deficiency Anemia

Calculate the INFeD dose based upon Table 1 and formulas below. Continue INFeD until hemoglobin is within the normal range and iron stores are replete.

Administer daily doses of no more than 2 mL of INFeD until the total required dose is administered. Monitor response to therapy by evaluating hematologic parameters (hemoglobin and hematocrit) and iron storage parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin). Iron storage parameters may improve prior to hematologic parameters. Serum ferritin may not be an accurate measure of body iron stores in patients on chronic dialysis.

Alternatively, the total dose may be calculated using the formulas below:

### Iron as an emerging therapeutic target in critically ill patients [^11457cfW]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Higher plasma iron levels correlate with poor outcomes in the ICU

NTBI is released during acute crises observed in the ICU, leading to the saturation of physiological iron-scavenging systems and potentially exacerbating the acute crisis (Fig. 3). Monitoring iron parameters is therefore crucial in the ICU. Currently, total plasma iron and TSAT are commonly measured iron parameters to assess iron availability in the plasma (normal ranges in healthy patients are 20 µM and 30%, respectively). TSAT is calculated as the ratio of serum iron to serum total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), which can be determined from the transferrin concentration or directly measured by titration. Ferritin, the iron storage protein, can also be found in low concentrations in the plasma (between 30 and 300 µg/L for men, between 15 and 150 µg/L for women) and reflects the iron stored in the body. However, the iron content of ferritin can vary, and there is no accepted method for measuring ferritin-bound iron. Furthermore, ferritin is an acute-phase protein whose synthesis is increased during inflammation by circulating cytokines such as IL-6, under which conditions serum ferritin may not correlate with the body's iron storage status. Evaluating plasma iron availability in critically ill patients is complex, so we must measure multiple iron markers to better understand iron homeostasis.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^113Gvcb6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

DIAGNOSIS OF IRON DEFICIENCY

Serum ferritin is widely recognized as the most specific and cost‐effective biomarker for evaluating iron stores in the body. Establishing standardized ferritin thresholds that align with physiological norms is essential for accurately diagnosing low iron stores. However, current guidelines differ, which may lead to the potential underdiagnosis or overdiagnosis of ID.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines ferritin thresholds as < 12 μg/L for children and < 15 μg/L for women, but these values were based on expert opinion rather than physiological data, and the method used to determine cut‐offs was not detailed. A study analysing data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) identified a serum ferritin threshold of 25 μg/L for non‐pregnant women aged 15–49 years. This threshold was derived using restricted cubic spline models that assessed the physiological relationship between serum ferritin and both haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations in healthy individuals. Data from 62 anaemic individuals with either bone marrow‐confirmed ID (n = 54) or a documented response to iron therapy (n = 8) showed that ferritin < 12 μg/L yielded a sensitivity of only 25% for the diagnosis of ID. In contrast, increasing the threshold to < 30 μg/L significantly improved sensitivity to 92%. The soluble transferrin receptor showed a sensitivity of 92%, outperforming ferritin at the < 12 μg/L threshold and matching the performance of ferritin at the < 30 μg/L threshold. Increasingly, experts recommend a ferritin cut‐off of 30 μg/L for healthy males and females over 15 years.,

Although ferritin is the most reliable marker of iron stores, it can be elevated during inflammation, potentially masking ID. Therefore, measuring C‐reactive protein (CRP) or α1‐acid glycoprotein alongside ferritin helps distinguish true ID from inflammation‐related conditions in relevant cases. Additionally, transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptor levels can provide further insights, particularly in cases where ferritin levels may be unreliable due to inflammatory conditions,(Table 1).

MAIN DISORDERS OF IRON METABOLISM: Increased iron requirements, limited external supply, and increased blood loss may lead to iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anaemia. In chronic inflammation, the excess of hepcidin decreases iron absorption and prevents iron recycling, resulting in hypoferraemia and iron restricted erythropoiesis, despite normal iron stores (functional iron deficiency), and finally anaemia of chronic disease (ACD), which can evolve to ACD plus true ID (ACD+ID). In contrast, low hepcidin expression may lead to hereditary haemochromatosis (HH type I, mutations of the HFE gene) and type II (mutations of the hemojuvelin and hepcidin genes). Mutations of transferrin receptor 2 lead to HH type III, whereas those of the ferroportin gene lead to HH type IV. All these syndromes are characterised by iron overload. As transferrin becomes saturated in iron overload states, non-transferrin bound iron appears. Part of this iron is highly reactive (labile plasma iron), inducing free radical formation. Free radicals are responsible for the parenchymal cell injury associated with iron overload syndromes. ROLE OF LABORATORY TESTING IN DIAGNOSIS: In iron deficiency status, laboratory tests may provide evidence of iron depletion in the body or reflect iron deficient red cell production. Increased transferrin saturation and/or ferritin levels are the main cues for further investigation of iron overload. The appropriate combination of different laboratory tests with an integrated algorithm will help to establish a correct diagnosis of iron overload, iron deficiency and anaemia. REVIEW OF TREATMENT OPTIONS: Indications, advantages and side effects of the different options for treating iron overload (phlebotomy and iron chelators) and iron deficiency (oral or intravenous iron formulations) will be discussed.
