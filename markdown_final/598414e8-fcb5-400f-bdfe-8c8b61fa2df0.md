## Question

Effects of omega fatty acids on decreasing infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether omega-3 fatty acids can decrease infection risk, and in which situations and through what mechanisms this effect might occur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility and mechanisms by which EPA/DHA could modulate host defenses. Then, I should verify the highest-quality clinical evidence, especially meta-analyses and large RCTs. Next, I will examine population-specific data in critical illness, surgery, pediatrics, and COVID-19. After that, I need to check for conflicting or negative trials and guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion with dosing and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic rationale. Omega-3 long-chain PUFAs displace arachidonic acid in cell membranes, reduce pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, and increase specialized pro-resolving mediators (resolvins, protectins, maresins) that actively promote resolution of inflammation without compromising antimicrobial host defense, which provides a credible basis for reducing infection susceptibility and severity in inflammatory states [^115MnSyz] [^115KSPBT] [^117RmSza].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical signal in hospitalized adults receiving parenteral nutrition, where lipid composition is tightly controlled. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized trials show that omega-3–enriched parenteral nutrition reduces nosocomial infections by about 40% and sepsis by about 56%, with consistent reductions in ICU and hospital length of stay. Trial sequential analyses suggest adequate power for these outcomes, which strengthens confidence in the effect estimate [^117S3vyB] [^113XNPha] [^1142KjZF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality. I initially thought mortality might also improve, but I should double-check. These meta-analyses consistently show no statistically significant mortality reduction, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize that benefits are centered on infection and resource utilization rather than survival endpoints [^117S3vyB] [^1142KjZF].

> Next, I should review perioperative and trauma populations. Preoperative or perioperative omega-3 immunonutrition has been associated with fewer postoperative infectious complications in gastrointestinal surgery cohorts, and the INTERSEPT trial in early sepsis suggested less progression to severe sepsis or septic shock with EPA/GLA/antioxidant enteral nutrition, though mortality was unchanged. However, heterogeneity and confounding by multi-nutrient blends complicate attribution to omega-3s alone [^1126NJDB] [^114jy3xe] [^116Ahf9y].

> I need to check pediatric and neonatal data carefully. In preterm infants, LCPUFA supplementation does not reduce sepsis incidence, and pediatric critical care guidelines do not recommend immunonutrition, including omega-3s, due to lack of consistent benefit; observational neonatal data on fish oil–containing emulsions are hypothesis-generating but insufficient to change practice [^112yyLuf] [^111Zj5AA].

> Let me consider COVID-19 and respiratory infections. Observational app-based data suggest modestly lower odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among omega-3 users, but this is vulnerable to confounding. A large randomized cod liver oil trial primarily targeting vitamin D did not show reduced COVID-19 incidence, and contemporary ICU guidance frames omega-3s as adjunctive in ARDS rather than definitive therapy, reflecting low-to-moderate quality evidence [^115DvgTa] [^111YyTmc] [^115FGD6F].

> But wait, what about conflicting trials and guidelines. The OMEGA trial in ARDS found enteral omega-3s harmful by ventilator-free days and suggested higher adjusted mortality, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against omega-3s as immune supplements in sepsis. These negative signals likely reflect disease-specific biology, formulation, timing, and the risk of excessive anti-inflammatory effects in already immunosuppressed hosts [^116C9RkJ] [^1116pVWH].

> I should confirm dose and delivery considerations. The clearest infection-reduction signal comes from parenteral omega-3 lipid emulsions at approximately 0.1–0.2 g/kg/day of fish oil as part of PN, whereas enteral omega-3s have shown mixed results and may require higher or more targeted dosing to achieve membrane enrichment and SPM production. Safety monitoring for triglycerides and catheter-related infection risk is essential when using IV lipids [^115FGD6F] [^113VYZya].

> Let me synthesize. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly as EPA/DHA delivered parenterally in appropriate doses, reduce nosocomial infections and sepsis in hospitalized adults requiring PN, likely via pro-resolving mechanisms and reduced pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Benefits do not extend to mortality, pediatric populations lack supportive RCT evidence, and enteral use in sepsis/ARDS remains controversial with potential harm in some contexts, so patient selection, timing, and formulation matter greatly [^117S3vyB] [^1142KjZF] [^1116pVWH] [^111Zj5AA].

> Final check and clinical take: Yes, omega-3 fatty acids can decrease infection risk in selected adult populations receiving parenteral nutrition, with the most consistent evidence in ICU and surgical patients. They should not be considered a universal infection-prevention strategy, and current guidelines advise against routine omega-3 immunonutrition in sepsis while allowing consideration in perioperative or PN contexts where benefits outweigh risks and monitoring is feasible [^117S3vyB] [^115EFoZC] [^1116pVWH].

Omega-3 fatty acids reduce infection risk in **critically ill adults** [^113XNPha] by lowering nosocomial infections and sepsis [^117S3vyB] when given as part of parenteral nutrition, with a 40% reduction in infections and 56% reduction in sepsis [^117S3vyB]. They also shorten ICU and hospital stay [^1142KjZF] and reduce mechanical ventilation duration in sepsis [^113ThATf], but **do not reduce mortality** [^113XNPha]. Evidence is strongest for parenteral omega-3s in ICU patients [^1142KjZF]; enteral omega-3s show mixed results and are not routinely recommended in sepsis [^1116pVWH]. Omega-3s are generally safe, but high-dose or long-term use may impair host defense in some infections, so dosing and timing should be individualized [^116jutG5].

## Clinical evidence in critically ill patients

### Parenteral omega-3 fatty acids

- **Infection reduction**: Omega-3–enriched parenteral nutrition reduces nosocomial infections by ~40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49–0.72) [^113XNPha] and sepsis by ~56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28–0.70) [^113XNPha].

- **Length of stay**: Reduces ICU stay by ~2 days and hospital stay by ~2 days [^113XNPha] [^1142KjZF].

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Shortens ventilation duration in septic patients [^113ThATf].

- **Mortality**: No significant mortality reduction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65–1.07) [^113XNPha].

---

### Enteral omega-3 fatty acids

Enteral omega-3s show **mixed results**: some trials report fewer infections and shorter ventilation, whereas others show no benefit or possible harm [^116C9RkJ]. Routine use in sepsis is **not recommended** due to inconsistent outcomes [^1116pVWH].

---

## Mechanisms of infection reduction

Omega-3s exert **anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects** that may reduce infection risk:

- **Eicosanoid modulation**: Shift from pro-inflammatory ω-6 to less inflammatory ω-3 mediators [^115MnSyz].

- **Specialized pro-resolving mediators**: Resolvins, protectins, and maresins enhance resolution of inflammation and microbial clearance [^1114UHnC].

- **Immune cell function**: Modulate neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte responses to balance host defense and inflammation [^117AMSBK].

---

## Clinical evidence in specific infections

| **Infection type** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Sepsis | Parenteral omega-3s reduce infections and sepsis in ICU patients [^1142KjZF] |
| COVID-19 | Observational data suggest lower risk of testing positive with omega-3 use, but RCTs are limited [^115DvgTa] [^113StkQu] |
| Respiratory infections | Limited evidence; some observational studies suggest reduced risk, but high-quality RCTs are lacking [^113fC9RJ] |

---

## Safety considerations

- **General safety**: Omega-3s are well tolerated; gastrointestinal symptoms are most common.

- **High-dose caution**: Prolonged high-dose use may impair host defense in some infections (e.g. intracellular pathogens) [^116jutG5].

- **Drug interactions**: Potential interactions with anticoagulants and immunosuppressants require monitoring.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Parenteral omega-3s are **recommended for ICU patients requiring PN** to reduce infections and sepsis [^113XNPha] [^1142KjZF]. Enteral omega-3s are **not routinely recommended in sepsis** because of inconsistent evidence [^1116pVWH]. Dosing of **0.1–0.2 g/kg/day of fish oil (EPA/DHA)** is suggested when omega-3 PN is used [^115FGD6F].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

- **Heterogeneity**: Variability in populations, formulations, and dosing limits generalizability [^113ThATf].

- **Mortality**: No consistent mortality benefit demonstrated [^113XNPha].

- **Pediatric evidence**: Limited pediatric data; no clear benefit established [^111Zj5AA].

---

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly when given parenterally in ICU patients, **reduce infection risk and sepsis** [^113XNPha] and shorten ICU and hospital stay [^1142KjZF], but do not improve mortality. Enteral omega-3s have mixed results and are not routinely recommended in sepsis [^1116pVWH].

### Supplementation with fish oil in pregnancy reduces gastroenteritis in early childhood [^112xwsne]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We hypothesized that insufficient intake of fish oil-derived omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs) during pregnancy is a contributing factor to gastroenteritis in early childhood. We examined the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on gastroenteritis symptoms in the offspring's first 3 years of life.

Methods

This was a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial whereby 736 mothers were administered n-3 LCPUFA or control from pregnancy week 24 until 1 week after birth. We measured the number of days with gastroenteritis, number of episodes with gastroenteritis, and the risk of having a gastroenteritis episode in the first 3 years of life.

Results

A median reduction of 2.5 days with gastroenteritis (P = 0.018) was shown, corresponding to a 14% reduction in the n-3 LCPUFA group compared with controls in the first 3 years of life (P = 0.037). A reduction in the number of gastroenteritis episodes (P = 0.027) and a reduced risk of having an episode (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% confidence interval, .66-.97]; p = 0.023) were also shown.

Conclusions

Fish oil supplementation from the 24th week of pregnancy led to a reduction in the number of days and episodes with gastroenteritis symptoms in the first 3 years of life. The findings suggest n-3 LCPUFA supplementation as a preventive measure against gastrointestinal infections in early childhood.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids, inflammation and immunity [^117AMSBK]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids greatly exceeds that of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic gives rise to the eicosanoid family of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes and related metabolites) and through these regulates the activities of inflammatory cells, the production of cytokines and the various balances within the immune system. Fish oil and oily fish are good sources of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Consumption of these fatty acids decreases the amount of arachidonic acid in cell membranes and so available for eicosanoid production. Thus, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids act as arachidonic acid antagonists. Components of both natural and acquired immunity, including the production of key inflammatory cytokines, can be affected by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although some of the effects of n-3 fatty acids may be brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, it is possible that these fatty acids might elicit some of their effects by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms. Such n-3 fatty acid-induced effects may be of use as a therapy for acute and chronic inflammation, and for disorders which involve an inappropriately activated immune response.

### Omega-6 sparing effects of parenteral lipid emulsions-an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [^115EFoZC]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Critical illness is often characterized by an imbalanced immune response, which can lead to excessive cytokine release and accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress ultimately result in tissue damage, multi organ failure and high mortality rates. Parenteral lipid emulsions provide fatty acids (FAs) as a source of calories and cellular building blocks and have been under investigation because of their immunomodulating features. Traditionally, parenteral lipid emulsions are derived from plant — and especially soybean oil (SO) to provide the patient with essential long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, SO's ratio of omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs to omega-3 polyunsaturated FAs (7:1) is being regarded critically. In vivo, linoleic acid (omega-6) is converted to arachidonic acid and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. On the other hand, α-linolenic acid (omega-3) is the metabolic precursor of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which both have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties like inhibitory effects on various innate and adaptive immune cells and the transcription of inflammatory cytokines. Unfortunately, the pathway of α-linolenic acid conversion to DHA and EPA appears to be highly ineffective in most humans and an abundance of omega-6 FAs will furthermore suppress the balancing effects of omega-3 FA conversion, as both FAs (omega-3 and omega-6) compete for the same enzymes. Therefore, omega-6 FA reducing strategies have been introduced to clinical nutrition. A reduction in omega-6 FAs can be achieved with the addition of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), olive oil (OO) or fish oil (FO) to SO-based lipid emulsions. FO supplements, as a major source of DHA and EPA, can simultaneously provide adequate levels of omega-3 FAs, which is regarded as an attractive immunomodulatory treatment option with potential clinical benefits. Hitherto, meta-analyses solely focused on the FO aspect, resulting in limited evidence regarding the overall picture of omega-6 FA reduction. After aggregating 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2015, Manzanares et al. found that lipid emulsions with a FO component may reduce infectious complications, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and hospital length of stay (LOS) in critically ill patients. In the most recent meta-analysis by Pradelli et al. FO containing parenteral nutrition (PN) again reduced the rate of infections and hospital as well as ICU LOS. Current nutrition guidelines state that DHA and EPA (FO dose of 0.1–0.2 g/kg/d) can be provided in patients receiving PN. Ambiguous results regarding other omega-6 sparing strategies are delineated, however without a clear recommendation. In recent years, several new RCTs on omega-6 sparing effects in general and on FO-containing lipid emulsions in particular have been published. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to give a broad and comprehensive update on the emerging topic.

### Protective nutrients [^116FBrqv]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Recognition that specific nutrients can be beneficial when consumed in amounts above the accepted daily requirements has provided a major impetus for the critical examination of dietary approaches with single or multiple nutrient supplements chosen to modulate the inflammatory response, enhance immune function, or improve the blood-gut barrier. Patients suffering the effects of hypercatabolism caused by surgery, cancer, or extensive burns are prime candidates for immunonutrition, as the intervention has come to be known, as are immunosuppressed patients with the human immunodeficiency virus or other overwhelming infections. This review focuses on key nutrients used in clinical trials for which a body of information on the mode of action and metabolic pathways is available. The topics covered include the amino acids, glutamine and arginine; omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexanoic acid; vitamin A; and zinc. Lastly, we address the area of pre- and probiotics and how "friendly" microorganisms are being incorporated into therapeutic regimens aimed at sustaining health. The use of immunonutrition requires judicious consideration of the potential undesirable effects of certain additives in clinical settings where enhanced immune responsiveness can translate into tissue damage and altered mucosal defenses.

### Association between enteral essential fatty acids and plasma phospholipid essential fatty acids related immune response in critically ill adults with COVID-19: a prospective cohort study [^116JFSNu]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The mortality rate for people having COVID‐19 disease is high (25%–50%) for those admitted to the adult intensive care unit (ICU). COVID‐19 creates dysregulated immune responses in the respiratory tract and severe inflammation and damage to endothelial cells in the heart, kidneys, liver and intestine. Patients with severe COVID‐19 disease exhibit decreased clearance of infected cells, increased inflammation markers related to tissue damageand elevated mucous production. Pulmonary aspergillosis co‐infection with severe COVID‐19 is frequently associated with increased mortality. Immune response to infection involves utilization of essential fatty acids, but the impact of intake of essential fatty acids for those suffering respiratory failure during COVID‐19 disease is not clear.

Host immunity to infection and subsequent inflammation is driven by utilization of essential fatty acids for eicosanoid signals from arachidonic acid (20:4n‐6, AA). Essential fatty acid deficiency reduces immunological responses of innate and acquired immunity. Infiltration of neutrophil and NK cells is the first response to infection. Severe disease is due to failure of nonspecific first‐line defense attributed to failure of expression of 5‐lipoxygenase pathways or phospholipase A 2 essential to oxylipin synthesis from phospholipid 20:4n‐6 and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n‐3, EPA) derived from phospholipids within seconds of immune stimuli. After phospholipase A 2 release of arachidonic acid, production of leukotriene (LT) A 4 by 5 lipoxygenaseoccurs in addition to activating a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in immune signals. Phospholipase A 2, phosphatidylserine specific phospholipase, and levels of prostaglandin E 2 and F 2α are also elevated after infection.N‐3 fatty acids, specifically 20:5n‐3 and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n‐3, DHA), attenuate immune responses and inflammation by enhancing synthesis of mediators arising from series 3 and 5 prostaglandins and leukotrienes, protectins, and resolvins or by indirectly altering intracellular signaling cascades and altering transcription of genes that downregulate inflammation. Thus, the n‐6 to n‐3 fatty acid balance in the metabolic cascade that follows release of 20:4n‐6, 20:5n‐3 or 22:6n‐3 from the sn ‐2 position of phospholipid provides a potential mechanism for fatty acid intervention in the postinfection immune response. Leukotriene B 4 strongly induces monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)‐1 production. Interleukin (IL)‐6, IL‐2, IL‐17, granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF), interferon (IFN)‐γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)‐1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)‐1α, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α also orchestrate symptom progression.

### Nutrition of the COVID-19 patient in the intensive care unit (ICU): a practical guidance [^115FGD6F]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of EN enriched with omega-3 fatty acids should be preferred in case of ARDS. Fish oil-enriched intravenous fat emulsions should be prescribed if PN is required

A systematic review and meta-analysis on fish oil (FO) enteral supplementation suggests an advantage for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) acid supplementation in ARDS patients in terms of length of ventilation and length of ICU stay, but not mortality. However, these conclusions were based on low-quality studies. A Cochrane analysis found that enteral EPA and DHA may improve oxygenation and length of ventilation and length of stay, but these findings were mainly based on low-quality evidence studies. Negative outcome associated with administration of enteral FO has been only observed when administered in a bolus and with a low protein regimen. The immunoregulator effects of EPA and DHA may have a beneficial impact in the severe cytokine storm observed in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. Therefore, we suggest that EN enriched with 3.5 g/day EPA and DHA can be administered in this disease, not in a bolus. Higher amounts up to 9 g/day have been administered safely.

FO-based intravenous lipid emulsions have been extensively analyzed in a meta-analysis including 49 prospective randomized controlled studies with intervention groups receiving omega-3 fatty acids compared to standard intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs), as a part of PN covering > 70% of the energy provision. Mortality was not decreased significantly, but a significant decrease was observed in relative risk of infection (40% lower) with omega-3 fatty acid-enriched ILEs, in ICU and in hospital lengths of stay. Risk of sepsis was also reduced by 56%. This latest analysis increases our knowledge on FO-enriched lipid emulsions. If PN including ILEs is required in this population suffering from COVID-19 ARDS, FO-enriched lipid emulsions should be prescribed. The provision of omega-3 fatty acids increases the EPA and DHA plasma levels. The recommended FO doses are 0.1–0.2 g/kg/day.

### Association between enteral essential fatty acids and plasma phospholipid essential fatty acids related immune response in critically ill adults with COVID-19: a prospective cohort study [^1155BJmi]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patients not fed EPA + DHA vs fed EPA + DHA were similar in age and sex (Table 1). The specific comorbidities, indicative of any clinical disease, were identified for each patient from the patient's electronic record. The total number of comorbidities was similar between hospitalized groups (Table 1).

Effects of diet and treatment period in the ICU on plasma phospholipid

Quantitative values for plasma content (µg/ml of plasma) of each fatty acid in total plasma phospholipid are illustrated (Table 2). Values for individual essential fatty acids species containing 18:2n‐6, 20:4n‐6, 18:3n‐3, 20:5n‐3, or 22:6n‐3 in phosphatidylcholine are also illustrated (Table 3).

Table 2
Essential fatty acid content of plasma total phospholipids of patients with COVID‐19 on day 1 of admission to hospital and subsequently to the ICU.

Table 3
Fatty acids of plasma phosphatidylcholine for COVID‐19 patients in the ICU.

Essential fatty acid content of plasma total phospholipids of COVID‐19 infected patients who were admitted to the ICU indicated a reduced plasma content of 18:2n‐6 and 18:3n‐3 by approximately 20% on day 1 of hospital admission compared with the reference group (Table 2). Plasma content of 18:2n‐6 remained low for patients not fed EPA + DHA but were restored to normal levels by the end of week one in the ICU in those fed EPA + DHA (Table 2). The total plasma phospholipid content of other essential fatty acids for patients infected with COVID‐19 admitted to the ICU was similar to that observed for the reference group.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115yNuUL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

The following items from the each study were extracted into standardized data abstraction forms by two reviewers (WT and ZS) independently: first author's last name, publication year, sample size, country of origin, the composition of nutrition, administration strategies, and secondary organ dysfunction. The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcomes were the length of ICU stay, the duration of hospital stay, infectious complications, and the duration of mechanical ventilation. The methodological quality of each trial was evaluated by two of the researchers (WT and ZS) independently, and the Jadad's scale and Cochrane Handbook for risks of bias assessments were used.

Statistical analysis

RevMan software (version 5.3.5) was used in our meta-analysis. We reported binary outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes as weighted mean differences (WMD). Summary effect estimates were presented with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was explored for all the meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was measured and quantified using the I 2 test and the Mantel–Haenszel χ2 test. Statistical heterogeneity was predefined at I 2 > 50% or P < 0.05 by Mantel–Haenszel χ2 test. We reported results from a fixed effect model if there was no statistical heterogeneity (P ≥ 0.05 or I 2 ≤ 50%), or, a randomized effect model was used. Publication bias was assessed for all analysis after visual inspection of funnel plots. The Cohen's k was used to assess the agreements between reviewers for trial eligibility and methodological quality assessment.

### Omega-3 fatty acids improve the diagnosis-related clinical outcome [^111tR5t2]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Supplementation of clinical nutrition with omega-3 fatty acid in fish oil exerts immune-modulating and organ-protective effects, even after short-term application. The aim of this study was to evaluate dose-dependent effects of parenteral supplementation of a 10% fish oil emulsion (Omegaven, Fresenius-Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) on diagnosis- and organ failure-related outcome.

Design

Prospective, open label, multiple-center trial.

Patients and Methods

A total of 661 patients from 82 German hospitals receiving total parenteral nutrition for ≥ 3 days were enrolled in this study. The sample included 255 patients after major abdominal surgery, 276 with peritonitis and abdominal sepsis, 16 with nonabdominal sepsis, 59 after multiple trauma, 18 with severe head injury, and 37 with other diagnoses. The primary study end point was survival; secondary end points were length of hospital stay and use of antibiotics with respect to the primary diagnosis and the extent of organ failure. Multiple quasi-linear and logistic regression models were used for calculating diagnosis-related fish oil doses associated with best outcome.

Results

The patients enrolled in this survey were (mean ± sd) 62.8 ± 16.5 yrs old, with a body mass index of 25.1 ± 4.2 and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score of 32.2 ± 13.6. Length of hospital stay was 29.1 ± 18.7 days (12.5 ± 14.8 days in the intensive care unit). Total parenteral nutrition, including fish oil (mean, 0.11 g.kg(-1).day(-1)), was administered for 8.7 ± 7.5 days and lowered hospital mortality as predicted by Simplified Acute Physiology Score II from 18.9% (95% confidence interval, 17.4–20.4%) to 12.0% (p < .001). The fish oil dose.kg.day did correlate with beneficial outcome (intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, mortality). Fish oil had the most favorable effects on survival, infection rates, and length of stay when administered in doses between 0.1 and 0.2 g.kg(-1).day(-1). Lower antibiotic demand by 26% was observed when doses of 0.15–0.2 g.kg(-1).day(-1) were infused as compared with doses of < 0.05 g.kg(-1).day(-1). After peritonitis and abdominal sepsis, multiple quasi-linear regression models revealed a fish oil dose for minimizing intensive care unit stay of 0.23 g.kg(-1).day(-1) and an inverse linear relationship between dosage and intensive care unit stay in major abdominal surgery.

Conclusion

Administration of omega-3 fatty acid may reduce mortality, antibiotic use, and length of hospital stay in different diseases. Effects and effect sizes related to fish oil doses are diagnosis dependent. In view of the lack of substantial study literature concerning diagnosis-related nutritional single-substrate intervention in the critically ill, the present data can be used in formulating hypotheses and may serve as reference doses for randomized, controlled studies, which may, for instance, confirm the value of omega-3 fatty acid in the adjunctive therapy of peritonitis and abdominal sepsis.

### The intensive care medicine research agenda in nutrition and metabolism [^1126NJDB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Immune-modulating nutrition

The use of immune-modulating macronutrients (e.g. glutamine, arginine, and omega-3 fatty acids) and micronutrients (e.g. antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E and the minerals selenium and zinc) used alone (pharmaconutrition) or in combination (immunonutrition) to enrich EN or PN and improve outcomes of ICU patients has been challenged in a number of RCTs. The REDOXS trial showed an increase in mortality with high doses of enteral and parenteral glutamine (0.6 g/kg per day). The OMEGA trial showed that enteral supplementation of n-3 fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid, and antioxidants in patients with acute lung injury did not improve the primary endpoint of ventilator-free days or other clinical outcomes and might be harmful. In the MetaPlus study, high-protein EN enriched with glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, and antioxidants did not reduce infectious complications or improve other clinical endpoints when compared to standard high-protein EN and may have been harmful as suggested by an increased adjusted 6-month mortality. A recent meta-analysis showed that enteral glutamine supplementation does not confer clinical benefit in critically ill patients. However, in severe burn patients, enteral glutamine supplementation was associated with reduction in hospital mortality and stay.

The danger of providing arginine in the setting of sepsis has been challenged, as multiple studies in septic patients showed no adverse hemodynamic changes in response to intravenous arginine infusion. The use of arginine/fish oil formulas may still be beneficial in elective surgical patients, as its use has been shown in four recent meta-analyses to reduce infection and hospital LOS and improve other clinical outcomes (Supplementary References). In severe acute pancreatitis, three small studies in immune-modulating nutrition of varying components showed improved outcomes, but the small numbers enrolled were such that only one reached significance and a meta-analysis was negative (Supplementary References). This last group of patients (severe acute pancreatitis) should be studied further before discounting immune-modulating nutrition across the board. Important questions regarding immune-modulating nutrition remain (Table 1).

### Association between omega-3 fatty acids and autoimmune disease: evidence from the umbrella review and mendelian randomization analysis [^111mcUjf]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Autoimmune diseases are a group of disorders characterized by abnormal immune responses that mistakenly target and attack healthy cells, tissues, and organs, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. Omega-3 fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory activities and may decrease abnormal immune activity. However, the role of omega-3 fatty acids in various autoimmune diseases is still unclear. This umbrella review and Mendelian randomization (MR) study aims to summarize the highest available evidence on omega-3 fatty acids and autoimmune disease.

Methods

We conducted an umbrella review by searching electronic databases to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The selection criteria included systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, which evaluated omega-3 fatty acids as the exposure and autoimmune disease as the outcome variable. Two authors independently assessed the overlapping and quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR-2 tool. We also performed MR studies to investigate the potential causal effect of fatty acids on the risk of various autoimmune diseases, utilizing data from the meta-analysis of the UKB-TOPMed and FinnGen cohorts.

Result

The umbrella review identified 21 studies (8 systematic reviews and 13 meta-analyses) on 9 autoimmune diseases and 30 diseases in the MR study. AMSTAR 2 categorized the quality of evidence in six studies as critically low, six studies as low, eight studies as moderate, and one as high-quality evidence. The consistent result between the review and the MR study demonstrated the benefit of omega-3 fatty acids on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Additionally, in our summary review, omega-3 fatty acids can improve disease activity and inflammation biomarkers; however, MR studies provided no consistent evidence for the causal effects of omega-3 fatty acids on psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes (T1D), IgA nephropathy (IgAN), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Conclusion

The current study presented solid evidence highlighting the advantageous impact of omega-3 fatty acids on SLE and RA. This was achieved through the reduction of disease risk, the decrease of disease activity, and the mitigation of inflammatory biomarkers. To stratify another autoimmune illness, it is necessary to carry out rigorous evaluations to surpass the existing findings and enhance understanding in this domain.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116nZSab]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

The present study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) of randomized controlled trials. We conducted an electronic search of PubMed database up to Feb 2016 for relevant studies that tested the effect of omega-3 fatty acids enriched nutrition on septic patients. And we limited citations to prospective randomized controlled trials in adults. The following search terms were used: 1) omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid, or docosahexaenoic acid; 2) sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. In order to identify other potentially eligible studies that had not been captured with our primary electronic search, the reference lists of retrieved published papers and recent reviews were also reviewed. The literature language was restricted to English.

Study selection

Two investigators (WT and ZS) reviewed studies for inclusion, retrieved potentially relevant studies, and decided on study eligibility independently. Any differences were resolved by consensus. Agreements of trial eligibility between reviewers were assessed by using Cohen's k. As the current meta-analysis was based on trials which published previously, no ethical approval or patient consent was required.

Inclusion criteria

Studies were considered eligible if the following criteria were present: 1) the study design was a randomized controlled trial in adults (≥ 18 years of age); 2) subjects were patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock; 3) the study compared omega-3 fatty acids enriched nutrition (administrated via either parenteral or enteral route) with control (septic patients treated with an omega-3 fatty acids deficiency nutrition); 4) the mortality (at 28-days or, if not available, mortality at any time was recorded), the length of ICU stay, the duration of hospital, infectious complications, or the duration of mechanical ventilation was reported.

Exclusion criteria

The exclusion criterion was: using healthy people as control, administration strategies were different between study and control group, the article was a review, editorial, children's research, animal study, letter or other type of publication not based on original research, or the study did not include extractable outcomes.

### Association between enteral essential fatty acids and plasma phospholipid essential fatty acids related immune response in critically ill adults with COVID-19: a prospective cohort study [^111afQQR]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronaviruses infect the epithelium, modifying host cell metabolism by catabolizing plasma and membrane phospholipid to produce lipid components essential to viral replication. The coronavirus spike protein has three binding pockets for linoleic acid (18:2n‐6, LA), stabilizing the locked S conformation. We recently reported that COVID‐19 infection results in early fundamental depletion of plasma essential n‐6 fatty acid levels suggesting competition between virus and host for essential fatty acid. In patients with high mortality depletion of plasma n‐6 fatty acids content results in n‐6 fatty acid levels that may be too low to stimulate host immunity. At hospital admission, COVID‐19 infected patients who survive exhibit higher proportions of 20:4n‐6 in plasma phospholipids concurrent with elevation in plasma TNF‐α and IFN‐ɣ level compared with healthy patients. In contrast, more than half of patients who die of this virus exhibit very low 18:2n‐6 and 20:4n‐6 content in plasma phospholipids on hospital admission and a low level of primary inflammatory signals indicating limited stimulation of host immunity. Thus, COVID‐19 infection results in early and varied aberrations of essential fatty acid metabolism. Several papers and reviews examining the role of n‐3 fatty acids suggest that n‐3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of infection and provide an antiviral therapy to reduce the 'broad' risk after infection. Definitive studies of signals and immunological events affected are lacking.

We hypothesized that enteral formulas containing 20:5n‐3 and 22:6n‐3 would increase the concentration of circulating plasma phospholipid n‐3 essential fatty acids and modify the immune response by decreasing proinflammatory signals. This hypothesis was assessed in a prospective cohort study by feeding 20:5n‐3 and 22:6n‐3 to patients admitted to the ICU with COVID‐19‐associated respiratory failure to determine benefit to restoring the balance of essential fatty acids and impact on markers of immune response. This knowledge could affect treatment and disease outcome during hospitalization in the ICU because 25–50% of these patients do not survive.

### Molecular mechanisms of pharmaconutrients [^115vsXrM]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2010). Low credibility.

Nutritional supplementation has become the standard of care for management of critically ill patients. Traditionally, nutritional support in this patient population was intended to replete substrate deficiencies secondary to stress-induced catabolism. Recognition of the influence of certain nutrients on the immune and inflammatory response of the critically ill has led to the evolution of more sophisticated nutritional strategies and concepts. Administration of immune-enhancing formulas supplemented with a combination of glutamine, arginine, omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 FA), and nucleotides have been shown in most studies to reduce infectious outcomes. More recently, the separation of nutritional support from the provision of key nutrients has led to a further appreciation of the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits of isolated nutrients, such as glutamine and antioxidants. The purpose of this article is to review the molecular mechanisms that are unique to each class of frequently utilized nutrients. A better understanding of the specific molecular targets of immunonutrients will facilitate application of more refined nutritional therapies in critically ill patients.

### Modulation of host defence against bacterial and viral infections by omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^116jutG5]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs) are used widely in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, their effect in infectious disease requires a particular attention.

Methods

The present article discusses their anti-inflammatory and immune properties involved in the host defence and presents a systematic review of the effects of their oral administration on the prevention and outcome of experimental and clinical infections.

Results

At a dose corresponding to an human dose of 500 mg/day, n-3 LC-PUFAs intake is beneficial against experimental infections caused by extracellular pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus by reducing inflammation, and reduces the incidence of pneumococcal infections in the elderly, but at 2–4-fold higher doses as occurs in some human intervention and/or during long-term it becomes detrimental in intestinal infections with Citrobacter rodentium or Helicobacter hepaticus by exacerbating anti-inflammatory response. They are also harmful against infections caused by intracellular pathogens as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Influenza virus and Herpes simplex virus by affecting the immune cell response.

Conclusion

The effects of n-3-LC-PUFAs on infections depend on the pathogen and the n-3 LC-PUFA dose and timing. Caution should be recommended for high-dose and long-term supplementation in humans.

### Anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids in critical illness: novel mechanisms and an integrative perspective [^115yy6Vd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fish oil-based nutrition is protective in severe critical care conditions. Regulation of the activity of transcription factor NF-kappaB is an important therapeutic effect of the major omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA and DHA).

Methods and Results

Using the articles obtained by a Pubmed research, this article reviews three aspects of NF-kappaB/inflammatory inhibition by fish oil. (1) Inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway at several subsequent steps: extracellular, free omega-3 inhibits the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 by endotoxin and free saturated fatty acids. In addition, EPA/DHA blocks the signaling cascade between Toll-like/cytokine receptors and the activator of NF-kappaB, IKK. Oxidized omega-3 also interferes with the initiation of transcription by NF-kappaB. (2) The altered profile of lipid mediators generated during inflammation, with production of the newly identified, DHA-derived inflammation-resolving mediator classes (in addition to the formation of less pro-inflammatory eicosanoids from EPA). Resolvin D1 and Protectin D1 are potent, endogenous, DHA-derived lipid mediators that attenuate neutrophil migration and tissue injury in peritonitis and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Their production is increased in the later stages of an inflammatory response, at which time they enhance the removal of neutrophils. (3) Modulation of vagal tone with potential anti-inflammatory effects: vagal fibers innervating the viscera down-regulate inflammation by activating nicotinic receptors upon infiltrating and resident macrophages. Stimulation of the efferent vagus is therapeutic in experimental septic shock. Fish oil supplementation increases vagal tone following myocardial infarction and in experimental human endotoxinemia.

Conclusion

It remains to be shown whether these pleiotropic actions of EPA/DHA contribute to fish oil's therapeutic effect in sepsis.

### Randomized clinical trial of omega-3 fatty acid-supplemented enteral nutrition versus standard enteral nutrition in patients undergoing oesophagogastric cancer surgery [^115U4vn7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Radical surgery offers patients with oesophagogastric cancer the best prospect of cure, but perioperative risks are high. Morbidity rates of up to 43 and 60 per cent following oesophageal and gastric cancer surgery respectively have been reported in the UK. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (O-3FAs) has been shown to be beneficial in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.

An immunoenhancing diet (IED) can modulate both the hyperinflammatory and compensatory phases associated with surgery. O-3FAs, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are important constituents of immunonutrition owing to their effects on eicosanoid balance. O-3FAs have anti-inflammatory properties, leading to the production of eicosanoids that are less inflammatory than those produced by omega-6 fatty acids (O-6FAs).

The expression of HLA-DR is crucial in the specific immune response to infection. Reduced HLA-DR expression correlates directly with infectious complications and continued sepsis. HLA-DR expression is reduced on the T lymphocytes of patients who develop postoperative infections.

Existing results of immunonutrition in patients with gastrointestinal cancer are inconsistent. Some have reported reduced infective complications and shortened hospital stays–, whereas others have found no advantages–. These studies are confounded by heterogeneous groups of patients with cancer, numerous centres recruiting small numbers of patients and failure to analyse on an intention-to-treat basis–.

The primary aim of the present prospective randomized trial was to study the effect of perioperative enteral immunonutrition with O-3FAs on clinical outcome in a homogeneous group of patients with oesophagogastric cancer. A secondary aim was to examine the immunological effects of O-3FAs on these patients.

Prenatal omega-3 fatty acids — dose, timing, and outcome have been reported. In a recent clinical trial, high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation at 2.4 g/day to pregnant women, beginning at 24 week of gestation, resulted in a 30% reduction in relative risk of persistent wheeze or asthma at age 3 years, although the report notes the need to ensure no safety issues before use for asthma prevention.

### Micronutrients and sickle cell disease, effects on growth, infection and vaso-occlusive crisis: a systematic review [^115nJZ9w]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with Sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit signs of poor growth, increased susceptibility to infection and recurrent episodes of painful vaso-occlusive crises. Micronutrient deficiencies may increase susceptibility to these outcomes. We conducted a systematic review to assess the strength of evidence for improved outcomes related to micronutrient interventions. Six randomized-controlled trials of moderate quality met the inclusion criteria. Zinc supplementation was associated with improved growth and decreased incidence of infection and is a promising intervention in the management of SCD patients. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with limited reduction in vaso occlusive crises. This review identifies key knowledge gaps, which are important research priorities for nutritional interventions.

### Dietary omega-3 fatty acids increase survival and decrease bacterial load in mice subjected to Staphylococcus aureus-induced sepsis [^1114UHnC]. Infection and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis caused by Staphylococcus aureus is increasing in incidence. With the alarming use of antibiotics, S. aureus is prone to become methicillin resistant. Antibiotics are the only widely used pharmacological treatment for sepsis. Interestingly, mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids have better survival of S. aureus-induced sepsis than mice fed HFD rich in saturated fatty acids (HFD-S). To investigate what component of polyunsaturated fatty acids, i.e., omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, exerts beneficial effects on the survival of S. aureus-induced sepsis, mice were fed HFD rich in omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids for 8 weeks prior to inoculation with S. aureus Further, mice fed HFD-S were treated with omega-3 fatty acid metabolites known as resolvins. Mice fed HFD rich in omega-3 fatty acids had increased survival and decreased bacterial loads compared to those for mice fed HFD-S after S. aureus-induced sepsis. Furthermore, the bacterial load was decreased in resolvin-treated mice fed HFD-S after S. aureus-induced sepsis compared with that in mice treated with vehicle. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids increase the survival of S. aureus-induced sepsis by reversing the deleterious effect of HFD-S on mouse survival.

### Enteral nutrition with eicosapentaenoic acid, γ-linolenic acid and antioxidants in the early treatment of sepsis: results from a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study: the INTERSEPT study [^116Ahf9y]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

It has been demonstrated that nutritional support by feeding patients specialized diets, as a result of its capacity to interfere with a variety of biological processes, can modulate the chain of inflammatory responses. Recent pharmaceutical interventions proposed for sepsis have sought to focus on regulating the chain of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, which are responsible for causing the systemic characteristics of the disease and consequently leading to multiple organ failure. The inflammatory reaction is capable of activating the synthesis of several lipid mediators which are involved in the complex regulation of the inflammatory process.

Lipid mediators are synthesized by three main pathways, cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450, by using fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and γ-linolenic acid (GLA) as substrates, but the biological anti-inflammatory activities of EPA and GLA are far beyond the simple regulation of eicosanoid production. For instance, EPAs can affect immune cell responses through the regulation of gene expression and subsequent downstream events by acting as ligands for nuclear receptors and as control transcription factors. EPA can also affect the activity of the proinflammatory transcription nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which regulates the expression of many proinflammatory gene-encoding adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines and other effectors of the innate immune response system. Researchers have recently described that the two main active fish oil pharmaconutrients, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid, are substrates of two novel classes of mediators called resolvins and protectins, which are involved in the resolution of the inflammatory process.

In 1999, Gadek and co-workers demonstrated that the use of a diet enriched with EPA, GLA and antioxidants can improve oxygenation status in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The same study demonstrated that patients nourished with this diet spend fewer days in the ICU as well as in the hospital. This diet was further evaluated in two additional studies published in 2006. Singer et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of an EPA/GLA diet in improving oxygenation status and decreasing the ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) of patients with acute lung injury (ALI). This diet was also associated with lower mortality rates on the basis of 28-day all-cause mortality. Similar results were observed by Pontes-Arruda et al. in which such a diet was fed to patients with ARDS secondary to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

### Impact of SMOFlipid emulsion integration in total parenteral nutrition on inpatient outcomes and economic burden for preterm neonates: a retrospective cohort study [^111bmYPJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In Egypt, the reported incidence rate of sepsis in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is approximately 33%. Many studies have found an association between bacteremia outbreaks in the NICU and intravenous lipid emulsion, which consequently elevates the risk of infections, mortality rates, and extends the duration of hospital stays with high costs associated with the total treatment. This dilemma places healthcare providers in a precarious position: the imperative to administer lipid solutions as a component of TPN to support the nutritional needs of preterm infants starkly contrasts with the potential adverse health outcomes associated with traditional lipid emulsions.

An alternative lipid emulsion, fish oil (FO)-containing lipid emulsions such as SMOFlipid (Fresenius Kabi), is a mixed-composite lipid emulsion. It differs from standard emulsions by increasing omega-3 (α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), α-tocopherol, oleic acid (mono-unsaturated omega-9 fatty acid), and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) while decreasing the content of omega-6 (Linoleic acid).

Using SMOFlipid led to improved metabolism with a reversed energy deficit. It modulates oxidative stress by reducing the impact of lipid peroxidation on oxidative stress. It increased antioxidants, leading to enhanced immune system strength and reduced immunosuppression. In preterm infants with preexisting inflammation, it prevented the occurrence of hyperinflammation. Although there is evidence of the beneficial effects of lipid emulsions enriched in PUFA n-3, MCT, and LCT, there is insufficient information regarding their cost-effectiveness. Using SMOFlipid emulsion in preterm infants may have a cost-minimization effect by reducing the incidence of sepsis, a serious and costly complication. However, the utility of this nutritional regimen has not yet been well studied in developing countries with limited resources.

Considering these challenges, our study aims to elucidate the potential beneficial health outcomes and economic impact of including SMOFlipid emulsion in TPN for preterm infants, specifically focusing on the incidence of neonatal sepsis, LOS in the NICU, and the associated economic implications from the perspective of healthcare providers in Egypt.

Sepsis was reported in 9 studies (1141 patients), of which 2 were ICU studies and 7 non‐ICU studies. Compared with standard lipid emulsions, ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN resulted in a significant 56% reduction in the risk of sepsis (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28‐0.70; P = 0.0004) (Figure 6). No meta‐analyses were performed on hospital readmissions, ICU‐free days, or ventilation‐free days, as only 1 or no studies reported each of these outcomes.

Trial sequential analysis for all significant clinical outcomes (infection rate, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and sepsis) showed adequate power (Figures S1–S4), and thus these estimates can be considered conclusive.

Nonclinical Outcomes

Significant benefits were found in 10 of the 24 laboratory parameters analyzed (Table S2). These were significant benefits in marker liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT, and GGT), higher levels of the antioxidant α‐tocopherol, as well as lower levels for markers of inflammation such as TNF‐α. A significant benefit was observed in fatty‐acid profiles, with increases in levels of the ω‐3 fatty acids, DHA, and EPA. A positive influence was also observed on LT levels, with a significant increase in LTB5 levels as well as on the LTB5:LTB4 ratio. PTT also increased significantly.

### Ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^117HYwzV]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This systematic review and meta‐analysis investigated ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched parenteral nutrition (PN) vs standard (non‐ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched) PN in adult hospitalized patients (PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018110179). We included 49 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with intervention and control groups given ω‐3 fatty acids and standard lipid emulsions, respectively, as part of PN covering ≥ 70% energy provision. The relative risk (RR) of infection (primary outcome; 24 RCTs) was 40% lower with ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN than standard PN (RR 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49‐0.72; P < 0.00001). Patients given ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN had reduced mean length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (10 RCTs; 1.95 days, 95% CI 0.42‐3.49; P = 0.01) and reduced length of hospital stay (26 RCTs; 2.14 days, 95% CI 1.36‐2.93; P < 0.00001). Risk of sepsis (9 RCTs) was reduced by 56% in those given ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28‐0.70; P = 0.0004). Mortality rate (co‐primary outcome; 20 RCTs) showed a nonsignificant 16% reduction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65‐1.07; P = 0.15) for the ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched group. In summary, ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN is beneficial, reducing risk of infection and sepsis by 40% and 56%, respectively, and length of both ICU and hospital stay by about 2 days. Provision of ω‐3‐enriched lipid emulsions should be preferred over standard lipid emulsions in patients with an indication for PN.

### The effect of a 12-week course of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on lipid parameters in hypertriglyceridemic adult HIV-infected patients undergoing HAART: a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial [^113CAFz6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertriglyceridemia is common in patients with HIV treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

Objective

The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 460 mg/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 380 mg on hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-treated patients.

Methods

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter pilot study was undertaken in 48 evaluable HIV-infected patients undergoing HAART, with fasting triglyceride levels of 3.39 to 11.3 mmol/L. Patients were allowed fibrate or niacin but not statins and were randomized to PUFA 4 g daily versus placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was mean fasting triglyceride levels.

Results

The study included 48 patients; 23 in the PUFA group (mean age, 46.1 years) and 25 in the placebo group (mean age, 43.6 years). All except one were male. All patients in the PUFA group were white; in the placebo group, 20 were white, 4 Asian, and 1 black. The PUFA group had a mean body mass index of 24.7 kg/m(2); the placebo group, 24.1 kg/m(2). All patients were receiving concomitant fibrate therapy. Median baseline triglyceride levels were 5.58 (1.76–10.6) mmol/L for the PUFA group and 4.29 (1.81–6.14) mmol/L for the placebo group. PUFA reduced triglycerides by a median of 1.75 mmol/L versus a 0.41 mmol/L increase for the placebo group (baseline-corrected percentage change relative to placebo [95% CI, -69.48% to -6.53%; P = 0.019). No effect was seen on biochemical or virologic safety parameters. No severe treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred. Mild and moderate TEAEs occurred in 20 PUFA-treated patients versus 19 patients receiving placebo. Five were adjudged treatment related, and one was due to cholelithiasis, which led to early discontinuation. Most TEAEs affected the gastrointestinal tract (DHA/EPA, n = 7; placebo, n = 4) and comprised diarrhea, nausea, and flatulence (DHA/EPA vs placebo: 3, 2, and 2 vs 2, 0, and 0, respectively).

Conclusions

PUFA therapy with DHA/EPA reduced triglyceride levels significantly compared with placebo in HIV-infected patients with HAART-associated hypertriglyceridemia.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for cystic fibrosis [^116enJ3s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies suggest that a diet rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids may have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects for chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of a previously published review.

Objectives

To determine whether there is evidence that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality and to identify any adverse events associated with supplementation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of last search: 01 April 2020. We also searched online study registries and contacted authors. Date of last search: 12 February 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis comparing omega-3 fatty acid supplements with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

The searches identified 23 studies; five studies with 106 participants (children and adults) were included; duration of studies and interventions differed. Two studies compared omega-3 fatty acids to olive oil for six weeks; one study compared omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids to control capsules (customised fatty acid blends) for three months; one study compared a liquid dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids to one without for six months; and one study compared omega-3 fatty acids to a placebo for 12 months. Three studies had a low risk of bias for randomisation, but the risk was unclear in the remaining two studies; all studies had an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. Three of the studies adequately blinded participants; the risk of bias for selective reporting was high in one study and unclear for four studies. Two studies reported the number of respiratory exacerbations. At three months, one study (43 participants) reported no change in antibiotic usage. At 12 months the second study (15 participants) reported a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations and cumulative antibiotic days in the supplement group compared to the previous year (no data for the control group); very low-quality evidence means we are unsure whether supplementation has any effect on this outcome. With regards to adverse events, one six-week study (12 participants) reported no difference in diarrhoea between omega-3 or placebo capsules; the very low-quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on this outcome. Additionally, one study reported an increase in steatorrhoea requiring participants to increase their daily dose of pancreatic enzymes, but three studies had already increased pancreatic enzyme dose at study begin so as to reduce the incidence of steatorrhoea. One study (43 participants) reported stomach pains at three months (treatment or control group not specified). One six-week study (19 participants) reported three asthma exacerbations leading to exclusion of participants since corticosteroid treatment could affect affect essential fatty acid metabolism. Four studies reported lung function. One six-week study (19 participants) reported an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (L) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), but the very low-quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on lung function. The remaining studies did not report any difference in lung function at three months (unit of measurement not specified) or at six months and one year (FEV 1% predicted and FVC % predicted). No deaths were reported in any of the five studies. Four studies reported clinical variables. One study reported an increase in Schwachman score and weight alongside a reduction in sputum volume with supplementation compared to placebo at three months (data not analysable). However, three studies reported no differences in either weight at six weeks, in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation (SD) score at six months (very low-quality evidence) or BMI Z score at 12 months. Three studies reported biochemical markers of fatty acid status. One study showed an increase from baseline in both EPA and DHA content of serum phospholipids in the omega-3 group compared to placebo at three months and also a significant decrease in n-6/n-3 ratio in the supplement group compared to placebo; since the quality of the evidence is very low we are not certain that these changes are due to supplementation. One six-month cross-over study showed a higher EPA content of the neutrophil membrane in the supplement group compared to the placebo group, but, no difference in DHA membrane concentration. Furthermore, the leukotriene B 4 to leukotriene B 5 ratio was lower at six months in the omega-3 group compared to placebo. A one-year study reported a greater increase in the essential fatty acid profile and a decrease in AA levels in the treatment arm compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that regular omega-3 supplements may provide some limited benefits for people with cystic fibrosis with relatively few adverse effects: however, the quality of the evidence across all outcomes was very low. The current evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. A large, long-term, multicentre, randomised controlled study is needed to determine any significant therapeutic effect and to assess the influence of disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment. Future researchers should note the need for additional pancreatic enzymes when providing omega-3 supplementation or olive oil placebo capsules. More research is required to determine the exact dose of pancreatic enzyme required.

### Ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^113XNPha]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition (PN) vs standard (non-ω-3 fatty-acid enriched) PN in adult hospitalized patients (PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018110179). We included 49 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with intervention and control groups given ω-3 fatty acids and standard lipid emulsions, respectively, as part of PN covering ≥ 70% energy provision. The relative risk (RR) of infection (primary outcome; 24 RCTs) was 40% lower with ω-3 fatty-acid enriched PN than standard PN (RR 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49–0.72; P < 0.00001). Patients given ω-3 fatty-acid enriched PN had reduced mean length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (10 RCTs; 1.95 days, 95% CI 0.42–3.49; P = 0.01) and reduced length of hospital stay (26 RCTs; 2.14 days, 95% CI 1.36–2.93; P < 0.00001). Risk of sepsis (9 RCTs) was reduced by 56% in those given ω-3 fatty-acid enriched PN (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28–0.70; P = 0.0004). Mortality rate (co-primary outcome; 20 RCTs) showed a nonsignificant 16% reduction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65–1.07; P = 0.15) for the ω-3 fatty-acid enriched group. In summary, ω-3 fatty-acid enriched PN is beneficial, reducing risk of infection and sepsis by 40% and 56%, respectively, and length of both ICU and hospital stay by about 2 days. Provision of ω-3-enriched lipid emulsions should be preferred over standard lipid emulsions in patients with an indication for PN.

### Statins and prevention of infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of data from large randomised placebo controlled trials [^116TNMnN]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Results

The first database query yielded 607 publications (fig 1). Another 25 studies were identified by hand searching. After removal of duplicates, the remaining 587 articles were screened on the basis of the title and abstract. Only 135 trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These trials were further evaluated for reporting on the incidence of adverse events and mortality. Of the 39 trials reporting adverse events and causes of death, 10 publications had information on infections. Additionally, 13 trials were certified as potentially relevant and the authors were contacted for primary and supplementary information (see web extra). Of these 13 trials, only one study group provided additional information. In total, the final selection comprised 11 trials. Analyses were carried out on these 11 trials.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms in HIV-positive individuals: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^112maDrw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The antidepressant effect of omega-3 fatty acids has been described in the non-HIV population. The effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the mood status of HIV-positive patients has not been evaluated yet.

Objective

In this study, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms was evaluated in HIV-positive individuals.

Method

A total of 100 HIV-positive patients with Beck Depression Score ≥ 16, were assigned to receive either omega-3 fatty acids or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. Depressive symptoms of each participant were evaluated at baseline (month 0) and at the end of months 1 and 2 of the study. Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition, depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire were used for assessment of depressive symptoms.

Results

Reduction in mean ± SD of all depression scores during the study period was statistically significant within the omega-3 group and when compared with the placebo group (for both comparisons, P < 0.001). Also, the mean differences of all depression scores were decreased significantly during the intervals: months 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Among the participants, 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) patients in the omega-3 and the placebo group, respectively, experienced mild gastrointestinal problems, but the incidence of adverse drug reactions related to the interventions was not statistically different between the groups (P = 0.09).

Conclusion

Omega-3 fatty acids improved depressive symptoms in HIV-positive individuals without any significant adverse reaction.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: biologic aspects

Excessive and uncontrolled inflammation is a hallmark of critical illness, and the ability of the host response to resolve inflammation and return to homeostasis has implications on clinical outcomes. Resolution of inflammation is now understood to be a highly coordinated and biosynthetically active programmed response in which specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) take on important coordinating tasks. Arachidonic acid and long-chain omega-3 PUFAs (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) are precursors for SPMs. SPM 'families' include lipoxins (from arachidonic acid) and resolvins, protectins, and maresins (from long-chain omega-3 PUFAs). Each SPM family has distinct roles in inflammation resolution — actively disrupting inflammatory pathways and shifting the immune response towards resolution and homeostasis (Fig. 1). Contrary to many common anti-inflammatory drugs, immune modulation and tissue repair involving SPMs occurs without compromising host defences.

Fig. 1
The acute inflammatory response to critical illness and its resolution or progression to chronic inflammation. Pro-resolution lipid mediators (i.e. resolvins, protectins, and maresins) typically derive from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (i.e. prostaglandins or leukotrienes) typically derive from omega-6 PUFAs. In critical illness, prolonged inflammation triggers effects on different organs that can result in organ damage. However, the timely resolution of inflammation is associated with more favorable clinical outcomes

In addition to their inflammation-resolving effects, omega-3 PUFAs potentially counteract loss of muscle mass. Preclinical investigations suggest that increased incorporation of EPA and DHA into membrane phospholipids leads to enhanced muscle protein synthesis and/or decreases the expression of factors regulating muscle protein breakdown. The extent of these effects, however, may further depend on factors such as protein intake and age. Current clinical evidence is predominantly from oral supplementation in ageing populations and/or chronic diseases, rather than critically ill patients.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113ThATf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis reported that omega-3 fatty acids nutrition may reduce mortality in septic patients. As new randomized controlled trials began to accumulate, we conducted an update.

Methods

A PubMed database was searched through Feb 2016, and randomized controlled trials comparing omega-3 fatty acids with control were selected by two reviewers independently.

Results

Eleven trials randomly assigning 808 patients were included in the present study. Using a fixed effects model, we found no significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids on overall mortality (risk ratio 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67 to 1.05, P = 0.12), or infectious complications (risk ratio 0.95; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.25, P = 0.70). However, the duration of mechanical ventilation was markedly reduced by omega-3 fatty acids (weighted mean differences (WMD) = −3.82; 95% CI: −4.61 to −3.04; P < 0.00001). A significant heterogeneity was found when the duration of hospital (I 2 = 93%; WMD = −2.82; 95% CI: −9.88 to 4.23, P = 0.43), or intensive care stay (I 2 = 87%; WMD = −2.70; 95% CI: −6.40 to 1.00, P = 0.15) were investigated.

Conclusions

Omega-3 fatty acids confer no mortality benefit but are associated with a reduction in mechanical ventilation duration in septic patients. However, low sample size and heterogeneity of the cohorts included in this analysis limits the generalizability of our findings.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk: a systematic review [^113jQ7ug]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Omega-3 fatty acids are purported to reduce the risk of cancer. Studies have reported mixed results.

Objective

To synthesize published and unpublished evidence to determine estimates of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk in prospective cohort studies.

Data Sources

Articles published from 1966 to October 2005 identified through MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CAB Health; unpublished literature sought through letters to experts in the neutraceutical industry.

Study Selection

A total of 38 articles with a description of effects of consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on tumor incidence, prospective cohort study design, human study population; and description of effect of omega-3 among groups with different levels of exposure in the cohort were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed articles using structured abstraction forms; disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted detailed data about the incidence of cancer, the type of cancer, the number and characteristics of the patients, details on the exposure to omega-3 fatty acids, and the elapsed time between the intervention and outcome measurements. Data about the methodological quality of the study were also abstracted.

Data Synthesis

Across 20 cohorts from 7 countries for 11 different types of cancer and using up to 6 different ways to categorize omega-3 fatty acid consumption, 65 estimates of the association between omega-3 fatty acid consumption were reported. Among these, only 8 were statistically significant. The high degree of heterogeneity across these studies precluded pooling of data. For breast cancer 1 significant estimate was for increased risk (incidence risk ratio [IRR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–1.98) and 3 were for decreased risk (RR, 0.68–0.72); 7 other estimates did not show a significant association. For colorectal cancer, there was 1 estimate of decreased risk (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27–0.89) and 17 estimates without association. For lung cancer one of the significant associations was for increased cancer risk (IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2–7.3), the other was for decreased risk (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13–0.76), and 4 other estimates were not significant. For prostate cancer, there was 1 estimate of decreased risk (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22–0.83) and 1 of increased risk (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.34–2.93) for advanced prostate cancer; 15 other estimates did not show a significant association. The study that assessed skin cancer found an increased risk (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.27). No significant associations between omega-3 fatty acid consumption and cancer incidence were found for aerodigestive cancer, bladder cancer, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, or stomach cancer.

Conclusions

A large body of literature spanning numerous cohorts from many countries and with different demographic characteristics does not provide evidence to suggest a significant association between omega-3 fatty acids and cancer incidence. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids is unlikely to prevent cancer.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115uNzjw]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Secondary organ dysfunction is a key factor that triggered death in septic patients. It has been found that omega-3 fatty acids nutrition may prevent new organ dysfunction in three randomized controlled trials with 278 cases of sepsis (two trials investigated mild or early sepsis, one study with severe sepsis or septic shock). Thus, it seems that the omega-3 fatty acids may play a benefit on sepsis through inhibit new organ dysfunction. SOFA scores, an indicator of secondary organ dysfunction, were reported in three trials. As it was unable to obtain explicit data on SOFA scores that could be combined in the meta-analysis, we did not analyze the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on SOFA scores. It seems that omega-3 fatty acids may have potential benefit on new organ dysfunction; we suggested that a further study focus on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sepsis should investigate secondary organ dysfunction. Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving strategy for critical ill patients. However, its adverse effects such as ventilation-induced lung injury, and ventilator associated pneumonia are life threatening. Our meta-analysis included 5 trials (Fig. 5) suggested that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in septic patient. This result is not consistent with a previous meta-analysis which included two studies. Nevertheless, heterogeneity was found across the trials. Thus, the result should be interpreted with caution.

### N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, inflammation, and inflammatory diseases [^115MnSyz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Inflammation is part of the normal host response to infection and injury. However, excessive or inappropriate inflammation contributes to a range of acute and chronic human diseases and is characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and other oxidized derivatives), other inflammatory agents (e.g., reactive oxygen species), and adhesion molecules. At sufficiently high intakes, long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as found in oily fish and fish oils, decrease the production of inflammatory eicosanoids, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species and the expression of adhesion molecules. Long-chain n-3 PUFAs act both directly (e.g., by replacing arachidonic acid as an eicosanoid substrate and inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism) and indirectly (e.g., by altering the expression of inflammatory genes through effects on transcription factor activation). Long-chain n-3 PUFAs also give rise to a family of antiinflammatory mediators termed resolvins. Thus, n-3 PUFAs are potentially potent antiinflammatory agents. As such, they may be of therapeutic use in a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory settings. Evidence of their clinical efficacy is reasonably strong in some settings (e.g., in rheumatoid arthritis) but is weak in others (e.g., in inflammatory bowel diseases and asthma). More, better designed, and larger trials are required to assess the therapeutic potential of long-chain n-3 PUFAs in inflammatory diseases. The precursor n-3 PUFA alpha-linolenic acid does not appear to exert antiinflammatory effects at achievable intakes.

### Immunonutrition [^111kbNL3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To outline recent findings on the efficacy of immunonutrients in patients undergoing inflammatory stress due to surgery, infection and cancer.

Recent Findings

Enteral nutrition is more efficacious and poses lower risks than parenteral nutrition. It reduces infection rates and shortens ICU and hospital length of stay of critically ill patients. Beneficial effects of immunonutrition are most apparent in malnourished patients. Perioperative enteral nutrition is more effective than postoperative nutrition. In Crohn disease similar remission rates are achieved with enteral nutrition as with steroids. Glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants exert beneficial influences in diverse patient populations. L-arginine is an important immunonutrient having both beneficial and adverse effects. The former effect occurs in necrotizing enterocolitis; the latter influence is seen in septic patients. The gut plays a major role in whole body amino acid metabolism, particularly arginine homeostasis. Arginase and nitric oxide synthetase compete for arginine within immune cells and play a pivotal role in clinical outcome during infection. In cancer a range of antioxidants are able to ameliorate immunosuppression. Intravenous lipids may be deleterious due to the pro-inflammatory effects of omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and combined with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and olive oil may provide a more efficacious form of intravenous lipid.

Summary

Immunonutrition is effective in improving outcome in a wide range of patients when applied enterally, particularly in malnourished individuals. Parenteral immunonutrition carries a higher risk but can be efficacious in selected patient groups for whom enteral nutrition is problematic.

### Omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to prevent preterm birth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Mfh86]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 in reducing the incidence of preterm birth.

Data Sources

Searches were performed in MEDLINE, OVID, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with the use of a combination of keywords related to "fish oil", "pregnancy", and "omega-3".

Methods Of Study Selection

We included all randomized controlled trials of asymptomatic women with singleton gestations who were randomized to prophylactic treatment with either omega-3 supplementation or control (either placebo or no treatment). Exclusion criteria included trials in women with multiple gestations, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia at randomization, prior preterm birth, and trials with polyunsaturated fatty acids as control.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Nine randomized trials including 3,854 eligible women were identified. Women who received omega-3 had a similar rate of preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation compared with women in the control group (7.7% compared with 9.1%, respectively; relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–1.11). There were no significant differences in birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit admission, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, or perinatal death in the omega-3 compared with control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the subgroup analyses, except for the rate of perinatal death, which was lower (0.3% compared with 1.2%; relative risk 0.27, 95% CI 0.09–0.80) in the women who received omega-3 before 21 weeks of gestation and in trials with low risk of bias (0.3% compared with 1.0%; relative risk 0.28, 95% CI 0.09–0.89) compared with women in the control group. However, in no randomized controlled trial was perinatal death the primary outcome.

Conclusion

Omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the incidence of preterm birth or improve neonatal outcome.

### Cost-effectiveness of parenteral nutrition containing ω-3 fatty acids in hospitalized adult patients from 5 European countries and the US [^111auvfj]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical relevancy statement

A recent meta‐analysis showed that ω‐3 fatty acid (FA)–containing parenteral nutrition (PN) is associated with statistically and clinically significant reductions in the rates of infection and sepsis as well as in the duration of hospitalization and length of stay in the intensive care unit. This cost‐effectiveness analysis for 6 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, and US) demonstrates that these outcomes translate into significant decreases in mean hospital costs with ω‐3 FA–containing PN in comparison with PN not containing ω‐3 FAs.

### Pharmaconutrition review: physiological mechanisms [^11333C5i]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as "pharmaconutrition", with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ω-3 fatty acids, and selenium.

### Preemptive enteral nutrition enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid and antioxidants in severe multiple trauma: a prospective, randomized, double-blind study [^117TwUtz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Severe injury triggers a complex systemic immune response which may result in significant respiratory compromise, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). No randomized clinical trial has assessed the role of nutritional interventions to limit respiratory complications.

Methods

This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, comparative, double-blind, controlled study of patients with severe trauma requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a control formula (n = 58) or a formula enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and antioxidants (n = 62) at time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Primary outcome measures included the level of oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PF ratio) on days 4 and 8, incidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and/or ARDS and length of ventilation. The development of infectious complications and fatty acid red blood cell membrane composition were also assessed.

Results

In this intention-to-treat population, no significant differences between the control and study groups were found for the PF ratio at day 4 (213.7 ± 85.6 vs. 227.2 ± 67.7, respectively; P = 0.24) and day 8 (187.8 ± 65.2 vs. 188.9 ± 56.0, respectively; P = 0.82), the incidence of ARDS/ALI (24.1 vs. 29.0%, respectively; P = 0.68), length of ventilation time (13.6 ± 10.7 vs. 17.0 ± 15.1 days, respectively; P = 0.15), duration of ICU stay (16.4 ± 11.3 vs. 19.5 ± 15.3 days, respectively; P = 0.21) and 28-day mortality (8.6 vs. 12.9%, respectively P = 0.56). While the study group showed a significant increase in EPA and GLA concentrations at day 4 (P = 0.05) and day 8 (P < 0.001), the Omega-3 Index (O-3I) failed to reach those suggested as being optimal to obtain clinical efficacy. The significantly higher incidence of bacteremia noted in the study group (P = 0.03) was associated with a higher number of patients with multiple trauma and a higher red blood cell transfusion requirement (P = 0.008).

Conclusion

This study failed to show a significant benefit for the preemptive use of the study formula in patients with severe trauma. Additional studies need to be performed in which the amount of supplementation is targeted to a potentially measurable endpoint, e.g. the O-3I.

### Marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids: fishing for clues for cancer prevention… [^114Z3otZ]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

Omega-3 FAs are polyunsaturated, long-chain, essential FAs, which play major roles in membrane fluidity, cell signaling, inflammation, and protection from oxidative stress. They offset the pro-inflammatory activities of eicosainoid and other metabolites of the omega-6 FA derivative arachidonic acid. 1The most biologically potent omega-3 FA are EPA and DHA, which may be incorporated directly into cell membranes and are found in cold-water oily fish, such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel. EPA and DHA are then metabolized to resolvins and protectins, which limit or reduce inflammation. Omega-3 FA intake from fish or supplements has been studied as a means to reduce risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and dementia; reduce obesity-related insulin resistance and fatty liver disease; and attenuate the activity of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease — all conditions with an inflammatory component.

Biologic effects of omega-3 FA include decreased production of prostaglandin E2 metabolites, thromboxane A2, leukotriene B4, and decreased release of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin B1 and platelet-derived growth factor. 3By reducing prostaglandin synthesis, EPA and DHA may reduce aromatase activity, local estrogen synthesis, and estrogen-related signaling. 13EPA and DHA have peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist activity and promote differentiation and apoptosis through enhanced lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, and increased p53 expression. 3They increase adiponectin secretion and PTEN expression and reduce proliferation and signaling through the ERK as well as PI3 kinase pathways.

14–16Insulin resistance in obese animal models is reduced through attenuation of nuclear factor kappa beta signaling and upregulation of insulin sensitivity–related genes GLUT 4 and IRS-1. 17Given the myriad of biologic pathway modulation observed in predominately preclinical studies, one would expect to see prevention of tumors where inflammation plays a role in promotion or progression. Early Clinical Studies with Biomarkers as the Primary Endpoint A randomized trial of omega-3 FA in individuals with hyperlipidemia showed reduction in the inflammatory marker high sensitivity c reactive protein, which has also been associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.

### Prevention of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections with cod liver oil supplementation, a low dose vitamin D supplement: quadruple blinded, randomised placebo controlled trial [^113StkQu]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Few studies have examined omega 3 fatty acids and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, and other acute respiratory infections. The NutriNet-Santé cohort found no association between dietary intake of omega 3 fatty acids and susceptibility to covid-19. Conversely, others have seen an association between omega 3 supplementation and reduced risk of covid-19and upper respiratory tract infections. Also, an inverse association between the omega 3 index in blood and death from covid-19 has been reported. The effect of vitamins A and E, also present in cod liver oil, on SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, and other acute respiratory infections is not known. Vitamin D has been suggested to reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in those with mild to moderate asthma, whereas a Norwegian study found an increase in the incidence of adult onset asthma with the use of cod liver oil. Vitamin A levels in the cod liver oil used in that study were more than three times the daily amount provided by the cod liver oil in our study, however. We believe it is unlikely that vitamin A or E would have masked any effect of vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acids on covid-19 disease or other acute respiratory infections.

Only low grade side effects were reported in our trial. More side effects were reported by participants in the placebo group than in the cod liver oil group, including low levels of vitamin D.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^117RmSza]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

EPA and DHA Give Rise to Bioactive Lipids That Modulate Inflammation

Atherosclerosis involves inflammatory mechanisms of both the adaptive and innate immune responses. The n3-FAs give rise to signaling molecules that can reduce inflammation in different tissues and vascular beds. EPA and DHA form the cardioprotective and antithrombotic metabolites thromboxane A3/prostacyclin. In contrast, n6-FAs form thromboxane A2, a platelet activator that contributes to atherothrombosis. The n3-FAs compete with the n6-FA for the COX (cyclooxygenase) enzymes that synthesize the thromboxanes and thus limit the production of these potent proaggregatory and vasoconstrictor mediators. Despite this link between n6-FAs and proinflammatory signaling molecules, a recent pooled analysis of 30 cohort studies showed higher circulating and tissue levels of linoleic acid associate with lower risk of major cardiovascular events. Compared with other FAs, such as saturated FAs, linoleic acid has favorable effects on lipid metabolism. Another meta-analysis showed the lower cardiovascular risk was observed with n3-FAs and arachidonic acid but not other n6-FAs.

Of the various eicosanoids produced by COXes, prostacyclin has particular interest with respect to vascular protection. Produced by healthy ECs, prostacyclin functions through a paracrine signaling pathway mediated by G protein-coupled receptors on nearby platelets and ECs. Receptor binding leads to inhibition of abnormal platelet activation while counteracting the prothrombotic effects of thromboxane. Prostacyclin also promotes smooth muscle relaxation and endothelial-dependent vasodilation.

Additional bioactive lipids that derive from n3-FAs originate from macrophages and neutrophils include the leukotrienes and resolvins. The metabolism of n3-FAs produces resolvins, maresins, and protectins. These metabolites, known as specialized proresolving lipid mediators, promote the resolution of inflammation as part of a highly coordinated process that helps to reestablish homeostasis after tissue injury or infection. Following acute inflammation, these steps include a reduction in the production of cytokines and extracellular-reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with inhibition of granulocyte trafficking. These bioactive lipids also modulate the inflammatory response by influencing macrophage-mediated clearance of cellular debris.

### Modest effects of dietary supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from 445 850 users of the COVID-19 symptom study app [^115DvgTa]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2021). High credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3 fatty acids can influence antigen-presenting cell, T-cell and B-cell function, although their effects on these cell types in humans is not consistently reported. However, they are clearly demonstrated to be anti-inflammatoryand to be converted to specialised proresolving mediators such as resolvins, protectins and maresins. Whether this is a mechanism by which they reduce risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 is not clear. Nevertheless, here we provide evidence to support a protective effect in omega-3 fatty acid supplements users with a 12% reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the overall UK cohort, 21% in the US cohort and 16% in the SE cohort. Although, in the UK, stratified analysis shows this effect is largely driven by females, and only significant in one male stratum.

Probiotics

Probiotics modify the host's gut microbiota and may generate antiviral metabolites, and they interact with the host's gut-associated immune system. This can result in improved immunity, including enhanced responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine. Mechanistic studies support a gut-lung axis, whereby immune effects of microbiota at the gut level can be transferred to the lung, most likely through movement of immune cells. This could explain why some probiotic organisms reduce riskand severityof respiratory tract infections. Here, we provide evidence to suggest that people taking probiotics supplements are modestly protected with a 14% reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the overall UK cohort, 18% in the US cohort and 37% in the SE cohort. However, effects of probiotics are strain and species specific and we have no information of which probiotics or their quality were being used by participants in this study. Moreover, when we adjusted for other covariates including diet, the effect of probiotics was weaker suggesting that probiotic use may be confounded by a healthy diet.

### Interactions between fatty acids and arginine metabolism: implications for the design of immune-enhancing diets [^112UEsXX]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Trauma increases the enzyme arginase, thus depleting arginine necessary for producing nitric oxide. Arginine and omega-3 fatty acids are components in immune-enhancing diets. These diets decrease infections in surgical patients, perhaps by preventing arginine deficiency. This study examines whether omega-3 fatty acids alter the metabolic fate of arginine. Thus, we hypothesized there could be differential effects of varying prostaglandins on regulation of arginase.

Methods

Prostaglandins PGE1, PGE2, and PGE3 were tested using RAW 264.7 cells cultured in the presence of these prostaglandins for 24 hours. IL-13 (10 ng/mL) was added 24 hours later to induce arginase I. NO production was induced by adding LPS (2 microg/mL) to the cultures after another 24 hours.

Results

Arginase activity (nmol/min/mg) was induced by all prostaglandins but significantly more by PGE1 (466.05 ± 30.25) and PGE2 (248.45 ± 15.05) than PGE3 (139.87 ± 19.88; p < .002) when co-cultured with IL-13. Western blots correlated the increase in arginase I expression. Nitrate levels (microM) were inversely proportional to activity with PGE3 having the highest production (3.89 ± 0.19) and PGE2 and PGE1 with the lowest (2.75 ± 0.49 and 1.54 ± 0.19, respectively). Inhibition of arginase I using nor-hydroxyarginine increased and equalized nitrate levels.

Conclusions

Different prostaglandins significantly alter the metabolism of arginine. Prostaglandins from omega-6 fatty acids increases arginase I expression. By decreasing arginase I expression, prostaglandins from omega-3 fatty acids may increase available arginine. The specific combinations of dietary fatty acids and arginine should be considered when tailoring dietary regimens.

### Immunomodulation by lipid emulsions in pulmonary inflammation: a randomized controlled trial [^113dfmWU]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still linked with a high mortality rate. Despite major advances in intensive care medicine, a successful pharmacologic approach for the management of patients with ARDS is still missing. Pro-inflammatory mediators have been suggested to contribute to primary and secondary organ dysfunction in experimental models of ARDS, and excessive generation of these mediators has been observed in patients.

Monocytes have been suggested to be intimately involved in controlling inflammatory cascades, as they release both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines directing activation and recruitment of leukocyte populations, such as polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). The PMN represent the first line of defense against invading bacteria, yet they are capable of causing serious tissue destruction.

Eicosanoids play an essential role in the modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory events. The n-6 fatty acids, including arachidonic acid, represent the predominant polyunsaturated fatty acid in common Western diets, and current nutritional regimes. Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are the most important members of the n-3 family of fatty acids. Both may serve as alternative lipid precursors for the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Moreover, by incorporation into various membrane (phospho)-lipid pools, n-6 and n-3 fatty acids may affect lipid-signaling events and may be mediated by the potent pro-resolution lipid mediator class of resolvins.

Diets with specific fat composition may influence inflammatory and immunological events. Beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been demonstrated in experimental models of acute lung injury. In patients with lung injury or sepsis, an enteral diet enriched in n-3 fatty acids and anti-oxidants reduced ventilation time, improved the oxygenation index, and reduced the length of stay in the intensive care unit. However, recent studies including a large multi-center trial conducted by the ARDSnet (OMEGA) investigating the effect of an enteral supplementation of n-3 fatty acids in ARDS patients revealed no beneficial effect. The study OMEGA was stopped early for futility, displaying a higher rate of complications in the group receiving n-3 fatty acids. Due to the inconsistency of data on the enteral use of n-3 fatty acids in ARDS there is an ongoing debate in the scientific community with a final recommendation lacking at the moment. Data on the use of n-3-based lipid emulsions in parenteral nutrition in ARDS or even to reduce subsequent injury as currently applied are scarce.

### Omega-3 fatty acid-containing parenteral nutrition in ICU patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis [^1142KjZF]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes

Overall, this meta-analysis showed a positive impact of omega-3 FA-containing PN on clinical outcomes for ICU patients. The relative risk for infection was reduced significantly by 38% with ω-3 FA-containing PN versus standard PN in ICU patients across 8 studies with 795 patients (relative risk [RR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45, 0.86; p = 0.004) (Fig. 1 a). Similarly, critically ill ICU patients had a 35% RR reduction for infection with ω-3 FA-containing PN (5 studies with 659 patients; RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46, 0.94; p = 0.02) (Fig. 1 b). There was a not significant trend towards a decreasing incidence of sepsis with ω-3 FA-containing PN (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.26, 1.19; p = 0.13) in 3 studies with 336 ICU patients (Fig. 2). Sepsis was not evaluated for the subgroup of critically ill patients, as the minimum observation requirement was not met. ω-3 FA-containing PN was associated with a non-significant 10% relative risk reduction in 30-day mortality in all ICU patients and the subgroup of critically ill ICU patients across 12 studies with 925 patients (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.69, 1.16; p = 0.41) and 10 studies with 835 patients (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.69, 1.16; p = 0.41), respectively (Fig. 3 a, b). HLOS was reported in 11 studies with 872 ICU patients and 8 studies with 742 critically ill ICU patients: both patient groups exhibited significant reductions in mean HLOS with ω-3 FA-containing PN of − 3.05 days (95% CI − 5.03, − 1.07; p = 0.003) and − 3.98 days (95% CI − 6.90, − 1.06; p = 0.008), respectively (Fig. 4 a, b). ICU LOS was also significantly reduced with ω-3 FA-containing PN versus standard PN in all ICU patients and critically ill ICU patients: 11 studies (890 patients) reported ICU LOS in the general ICU patient population, with a mean reduction of − 1.89 days (95% CI − 3.33, − 0.45; p = 0.01) (Fig. 5 a) and 9 studies with 826 patients reported a mean ICU LOS reduction of − 2.14 days (95% CI − 3.89, − 0.40; p = 0.02) in critically ill ICU patients (Fig. 5 b). Length of mechanical ventilation was reported in 6 studies (528 patients): Compared with standard PN, ω-3 FA-containing PN was associated with a non-significant reduction of − 0.02 days in length of mechanical ventilation (95% CI − 0.10, 0.05; p = 0.60) (Fig. 6). The relevance of statistically significant outcomes was verified with TSAs: all significant clinical outcomes showed adequate statistical power, meaning the results can be considered conclusive (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Hence, the beneficial effects of a lower infection rate, shorter HLOS as well as ICU LOS are indeed a consequence of the application of an ω-3 FA-containing PN solution.

### The effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on inflammatory factors in HIV-infected patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114wFvtH]. Cytokine (2020). Medium credibility.

High concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and inflammatory markers are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and are associated with non-HIV related comorbidity and mortality. Data on the benefits of omega-3 fatty acid (omega-3 FA) supplementation for improving inflammation status in HIV-infected patients are controversial. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the beneficial effects of omega-3 FAs on controlling inflammation in HIV-infected patients. We conducted a comprehensive search of the major biomedical databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane library, for all potentially relevant studies published without restriction from the beginning of time to June 2020. Overall, nine RCTs were included comprising a total of 427 participants. A random-effects model was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the effect was measured as standardized mean difference (SMD). Supplementation of omega-3 FAs showed a significant reduction of CRP (SMD: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.07, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in levels of TNF-α (SMD: 0.03, 95% CI: -0.79 to 0.85, P = 0.94, I² = 87%) and IL-6 (SMD: -0.13, 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.32, P = 0.57, I² = 73%, Fig. 3). The results indicate that the supplementation of omega-3 FAs in HIV-infected patients significantly decreases serum CRP levels when compared to the control group, however has no significant effect on IL-6 and TNF-α levels.

### Omega-3 supplementation to prevent recurrent preterm birth: a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials [^113CEeY5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth (PTB) in asymptomatic singleton gestations with previous PTB. We searched fish oil, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, pregnancy, and omega-3 in MEDLINE, OVID, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception of each database to December 2014 with no limit for language. In addition the reference lists of all identified articles were examined to identify studies that were not captured by electronic searches. We performed a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials of asymptomatic singleton gestations with previous PTB who were assigned randomly to prophylactic omega-3 supplementation vs control (either placebo or no treatment). The primary outcome was predefined as PTB at < 37 weeks of gestation. The pooled results were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The protocol of this review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42015016371). Two randomized controlled trials that included 1080 women were analyzed. The mean gestational age at randomization was approximately 134 days in both groups (mean difference, 0.01 days; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.14). Women who received omega-3 had similar rates of PTB at < 37 weeks of gestation (34.5% vs 39.8%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59–1.12) and PTB at < 34 weeks of gestation (12.0% vs 15.4%; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.26–1.46) compared with control subjects. The omega-3 groups had a statistically significantly longer latency (mean difference, 2.10 days; 95% CI, 1.98–2.22) and higher birthweight (mean difference, 102.52 g; 95% CI, 20.09–184.95) compared with control subjects; the other secondary outcomes (which included gestational age at delivery, spontaneous PTB at < 37 and 34 weeks of gestation, admission to the intensive care unit, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and perinatal death) were similar. Omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy does not prevent recurrent PTB in asymptomatic singleton gestations with previous PTB. The benefits in longer latency and higher birth weight may deserve further study.

### Prenatal primary prevention of mental illness by micronutrient supplements in pregnancy [^115ygzb5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Genes, infection, malnutrition, and other factors affecting fetal brain development are a major component of risk for a child's emotional development and later mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. Prenatal interventions to ameliorate that risk have yet to be established for clinical use. A systematic review of prenatal nutrients and childhood emotional development and later mental illness was performed. Randomized trials of folic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements assess effects of doses beyond those adequate to remedy deficiencies to promote normal fetal development despite genetic and environmental risks. Folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is an example. Vitamins A and D are currently recommended at maximum levels, but women's incomplete compliance permits observational studies of their effects. Folic acid and phosphatidylcholine supplements have shown evidence for improving childhood emotional development associated with later mental illnesses. Vitamins A and D decreased the risk for schizophrenia and autism in retrospective observations. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during early pregnancy increased the risk for schizophrenia and increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but in later pregnancy it decreased childhood wheezing and premature birth. Studies are complicated by the length of time between birth and the emergence of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, compared with anomalies like facial clefts identified at birth. As part of comprehensive maternal and fetal care, prenatal nutrient interventions should be further considered as uniquely effective first steps in decreasing risk for future psychiatric and other illnesses in newborn children.

### European Respiratory Society research seminar on preventing pediatric asthma [^114eS8e1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.8 Fish Oil

Dietary changes in westernized countries have resulted in an increase in the intake of n −6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and a decrease in the intake of n −3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially the long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n −3 LCPUFA) — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — found in oils from cold‐water fish. There is considerable evidence from observational human studies and animal studies that low levels of n −3 LCPUFA during pregnancy might increase the risk of atopic disorders in the offspring, including asthma, allergy and atopic dermatitis, but the evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of fish oil supplementation has been inconsistent. An RCT of fish oil supplementation during pregnancy in 736 Danish women found that supplementation in the last trimester of pregnancy reduced the risk of asthma in the offspring by 30% by age 5 years. This effect was most pronounced in mothers with low EPA and DHA blood levels before the intervention, and in mothers who carried fatty acid desaturases (FADS) gene risk variants associated with lower levels of EPA and DHA. Evidence of a protective effect was also found for RTIs and gastroenteritis, while there was no effect on allergy or atopic dermatitis. Surprisingly, supplementation with fish oil was associated with an increased body mass index (BMI) during childhood. These results need to be replicated in future large‐scale trials to provide sufficient evidence base for recommendations on fish oil supplementation during pregnancy. Future studies should address the unexpected protective effects against infections, and potential modifying factors, such as maternal EPA and DHA blood levels, genotype, lifestyle, dietary factors, and ethnicity. Also, potential adverse effects should be investigated including metabolic consequences of a potential increase in childhood BMI. If the beneficial effects on early asthma and infections are confirmed, fish oil supplementation during pregnancy could be one of the first preventive measures for these common childhood disorders, with large health benefits in offspring of high‐risk mothers. From a research perspective, this could also provide insight into the still poorly understood mechanisms of infection susceptibility in childhood.

### Lipid mediators in immune dysfunction after severe inflammation [^1111oKCo]. Trends in Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Inflammation unites CI

Systemic inflammation is nearly ubiquitous in CI, uniting the leading causes of intensive care (ICU) admission. Induced by infectious and noninfectious stimuli with approximately equal frequency, the host inflammatory reaction is driven by common mediators and shared signaling pathways. Critically ill patients are now understood to experience a highly coordinated, reproducible response at the transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic level, regardless of the inflammatory source.

Adverse clinical outcomes are associated with a quantitative dysregulation of the inflammatory profile in both magnitude and duration. Predominance and prolongation of anti-inflammatory processes mechanistically contribute to multiple defects in the innate and adaptive immune system, and consequent vulnerability to nosocomial [hospital-acquired infection (HAI)], and CI-induced immune dysfunction (CIIID). In total, ∼30% of CI patients will contract HAI; a rate six times greater than on standard wards. HAI in this setting is associated with a twofold greater inpatient mortality risk and a case mortality in excess of 50%. Causative pathogens are most commonly bacterial; however, fungal infections (particularly Candida spp.) are increasing in incidence. Viral infection, especially reactivation, poses an additional risk, and polymicrobial infection is common.

LMs, including eicosanoids and the more recently discovered 'specialized pro-resolution lipid mediators' (SPMs), are key signaling molecules in the resolution of inflammation, playing a pivotal role in regulating the inflammatory profile and promoting return to homeostasis. Their dysregulation in any of several dimensions may have pathogenic consequences (Box 1), with failure of resolution leading to chronic inflammation and excess tissue damage being best recognized. The potential active contribution of LMs to an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive phenotype has, until recently, received little attention.

Box 1
LMs: background and pathogenic potential

AA (20:6, ω-6), docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, ω-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, ω-3) are polyunsaturated fatty acids that form the substrates for the enzymatic generation of several groups of bioactive LMs. Eicosanoids – the generic term for a group of bioactive lipids containing 20 carbons derived from AA – are divided into several separate mediator families, the major groups being the PGs, LTs and LXs. More recently discovered ω-3-derived SPM families include Rvs, protectins, and maresins. LMs represent vital endogenous biochemical determinants of inflammatory kinetics and the principle mediators of resolution.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111kUK7z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life threatening systemic inflammatory syndrome that is triggered by infection, and it is a major cause of death in critical ill patients such as severe burn. Even with dramatic advances in pharmacology as well as the technology of intensive care and life supporting, the mortality estimates in septic patients is as high as over 25%. It is suggested that when complicated with organ failure or shock, the mortality in septic patients could be further elevated to 33.2%. Thus, strategies that could play a benefit on survival in septic patients are appreciated.

Omega-3 fatty acids are reported to have a protective role in cardiovascular diseases. And it is also recognized that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating features. Recently, a number of studies have focused on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on septic patients. However, inconsistent findings were reported between trials. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2014 found mortality in septic patients could be reduced by parenteral nutrition of omega-3 fatty acids. However, as the low quality of enrolled trials, the authors concluded that the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on the mortality of sepsis was uncertain. Meanwhile, as new randomized controlled trials began to accumulate, we conducted an update and in the present meta-analysis, our goal was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids nutrition on mortality, the duration of hospital, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, infectious complications, and the duration of mechanical ventilation in septic patients.

### Immunonutrition as an adjuvant therapy for burns [^113kfMvj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

With burn injuries involving a large total body surface area (TBSA), the body can enter a state of breakdown, resulting in a condition similar to that seen with severe lack of proper nutrition. In addition, destruction of the effective skin barrier leads to loss of normal body temperature regulation and increased risk of infection and fluid loss. Nutritional support is common in the management of severe burn injury, and the approach of altering immune system activity with specific nutrients is termed immunonutrition. Three potential targets have been identified for immunonutrition: mucosal barrier function, cellular defence and local or systemic inflammation. The nutrients most often used for immunonutrition are glutamine, arginine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids and nucleotides.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a diet with added immunonutrients (glutamine, arginine, BCAAs, n-3 fatty acids (fish oil), combined immunonutrients or precursors to known immunonutrients) versus an isonitrogenous diet (a diet wherein the overall protein content is held constant, but individual constituents may be changed) on clinical outcomes in patients with severe burn injury.

Search Methods

The search was run on 12 August 2012. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), ISI WOS SCI-EXPANDED & CPCI-S and four other databases. We handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, screened reference lists and contacted pharmaceutical companies. We updated this search in October 2014, but the results of this updated search have not yet been incorporated.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of immunonutrients to a standard nutritional regimen versus an isonitrogenated diet or another immunonutrient agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors were responsible for handsearching, reviewing electronic search results and identifying potentially eligible studies. Three review authors retrieved and reviewed independently full reports of these studies for inclusion. They resolved differences by discussion. Two review authors independently extracted and entered data from the included studies. A third review author checked these data. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study and resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation with the third and fourth review authors. Outcome measures of interest were mortality, hospital length of stay, rate of burn wound infection and rate of non-wound infection (bacteraemia, pneumonia and urinary tract infection).

Main Results

We identified 16 trials involving 678 people that met the inclusion criteria. A total of 16 trials contributed data to the analysis. Of note, most studies failed to report on randomisation methods and intention-to-treat principles; therefore study results should be interpreted with caution. Glutamine was the most common immunonutrient and was given in seven of the 16 included studies. Use of glutamine compared with an isonitrogenous control led to a reduction in length of hospital stay (mean stay -5.65 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.09 to -3.22) and reduced mortality (pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78). However, because of the small sample size, it is likely that these results reflect a false-positive effect. No study findings suggest that glutamine has an effect on burn wound infection or on non-wound infection. All other agents investigated showed no evidence of an effect on mortality, length of stay or burn wound infection or non-wound infection rates.

Authors' Conclusions

Although we found evidence of an effect of glutamine on mortality reduction, this finding should be taken with care. The number of study participants analysed in this systematic review was not sufficient to permit conclusions that recommend or refute the use of glutamine. Glutamine may be effective in reducing mortality, but larger studies are needed to determine the overall effects of glutamine and other immunonutrition agents.

### Ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112RnBnM]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ω‐3 Fatty‐acid enriched PN significantly reduces the risk of infections and length of both ICU and hospital stays compared with standard PN. Furthermore, ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN had potentially beneficial effects on liver chemistry, antioxidant status, markers of inflammation, coagulation, and fatty‐acid profile.

The validity and robustness of results from our previous publication that encompassed 23 RCTs 10 have been confirmed and extended by the present study using a much larger and current dataset and the addition of trial sequential analysis. Moreover, this update was needed, as the Cochrane Collaboration recommends that systematic reviews and meta‐analyses are updated at least every 2 years, if possible. 12 When comparing the results of the previous meta‐analysis 10 and this update, there is a great degree of similarity, but an increased number of patients have resulted in greater precision (narrower CIs) (Table S4). The current results also include sepsis, demonstrating a significant (approximately 56%) reduction in sepsis associated with the use of PN including fish oils (P = 0.0004). The only clinical outcome that was not statistically significant was mortality, as shown previously.

To the best of our knowledge, the current systematic review and meta‐analysis is the largest conducted to date on this subject. A number of other meta‐analyses have compared clinical outcomes for PN enriched with ω‐3 fatty acids vs standard PN in surgical patients, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 ICU and/or critically ill patients, 71, 72, 73 ICU and non‐ICU patients, 10, 74 or patients with gastrointestinal cancer. 75 Only 2 of these 11 meta‐analyses failed to find 1 or more significant clinical benefits in favor of ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN, 68, 72 though both were probably underpowered, as each only included 6 RCTs, 1 with a total of 306 patients 68 and the other 390 patients. 72 To our knowledge, no meta‐analyses have found any significant clinical benefits in favor of standard PN.

### The role of lipid emulsions containing omega-3 fatty acids for medical and surgical critical care patients [^115aGfYQ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence for benefits of PN containing omega-3 PUFAs in critically ill patients

Numerous clinical studies have evaluated mixed-oil ILEs (with or without fish oil) in different critically ill patient populations, with meta-analyses providing supplementary information. Results of most systemic reviews/meta-analyses indicate that ILEs containing fish oil have beneficial effects on the inflammatory response and clinical outcomes, with a notable exception. One meta-analysis screened 1054 studies, including 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1733 patients, finding that PN formulations containing less omega-6 PUFAs (any mixed-oil ILE) were associated with a significant decrease in hospital length of stay (LOS), and a trend towards reduction in 28-day mortality, ICU LOS, and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. Among the different mixed-oil ILEs, PN containing fish oil reduced the duration of ICU care and the rate nosocomial infection, and a trend towards shorter hospital LOS was observed. These results aligned with a previous large meta-analysis, including 24 RCTs and1421 patients, that reported fewer infections, fewer cases of sepsis, and shorter durations of both hospital and ICU LOS. A subsequent network-meta-analysis by the same group compared PN with and without fish oil (any mixed-oil ILE without fish oil), confirming these findings. Notz et al. also reported benefits for fish oil on mortality rates compared with placebo when fish oil was used as a stand-alone ILE — though the use of pure fish-oil ILEs for adults is experimental and should not (yet) be applied outside a formal clinical study setting.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112KeRXz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

We are also interested in that whether the difference between parenteral and enteral administration may influence the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on septic patients. In a previous meta-analysis included three trials that reported a protective effect of omega-3 fatty acids on ARDS, the administration strategy was enteral nutrition. Our subgroup meta-analysis suggested that the mortality in septic patients was not influenced by omega-3 fatty acids that administrated through either parenteral or enteral pathway. This result is consistent with a previous meta-analysis that focuses on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on critically ill patients. These results suggested that the administration strategy may not be the key factor that influenced the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sepsis or other critically ill patients.

There are some limitations in our meta-analysis. One potential limitation of the present meta-analysis was the asymmetric funnel plot that suggested publication bias may exist. It is possibly that the present meta-analysis did not include all of the trials, as we restricted the literature language to English, and other database except the PubMed was not adopted. Meanwhile, the small sample size may also have been a limitation, which may have lowered the statistical power. Furthermore, a marked heterogeneity was detected when the length of ICU or hospital stay was analyzed.

In brief, although our meta-analysis suggested that omega-3 fatty acids failed to reduce overall mortality in septic patients, a tendency toward a reduction in mortality should not be neglected (risk ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.05, P = 0.12). Thus, future large scale, multicentre investigation is still required to draw a conclusion.

### Omega-3 fatty acid-containing parenteral nutrition in ICU patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis [^114CA6UT]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acid (FA)-containing parenteral nutrition (PN) is associated with significant improvements in patient outcomes compared with standard PN regimens without ω-3 FA lipid emulsions. Here, we evaluate the impact of ω-3 FA-containing PN versus standard PN on clinical outcomes and costs in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients using a meta-analysis and subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of a hospital operating in five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK) and the US.

Methods

We present a pharmacoeconomic simulation based on a systematic literature review with meta-analysis. Clinical outcomes and costs comparing ω-3 FA-containing PN with standard PN were evaluated in adult ICU patients eligible to receive PN covering at least 70% of their total energy requirements and in the subgroup of critically ill ICU patients (mean ICU stay > 48 h). The meta-analysis with the co-primary outcomes of infection rate and mortality rate was based on randomized controlled trial data retrieved via a systematic literature review; resulting efficacy data were subsequently employed in country-specific cost-effectiveness analyses.

Results

In adult ICU patients, ω-3 FA-containing PN versus standard PN was associated with significant reductions in the relative risk (RR) of infection (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.45, 0.86; p = 0.004), hospital length of stay (HLOS) (-3.05 days; 95% CI -5.03, -1.07; p = 0.003) and ICU length of stay (LOS) (-1.89 days; 95% CI -3.33, -0.45; p = 0.01). In critically ill ICU patients, ω-3 FA-containing PN was associated with similar reductions in infection rates (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46, 0.94; p = 0.02), HLOS (-3.98 days; 95% CI -6.90, -1.06; p = 0.008) and ICU LOS (-2.14 days; 95% CI -3.89, -0.40; p = 0.02). Overall hospital episode costs were reduced in all six countries using ω-3 FA-containing PN compared to standard PN, ranging from €-3156 ± 1404 in Spain to €-9586 ± 4157 in the US.

Conclusion

These analyses demonstrate that ω-3 FA-containing PN is associated with statistically and clinically significant improvement in patient outcomes. Its use is also predicted to yield cost savings compared to standard PN, rendering ω-3 FA-containing PN an attractive cost-saving alternative across different health care systems.

### Prevention of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections with cod liver oil supplementation, a low dose vitamin D supplement: quadruple blinded, randomised placebo controlled trial [^111YyTmc]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D has received much attention during the covid-19 pandemic for its potential role in preventing and treating covid-19. Preclinical studies have reported a role for vitamin D metabolites in the immune responses to respiratory viruses, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25(OH)D 3) have been associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory infections. A recent meta-analysis, examining 46 randomised controlled trials, concluded that vitamin D supplementation (400–1000 IU/day or 10–25 µg/day) decreased the risk of acute respiratory infections compared with placebo.

Serious covid-19 has been associated with increased inflammation with uncontrolled activation of immune cells and excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines. Long chained omega 3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, have been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. Ensuring adequate levels of these fatty acids and vitamin D has been proposed as a cost effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious covid-19.

Cod liver oil is a low dose vitamin D supplement with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. A long tradition exists in Norway of taking cod liver oil during the winter to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, we initiated the Cod Liver Oil for Covid-19 Prevention Study (CLOC), where participants were randomised to receive cod liver oil or placebo (corn oil) during the winter of 2020–21, and we examined whether cod liver oil could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, or other acute respiratory infections.

### Role of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators in pulmonary inflammation diseases: mechanisms and development [^114c3ZBh]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Inflammation response and resolution are complex processes which involve a huge number of immune cells and regulatory factors. The dysregulation of inflammation resolution is the primary pathophysiology of disease development. Therefore, the direct or indirect clearance of pathogens via all types of immune cells limits any overlap between inflammatory phases and prevents chronic inflammation development. SPMs family, their pathways, and receptors could provide a basis for new approaches for treating inflammation-associated diseases, especially in respiratory diseases.

Pneumonia and TB are caused by various microbial factors and produce a complex immune response. Many factors can cause pneumonia. Over the past few decades, coronaviruses have repeatedly posed a public health concern. The coronavirus infection-induced alveolar, lung tissue, and extra-pulmonary damage are major caused by the "inflammatory storms" and immune responses. They also cause higher mortality rates than those elicited by pneumonia due to infection with influenza viruses. Continuing research on coronaviruses has shown that they can elicit an early, rapid immune response. The inflammatory storm might cause lung tissue damage, impair function, and reduce vital capacity. In addition to the pathogenicity of the virus, the body's inflammatory response also has a vital role in cases of coronavirus infection-induced lung injury. Recent studies show that Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically EPA and DHA, could reduce the risk of ARDS and the need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). Moreover, a traditional Chinese medicine research has shown that the inhibition of the arachidonic-acid metabolic pathway potentially inhibits the release of inflammatory factors and alleviates the "cytokine storm" in the early infectious phase. These researches suggest that SPMs might be a novel target for the rapidly inflammation reaction in the future.

### Association of omega-3 status with long-term risk of hospitalization for sepsis [^113ob5Hx]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection. Despite decades of clinical trials, there are no specific treatments; care of the nearly 50 million annual cases worldwide is limited to antimicrobials and supportive measures. A primary prevention strategy may therefore be of value. We hypothesized that higher premorbid omega-3 fatty acid levels would be associated with a reduced incidence of sepsis.

Design

Population-based cohort study.

Setting

Retrospective data from the United Kingdom (U.K. Biobank).

Patients

Two hundred seventy-three thousand three hundred twenty-five participants from the U.K. Biobank.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Our exposure was baseline estimated omega-3 index (eO3I), modeled both categorically in quartiles, and continuously with restricted cubic splines. Our outcome measure was hospital admission with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition code consistent with sepsis. The median (interquartile range) baseline eO3I was 6.0% (4.8–7.3%). Over a mean follow-up period of 13 years, 9241 participants experienced hospitalization with sepsis. In our adjusted model, compared with the lowest eO3I quartile, participants had lower risks of sepsis incidence in the second quartile (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86–0.91; p < 0.001), third quartile (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.78–0.83; p < 0.001), and fourth quartile (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–0.77; p < 0.001). When analyzed as a continuous variable, increasing eO3I was associated with a decreasing risk of sepsis (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this population-based cohort study, baseline eO3I was inversely associated with subsequent sepsis incidence. Given that omega-3 levels can be increased with dietary supplementation, primary prevention should be explored to mitigate the burden of sepsis.

### Omega-3 fatty acids: investigations from cytokine regulation to pancreatic cancer gene suppression… [^113Esx2A]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Omega-3 fatty acids have been clinically and experimentally associated with the amelioration of chronic and acute inflammation; however, the mechanisms for these observations have not been well defined. During the past decade, laboratories of nutrition and inflammation have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory activities of ω-3 fatty acids occur at least in part through the inhibition of macrophage-elaborated tumor necrosis factor production and through inactivation of the nuclear factor–κB signaling pathway subsequently altering proinflammatory cytokine transcription. In healthy humans and animal models of experimental infection, EPA has consistently reduced prostaglandin synthesis in response to inflammatory stimuli; however, a concomitant reduction in proinflammatory cytokine production, especially tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1, has been variably reported.

6–10 Variability in type and content of experimental EPA preparations may account for some of the inconsistent results observed. We demonstrated that 4-hour ω-3 pretreatment significantly reduced TNF production in LPS-stimulated cells, with a 46% reduction in TNF from baseline observed. These data support the contention that anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 FAs occur at least in part through the inhibition of MØ TNF production in response to endotoxin. In various animal models, supplemental EPA decreased the number and size of tumors. 1, 17 Fish oil–fed mice demonstrate reduced tumor growth, metastatic load, blood vascular area, mast cell number, and MØ infiltration in solid mammary tumors. 18 In addition, ω-3 FAs have been shown to slow primary tumor growth and decrease metastasis in animal and human models of mammary tumorogenesis. 18–23.

As a result, the NF-κB signal transduction cascade is inhibited, and this decreased NF-κB activity is translated into a concomitant decrease in TNF messenger RNA and protein expression by 47% and 46%, respectively. Moreover, the ω-6 FA–treated MØs exhibit effects similar to MØs exposed to media alone in all experiments, validating observations that the anti-inflammatory effects on MØs are exclusive to ω-3 FAs and not a result of a general lipid effect. In this model, ω-3 FA treatment shows a strong positive correlation with PARP cleavage. Although there does not seem to be a synergistic effect supported by the PARP cleavage product data, there is a mild proapoptotic effect noted with gemcitabine-only treatment.

### Ω-3 fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid, and antioxidants: immunomodulators or inert dietary supplements? [^116C9RkJ]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, along with γ-linolenic acid and antioxidants, may modulate systemic inflammatory response and improve oxygenation and outcomes in patients with acute lung injury.

Methods

Objective: To determine if dietary supplementation of these substances to patients with acute lung injury would increase ventilator-free days to study day 28. Design: The OMEGA study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial conducted from January 2, 2008, through February 21, 2009. All participants had complete follow-up. Setting: This trial occurred at 44 hospitals in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ARDS Clinical Trials Network. Subjects: Participants were 272 adults within 48 hours of developing acute lung injury requiring mechanical ventilation whose physicians intended to start enteral nutrition. Intervention: Twice-daily enteral supplementation of n-3 fatty acids, γ -linolenic acid, and antioxidants compared with an isocaloric control. Enteral nutrition, directed by a protocol, was delivered separately from the study supplement. Outcomes: Ventilator-free days to study day 28.

Results

The study was stopped early for futility after 143 and 129 patients were enrolled in the n-3 and control groups. Despite an 8-fold increase in plasma eicosapentaenoic acid levels, patients receiving the n-3 supplement had fewer ventilator-free days (14.0 vs 17.2; p = 0.02) (difference, −3.2 [95% CI, −5.8 to −0.7]) and intensive care unit-free days (14.0 vs 16.7; p = 0.04). Patients in the n-3 group also had fewer nonpulmonary organ failure-free days (12.3 vs 15.5; p = 0.02). Sixty-day hospital mortality was 26.6% in the n 3 group vs 16.3% in the control group (P = 0.054), and adjusted 60-day mortality was 25.1% and 17.6% in the n-3 and control groups, respectively (P = 0.11). Use of the n-3 supplement resulted in more days with diarrhea (29% vs 21%; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Twice-daily enteral supplementation of n-3 fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid, and antioxidants did not improve the primary end point of ventilator-free days or other clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury and may be harmful.

### Omega-6 sparing effects of parenteral lipid emulsions-an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [^117Y8a2i]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Overall, our systematic review and meta-analysis covered 26 trials in critically ill patients, of which 16 studies with 1046 patients were newly included in comparison with the previous meta-analysis by Manzanares et al. We hereby provide an update and additional insights not only on FO but also on general omega-6 FA reducing strategies in intensive care. Omega-6 sparing effects included a significant decrease in hospital LOS and trends towards reduction in 28-day mortality, ICU LOS and mechanical ventilation. Among different omega-6 FA reducing PN regimens, FO containing lipid emulsions reduced the length of intensive care and rate of nosocomial infections. Potential signals on mortality rates were observed with stand-alone use of FO, which encourages further research in this area.

In the past decades, clinical and technological advances promoting physiologic and metabolic resuscitation as well as early diagnosis and optimal treatment have significantly decreased hospital mortality in critical illness. In this context, nutritionally derived compounds exhibiting pharmacological effects contribute to an improved clinical outcome. However, due to low quality of evidence, the potential benefits of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects in critically ill patients remain unproven. While a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory response mechanisms is crucial for an adequate immune response, critically ill patients often exhibit immune dysregulation. Imbalance arises from either excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species or a lack of their physiological anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative counterparts. A similar concept applies for omega-6 and omega-3 FAs or rather their metabolites. By reducing prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes via MCT, OO or FO on the one hand and increasing DHA and EPA levels by FO on the other, pharmaconutrition might play a role in regaining inflammatory balance in critically ill patients. This basic concept is tempting, even though clinical evidence is scarce and ambiguous. There are — if at all — only minor effects of sole omega-6 FA reduction on inflammatory parameters and markers of oxidative stress, which is in line with our results, where the impact of SO/MCT and SO/OO on the clinical course was rather small. However, an RCT, in which OO was significantly associated with reduced ICU LOS and MV, had to be excluded, due to an unusual lipid- versus glucose-based treatment regimen. In the case of FO, omega-6 sparing effects are complemented by a simultaneous increase in omega-3 FAs, which may be even more beneficial for inflammatory control.

### Role of arginine and omega-3 fatty acids in wound healing and infection [^113P2JjE]. Advances in Wound Care (2014). Low credibility.

Significance: Only a few decades ago, the primary focus of nutritional supplementation was to prevent deficiencies of essential nutrients. It is now recognized that, at higher than essential levels, selected nutrients can have a pharmacologic effect to prevent or treat disease. Recent Advances: Two of the most important pharmaconutrients, arginine, and the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, have been shown to have profound effects on wound healing and infections. Critical Issues: Both arginine and fish oils have independent benefits, but the combination appears to be much more effective. This combination has been shown to affect outcomes involving wound healing and infections, as reviewed here, and can also affect incidence and outcomes in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, organ transplant rejection, and other inflammatory conditions. These possibilities have not yet progressed to widespread clinical application. Future Directions: The optimal combinations of immunonutrients, timing of administration, and the doses needed for best results need to be determined in preclinical and clinical studies. Also, the mechanisms involved in the administration of pharmaconutrients need to be established.

### Specialized pro-resolving mediators from omega-3 fatty acids improve amyloid-β phagocytosis and regulate inflammation in patients with minor cognitive impairment [^117HdtWC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

In this review we discuss the immunopathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and recent advances in the prevention of minor cognitive impairment (MCI) by nutritional supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids. Defective phagocytosis of amyloid-β (Aβ) and abnormal inflammatory activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are the two key immune pathologies of MCI and AD patients. The phagocytosis of Aβ by PBMCs of MCI and AD patients is universally defective and the inflammatory gene transcription is heterogeneously deregulated in comparison to normal subjects. Recent studies have discovered a cornucopia of beneficial anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) resolvins, protectins, maresins, and their metabolic precursors. Resolvin D1 and other mediators switch macrophages from an inflammatory to a tissue protective/pro-resolving phenotype and increase phagocytosis of Aβ. In a recent study of AD and MCI patients, nutritional supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids individually increased resolvin D1, improved Aβ phagocytosis, and regulated inflammatory genes toward a physiological state, but only in MCI patients. Our studies are beginning to dissect positive factors (adherence to Mediterranean diet with omega-3 and exercise) and negative factors (high fat diet, infections, cancer, and surgeries) in each patient. The in vitro and in vivo effects of omega-3 fatty acids and SPMs suggest that defective phagocytosis and chronic inflammation are related to defective production and/or defective signaling by SPMs in immune cells.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1133JDTB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

The potential mechanism that could possibly explain why omega-3 fatty acids may not be beneficial in septic patients was as follows: Firstly, sepsis is a severe disease with a high mortality. A number of factors such as a history of severe diseases, or divergence of pathogen may influence the clinic outcome. Septic patients often complicated with organ dysfunction or shock which may further elevate mortality. The included trials in our meta-analysis suggested that a number of patients diagnosed as sepsis were complicated organ dysfunction or shock. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, an inflammation disease with mortality over 40%, is a common secondary organ dysfunction in septic patients. A previous meta-analysis focused on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) reported that it has no effect on reduction of 28-day mortality. The failure on the improvement of complications by omega-3 fatty acids seems to have limited impact on septic patients' survival. Secondly, the rational of omega-3 fatty acids nutrition as an adjunctive therapy for sepsis is partly based on its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating features. However, the mild anti-inflammatory effect of omega-3 fatty acids might not lead to improve in outcome. It has been reported that even a delay of antibiotics treatment may cause a significant increased mortality in patients with sepsis.

A previous meta-analysis suggested that a high fat formula used in control group which may contribute to an increased mortality could be the reason that a reduced mortality was observed in study group. It is suggested that the high fat formula may have pro-inflammatory features, and resulting in a worsened clinical outcome. It seems that clinical outcomes could be influenced by the dose and composition of nutrition. As the dose and composition of omega-3 fatty acids nutrition agent were divergent in studies, we are interested in that whether the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sepsis may be affected by the difference of dose and composition. Therefore, we examined trials testing different type of omega-3 fatty acids agent separately. Our subgroup meta-analysis indicated that the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on mortality in septic patients was not influenced by its dose and composition.

### Ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^115pe8Za]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

There is considerable confidence in the effect estimates of the current study as assessed using GRADE and trial sequential analysis. This is necessary for the result to be relevant to clinical practice. 76 The quality of evidence for clinical outcomes and all laboratory parameters (except TNF‐α) were rated as high or moderate. Moreover, there was no evidence of meta‐bias (reporting bias) from funnel plots. Although we have a high level of confidence in the meta‐analysis estimates, especially infection and sepsis reduction estimates, ideally it would be useful to confirm these evaluations by performing further large‐scale RCTs. In particular, large, properly designed trials are required to prove or reject any effect on mortality rates. Finally, we adhered to best practices, such as prospective registration of methods and following the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta‐analyses.

In summary, this meta‐analysis confirms and extends previous results in greater numbers of patients and clinical trials, providing greater precision. It provides clear evidence that omega‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN provides significant clinical and nonclinical benefits over standard non‐ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN in adult hospitalized patients.

### The role of ω-3 fatty acid supplemented parenteral nutrition in critical illness in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SX5D4]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the supplementation of parenteral nutrition with ω-3 fatty acids confers treatment benefits to critically ill adult patients.

Data Source

We performed computerized searches for relevant articles from 1996 to June 2011 on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane register of controlled trials and abstracts of scientific meetings from 2005 to 2011.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials of ω-3 fatty acid supplemented parenteral nutrition in critically ill adult patients admitted to the intensive therapy unit, given in addition to their routine care, compared with parenteral nutrition without ω-3 fatty acid supplementation.

Data Synthesis

Five fully published trials and three trials published in abstract form with 391 participants have been included. Overall trial quality was poor. Mortality data were pooled from eight studies with 391 participants. No differences were found with a risk ratio for death of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.57, 1.20; p = 0.32). Data for infectious complications were available from five studies with 337 participants. No differences were found, with a risk ratio for infection of 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.43, 1.41; p = 0.41). Data for intensive therapy unit and hospital length of stay were available from six and three studies with 305 and 117 participants, respectively. With respect to intensive therapy unit length of stay, no differences were observed with a mean difference of 0.57 days in favor of the ω-3 fatty acid group (95% confidence interval -5.05, 3.90; p = 0.80). A significant reduction in hospital length of stay of 9.49 days (95% confidence interval -16.51, -2.47; p = 0.008) was observed for those receiving ω-3 fatty acid supplemented parenteral nutrition, but results were strongly influenced by one small study.

Conclusions

On the basis of this systematic review, it can be concluded that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation of parenteral nutrition does not improve mortality, infectious complications, and intensive therapy unit length of stay in comparison with standard parenteral nutrition. Although ω-3 fatty acids appear to reduce hospital length of stay, the poor methodology of the included studies and the absence of other outcome improvements mean they cannot be presently recommended.

### Serum levels of proinflammatory lipid mediators and specialized proresolving molecules are increased in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and correlate with markers of the adaptive immune response [^117VRWtj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by fever and cough, with more severe cases developing acute respiratory distress, acute lung injury, pneumonia, and mortality. The higher rates of severe SARS-CoV-2 illness and death are associated with increasing age. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with changes in adaptive and innate immunity, including elevated levels of circulating neutrophils and in severe cases the presence of peripherally derived macrophages in the lungs, reduced numbers of circulating T cells, and robust cytokine responses, which continues after clearance of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with elevated levels of prostaglandins (PGs), although these levels decrease with severe disease, and proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL) 6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor–α. Importantly, levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 are also elevated following infection.

Prostaglandins and leukotrienes have essential roles in initiating acute inflammatory responses and the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, which sustain chronic inflammatory responses. In concert with the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways, the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways produce proinflammatory hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) from arachidonic acid (AA) and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) from linoleic acid (LA). The active curtailing of inflammatory signalling is essential to restore tissue homeostasis and prevent chronic inflammatory events leading to pathology. Following the initial acute inflammatory phase, specialized proresolving molecules (SPMs), derived from key polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are generated and orchestrate the resolution of inflammation by promoting macrophage-mediated clearance of cellular debris and counteracting the effects of proinflammatory cytokines. The SPMs are derived from omega-6 (LA, AA) or omega-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) substrates via the COX, LOX, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways (Supplementary Figure 1). Knowledge of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the pathways that drive the resolution of inflammation will provide crucial new mechanistic insight and potential novel avenues for treatment.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: clinical role for alternative intravenous fat emulsions [^111mrF7A]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Fatty acids classification and inflammatory pathways — introduction/background: Fatty acids (FAs) are categorized by chain length as 2–4 carbons for short-chain FA, 6–12 carbons for medium-chain FA, and ≥ 14 carbons for long-chain FA; saturated FAs have no double bonds, monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) have 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) have 2 or more double bonds. Unsaturated FAs include 3 principal families — ω-3, ω-6, and ω-9 — with the first double bond at the third, sixth, or ninth carbon, respectively; the ω-6 and ω-3 FAs are metabolized through 2 different pathways but use the same enzymes with a preference of ω-3 > ω-6 > ω-9. Clinically, ω-3 FAs are relatively less proinflammatory than ω-6 FAs and some ω-3 FAs may actually have anti-inflammatory effects; more of one FA than another in the diet can drive production toward proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory metabolites, and some evidence suggests certain long-chain FAs may impair immune function via effects on phagocytosis and chemotaxis, increasing infection risk.

### Guidelines for the provision and assessment of nutrition support therapy in the pediatric critically ill patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [^111Zj5AA]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Immunonutrition in critically ill children — evidence and recommendations indicate limited pediatric benefit and current nonrecommendation: Infants requiring parenteral nutrition (PN) were randomized to intravenous lipid emulsions including omega-3 fatty acids or a 100% soybean oil–based lipid, but relevant clinical outcomes were not evaluated; lipids containing omega-3 versus 100% omega-6 fatty acids were associated with lower plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and potential for reduced intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Trials of parenteral glutamine found that clinical outcomes did not differ from standard PN. In a comparative effectiveness trial of mechanically ventilated children receiving enteral nutrition (EN), enrollment ended at 293 with no differences in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, infections, or mortality, although in a small immunocompromised subgroup nosocomial infections were lower with the study intervention compared with whey protein (1.57 vs 6.09; p = 0.011). Across pediatric trials, none demonstrated superiority of immunonutrition versus standard nutrition in terms of clinical outcomes. Adult trials reported no infectious benefits and possibility of harm with a significantly higher 6-month mortality with an immunonutrition-containing formula, and adult guidelines state that immunonutrition not be used in critically ill septic or medical patients but may be considered in perioperative or traumatic injuries; due to potential adult harms and limited pediatric data, immunonutrition cannot be currently recommended in critically ill children, and future trials should examine its role in select populations.

### Fish oil (omegaven) [^113VYZya]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants

In the postmarket setting, serious adverse reactions including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in neonates and infants after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions. Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly reported.

Strictly adhere to the recommended total daily dosage; the hourly infusion rate should not exceed 1.5 mL/kg/hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion.

Carefully monitor the infant's ability to eliminate the infused lipids from the circulation (e.g., measure serum triglycerides and/or plasma free fatty acid levels). If signs of poor clearance of lipids from the circulation occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6) and Overdosage (10)].

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Omegaven contains fish oil and egg phospholipids, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis has been reported following Omegaven administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Omegaven is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fish or egg protein or to any of the active or inactive ingredients in Omegaven [see Contraindications (4)]. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop infusion of Omegaven immediately and initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures.

5.3 Infections

Lipid emulsions, such as Omegaven, can support microbial growth and are an independent risk factor for the development of bloodstream infections. The risk of infection is increased in patients with malnutrition-associated immunosuppression, long-term use and poor maintenance of intravenous catheters, or immunosuppressive effects of other conditions or concomitant drugs.

To decrease the risk of infectious complications, ensure aseptic technique in catheter placement and maintenance, as well as in the preparation and administration of Omegaven.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of early infections including fever and chills, laboratory test results that might indicate infection (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia), and frequently inspect the intravenous catheter insertion site for edema, redness, and discharge.

### Ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^116fvrvK]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility criteria for included studies are shown according to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study designs (PICOS). 12, 13

Participants

Publications included human studies of adult hospitalized patients (later assigned as being within an intensive care unit [ICU] or non‐ICU setting, as defined by the authors using the criteria that ICU studies should have a mean of at least 48 hours in an ICU) who were eligible to receive PN covering at least 70% of their total energy provision. This excluded nontarget populations (ie, pediatric or neonatal patients), or enteral nutrition studies.

Interventions and comparisons

Interventions and comparators included were ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN and standard (non‐ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched) PN, respectively. This excluded "off‐label" interventions (specifically in which fish oil was used as the sole source of parenteral lipids), and studies in which enteral nutrition accounted for > 30% of the daily caloric provision.

Outcomes

Clinical outcomes were infection rate (primary outcome), mortality rate (co‐primary outcome), length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, sepsis rate, hospital readmissions, ICU‐free days until day 30 or day 60, and ventilation‐free days until day 30 (note: sepsis included events defined by publication authors as septic or systemic inflammatory response syndrome; see Table S1). Other outcomes were transfused blood units and oxygenation index, fatty‐acid composition of plasma phospholipids and lipid profile (α‐tocopherol, EPA, DHA, arachidonic acid, plasma triglycerides), markers of inflammation and antioxidant status (interleukin‐6, leukotriene [LT] B5, LTB4, LTB5:LTB4 ratio, C‐reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]‐α), and routine laboratory parameters (lactate; urea; serum creatinine; creatinine clearance; platelets; prothrombin time; partial thromboplastin time [PTT]; international normalized ratio; bleeding time; liver enzymes aspartate [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and γ‐glutamyl transferase [GGT]; and total bilirubin).

Study design

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English in peer‐review journals containing at least 1 predefined outcome were included.

### Eicosanoids: the overlooked storm in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? [^113M2rkf]. The American Journal of Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, including systemic inflammatory response and multisystem organ failure, are now affecting thousands of infected patients and causing widespread mortality. Coronavirus infection causes tissue damage, which triggers the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and subsequent eicosanoid and cytokine storms. Although proinflammatory eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, are critical mediators of physiological processes, such as inflammation, fever, allergy, and pain, their roles in COVID-19 are poorly characterized. Arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids could alleviate the systemic hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19 infection by modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and stimulating the resolution of inflammation. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors, which increase endogenous epoxyeicosatrienoic acid levels, exhibit potent anti-inflammatory activity and inhibit various pathologic processes in preclinical disease models, including pulmonary fibrosis, thrombosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, targeting eicosanoids and sEH could be a novel therapeutic approach in combating COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the predominant role of eicosanoids in regulating the inflammatory cascade and propose the potential application of sEH inhibitors in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms. The host-protective action of omega-3 fatty acid-derived epoxyeicosanoids and specialized proresolving mediators in regulating anti-inflammation and antiviral response is also discussed. Future studies determining the eicosanoid profile in COVID-19 patients or preclinical models are pivotal in providing novel insights into coronavirus-host interaction and inflammation modulation.

### Deregulated balance of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids following infection by the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis [^114pTQG7]. Infection and Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen and an emergent zoonotic pathogen. Excessive inflammation caused by S. suis is responsible for early high mortality in septic shock-like syndrome cases. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may contribute to regulating inflammatory processes. This study shows that mouse infection by S. suis is accompanied by an increase of arachidonic acid, a proinflammatory omega-6 (ω-6) PUFA, and by a decrease of docosahexaenoic acid, an anti-inflammatory ω-3 PUFA. Macrophages infected with S. suis showed activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and cyclooxygenase-2 upregulation. Fenretinide, a synthetic vitamin A analog, reduced in vitro expression of inflammatory mediators. Pretreatment of mice with fenretinide significantly improved their survival by reducing systemic proinflammatory cytokines during the acute phase of an S. suis infection. These findings indicate a beneficial effect of fenretinide in diminishing the expression of inflammation and improving survival during an acute infection by a virulent S. suis strain.

### Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation and sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yyLuf]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have proven to be essential for development in preterm infants and have been studied for their capacity to reduce inflammation and infection rates, including sepsis in enteral and parenteral nutrition. The aim of this review and meta-analysis is to gather the information available on this subject to determine if n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can reduce sepsis incidence in preterm infants.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted by searching in the databases MEDLINE (via PubMed), ISI-Web of Science, EMBASE, SCOPUS, SciELO, and Cochrane Library databases. We analyzed the data regarding sepsis using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Results

A total of 40 trials were included for review and 35 trials had the data available for quantitative analysis. LCPUFAs supplementation did not reduce incidence of sepsis (relative risk (RR), confidence interval (CI) 0.95 [0.87, 1.03] P = 0.87; I² = 0%). These results remained consistent after the sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that LCPUFA supplementation is not associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of sepsis in premature infants.

Impact

Reviewing the information available about LCPUFA supplementation and sepsis since the results in previous Clinical Trials (CT) are inconclusive. It summarizes the results of 42 CT and we have not found conclusive results regarding sepsis in the literature. It could be of clinical interest for pediatricians and nutritionists.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113syd8m]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on infectious complications or the duration of mechanical ventilation

Infectious complications were reported in five studies (Additional file 2: Table S2), we combined these trials in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that omega-3 fatty acids did not affect infectious complications (risk ratio 0.95; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.25, P = 0.70; Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Forest plots show the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on infectious complications in septic patients

The duration of mechanical ventilation was reported in seven studies, but the data from five of them could be combined in the meta-analysis (Additional file 2: Table S2). Our meta-analysis showed that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (WMD = −3.82; 95% CI: −4.61 to −3.04; P < 0.00001; Fig. 5). However, a heterogeneity was found across the trials (I 2 = 40%; Fig. 5). Sensitivity analyses suggested that no benefit on the duration of mechanical ventilation was observed among the remaining studies after excluded one study (I 2 = 0%; Additional file 3: Figure 5S). Thus, this result should be interpreted with caution.

### Ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112nuddS]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lipid emulsions are a key component of parenteral nutrition (PN) and are used as an energy‐dense source of calories, reducing the glycemic load, supplying essential fatty acids, and lowering osmolarity. 1, 2 The first generation of lipid emulsions was based on soybean oil or soybean/safflower oil and characterized by high concentrations of long‐chain triglycerides providing high levels of ω‐6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). 1, 3 However, concerns arose that soybean oil lipid emulsions could promote inflammation and suppress immune function, thought to be related partly to an excess of ω‐6 PUFAs and a low concentration of ω‐3 PUFAs. 3, 4, 5

The idea that ω‐6 PUFAs might be "proinflammatory and immunosuppressive" led to the development of alternative lipid emulsions, including the partial replacement of soybean oil with medium‐chain triglycerides, olive oil, and by the inclusion of fish oil. 3, 4, 5 Fish oil has been shown to have anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, most likely because of fish oil's ω‐3 PUFA content, consisting of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as they influence diverse inflammatory processes – from signal transduction to protein expression. 6 EPA and DHA are now known to be direct precursors of potent specialized proresolution mediators (ie, resolvins, protectins, and maresins) that improve outcomes in many animal disease models. 7 Fish oil may oppose the actions of ω‐6 PUFAs, improve hepatic metabolism and liver function, and exert anticoagulatory and antiarrhythmic effects. 3 Thus, many trials have compared PN with or without fish oil to explore potential benefits for certain clinical conditions, in particular those characterized by an inflammatory over‐response (eg, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and following major abdominal surgery).

### Enteral nutrition with eicosapentaenoic acid, γ-linolenic acid and antioxidants in the early treatment of sepsis: results from a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study: the INTERSEPT study [^114jy3xe]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Enteral nutrition (EN) with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/γ-linolenic acid (GLA) is recommended for mechanically ventilated patients with severe lung injury. EPA/GLA has anti-inflammatory benefits, as evidenced by its association with reduction in pulmonary inflammation, improvement in oxygenation and improved clinical outcomes in patients with severe forms of acute lung injury. This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial designed to investigate whether EPA/GLA could have an effective role in the treatment of patients with early sepsis (systemic inflammatory response syndrome with confirmed or presumed infection and without any organ dysfunction) by reducing the progression of the disease to severe sepsis (sepsis associated with at least one organ failure) or septic shock (sepsis associated with hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation). Secondary outcomes included the development of individual organ failure, increased ICU and hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation and 28-day all-cause mortality.

Methods

Randomization was concealed, and patients were allocated to receive, for seven days, either an EPA/GLA diet or an isocaloric, isonitrogenous control diet not enhanced with lipids. Patients were continuously tube-fed at a minimum of 75% of basal energy expenditure × 1.3. To evaluate the progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock, daily screening for individual organ failure was performed. All clinical outcomes were recorded during a 28-day follow-up period.

Results

A total of 115 patients in the early stages of sepsis requiring EN were included, among whom 106 were considered evaluable. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis demonstrated that patients fed the EPA/GLA diet developed less severe sepsis and/or septic shock than patients fed the control diet (26.3% versus 50%, respectively; P = 0.0259), with similar results observed for the evaluable patients (26.4% versus 50.9% respectively; P = 0.0217). The ITT analysis demonstrated that patients in the study group developed cardiovascular failure (36.2% versus 21%, respectively; P = 0.0381) and respiratory failure (39.6% versus 24.6%, respectively; P = 0.0362) less often than the control group. Similarly, when considering only the evaluable patients, fewer patients developed cardiovascular failure (20.7% versus 37.7%, respectively; P = 0.03) and respiratory failure (26.4% versus 39.6%, respectively; P = 0.04). The percentage of patients fed the EPA/GLA diet requiring invasive mechanical ventilation was reduced compared with controls (ITT patients: 18.9% versus 33.9%, respectively; P = 0.394; evaluable patients: 17.5% versus 34.5%, respectively; P = 0.295). Patients nourished with the EPA/GLA diet remained in the ICU fewer days than the control population (ITT patients: 21.1 ICU-free days versus 14.7 ICU-free days, respectively; P < 0.0001; evaluable patients: 20.8 ICU-free days versus 14.3 ICU-free days, respectively; P < 0.0001) and fewer days at the hospital (ITT patients: 19.5 hospital-free days versus 10.3 hospital-free days, respectively; P < 0.0001; evaluable patients: 19.1 hospital-free days versus 10.2 hospital-free days, respectively; P < 0.001) (all numbers expressed as means). No significant differences in 28-day all-cause mortality were observed (ITT patients: 26.2% EPA/GLA diet versus 27.6% control diet, respectively; P = 0.72; evaluable: 26.4 EPA/GLA diet versus 30.18 control diet, respectively; P = 0.79).

Conclusions

These data suggest that EPA/GLA may play a beneficial role in the treatment of enterally fed patients in the early stages of sepsis without associated organ dysfunction by contributing to slowing the progression of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, especially with regard to cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111mBHMP]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary outcome of our meta-analysis suggested that omega-3 fatty acids nutrition has no benefit on reduction of mortality in septic patient. The secondary outcomes suggested that omega-3 fatty acids nutrition did not increase the infectious complications. Nevertheless, omega-3 fatty acids nutrition failed to show a beneficial effect on the length of hospital stay, or intensive care stay. However, the duration of mechanical ventilation was markedly reduced by omega-3 fatty acids.

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of parenteral omega-3 fatty acids for sepsis found a beneficial effect on mortality (risk ratio 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.99, P = 0.04; 12 trials, 721 patients). Our study is not consistent with this work. The difference of enrolled trials may attribute to the inconsistent result between our study and the previous meta-analysis. In the present meta-analysis, we also investigated that whether the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sepsis was different when it was administrated via parenteral or enteral pathway, and whether the dose and composition of omega-3 fatty acids nutrition could influence its effect.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) — immune-modulating formulas: Based on expert consensus, we suggest the use of either arginine-containing immune-modulating formulations or EPA/DHA supplement with standard enteral formula in patients with TBI. Evidence is limited; only 1 small trial in adults (40 patients) compared immune-modulating formulations (containing arginine, glutamine, prebiotic fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids) with standard enteral formulations in TBI patients and demonstrated decreased infections.

### Effects of n-3 long-chain PUFA supplementation to lactating mothers and their breastfed children on child growth and morbidity: a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial in rural Ethiopia [^115z6ovr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent infections and inflammation contribute to growth faltering in low-income countries. n-3 (ω-3) Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty-acids (LC-PUFAs) may improve immune maturation, resistance to infections, and growth in young children who are at risk.

Objective

We evaluated the independent and combined effects of fish oil (500 mg n-3 LC-PUFAs/d) supplementation to lactating mothers and their breastfed children, aged 6–24 mo, on child morbidity, systemic inflammation, and growth in southwest Ethiopia.

Design

A 4-arm double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted by enrolling 360 mother-infant pairs with infants 6–12 mo old. Study arms were both the lactating mother and child receiving fish oil intervention (MCI), only the lactating mother receiving fish oil intervention and child receiving placebo control (MI), only the child receiving intervention and mother receiving placebo control (CI), and both mother and child receiving a placebo supplement or control (C). The primary study outcome was linear growth using monthly changes in length-for-age z score. Anthropometric measurements were taken monthly, and hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and blood LC-PUFAs were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 mo of follow-up. Weekly morbidity surveillance was conducted throughout the study.

Results

Fish-oil supplementation significantly increased blood n-3 LC-PUFA concentration (P < 0.01) and decreased the arachidonic acid:(docosahexaenoic acid + eicosapentaenoic acid) ratio (P < 0.001) in all intervention arms. No significant intervention effect was found on linear growth, morbidity, or systemic inflammation. Compared to the control group, a small positive effect on monthly changes in weight-for-length z scores was found in the CI arm (effect size: 0.022/mo; 95% CI: 0.005, 0.039/mo; P = 0.012) and the MCI arm (effect size: 0.018/mo; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.034/mo; P = 0.041).

Conclusions

n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation of lactating mothers and children did not affect child linear growth and morbidity in a low-income setting. n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation given directly to children modestly increased relative weight gain. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01817634.

### Ω-3 supplementation in HIV-1-infected individuals with unsuppressed viral load: cause for caution? [^113VAW5T]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Dietary n-3 (ω-3) fatty acids, mainly eicosapentaenoic (C20: 5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (C22: 6n-3, DHA) are useful to decrease hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-1-infected patients. These fatty acids are readily incorporated in cell membranes, changing the properties of the phospholipid bilayer. Whether this triggers HIV-1 replication and infectivity remains unexplored, as data are limited to clinical trials conducted in patients under antiretroviral therapy (ART), thus precluding the evaluation of any potential effect on viral load. To address this issue, we set up an ex-vivo experiment to test HIV-1 infectivity and replication after inducing a range of ω-3 content in CD4 + T cell membranes resembling to those obtained after dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids. Fatty fish and most fish oil capsules contain both EPA and DHA species at different doses, with DHA usually being the most abundant. The issue of whether all ω-3 species are equal regarding their effects remains elusive. To avoid this caveat, we used DHA as supplemental fatty acid because it is the most abundant ω-3 in cell membranes.

### Systematic review of preoperative n-3 fatty acids in major gastrointestinal surgery [^114acdBP]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Major gastrointestinal surgery results in postoperative catabolism. The aim of preoperative nutritional intervention is to optimize nutritional stores before major surgery, to pre-empt and mitigate postoperative catabolism. Immunonutrition may add to this by specific immunomodulatory effects of nutrients, such as: arginine, glutamine, omega-3 (or n-3) fatty acids, and nucleotides. These may attenuate the postoperative inflammatory response. Analyses of therapeutic effects of immunonutrition are hampered by the inability to discern which nutrients (if any) provide benefit. The very long chain n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are readily incorporated into tissues leading to decreased production of proinflammatory mediators, by interference with arachidonic acid metabolism. Fish oil is a rich source of DHA and EPA and early clinical studies suggested that this may attenuate inflammation. In particular, EPA has been shown to modulate the proinflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB), and thereby reduce myocellular inflammation.

The inflammatory cascade is a key mediator in the myogenic response to muscle damage. Inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6) can inhibit muscle regeneration and trigger muscle wasting. The sequelae of acute inflammation are lower muscle strength and subsequent higher dependency for activities of daily living.

A decade ago, two meta-analyses reported on combinations of immunonutrients given preoperatively. These demonstrated reductions in postoperative infection and length of stay but heterogeneity of trial design, and subsequent change in perioperative care (such as Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)), makes broader interpretation challenging. There has been no evaluation of the effect of pre-operative n-3 fatty acids, independent of other components of immunonutrition.

The purpose of this systematic review is to determine the effect of preoperative n-3 fatty acids on the inflammatory response and clinical outcomes after major gastrointestinal surgery, in the modern era.

### Omega-3 fatty acids alleviate chemically induced acute hepatitis By suppression of cytokines [^113b9ZSm]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are key factors in liver inflammation. Supplementation with essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) has been demonstrated to lower TNF-alpha and IL-1 production in mononuclear cells. An inflammation-dampening effect has been observed with increased omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in several inflammatory diseases. In this study, we used the transgenic fat-1 mouse, expressing a Caenorhabditis elegans desaturase endogenously forming n-3 PUFA from n-6 PUFA, to analyze the effect of an increased n-3 PUFA tissue status in the macrophage-dependent acute D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccaride (D-GalN/LPS) hepatitis model. We show less severe inflammatory liver injury in fat-1 mice with a balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio as evidenced by reduced serum alanine aminotransferase levels and less severe histological liver damage. This decreased inflammatory response was associated with decreased plasma TNF-alpha levels and with reduced hepatic gene expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and IL-6 in fat-1 mice, leading to a decreased rate of apoptosis in livers from fat-1 animals, as measured by DAPI-staining.

Conclusion

The results of this study offer evidence for an inflammation dampening effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the context of liver inflammation.

### Evidence for the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on progression of age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review [^111x6Jar]. Retina (2007). Low credibility.

Background

As part of a larger systematic review on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on eye health, the aim of this report was to appraise and synthesize the evidence for the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in slowing down the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and/or decreasing the rate of progression to advanced forms of AMD.

Methods

A comprehensive search was undertaken in six databases (MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CAB Health, and Dissertation Abstracts).

Results

Two unique studies, one randomized clinical trial (RCT) and one prospective cohort study, satisfied the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The RCT reported evidence on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids in slowing down the progression of AMD. The prospective cohort study addressed the question: what is the evidence that omega-3 fatty acids decrease the rate of progression to advanced forms of AMD?

Conclusions

Clinical research on this topic is scarce. Only two studies were eligible to be included in this review. Although one study result indicated efficacy of preventing AMD progression to its advanced form, this result needs to be duplicated and supported by future research.

### Influence of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids enriched lipid emulsions on nosocomial infections and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients: ICU lipids study [^112kMTBL]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (contained in fish oil) have been shown to beneficially influence infection rate and clinical outcomes in surgical patients probably due to their immunomodulatory action. In contrast, study results of fish oil administration in critically ill patients are controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on the prevalence of nosocomial infections and clinical outcomes in medical and surgical critically ill patients.

Design

Prospective, multicenter, randomized, comparative, double-blind study.

Setting

Seventeen Spanish ICUs during 4 years.

Subjects

A total of 159 medical and surgical intensive care patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score more than or equal to 13, expected to require total parenteral nutrition for at least 5 days.

Interventions

Patients received total parenteral nutrition prepared either with a lipid emulsion containing 10% fish oil or a fish oil-free lipid emulsion. The prevalence of nosocomial infections was detected during 28 days of ICU stay. Patients were followed 6 months after discharge from the ICU for length of hospital stay, hospital mortality, and 6-month mortality.

Measurements and Main Results

The number of patients with nosocomial infections was significantly reduced in the fish oil-receiving group (21.0% vs 37.2%, p = 0.035) and the predicted time free of infection was prolonged (21 ± 2 vs 16 ± 2 d, p = 0.03). No significant differences were detected for ICU, hospital, and 6-month mortality.

Conclusions

The results show that administration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduces the risk of nosocomial infections and increases the predicted time free of infections in critically ill medical and surgical patients. The administration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was safe and well tolerated.

### Nutrient supplementation for prevention of viral respiratory tract infections in healthy subjects: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fC9RJ]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

It remains uncertain as to whether nutrient supplementation for the general population considered healthy could be useful in the prevention of RTIs, such as COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the evidence was evaluated for primary prevention of any viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) such as SARS-CoV-2, through supplementation of nutrients with a recognized role in immune function: multiple micronutrients, vitamin A, folic acid, vitamin B12, C, D, E, beta-carotene, zinc, iron and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The search produced 15,163 records of which 93 papers (based on 115 studies) met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 199,055 subjects (191,636 children and 7,419 adults) from 37 countries. Sixty-three studies were included in the meta-analyses, which was performed for children and adults separately. By stratifying the meta-analysis by world regions, only studies performed in Asia showed a significant but heterogeneous protective effect of zinc supplementation on RTIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.7–0.96, I² = 79.1%, p = .000). Vitamin D supplementation in adults significantly decreased the incidence of RTI (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–0.99, p = .272), particularly in North America (RR 0.82 95% CI 0.68–0.97), but not in Europe or Oceania. Supplementation of nutrients in the general population has either no or at most a very limited effect on prevention of RTIs. Zinc supplementation appears protective for children in Asia, whilst vitamin D may protect adults in the USA and Canada. In 10/115 (8.7%) studies post-hoc analyses based on stratification for nutritional status was performed. In only one study zinc supplementation was found to be more effective in children with low zinc serum as compared to children with normal zinc serum levels.

### The protective effect of breastfeeding on infant inflammation: a mediation analysis of the plasma lipidome and metabolome [^116EfgB8]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fatty acids

Many metabolomic fatty acid biomarkers (ratios of SFA, MUFA, and DHA in total fatty acids, PUFA/MUFA ratio, and linoleic acid) showed evidence of mediation in both directions, i.e. these fatty acids mediated the effect of breastfeeding on inflammation, and inflammation mediated the effect of breastfeeding on these fatty acids, although generally to a lesser extent. For example, the proportion mediation of the effect of breastfeeding on inflammation at 6 months by linoleic acid (measured by the NMR metabolomic platform) is 0.43 (Additional file 1: Table S22) compared with 0.19 proportion mediation of the effect of breastfeeding on linoleic acid by inflammation (Additional file 1: Table S26). Total omega 3 fatty acids were positively associated with breastfeeding and inflammation at 6 months, while the ratio of DHA to total fatty acids was positively associated with breastfeeding and negatively associated with inflammation. However, neither omega-3 nor omega-6 fatty acids overall mediated the effect of breastfeeding on inflammation (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7
Summary of the cross-sectional associations at 6 months of total fatty acids, and selected PUFA-carrying lipid classes, with inflammation (GlycA, x-axis) and breastfeeding status (y-axis). Points are coefficients from adjusted Linear regression models. Red squares highlight mediators of the effect of breastfeeding on inflammation. Bars are 95% confidence intervals

It is well established that fatty acids play critical roles in inflammatory regulation and immune function. Fatty acids such as linoleic acid are integral to anti-inflammatory pathways and immune modulation. Conversely, infection and inflammation may regulate fatty acid synthesis, mobilisation, or metabolism. This evidence for bidirectional mediation effects highlights the complex interplay between nutrition, lipid metabolism, and inflammation during early development, providing mechanistic insights into how breastfeeding may support optimal immune and metabolic health in infants.
