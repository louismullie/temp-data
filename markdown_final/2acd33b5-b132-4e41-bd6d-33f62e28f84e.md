## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which factors increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure (CHF) in a dyspneic patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-yield elements from history that shift pre-test probability. Then, I should review symptom patterns that are more specific to CHF. Next, I will examine physical examination signs with strong likelihood ratios. After that, I need to assess rapid diagnostic tests, especially natriuretic peptides, including rule-out and rule-in thresholds and common confounders. I will then consider essential imaging and point-of-care tools that augment bedside diagnosis. Finally, I should integrate validated diagnostic models and briefly address special populations like HFpEF and those with coexisting pulmonary disease, before summarizing a stepwise approach that avoids premature closure.

> Let me first confirm the historical predictors that meaningfully increase the likelihood of CHF in acute dyspnea, because pre-test probability frames all subsequent test interpretation. A prior history of heart failure is the single strongest historical factor, with a positive likelihood ratio around 5.8, and I need to ensure I do not overlook corroborating cardiac comorbidity such as coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation, all of which push the probability upward in ED cohorts and primary care diagnostic rules alike [^114Wjz9q] [^1142mMm4]. Hold on, I should also verify hypertension burden and age, since treatment with two or more antihypertensives and older age are incorporated into HFpEF-focused diagnostic tools and track with higher HF likelihood in dyspneic adults, and loop diuretic use is a historical clue to prior volume overload, further shifting probability toward CHF [^116HbyXP] [^1142mMm4].

> Next, I should review symptom patterns that incrementally support a cardiogenic etiology, but I need to be careful not to over-interpret them in isolation. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea raises the odds meaningfully, and orthopnea and rapid escalation of exertional dyspnea are consistent with decompensation; however, dyspnea alone is non-specific and heavily overlaps with pulmonary conditions, so I must not jump to conclusions based on symptoms without objective data to follow [^114Wjz9q]. Let me consider the nuance that older adults with HFpEF may present with subtle exertional intolerance and relatively nonspecific symptoms, which increases the risk of false positives if I rely solely on clinical gestalt and underscores why biomarker and imaging corroboration are essential in this group [^113zoxX6].

> I will now examine the physical examination, because certain signs have high diagnostic yield when present. The third heart sound (S3) gallop has one of the strongest positive likelihood ratios among individual signs, and a displaced apical impulse, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary rales, peripheral edema, and new irregularly irregular pulse suggesting atrial fibrillation all increase the probability of CHF in aggregate models and ED analyses; I should double-check each of these at the bedside before ordering tests, as their combination can robustly raise post-test odds [^114Wjz9q] [^1142mMm4]. Wait, I should verify that murmurs indicating valvular disease also contribute to pre-test probability in these models; they do, and their presence should push me to prioritize echocardiography early [^1142mMm4].

> Now to rapid diagnostics, with natriuretic peptides front-and-center; but let me first confirm their guideline-backed role. BNP or NT-proBNP testing is recommended to support diagnosis or exclusion in dyspneic patients, and to assist with risk stratification and prognostication in both acute and chronic HF, so ordering these early in the evaluation is appropriate and evidence-based [^1159tQD9] [^115ntb5a] [^1141y5kX]. I initially thought BNP thresholds varied widely by setting, but wait, I should verify the established cut-points used in pivotal ED studies: NT-proBNP less than 300 pg/mL or BNP less than 100 pg/mL strongly support ruling out acute CHF with very high negative predictive value, which aligns with PRIDE and Breathing Not Properly data as well as meta-analytic summaries; this is where a low value meaningfully lowers the odds and helps steer attention to noncardiac causes [^1159tQD9] [^115esYdK] [^112692Lq].

> For ruling in CHF, I need to check age-adjusted thresholds and common interpretive pitfalls to avoid misclassification. NT-proBNP greater than 450 pg/mL for patients younger than 50 years and greater than 900 pg/mL for those 50 years or older are robust rule-in thresholds in the ED, and BNP above about 500 pg/mL has a high positive predictive value; however, I should confirm that intermediate BNP values require clinical context, since factors like atrial fibrillation, anemia, radiographic cardiomegaly, and older age can modestly elevate BNP even without acute CHF, while obesity can suppress peptide levels and generate false negatives at fixed cutoffs [^1159tQD9] [^117SsDtV] [^116Ru1mL] [^112zE4Cz]. Hold on, I should verify the impact of renal dysfunction and past HF history: reduced GFR elevates baseline NT-proBNP but the test remains diagnostically useful with adjusted interpretation, and a history of HF reduces diagnostic performance, narrowing the AUC and necessitating integration with other data rather than reliance on the peptide alone [^112Z99EG] [^114szVzd].

> I need to ensure I do not neglect imaging that can rapidly refine the differential. Chest radiography showing pulmonary venous congestion or interstitial edema carries a high positive likelihood ratio for CHF in ED populations and is guideline-recommended in suspected or new-onset HF to assess heart size, pulmonary congestion, and alternate diagnoses; in parallel, bedside echocardiography and formal transthoracic echo delineate ventricular function and valvular disease and can be combined with BNP to increase diagnostic accuracy in acute dyspnea [^114Wjz9q] [^113sYqT2] [^111DtQqR]. Let me also consider point-of-care ultrasound patterns, since B-lines on lung ultrasound and a plethoric IVC can support a cardiogenic cause of dyspnea; while data are more limited, a simple cardiac–lung–IVC "triple scan" may accelerate early decision-making in the undifferentiated dyspneic patient, and IVC diameter and collapsibility can discriminate cardiac from pulmonary dyspnea in small cohorts, though I should confirm with comprehensive testing before anchoring [^116cgghG] [^11625bZN].

> Next, I should review integrative diagnostic tools that synthesize multiple features rather than leaning on any single sign or test. In primary care cohorts, combining age, coronary artery disease, and loop diuretic use with select physical findings provides strong discrimination, and adding NT-proBNP further improves classification; similarly, ED-derived clinical scores like the Brest score and decision support frameworks built around NT-proBNP, such as CoDE-HF, can standardize estimation in the acute setting, although they must be applied alongside ECG and CXR to optimize performance and avoid context errors [^1142mMm4] [^113nRvEC] [^116RY1Rq]. But wait, I should verify that meta-analyses of natriuretic peptides in acute care confirm these benefits; they do, showing improved diagnostic accuracy when peptides are added to conventional evaluation, reinforcing their role as part of a multimodal approach rather than a standalone determinant [^112692Lq].

> I will now examine special diagnostic challenges, particularly HFpEF and older adults with exertional dyspnea. Let me reconsider my initial inclination to equate a normal BNP with absence of HF, because up to a third of outpatients with HFpEF can have BNP values below typical diagnostic thresholds, and echocardiographic indices alone have limited predictive value; in such cases, structured scores like H2FPEF that combine age, AF, obesity, hypertension burden, and echo parameters help quantify probability and guide further provocative or hemodynamic testing when uncertainty persists [^113zoxX6] [^116HbyXP]. I need to ensure I integrate comorbidities and medication exposures that mimic or mask HF, since misattribution is common in multimorbid older adults and can delay appropriate management despite clear physiologic congestion once it is sought [^113zoxX6].

> But wait, what if the dyspnea is primarily pulmonary and I am overfitting to CHF; I should double-check epidemiology and overlap conditions. In ED populations, COPD and asthma are frequent causes of dyspnea in middle-aged adults while CHF predominates in the oldest group, and importantly, respiratory vital signs can be normal even in life-threatening presentations, so anchoring is risky; in patients with preexisting obstructive lung disease, BNP can still unmask occult CHF, outperforming routine clinical judgment in subgroup analyses, which argues for early peptide testing when the clinical picture is mixed [^115wYhX2] [^1118A7go]. Hold on, let me verify that guidelines also emphasize broad imaging to detect alternative cardiopulmonary causes when CHF is suspected; chest radiography is indeed recommended to evaluate heart size, congestion, and alternative diagnoses in suspected or acute HF, reinforcing a parallel track approach rather than a narrow diagnostic tunnel [^113sYqT2].

> Stepping back, I should confirm a practical, stepwise synthesis that increases the likelihood of CHF appropriately without premature closure. Start with high-yield history items such as prior HF, CAD or MI, AF, hypertension burden, loop diuretic use, diabetes, and age to set a realistic pre-test probability; weigh CHF-specific symptom patterns like orthopnea and PND while recognizing their limits; examine for S3, JVP elevation, pulmonary rales, edema, displaced apex, and murmurs; obtain BNP or NT-proBNP early to exploit robust rule-out thresholds and age-adjusted rule-in cut-points, carefully adjusting for obesity, renal dysfunction, AF, and prior HF; and use CXR, ECG, and echocardiography to corroborate cardiogenic congestion and define structural disease, employing validated clinical scores and decision tools to integrate these inputs, especially in HFpEF or multimorbid patients where signal-to-noise is lower [^114Wjz9q] [^111VTuRa] [^113sYqT2] [^1159tQD9] [^1142mMm4] [^116HbyXP]. Finally, I need to ensure ongoing diagnostic humility by reassessing when data conflict, since both under- and over-diagnosis of CHF in dyspneic patients are common and carry consequences for treatment and outcomes, which is precisely why a structured, reference-supported approach is essential here [^112692Lq] [^116RY1Rq].

In patients presenting with dyspnea, the likelihood of congestive heart failure (CHF) increases with a combination of clinical features, biomarkers, and imaging findings. The most predictive elements are a **history of heart failure** or **coronary artery disease**, **orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea**, **elevated jugular venous pressure**, **third heart sound (S3)** [^114Wjz9q], and **peripheral edema**. Elevated natriuretic peptides (**BNP > 400 pg/mL** or **NT-proBNP > 900 pg/mL** in patients ≥ 50 years) strongly support CHF, while levels **< 100 pg/mL (BNP)** or **< 300 pg/mL (NT-proBNP)** make CHF unlikely [^111VTuRa] [^112692Lq]. Chest radiography showing **cardiomegaly**, **pulmonary venous congestion**, or **interstitial edema** [^113sYqT2], and echocardiography demonstrating **reduced ejection fraction** or **diastolic dysfunction** [^111DtQqR], further increase diagnostic certainty [^115sXryv]. Integrating these findings yields the highest diagnostic accuracy for CHF in dyspneic patients [^115esYdK].

## Clinical history and symptoms

- **History of heart failure or coronary artery disease**: Strongly predictive of CHF recurrence or exacerbation [^1142mMm4] [^114Wjz9q].

- **Orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)**: Classic symptoms of CHF, indicating fluid redistribution and pulmonary congestion [^1142mMm4] [^114Wjz9q].

- **Rapid weight gain**: Suggests fluid retention, a hallmark of CHF exacerbation [^115r4ugS] [^114Wjz9q].

- **Fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance**: Commonly associated with CHF due to decreased cardiac output and perfusion [^115Y881R] [^1142mMm4].

---

## Physical examination findings

| **Physical finding** | **Likelihood ratio (LR)** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) | 5.1 | Indicates elevated right atrial pressure and volume overload |
| Third heart sound (S3) | 11.0 | - Highly specific for CHF <br/> - Indicating increased ventricular filling pressures [^114Wjz9q] |
| Peripheral edema | 2.3 | Suggests fluid retention and systemic congestion |
| Pulmonary rales | 2.8 | Indicates pulmonary congestion and interstitial edema [^114Wjz9q] |
| Displaced apex beat | 3.1 | Suggests cardiac enlargement and ventricular dysfunction |

---

## Laboratory biomarkers

- **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)**: Levels > 400 pg/mL strongly suggest CHF [^114szVzd], while levels < 100 pg/mL effectively exclude CHF [^111VTuRa] [^112692Lq].

- **N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP)**: Levels > 900 pg/mL in patients ≥ 50 years strongly indicate CHF, while levels < 300 pg/mL effectively exclude CHF [^1159tQD9] [^115gURyi].

- **Cardiac troponins**: Elevated levels may indicate myocardial injury or stress, supporting the diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) [^112pRCpt].

---

## Imaging studies

- **Chest radiography**: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary venous congestion, interstitial edema, and pleural effusions strongly suggest CHF [^114Wjz9q] [^113sYqT2].

- **Echocardiography**: Reduced ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, and structural cardiac abnormalities confirm CHF diagnosis [^111DtQqR] [^115Y881R].

- **Cardiac MRI**: Useful in complex cases to assess myocardial structure, function, and fibrosis [^115sXryv] [^1175JYp5].

---

## Clinical prediction rules and scoring systems

Several **clinical prediction rules and scoring systems** aid in diagnosing CHF. The **Framingham criteria** [^115Y881R] compile major and minor signs and symptoms; the **Brest score** is designed for acute CHF diagnosis in the emergency setting [^113nRvEC]; and the **H2FPEF score** assists in diagnosing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [^113zoxX6] in patients with unexplained dyspnea [^116HbyXP].

---

## Integration of clinical findings, biomarkers, and imaging

A comprehensive approach that integrates **clinical history, physical examination, biomarkers, and imaging** yields the highest diagnostic accuracy for CHF in dyspneic patients [^115esYdK]. Combining elevated natriuretic peptides with specific clinical signs (e.g. elevated JVP, S3) and imaging findings (e.g. cardiomegaly, reduced ejection fraction) significantly increases the likelihood of CHF [^1144xQuS].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite the availability of diagnostic tools, **challenges remain** in evaluating dyspneic patients for CHF. Dyspnea is non-specific [^114Wjz9q] and complicates the differential diagnosis; COPD and other pulmonary conditions can mimic CHF [^114bogZC] and complicate assessment; and factors such as obesity [^112zE4Cz], renal dysfunction [^112Z99EG], and age [^116Ru1mL] can affect natriuretic peptide levels and confound interpretation.

In patients presenting with dyspnea, the likelihood of CHF increases with a combination of clinical history, physical examination findings, laboratory biomarkers, and imaging studies. A comprehensive approach integrating these elements yields the **highest diagnostic accuracy for CHF** [^111VTuRa].

### The diagnostic value of physical examination and additional testing in primary care patients with suspected heart failure [^1142mMm4]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of nonacute heart failure is crucial because prompt initiation of evidence-based treatment can prevent or slow down further progression. Diagnosing new-onset heart failure in primary care is challenging.

- **Methods and results**: This is a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with external validation. Seven hundred twenty-one consecutive patients suspected of new-onset heart failure underwent standardized diagnostic work-up, including chest x-ray, spirometry, ECG, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement, and echocardiography in specially equipped outpatient diagnostic heart failure clinics. The presence of heart failure was determined by an outcome panel using initial clinical data and 6-month follow-up data, blinded to biomarker data. Of the 721 patients, 207 (28.7%) had heart failure. The combination of three items from history (age, coronary artery disease, and loop diuretic use) plus six from physical examination (pulse rate and regularity, displaced apex beat, rales, heart murmur, and increased jugular vein pressure) showed independent diagnostic value (c-statistic 0.83). NT-proBNP was the most powerful supplementary diagnostic test, increasing the c-statistic to 0.86 and resulting in net reclassification improvement of 69% (P < 0.0001). A simplified diagnostic rule was applied to two external validation datasets, resulting in c-statistics of 0.95 and 0.88, confirming the results.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, we estimated the quantitative diagnostic contribution of elements of history and physical examination in the context of primary care patients with suspected heart failure.

### Does this dyspneic patient in the emergency department have congestive heart failure [^114Wjz9q]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is a common complaint in the emergency department where physicians must accurately make a rapid diagnosis. The objective of this study is to assess the usefulness of history, symptoms, and signs along with routine diagnostic studies, such as chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), to differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to July 2005 and the reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks.

- **Study selection**: We retained 22 studies focused on diagnosing heart failure in adult patients presenting with dyspnea to the emergency department.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently abstracted data, including sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs), and assessed methodological quality.

- **Data synthesis**: Many features increased the probability of heart failure, with the best features being:

- **History**: Past history of heart failure (positive LR = 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.1–8.0)
- **Symptoms**: Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (positive LR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–4.5)
- **Signs**: Third heart sound (S3) gallop (positive LR = 11; 95% CI, 4.9–25.0)
- **Chest radiograph**: Pulmonary venous congestion (positive LR = 12.0; 95% CI, 6.8–21.0)
- **Electrocardiogram**: Atrial fibrillation (positive LR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7–8.8)

The features that best decreased the probability of heart failure were the absence of a past history of heart failure.

### The N-terminal pro-BNP investigation of dyspnea in the emergency department (PRIDE) study [^1159tQD9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The utility of aminoterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) testing in the emergency department to rule out acute congestive heart failure (CHF) and the optimal cutpoints for this use are not established. We conducted a prospective study of 600 patients who presented in the emergency department with dyspnea. The clinical diagnosis of acute CHF was determined by study physicians who were blinded to NT-proBNP results. The primary endpoint was a comparison of NT-proBNP results with the clinical assessment of the managing physician for identifying acute CHF.

The median NT-proBNP level among 209 patients (35%) who had acute CHF was 4,054 pg/ml versus 131 pg/ml among 390 patients (65%) who did not (p < 0.001). NT-proBNP levels above 450 pg/ml for patients under 50 years of age and 900 pg/ml for patients aged 50 or older were highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acute CHF (p < 0.001). An NT-proBNP level below 300 pg/ml was optimal for ruling out acute CHF, with a negative predictive value of 99%.

Increased NT-proBNP was the strongest independent predictor of a final diagnosis of acute CHF (odds ratio 44, 95% confidence interval 21.0 to 91.0, p < 0.0001). NT-proBNP testing alone was superior to clinical judgment alone for diagnosing acute CHF (p = 0.006). Additionally, NT-proBNP plus clinical judgment was superior to NT-proBNP or clinical judgment alone. NT-proBNP measurement is a valuable addition to standard clinical assessment for the identification and exclusion of acute CHF in the emergency department setting.

Echocardiography and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are diagnostic tests for congestive heart failure (CHF), but an emergency diagnosis can be difficult.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic performance of BNP testing and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular systolic function, separately and combined, for the identification of CHF in patients with acute dyspnea.

Design

Prospective, multinational, multicenter study.

Setting

Patients presenting to emergency departments in seven hospitals between June 1999 and December 2000.

### Ventilatory response to carbon dioxide output in subjects with congestive heart failure and in patients with COPD with comparable exercise capacity [^116UijQA]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with congestive heart failure or COPD may share an increased response in minute ventilation (V̇E) to carbon dioxide output (V̇CO2) during exercise. The goal of this study was to ascertain whether the V̇E/V̇CO2 slope and V̇E/V̇CO2 intercept can discriminate between subjects with congestive heart failure and those with COPD at equal peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2).

- **Methods**: We studied 46 subjects with congestive heart failure (mean age 61 ± 9 years) and 46 subjects with COPD (mean age 64 ± 8 years) who performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

- **Results**: The V̇E/V̇CO2 slope was significantly higher in subjects with congestive heart failure compared with those with COPD (39.5 ± 9.5 vs 31.8 ± 7.4, P < .01). The V̇E/V̇CO2 intercept at a V̇CO2 of 2.14 L/min demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.96. Regardless of peak V̇O2, the end-tidal pressure of CO2 (PETCO2) at peak exercise was not different in subjects with congestive heart failure (P = 0.42) and was significantly higher in subjects with COPD (P < .01) compared with the corresponding unloaded PETCO2.

- **Conclusions**: The ventilation response to carbon dioxide in subjects with congestive heart failure and COPD was assessed, indicating differences in V̇E/V̇CO2 metrics between the groups.

### An algorithmic approach to chronic dyspnea [^113SGisE]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to prospectively evaluate an algorithmic approach to the cause(s) of chronic dyspnea. The study used a prospective observational design. The study group consisted of 123 patients who presented with a chief complaint of dyspnea of unknown cause that had been present for over eight weeks. Dyspnea severity scores were documented at entry and after therapy. An algorithmic approach was used for diagnosing dyspnea, and therapy could be instituted at any time if data supported a treatable diagnosis. Whenever possible, the accuracy of the diagnosis was confirmed with an improvement in dyspnea following therapy. Tests required, the spectrum and frequency of diagnoses, and the values of individual tests were determined.

- **Results**: Causes were diagnosed in 122 out of 123 patients (99%); 97 patients received one diagnosis, and 25 patients received two diagnoses. About 53% of diagnoses were respiratory-related, while 47% were non-respiratory. Following therapy, dyspnea improved in 63% of patients.

- **Conclusions**: The prospective algorithmic approach led to diagnoses in 99% of cases. A third of patients were diagnosed with each tier of the algorithm, thereby minimizing the need for invasive testing. Specific diagnoses resulted in an improvement in dyspnea for the majority of cases. Based on the results of this study, the algorithm can be revised to further minimize unnecessary tests without losing diagnostic accuracy.

### Predictors of elevated B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations in dyspneic patients without heart failure: An analysis from the breathing not properly multinational study [^116Ru1mL]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an established tool for the diagnosis of acute congestive heart failure in patients presenting with dyspnea. Some patients have moderately elevated BNP levels (i.e. 100 to 500 pg/mL) in the absence of acute congestive heart failure. The objective of the study was to identify independent predictors of elevated BNP concentrations in the absence of congestive heart failure.

- **Methods**: We studied 781 patients without acute congestive heart failure and BNP levels ranging from 0 to 500 pg/mL, drawn from a cohort of 1,586 patients with acute dyspnea who had BNP levels measured upon arrival at the emergency department. Two cardiologists, blinded to BNP results, reviewed all clinical data and categorized patients according to whether they had acute congestive heart failure or not.

- **Results**: Independent predictors of elevated BNP levels (i.e. > 100 pg/mL) were identified as a medical history of atrial fibrillation, radiographic cardiomegaly, decreased blood hemoglobin concentration, decreased body mass index, and increased age.

- **Conclusion**: Knowledge of these commonly obtained variables should aid clinicians in the interpretation of moderately elevated BNP results in patients presenting with acute dyspnea in the emergency department.

### Impact of the history of congestive heart failure on the utility of B-type natriuretic peptide in the emergency diagnosis of heart failure: Results from the Breathing Not Properly Multinational Study [^117SsDtV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

B-type natriuretic peptide is known to correlate with the hemodynamic state, presence, and severity of congestive heart failure, and prognosis. Although a low-range B-type natriuretic peptide of less than 100 pg/mL has a high negative predictive value (90%) and a high-range B-type natriuretic peptide greater than 500 pg/mL has a high positive predictive value (87%), there remains some ambiguity in the interpretation of results in the medium range (100–500 pg/mL). We hypothesized that taking into account the history of congestive heart failure, along with other clinical variables, would be helpful in this range of B-type natriuretic peptide levels.

- **Method**: The Breathing Not Properly Multicenter Study was an international, 7-center, prospective study including 1475 patients with a mean age of 63 years (57% male, 54% female); 35% of patients with a history of congestive heart failure were enrolled, and a final diagnosis of congestive heart failure was made in 46%. The index criterion was defined as positive if any 2 index findings (i.e. history of coronary artery disease, lower extremity edema, pulmonary edema, cephalization of the pulmonary arteries, and cardiomegaly) were present.

- **Results**: The interval likelihood ratios (LR) for low, medium, and high B-type natriuretic peptide ranges are 0.13, 1.85, and 8.1, respectively. For medium B-type natriuretic peptide levels, a positive history of congestive heart failure makes the diagnosis more probable with a cumulative LR of 4.3. In this range, a positive index criterion was strongly indicative.

### Inflammatory biomarkers predicting prognosis in patients with acute dyspnea [^113Ku1X3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The study focused on unselected patients with acute dyspnea rather than on specific groups with a main diagnosis such as CHF, COPD, or infection. This approach aimed to identify biomarkers that are useful upon immediate presentation at the ED, a setting where the first-line physician often has limited or no access to the patient's underlying main diagnosis.

All conditions underlying acute dyspnea require different treatment plans, emphasizing the importance of identifying the underlying cause. The BMRS (Biomarker Risk Score) may prompt further examination and extensive medical testing. For instance, in patients with a high BMRS, it is crucial to use advanced examinations early to determine the exact cause and begin both short-term and long-term treatment swiftly. However, in patients with a low BMRS, such urgency is reduced, allowing further examinations to be decided upon gradually and as needed within primary care. This strategy could help prioritize and allocate time and monetary resources in the ED and healthcare in general. Future studies are specifically warranted to address these aspects.

Interleukin-8, also known as chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8, is produced by macrophages, monocytes, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. It induces chemotaxis for naive T cells, mobilizes and activates neutrophils, and promotes angiogenesis. Interleukin-8 is rapidly produced as a reaction to and progressor of inflammation and is already used clinically as an early marker of neon.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: New approaches to diagnosis and management [^113zoxX6]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosing heart failure (HF) in older adults poses specific challenges; false‐positive clinical diagnoses are not uncommon. The most common symptom of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is exertional dyspnea. However, symptoms like reduced exercise tolerance are prevalent in older adults and may reflect normal physiological aging processes or be attributed to non‐cardiac etiologies. Furthermore, diagnosing HF in older patients can be complex due to the presence of co‐morbidities, some of which can mimic HF signs and further confound the diagnosis.

Older patients with HFpEF may not exhibit "classic" HF symptoms and instead present with very subtle clinical signs. Up to one‐third of HFpEF outpatients may have a B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level below typical diagnostic thresholds, which challenges the common practice of using BNP for HF diagnosis. The limited predictive capabilities of echocardiographic variables for diagnosing diastolic dysfunction additionally complicate the clinical picture. There is also no universally agreed-upon definition for HFpEF. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) consensus states that the diagnosis of HFpEF is based on typical symptoms and signs of HF in a patient with normal range left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), no significant valvular abnormalities by echocardiography, and no other obvious precipitating factors for HF. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) requires diastolic dysfunction for the diagnosis.

### Causes of shortness of breath in the acute patient: A national study [^115wYhX2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is a common and ambiguous complaint that results in 3.4 million emergency department (ED) visits annually. While learners may encounter lists of differential diagnoses to consider during training, these lists are often not empirically based. We sought to establish an evidence-based differential diagnosis for dyspnea and determine whether normal vital signs can rule out a life-threatening diagnosis.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2005 to 2014 for ED visits with a chief complaint of dyspnea and tallied the principal discharge diagnosis. We included 10,170 sampled ED visits by adults with a chief complaint of dyspnea, representing nearly 42 million visits nationally. We then calculated the most common principal discharge diagnoses by age group and the frequency of abnormal respiratory vital signs in cases with life-threatening diagnoses.

- **Results**: The most represented age group was 45 to 64 years (31.6%). Most visits were discharged directly from the ED (57.5%), while 8.1% required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The most common diagnosis in patients aged 18 to 44 was acute asthma exacerbation (14.8%). Obstructive chronic bronchitis was the most common specified diagnosis in both patients ages 45 to 64 (11.1%) and patients ages 65 to 79 (12.4%), while congestive heart failure was the most common for patients ages 80 and over (15.9%). Respiratory vital signs were frequently normal in the 44.6% of visits that resulted in a potentially life-threatening diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and assessment of the heart failure patient: the cornerstone of effective management [^114WcJbP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a syndrome describing a pathophysiological state with diverse etiologies. Providing an adequate mechanistic definition is difficult. The guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology define the diagnosis of heart failure based on three criteria:

- **Symptoms and evidence**: Patients should have symptoms compatible with heart failure at rest or on exercise. There should be objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction at rest. In doubtful cases, there should be a favorable response following therapy for heart failure.

The term diagnosis derives from the Greek words "dia" and "nosi", meaning "through knowledge". It implies that a conclusion is drawn describing the patient's status based on the available information. This information is commonly based on symptoms, history, findings at physical examination, results from laboratory tests, and results from various non-invasive and invasive special examinations. Diagnostic precision is crucial in deciding treatment strategy, presenting a continuous academic and clinical challenge. Ultimately, the clinical diagnosis of heart failure is based on all the information available to physicians. No single investigation is specific for this clinical syndrome, and management strategies attempt to modify the underlying mechanisms to alleviate symptoms and improve survival.

- **Heart failure and edema**: Advise patients to be alert for symptoms of congestive heart failure, including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema, and instruct them to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur [see WARNINGS].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, such as nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms. If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical attention.

- **Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions**: Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction, including difficulty breathing and swelling of the face or throat. If these occur, patients should seek immediate emergency help [see WARNINGS].

- **Fetal toxicity**: Inform pregnant women to avoid the use of diflunisal tablets and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks of gestation due to the risk of premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with diflunisal tablets is needed for a pregnant woman between approximately 20 to 30 weeks of gestation, advise her that monitoring for oligohydramnios may be necessary if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours [see WARNINGS, Fetal Toxicity and PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy].

- **Laboratory tests**: Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term NSAID treatment should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically.

### Uncovering heart failure in patients with a history of pulmonary disease: rationale for the early use of B-type natriuretic peptide in the emergency department [^1118A7go]. Academic emergency medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) can reliably identify acute congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea. Heart failure, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are syndromes where dyspnea and wheezing are overlapping signs, and hence, these syndromes are often difficult to differentiate.

Objective

To determine whether BNP can distinguish new-onset heart failure in patients with COPD or asthma presenting with dyspnea to the ED.

Methods

The BNP Multinational Study was a seven-center prospective study of 1,586 adult patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnea who had blinded BNP levels measured on arrival with a rapid, point-of-care device. This study evaluated the 417 patients with no previous history of heart failure and a history of asthma or COPD as a subgroup from the 1,586 adult patients in the BNP Multinational Study. The reference standard for CHF was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists, also blinded to BNP results, who reviewed all clinical data and standardized CHF scores.

Results

A total of 417 subjects (mean age 62.2 years, 64.4% male) had a history of asthma or COPD without a history of CHF. Of these, 87/417 (20.9%, 95% CI = 17.1% to 25.1%) were found to have CHF as the final adjudicated diagnosis. The emergency physicians identified a minority, 32/87 (36.8%), of these patients with CHF. The mean BNP values (± SD) were 587.0 ± 426.4 and 108.8 ± 221.3 pg/mL for those with and without CHF (p < 0.0001). At a cutpoint of 100 pg/mL, BNP had the f

### Dyspnoea and worsening heart failure in patients with acute heart failure: Results from the Pre-RELAX-AHF study [^1118Cxwp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Changes in dyspnoea were correlated with changes in other symptoms and clinical signs of acute heart failure (AHF) in this small database. Our results are in agreement with data from registries, as well as with post-hoc analyses from EVEREST and the PROTECT pilot study, and suggest that changes in dyspnoea are related to those in patients' congestion (both peripheral and central).

Relief of dyspnoea and lack of worsening heart failure (WHF) were associated with trends, sometimes reaching statistical significance, towards improved outcomes such as a shorter length of stay, more days alive and out of hospital, and lower mortality. These associations are important since they suggest that relief of dyspnoea and prevention of WHF, beyond being an important treatment goal for symptom improvement, are also markers of better outcomes. Hence, prevention of in-hospital WHF may become a major goal of therapy in AHF. Given the lack of association between dyspnoea relief and baseline characteristics, these data suggest that early assessment of dyspnoea relief may add important prognostic information beyond the information available at the time of admission.

The reasons for the association between dyspnoea relief and outcomes are likely to be multiple. First, relief of dyspnoea may be a marker of the relief of congestion and of less severe disease. However, faster resolution of dyspnoea may also reduce the need for additional therapies (loop diuretics, intravenous vasodilators, and inotropes) that are aimed at symptom relief, yet may also have potential adverse effects.

### Evaluation of chronic dyspnea [^113j1Uuh]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea is defined as dyspnea lasting more than one month. In approximately two-thirds of patients presenting with dyspnea, the underlying cause is cardiopulmonary disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is essential because treatment differs depending on the underlying condition. Asthma, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, interstitial lung disease, and psychogenic causes account for 85 percent of patients with this principal symptom.

The history and physical examination should guide the selection of initial diagnostic tests, such as electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, spirometry, complete blood count, and metabolic panel. If these are inconclusive, additional testing is indicated. Formal pulmonary function testing may be needed to establish a diagnosis of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or interstitial lung disease. High-resolution computed tomography is particularly useful for diagnosing interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or pulmonary embolism. Echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide levels help establish a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. If the diagnosis remains unclear, additional tests may be required. These include ventilation perfusion scans, Holter monitoring, cardiac catheterization, esophageal pH monitoring, lung biopsy, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

### Relationship between heart failure and the risk of acute exacerbation of COPD [^114bogZC]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

These results suggest that heart failure (HF) may be an underlying factor triggering exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are a number of challenges facing clinicians in the management of patients with COPD and HF. COPD exacerbation is a diagnosis of exclusion, with no biomarkers for exacerbation; the overlapping symptoms with HF make misdiagnosis possible. Similarly, the signs and symptoms of HF are non-specific, and many patients with HF are initially treated for exacerbation of other conditions. COPD and HF share common risk factors (e.g. smoking) and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, fatigue, exercise intolerance), which can make diagnosing one in the presence of the other difficult. Air trapping due to pulmonary disease can affect echocardiogram acoustic windows, leading to unsatisfactory imaging quality and making diagnosis more difficult.

The severity of COPD may be overestimated in patients with comorbid HF, as part of the reduction in lung function may be caused by HF. In patients with COPD, the median time between symptom presentation and HF diagnosis in UK primary care has been shown to be over three years, compared with only 2.4 years in patients without COPD. HF treatment is also delayed, with patients with COPD waiting 2.9 years compared with only 1.9 years in patients without COPD. There are currently no bespoke guidelines available for the management of patients with COPD and HF, despite the ongoing debate around the use of beta-agonists and the lingering hesitancy around beta-blocker (BB) use, which appears to be largely unfounded.

There is increasing recognition of the multimorbid patient, but the translation of this into clinical practice remains a challenge.

### The role of inferior vena cava diameter in the differential diagnosis of dyspneic patients; best sonographic measurement method [^11625bZN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine the role of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter in differentiating dyspnea of cardiac origin, such as acute heart failure (AHF), from pulmonary origin. It also sought to identify the most effective sonographic method for measuring the IVC diameter.

This prospective observational study was carried out at the intensive care unit of the emergency department of a training and research hospital. Participants were patients whose main symptom was dyspnea, categorized into two groups: cardiac dyspnea and pulmonary dyspnea, based on their final diagnosis. All patients underwent sonographic measurement of the minimum and maximum diameters of the IVC, and the caval index (CI) was calculated using both M-mode and B-mode. The sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) of the IVC values were analyzed for differentiation between the two groups.

The study included 74 patients with a mean age of 72.8 years. Among them, 32 had dyspnea of cardiac origin, while 42 had dyspnea of pulmonary origin. The IVC diameter measured with B-mode during inspiration (B-mode i) proved to be the most successful method for differentiating the groups. B-mode i values greater than 9 mm predicted dyspnea of cardiac origin with a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 92.9% (+LR: 11.8, -LR: 0.16).

In conclusion, the sonographic assessment of the IVC diameter can be used as a rapid, readily available, non-expensive, complication-free, and reproducible technique for distinguishing between cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea.

### Development and validation of a decision support tool for the diagnosis of acute heart failure: systematic review, meta-analysis, and modelling study [^1144xQuS]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations in our study. Firstly, we were able to obtain individual patient-level data for only 14 out of 30 studies that met our eligibility criteria, which introduces the possibility of selection bias. Nevertheless, the eligible studies that were not included had similar prevalence of acute heart failure, publication dates, geographical coverage, and population demographics and clinical characteristics as those that were included.

Secondly, when combining information from multiple studies, some variables had missing data in several studies. To maximize the use of information, we used a hierarchical multiple imputation method. Thirdly, we did not have consistently recorded data from the electrocardiogram and chest radiograph, and therefore could not include these data in our model. The interpretation of NT-proBNP in patients with suspected acute heart failure should be made in conjunction with these investigations, and future studies are needed to determine whether approaches that integrate these investigations can improve the performance of CoDE-HF.

Fourthly, not all studies adjudicated the diagnosis blinded to the results of NT-proBNP testing. In our sensitivity analysis, diagnostic performance was unchanged when we excluded the two studies in which adjudication was unblinded. Fifthly, the adjudicated diagnosis of acute heart failure did not differentiate between heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The increasing prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction highlights the need for further investigation.

### Epidemiology of heart failure [^111EX8cm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Heart failure can be considered the chronic stage of any disease leading to cardiac functional impairment, making it challenging to pinpoint a specific cause in an individual. Multiple causes often coexist, and most comorbid conditions do not occur independently of heart failure. Instead, they share risk factors, contribute to syndrome pathogenesis, or act as perpetuators of the condition. The majority of patients with heart failure exhibit multimorbidity. The number of patients with three or more chronic comorbidities increased from 68% in 2002 to 87% in 2014. Comorbidity is associated with increased severity of heart failure symptoms, leading to a poor quality of life and a worse prognosis.

### Epidemiology of heart failure [^112ZuxLg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a contemporary overview of the epidemiology of heart failure for the practicing physician. It covers prevalence and incidence, aetiology, and prognosis. The heterogeneity of the heart failure syndrome is reflected in the existing variety of definitions and categorizations, leading to large variance in reported estimates of occurrence, hospitalizations, and mortality rates of heart failure. This paper is not intended to be a comprehensive presentation of all epidemiological reports but rather serves as a clinical summary of the evolving heart failure epidemic and as a guide to understanding differences across studies.

### Impact of point-of-care B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurement on medical decision-making for older emergency department patients with dyspnea [^111fRiNq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been shown to aid in the Emergency Department (ED) diagnosis of heart failure. We sought to determine how point-of-care BNP measurement influences real-world medical decision-making. Using a commercially available, point-of-care assay, BNP levels were measured in a convenience sample of ED patients over the age of 55 years who complained of dyspnea.

Blinded to BNP results, emergency physicians were asked to formulate a differential diagnosis and management plan for each patient. Immediately thereafter, BNP results were disclosed, and the physicians were asked what (if any) decisions they would change.

With physicians blinded to BNP results, 24 of 88 patients (27%) were given a primary diagnosis of heart failure, and 18 patients (20%) were given a secondary or alternative diagnosis of heart failure. For the former group, disclosure of BNP results resulted in no changes in diagnosis or management. For the latter group, disclosure of BNP results caused heart failure to become the primary diagnosis in 4 patients (22%) and led to five changes in medical management.

For the 46 patients initially given neither a primary nor secondary diagnosis of heart failure, disclosure of BNP results caused heart failure to become the primary diagnosis in one patient (2%) and a secondary diagnosis in 4 patients (9%) and led to five changes in medical management. Thus, for ED patients with a primary clinical diagnosis of heart failure, BNP testing had no impact on medical decision-making. However, for other patients with dyspnea, elevated BNP…

### A simple, evidence-based approach to help guide diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116HbyXP]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is challenging in euvolemic patients with dyspnea, and no evidence-based criteria are available. We sought to develop and then validate noninvasive diagnostic criteria that could be used to estimate the likelihood that HFpEF is present among patients with unexplained dyspnea to guide further testing.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with unexplained dyspnea referred for invasive hemodynamic exercise testing were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnosis of HFpEF (case) or noncardiac dyspnea (control) was ascertained by invasive hemodynamic exercise testing. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the ability of clinical findings to discriminate cases from controls. A scoring system was developed and then validated in a separate test cohort.

- **Results**: The derivation cohort included 414 consecutive patients (267 cases with HFpEF and 147 controls; HFpEF prevalence, 64%). The test cohort included 100 consecutive patients (61 with HFpEF; prevalence, 61%). Obesity, atrial fibrillation, age > 60 years, treatment with ≥ 2 antihypertensives, echocardiographic E/e' ratio > 9, and echocardiographic pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 35 mmHg were selected as the final set of predictive variables. A weighted score based on these 6 variables was used to create a composite score (H2FPEF score) ranging from 0 to 9. The odds of HFpEF doubled for each 1-unit score increase (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.74–2.30; P < 0.0001), with an area under the curve of 0.841 (P < 0.0001). The H2FPEF score was superior to current approaches.

### Diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of natriuretic peptides in emergency department patients with dyspnea [^112V8AS1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

More than 4.5 million Americans have congestive heart failure (CHF), with close to 550,000 new cases diagnosed each year. One third of known patients with CHF are admitted to the hospital annually. Emergency department diagnosis of CHF is often based on history and physical examination findings, along with results of ancillary tests such as chest radiography and ECG. Although signs and symptoms of fluid overload, such as lower extremity edema and dyspnea, raise the suspicion of CHF, their lack of sensitivity makes them poor screening tools.

The natriuretic peptides are promising markers of myocardial dysfunction and heart failure. Because of their relationship to myocardial pressure and stretching, natriuretic peptides have been investigated over the past five decades as both diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndromes and CHF. This article discusses each of the natriuretic peptides and attempts to delineate their potential diagnostic and prognostic roles in the emergency department.

### Three-view bedside ultrasound to differentiate acute decompensated heart failure from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116cgghG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Identifying the cause of acute dyspnea in the emergency department is often challenging, even for the most experienced provider. Distinguishing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from acute decompensated heart failure in the acutely dyspneic patient who presents in respiratory distress is often difficult. Patients are often unable to give a detailed history when in extremis, yet primary management needs to be initiated before further testing can be completed. Bedside diagnostic ultrasound has emerged as a tool for emergency physicians to rapidly evaluate the cardiopulmonary status in patients presenting with undifferentiated shortness of breath [1–3]. A rapid three-view sonographic evaluation of the heart, lungs, and inferior vena cava, or "Triple Scan", may be a useful tool in identifying the cause of acute dyspnea and may aid the clinician in the initial management of the critically ill dyspneic patient. We present a case where a three-view ultrasound examination, the "Triple Scan", allowed for detection of new-onset congestive heart failure and initiation of appropriate medical therapy without waiting for further standard diagnostic testing.

### Practical algorithms for early diagnosis of heart failure and heart stress using NT-proBNP: A clinical consensus statement from the Heart Failure Association of the ESC [^115gURyi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosing heart failure is often difficult due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, which can be caused by a range of medical conditions. Natriuretic peptides (NPs) have been recognized as important biomarkers for diagnosing heart failure. This document from the Heart Failure Association examines the practical uses of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in various clinical scenarios.

The concentrations of NT-proBNP vary according to the patient profile and the clinical scenario; therefore, values should be interpreted with caution to ensure appropriate diagnosis. Validated cut-points are provided to rule in or rule out acute heart failure in the emergency department and to diagnose de novo heart failure in the outpatient setting. We also coin the concept of 'heart stress' when NT-proBNP levels are elevated in an asymptomatic patient with risk factors for heart failure (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease), underlying the development of cardiac dysfunction and further increased risk.

We propose a simple acronym for healthcare professionals and patients, FIND-HF, which serves as a prompt to consider heart failure: Fatigue, Increased water accumulation, Natriuretic peptide testing, and Dyspnoea. Use of this acronym would enable the early diagnosis of heart failure. Overall, understanding and utilizing NT-proBNP levels will lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of heart failure, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

### The diagnostic accuracy of the natriuretic peptides in heart failure: Systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis in the acute care setting [^112692Lq]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Making the correct diagnosis in patients with suspected acute heart failure is challenging, and is confirmatory in only 40–50% of cases. Several studies have shown that when added to routine history, clinical examination, and conventional investigations (e.g. chest radiography), measurement of plasma natriuretic peptide levels improves diagnostic accuracy. This has led to the recommendation of these markers in international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure. The 2012 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for heart failure endorsed specific age-independent decision cut-offs for plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (≤ 100 ng/L), N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP, ≤ 300 ng/L), and mid-regional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP, ≤ 120 pmol/L) for the exclusion of acute heart failure based on consensus of expert opinion.

Although natriuretic peptide levels have been used widely for the earlier diagnosis or exclusion of chronic heart failure in the outpatient setting, their use in the acute care setting has only been partially adopted. This is because their role has remained uncertain, and they are not routinely available in emergency departments in the United Kingdom for rapid assessment of patients presenting with breathlessness. This lack of availability reflects the lack of clarity on the diagnostic accuracy of natriuretic peptides in this setting. In particular, while the age-independent cut-offs as recommended by the European Society of Cardiology are relatively easy to apply in clinical practice, they have not been evaluated by further comprehensive studies.

### What causes exertional dyspnoea in patients with atrial fibrillation? Implications for catheter ablation in patients with heart failure [^111QQXPS]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Recently, the effect of catheter ablation in the setting of a randomized controlled trial was evaluated in a subgroup of patients who participated in the CABANA trial. The investigators identified 778 patients considered to have heart failure, of whom nearly 75% had an ejection fraction of 50% or greater. The investigators reported that death for any reason occurred in fewer patients assigned to ablation; however, the trial recorded only 60 deaths, leading to imprecise estimates that are prone to yielding non-reproducible results. Interestingly, there were only 30 cardiovascular deaths and only 10 deaths due to heart failure in the trial, even though the median follow-up was four years. These low event rates are incompatible with the diagnosis of heart failure.

When the number of deaths in a trial is sparse, investigators typically look toward the treatment effect on hospitalizations for heart failure. However, in the CABANA trial, catheter ablation did not reduce the risk of these non-fatal serious adverse heart failure events, with a hazard ratio of 0.89 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.56 to 1.44.

### When the chief complaint is (or should be) dyspnea in adults [^111Yskpe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Dyspnea, "a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", is an important and challenging complaint associated with a wide variety of adverse clinical outcomes, including hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac mortality. Although up to 85% of cases are caused by asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, or psychogenic disorders, a systematic approach can help to identify uncommon but important causes of dyspnea.

This review includes clinical examples and a didactic review of currently available information. We suggest a step-wise approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with dyspnea. It is also important to avoid three possible pitfalls: accepting a cause for dyspnea when the element identified is only part of a syndrome that includes that element; accepting a single cause for dyspnea when the cause is multifactorial; and failing to recognize when a diagnosis and cause of dyspnea is incorrect and has been assumed without rigorous confirmation, especially when a patient with a specific diagnosis is referred for "failing to respond to treatment".

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to acute decompensated heart failure [^115r4ugS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Heart failure afflicts a large number of patients and is the leading cause of hospitalizations in the United States. Diagnosis and management of decompensated heart failure present a clinical challenge, requiring complex decision-making. History and physical examination findings are important in diagnosing heart failure. Diagnostically, B-type natriuretic peptide levels appear very useful in distinguishing cardiac from non-cardiac causes of dyspnea and provide information about the severity and prognosis of heart failure. Immediate management goals include improving symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. Diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents are useful in the acute setting. This article provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and managing acute decompensated heart failure.

- **Warning: congestive heart failure**: Thiazolidinediones, including Actos, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. After the initiation of Actos, and following dose increases, patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure, such as excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to standard care practices, and discontinuation or dose reduction of Actos must be considered. Actos is not recommended for patients with symptomatic heart failure. The initiation of Actos in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### A review of dyspnea in acute heart failure syndromes [^116exsoz]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

In acute heart failure syndrome (AHFS), dyspnea is one of the most common but least understood presenting symptoms for hospitalization. For this reason, dyspnea relief is increasingly becoming a focus in the development of therapies for the treatment of AHFS and currently stands as an acceptable primary endpoint for regulatory approval by governmental agencies. This raises the question of how best to measure such a subjective symptom. In this review, we will describe the basis for dyspnea, provide a detailed description of the strengths and weaknesses of the tools used to measure it, and describe future directions for the development of dyspnea measurement in AHFS.

### Relation of dyspnea in patients unable to perform exercise stress testing to outcome and myocardial ischemia [^1165xxVV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Limited information exists regarding the significance of dyspnea in patients who are unable to exercise and the contribution of myocardial ischemia to this symptom. To assess this, we evaluated results of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and the long-term outcomes of patients with dyspnea referred for DSE. We studied 6,376 consecutive patients who were unable to perform an exercise test and were referred for DSE. Patients were classified according to presenting symptoms and followed for an average of 5.5 ± 2.8 years. The end points were cardiac ischemic events (myocardial infarction or revascularization), hospitalization for heart failure (HF), and death.

The dobutamine stress echocardiogram was positive for ischemia in 19% of patients with dyspnea versus 24% (p = 0.002) of those with typical angina and 17% (p = 0.2) of asymptomatic patients. In multivariate analysis, the risk of death was increased in dyspneic patients versus asymptomatic patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, p = 0.02) and patients with chest pain (HR 1.20, p < 0.001). Hospitalization for HF occurred more often in patients with dyspnea (HR 1.26, p = 0.05 vs. asymptomatic; HR 1.24, p = 0.06 vs. chest pain), especially in the subset without previous HF (HR 1.45, p = 0.006 vs. chest pain). The risk of cardiac ischemic events in patients with dyspnea was similar compared to asymptomatic patients (HR 0.92, p = 0.39) and decreased compared to patients with chest pain (HR 0.70, p < 0.001).

In conclusion, in patients referred for DSE, dyspnea was associated with a poor outcome. This increased hazard seems not to be linked to myocardial ischemia but instead may be related to other underlying conditions.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dyspnea-suspected cardiac origin (ischemia already excluded): 2021 update [^115sXryv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is the symptom of perceived breathing discomfort and is commonly encountered in a variety of clinical settings. Cardiac etiologies of dyspnea are important considerations. Among these, valvular heart disease (Variant 1), arrhythmia (Variant 2), and pericardial disease (Variant 3) are reviewed in this document. Imaging plays a crucial role in the clinical assessment of these suspected abnormalities with usually appropriate procedures. These include resting transthoracic echocardiography in all three variants, radiography for Variants 1 and 3, MRI heart function and morphology in Variants 2 and 3, and CT heart function and morphology with intravenous contrast for Variant 3.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Cut-off values of B-type natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of congestive heart failure in patients with dyspnoea visiting emergency departments: a study on Korean patients visiting emergency departments [^1119ABWY]. Emergency medicine journal (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the optimal cut-off values of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for the diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) in 1040 Korean patients with dyspnoea visiting emergency departments.

Methods

BNP values were measured for 662 patients without CHF to examine whether significant relationships existed between the BNP values and age, gender or underlying disease. In 378 patients with CHF, a similar analysis was performed in addition to the examination of the relationship between the mean BNP values and CHF severity.

Results

The optimal threshold for the detection of heart failure was a BNP concentration of 296.5 pg/mL, regardless of age, sex and underlying disease among the Korean study population. In the non-CHF patients, women showed significantly higher mean BNP values than did men. Further, in these patients, the mean BNP values of men with underlying disease (hypertension, angina pectoris, chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and those with at least two underlying diseases, one of which was hypertension, was higher than those without underlying disease, whereas no difference was observed between women with and without underlying disease. Based on the New York Heart Association classification, echocardiography findings and mortality rate of the CHF patients, the BNP value was found to be related to both the severity of heart failure and its prognosis.

Conclusions

The BNP concentration used for the diagnosis of CHF in Korean people is considerably higher than the normal cut-off value of 100 pg/mL. In the non-CHF patient

### Utility of a rapid B-natriuretic peptide assay in differentiating congestive heart failure from lung disease in patients presenting with dyspnea [^113D2TeS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Since B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted by the left ventricle (LV) in response to elevated LV pressure, we sought to assess whether a rapid assay for BNP levels could differentiate cardiac from pulmonary causes of dyspnea.

Differentiating congestive heart failure (CHF) from pulmonary causes of dyspnea is very important for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea.

B-natriuretic peptide levels were obtained in 321 patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnea. Physicians were blinded to BNP levels and asked to give their probability of the patient having CHF and their final diagnosis. Two independent cardiologists were blinded to BNP levels and asked to review the data and evaluate which patients presented with heart failure. Patients with right heart failure from cor pulmonale were classified as having CHF.

Patients with CHF (n = 134) had BNP levels of 758.5 ± 798 pg/ml, significantly higher than the group of patients with a final diagnosis of pulmonary disease (n = 85) whose BNP was 61 ± 10 pg/ml. The area under the receiver operating curve, which plots sensitivity versus specificity for BNP levels in separating cardiac from pulmonary disease, was 0.96 (p < 0.001). A breakdown of patients with pulmonary disease revealed: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): 54 ± 71 pg/ml (n = 42); asthma: 27 ± 40 pg/ml (n = 11); acute bronchitis: 44 ± 112 pg/ml (n = 14); pneumonia: 55 ± 76 pg/ml (n = 8); tuberculosis: 93 ± 54 pg/ml (n = 2); lung cancer: 120 ± 120 pg/ml.

### Comparative value of Doppler echocardiography and B-type natriuretic peptide assay in the etiologic diagnosis of acute dyspnea [^113zNUp5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

We compared the accuracy of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) assay with Doppler echocardiography for the diagnosis of decompensated congestive left-heart failure (CHF) in patients with acute dyspnea. Both BNP and Doppler echocardiography have been described as relevant diagnostic tests for heart failure.

One hundred sixty-three consecutive patients with severe dyspnea underwent BNP assay and Doppler echocardiogram on admission. The accuracy of the two methods for etiologic diagnosis was compared on the basis of the final diagnoses established by physicians who were blinded to the BNP and Doppler findings.

The final etiologic diagnosis was CHF in 115 patients. Twenty-four patients (15%) were misdiagnosed at admission. The BNP concentration was 1,022 ± 742 pg/ml in the CHF subgroup and 187 ± 158 pg/ml in the other patients (p < 0.01). A BNP cutoff of 300 pg/ml correctly classified 88% of the patients (odds ratio [OR] 85 [19 to 376], p < 0.0001), but a high negative predictive value (90%) was only obtained when the cutoff was lowered to 80 pg/ml. The etiologic value of BNP was low in patients with values between 80 and 300 pg/ml (OR 1.85 [0.4 to 7.8], p = 0.4) and also in patients who were studied very soon after onset of acute dyspnea. Among the 138 patients with assessable Doppler findings, a "restrictive" mitral inflow pattern had a diagnostic accuracy for CHF of 91% (OR 482 [77 to 3,011], p < 0.0001), regardless of the BNP level.

Bedside BNP measurement and Doppler echocardiography are both useful for establishing a diagnosis.

### Deliberating the diagnostic dilemma of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116XVQsN]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

There is a lack of consensus on how we define heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with broad variation in diagnostic criteria across society guidelines. This lack of uniformity in disease definition stems in part from an incomplete understanding of disease pathobiology, phenotypic heterogeneity, and natural history. We review knowledge gaps and existing diagnostic tools and algorithms.

- **Simple approach implementation**: We present a simple approach to implement these tools within the constraints of the knowledge base, addressing separately (1) hospitalized individuals with rest congestion, where diagnosis is more straightforward; and (2) individuals with exercise intolerance, where diagnosis is more complex. Here, a potential role for advanced or provocative testing, including evaluation of hemodynamic responses to exercise, is considered.

- **Focus areas for future studies**: More importantly, we propose focus areas for future studies to develop accurate and feasible diagnostic tools for HFpEF, including animal models that recapitulate human HFpEF, and human studies that both address a fundamental understanding of HFpEF pathobiology and new diagnostic approaches and tools.

In sum, there is an urgent need to more accurately define the syndrome of HFpEF to inform diagnosis, patient selection for clinical trials, and, ultimately, future therapeutic approaches.

### Silent disease progression in clinically stable heart failure [^111K7cKx]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with heart failure (HF) are often considered clinically stable if they are receiving treatment and show no physical signs and symptoms suggestive of worsening cardiac function. However, a lack of clinically observable signs and symptoms of worsening HF may not always be indicative of a patient's long-term prognosis. Although currently available therapies for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) can be used to minimize clinical symptoms, most do little to correct the underlying pathology responsible for progressive cardiac dysfunction.

Recent studies have shown that most patients with clinically stable HFrEF have chronic low-level elevations in plasma troponin, a marker for myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte loss that is associated with neurohormonal activation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell wall stretch. HF is thus a progressive disorder, and ongoing cardiac structural and functional deterioration is present in many patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.

- **Silent progression**: Once left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is established, it can worsen over the course of months or years without any clinically apparent symptoms; thus, progressive yet silent worsening of the HF state often remains unrecognized and, consequently, may be left undertreated.

Despite their apparent clinical stability, these patients remain at high risk of adverse outcomes. Sudden cardiac death, for example, is most common in patients with mild or moderate HF symptoms who could be considered 'clinically stable'. Furthermore, in patients with HFrEF, gradual functional and structural deterioration continues unnoticed.

Inform patients about the potential adverse effects of Oseni, including:

- **Congestive heart failure**: Educate patients on the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Instruct those experiencing an unusually rapid increase in weight, edema, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of heart failure while using Oseni to immediately report these symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Pancreatitis**: Notify patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported with Oseni use. Teach patients that persistent, severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and possibly accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue Oseni and contact their healthcare provider if they experience persistent severe abdominal pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Inform patients that allergic reactions have been reported with Oseni. Advise patients to discontinue Oseni and seek medical advice promptly if they experience symptoms such as skin rash, hives, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, which may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Hepatic effects**: Advise patients to stop taking Oseni and seek immediate medical advice if they experience signs or symptoms of liver injury, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or dark urine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Edema**: Inform patients that Oseni can lead to new-onset or worsening edema. Instruct them to immediately report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Acute heart failure syndromes [^112pRCpt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heart failure resulting in hospitalization represents a significant and growing health care burden. Heterogeneity characterizes this group in terms of mode of presentation, pathophysiology, and prognosis. The vast majority of patients symptomatically improve during hospitalization; however, their early post-discharge rehospitalization and mortality rates continue to be high. Worsening signs and symptoms, neurohormonal and renal abnormalities occurring soon after discharge may contribute to these high post-discharge event rates. Currently available assessment modalities combined with recent advances in cardiovascular therapies provide present-day opportunities to improve post-discharge outcomes. Further investigation into pathophysiologic targets and novel approaches to clinical trial design are needed. Improving post-discharge outcomes is the single most important goal in the management of acute heart failure syndromes.

### A prediction rule to identify low-risk patients with heart failure [^115MTHrY]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To derive a prediction rule using data available in the emergency department (ED), researchers aimed to identify a group of patients hospitalized for the treatment of heart failure who are at low risk of death and serious complications.

The authors analyzed data for all 33,533 patients with a primary hospital discharge diagnosis of heart failure in 1999 who were admitted from EDs in Pennsylvania. Candidate predictors included demographic and medical history variables and the most abnormal examination or diagnostic test values measured in the ED (vital signs only) or on the first day of hospitalization. Classification trees were constructed to identify a subgroup of patients with an observed rate of death or serious medical complications before discharge of less than 2%. The tree that identified the subgroup with the lowest rate of this outcome and an inpatient mortality rate of less than 1% was chosen.

Within the entire cohort, 4.5% of patients died and 6.8% survived to hospital discharge after experiencing a serious medical complication. The prediction rule used 21 prognostic factors to classify 17.2% of patients as low risk; 19 patients (0.3%) died, and 59 (1.0%) survived to hospital discharge after experiencing a serious medical complication.

This clinical prediction rule identified a group of patients hospitalized from the ED for the treatment of heart failure who were at low risk of adverse inpatient outcomes. Model performance needs to be examined in a cohort of patients with an ED diagnosis of heart failure and treated as outpatients or hospitalized.

### Dyspnoea and worsening heart failure in patients with acute heart failure: Results from the Pre-RELAX-AHF study [^113vXZm1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Patients assessed their dyspnoea at baseline and then at 6, 12, and 24 hours from randomization. Assessments continued daily to Day 5 and then at Day 14, using patient-reported assessment tools, which included two main measures:

- **Absolute dyspnoea severity**: Assessed at each time point on a visual analogue scale (VAS) using a 100 mm vertical line. Patients drew a horizontal line rating their breathing, with 100 representing the "best imaginable health state" and zero "the worst imaginable health state".

- **Relative changes in dyspnoea**: Captured using a 7-point Likert scale. Patients rated their breathing as being markedly, moderately, or minimally better; no change; or minimally, moderately, or markedly worse compared to baseline.

Dyspnoea assessment was conducted with the patient lying on the bed, the head elevated to 30 degrees, legs on the bed, and oxygen withdrawn for 5 minutes. If the patient could not tolerate the position or being taken off oxygen for 5 minutes, these measures were discontinued, and the patient was asked to complete the dyspnoea assessment describing their condition at the time oxygen was withdrawn. The dyspnoea questionnaires were translated into all languages by certified translators.

After the assessment of dyspnoea, physicians performed additional daily clinical evaluations, including the assessment of orthopnoea, dyspnoea on exertion, and congestion by assessing jugular venous pressure.

### B-type natriuretic peptide and clinical judgment in emergency diagnosis of heart failure: Analysis from Breathing Not Properly (BNP) Multinational Study [^115esYdK]. Circulation (2002). High credibility.

We sought to determine the degree to which B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) adds to clinical judgment in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF).

- **Methods and results**: The Breathing Not Properly Multinational Study was a prospective diagnostic test evaluation study conducted in 7 centers. Of 1586 participants who presented with acute dyspnea, 1538 (97%) had clinical certainty of CHF determined by the attending physician in the emergency department. Participants underwent routine care and had BNP measured in a blinded fashion. The reference standard for CHF was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists, also blinded to BNP results. The final diagnosis was CHF in 722 (47%) participants.

	- At an 80% cutoff level of certainty of CHF, clinical judgment had a sensitivity of 49% and specificity of 96%. At 100 pg/mL, BNP had a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 73%. In determining the correct diagnosis (CHF versus no CHF), adding BNP to clinical judgment would have enhanced diagnostic accuracy from 74% to 81%. In those participants with an intermediate (21% to 79%) probability of CHF, BNP at a cutoff of 100 pg/mL correctly classified 74% of the cases. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.86 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.88), 0.90 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.91), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.94) for clinical judgment, for BNP at a cutoff of 100 pg/mL, and for the 2 in combination, respectively (P < 0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons).

- **Conclusions**: The evaluation of acute dyspnea would be improved with the addition of BNP testing to clinical judgment.

**What is already known on this topic**: The diagnosis of acute heart failure can be challenging because patients often present with non-specific symptoms. Most national and international guidelines recommend N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) testing to aid in the diagnosis of acute heart failure. NT-proBNP testing has not been universally implemented owing to concerns about diagnostic performance in clinically important patient subgroups.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in perspective [^111PtTfe]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately half of the patients with signs and symptoms of heart failure have a left ventricular ejection fraction that is not markedly abnormal. Despite the initial surprise, heightened risks for heart-failure-specific major adverse events occur across the broad range of ejection fractions, including normal. Recognition of the magnitude of the problem of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the past 20 years has spurred an explosion of clinical investigations and an increasing intensity of informative outcome trials. This article addresses the historical development of this component of the heart failure syndrome, including the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and existing and planned therapeutic studies. Looking forward, more specific phenotyping and even genotyping of subpopulations should lead to improvements in outcomes from future trials.

### Effect of body mass index on natriuretic peptide levels in patients with acute congestive heart failure: A ProBNP Investigation of Dyspnea in the Emergency Department (PRIDE) substudy [^112zE4Cz]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Obesity is associated with lower B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in healthy individuals and patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Neither the mechanism of natriuretic peptide suppression in the obese patient nor whether obesity affects natriuretic peptide levels among patients with acute CHF is known.

- **Methods**: The associations of amino-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), BNP, and body mass index (BMI) were examined in 204 subjects with acute CHF. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify factors independently related to NT-proBNP and BNP levels.

- **Results**: Across clinical strata of normal, overweight, and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) patients, median NT-proBNP and BNP levels decreased with increasing BMI (both P values ≥ 30 kg/m²). Using the standard cut point of 100 pg/mL, BNP testing was falsely negative in 20% of CHF cases in both overweight and obese patients. The assays for NT-proBNP and BNP exhibited similar overall sensitivity for the diagnosis of CHF.

- **Conclusions**: When adjusted for relevant covariates compared with normal counterparts, overweight and obese patients with acute CHF have lower circulating NT-proBNP and BNP levels, suggesting a BMI-related defect.

To derive and validate a clinical prediction rule of acute congestive heart failure obtainable in the emergency care setting, the study was designed with the following approach:

- **Design**: Derivation of the score was performed on a retrospective cohort of 927 patients admitted to our emergency department for dyspnea. The prediction model was externally validated on an independent prospective cohort of 206 patients.

- **Interventions and measures**: During the derivation phase, variables associated with acute congestive heart failure were included in a multivariate regression model. Logistic regression coefficients were used to assign scoring points to each variable. During the validation phase, every diagnosis was confirmed by an independent adjudication committee.

- **Results**: The score comprised 11 variables: age ≥ 65 years (1 point), seizure dyspnea (2 points), night outbreak (1 point), orthopnea (1 point), history of pulmonary edema (2 points), chronic pulmonary disease (-2 points), myocardial infarction (1 point), crackles (2 points), leg edema (1 point), ST-segment abnormality (1 point), atrial fibrillation/flutter (1 point) on electrocardiography. In the validation step, 30 patients (14.6%) had a low clinical probability of acute congestive heart failure (score ≤ 3), of which only 2 (6.7%) had a proven acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The prevalence of acute congestive heart failure was 58.5% in the 94 patients with an intermediate probability (score of 4–8) and 91.5% in the 82 patients (39.8%) with a high probability (score ≥ 9).

- **Conclusion**: This score of acute congestive heart failure is based on easily available and objective measures in the emergency care setting.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of heart failure [^115Y881R]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of volume overload, which may include peripheral edema and pulmonary rales. It has high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in older persons. Many conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, can cause or lead to the decompensation of chronic heart failure. Up to 40 to 50 percent of patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular function, and the overall mortality is similar to that of systolic heart failure. The initial evaluation includes a history and physical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and laboratory assessments to identify causes or precipitating factors.

- **Significant indicators**: A displaced cardiac apex, a third heart sound, and chest radiography findings of venous congestion or interstitial edema are useful in identifying heart failure. Systolic heart failure is unlikely when the Framingham criteria are not met or when B-type natriuretic peptide level is normal. Echocardiography is the diagnostic standard to confirm systolic or diastolic heart failure through assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction.

Evaluation for ischemic heart disease is warranted in patients with heart failure, especially if angina is present, given that coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure.

### Renal function, congestive heart failure, and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide measurement: Results from the ProBNP Investigation of Dyspnea in the Emergency Department (PRIDE) Study [^112Z99EG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The relationship between renal insufficiency and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels remains unclear. We examined this relationship in the context of patients who presented to the emergency department of an urban tertiary care medical center with dyspnea. Even in the presence of renal insufficiency, NT-proBNP remained a valuable tool for the diagnosis of acute congestive heart failure and provided important prognostic information.

- **Objectives**: We sought to examine the interaction between renal function and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels.

- **Background**: The effects of renal insufficiency on NT-proBNP among patients with and without acute congestive heart failure (CHF) are controversial. We examined the effects of kidney disease on NT-proBNP-based CHF diagnosis and prognosis.

- **Methods**: A total of 599 dyspneic patients with glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) as low as 14.8 ml/min were analyzed. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine covariates associated with NT-proBNP results and linear regression analysis to analyze associations between NT-proBNP and GFR. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined the sensitivity and specificity of NT-proBNP for CHF diagnosis. We also assessed 60-day mortality rates as a function of NT-proBNP concentration.

- **Results**: Glomerular filtration rates ranged from 15 ml/min/1.73 m² to 252 ml/min/1.73 m². Renal insufficiency was associated with risk factors for CHF, and patients with renal insufficiency were more likely to have CHF (all p < 0.003).

### Influence of history of heart failure on diagnostic performance and utility of B-type natriuretic peptide testing for acute dyspnea in the emergency department [^114szVzd]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a history of heart failure (HF) on emergency department (ED) B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing and the impact of feedback of BNP level to ED physicians.

- **Methods**: Admission BNP was measured in 143 patients (mean age 79 ± 10 years) presenting to the ED with dyspnea. Emergency department physicians scored the probability of HF as the cause of dyspnea and categorized the cause of dyspnea. An independent cardiologist determined the cause of dyspnea after chart review. In 83 patients, ED physicians rescored and reclassified patients after BNP measurement and evaluated test utility.

- **Results**: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for BNP diagnosis of HF as the cause of dyspnea was significantly worse in patients with a history of HF than those without (0.74 vs 0.94, P < .01) and in those with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% (0.64 vs 0.87, P < .05). A BNP cut point of 100 pg/mL had 100% sensitivity but only 41% specificity for diagnosing acute HF, whereas a cut point of 400 pg/mL had 87% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Emergency department physicians rated BNP as useful in 64% of patients, and diagnostic uncertainty was reduced from 53% to 25% (P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: B-type natriuretic peptide test performance for the diagnosis of dyspnea cause is significantly reduced in patients with a history of HF and must be taken into consideration in the evaluation of such patients in the ED.
