## Question

What causes an itchy rash on a hematoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes an itchy rash on a hematoma and how to think through the differential and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hematoma itself and the local tissue changes it produces. Then, I should verify the main pathophysiologic mechanisms that could link hematoma to pruritus, including inflammatory mediators, secondary dermatoses, drug-induced reactions, and neuropathic itch. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline a practical diagnostic approach. Finally, I will consider management strategies tailored to the likely etiologies and note red flags that warrant urgent evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: a hematoma is a localized collection of extravasated blood that disrupts normal dermal and subcutaneous architecture, alters vascular permeability, and triggers a robust inflammatory response, which sets the stage for multiple downstream cutaneous manifestations including pruritus and rash.

> I will now examine the inflammatory mediator hypothesis. Hematomas release erythrocyte breakdown products such as iron and porphyrins, and they generate cytokines and prostaglandins that can directly activate cutaneous sensory nerves and provoke itch. This is mechanistically aligned with the observation that inflammatory dermatoses like stasis dermatitis feature prominent pruritus driven by local inflammation and vascular injury, supporting the plausibility that hematoma-associated inflammation alone can cause itch even without a primary dermatosis [^notfound] [^114HHsKQ].

> Wait, let me verify the secondary dermatoses pathway. Hematomas can precipitate irritant contact dermatitis from topical agents, dressings, or repeated mechanical friction, and they can also predispose to allergic contact dermatitis when adhesives or antiseptics sensitize the compromised skin barrier; in both scenarios, pruritus is common and the rash may be eczematous or lichenified from scratching, reinforcing the need to scrutinize local exposures and secondary changes on exam [^115twhea].

> Hold on, I should consider drug-induced etiologies carefully. Anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins can cause local injection-site reactions including pruritus, urticaria, and even delayed-type hypersensitivity with erythematous, infiltrated plaques; rare entities like heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis and skin necrosis can complicate the picture, and cross-reactivity within heparinoids has been documented, so medication reconciliation and temporal correlation are critical [^111byy1q] [^112ABc1M] [^112Lfs39] [^117SfZC7].

> Let me think about neuropathic itch as a contributor. Hematomas can injure cutaneous nerves or alter local neurovascular dynamics, producing dysesthetic sensations; neuropathic pruritus is well described after nerve injury and can present with localized itch, paresthesias, or allodynia, so if the itch is persistent, burning, or dysesthetic with minimal primary skin changes, a neuropathic mechanism should be considered alongside inflammatory causes [^115LVQ6i].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis in order of likelihood. Primary inflammatory dermatitis from hematoma-associated cytokines and prostaglandins is common. Secondary irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from dressings, topicals, or friction is frequent. Drug-induced reactions, particularly to heparins, are important. Neuropathic itch from local nerve injury remains a key consideration when the skin appears relatively normal but the sensation is prominent, with systemic pruritus without rash being less likely unless there is concurrent systemic disease or medication effect [^111XYUnR] [^113paMho] [^115twhea] [^111byy1q] [^115LVQ6i].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is structured. A careful history should document the timing of hematoma formation, onset of itch, new topical exposures, dressings, and all medications, especially anticoagulants. The physical exam should distinguish primary lesions from secondary excoriations and characterize morphology. If systemic pruritus is suspected or the patient is older than 60 with generalized itch, a basic laboratory screen including CBC, liver and renal function, thyroid studies, and fasting glucose is reasonable, with additional tests guided by findings. When morphology is atypical or refractory, a punch biopsy can clarify inflammatory patterns or vasculitis, and if a drug eruption is suspected, targeted drug withdrawal and, in select cases, cautious provocation under specialist supervision may be informative [^113paMho] [^111XYUnR] [^116gWcaX] [^112QjpcV].

> Let me reconsider management implications. For inflammatory dermatitis from hematoma, topical corticosteroids and liberal emollients reduce inflammation and itch. For contact dermatitis, identify and eliminate the offending agent and use barrier restoration. For suspected drug-induced reactions, discontinue the culprit when feasible and consider alternatives. For neuropathic itch, topical capsaicin, topical anesthetics, or neuromodulators such as gabapentin may help. Throughout, trigger avoidance, gentle skin care, and oral antihistamines can be adjunctive, recognizing that many nonhistaminergic itches respond poorly to antihistamines alone [^113paMho] [^1167tfbn] [^115LVQ6i] [^1116QfuT].

> But wait, what if the rash is purpuric, necrotic, or accompanied by systemic symptoms. I should double-check for red flags suggesting vasculitis, infection, or drug-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions; rapidly progressive lesions, fever, mucosal involvement, or systemic toxicity warrant urgent evaluation and may require hospitalization, hematology input, and expedited dermatology consultation to exclude entities like vasculitis, purpura fulminans, or severe drug eruptions [^1145uzFe] [^11413nH8] [^1176aEnF].

> In summary, an itchy rash over a hematoma most commonly reflects local inflammatory mediator–driven pruritus, secondary irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from exposures or friction, drug-induced reactions particularly with heparins, or neuropathic itch from nerve injury. A focused history, detailed skin exam, selective labs, and, when needed, biopsy or drug withdrawal testing guide diagnosis, and management should be tailored to the identified mechanism while maintaining vigilance for serious systemic or drug-related complications [^111XYUnR] [^115twhea] [^111byy1q] [^115LVQ6i] [^113paMho].

---

An itchy rash over a hematoma is most often due to **local inflammation** from blood breakdown products (bilirubin, heme) irritating the skin [^115TZvuz], and **secondary dermatitis** from repeated scratching or topical treatments [^113paMho]. Less commonly, it reflects **allergic contact dermatitis** to anticoagulants, dressings, or ointments [^115twhea], or a **hypersensitivity reaction** to blood components [^113D181r]. Evaluation should include a focused history, exam, and, if needed, patch testing or biopsy [^111e5EbH]; management centers on topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, and avoiding irritants [^1167tfbn].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain the development of an itchy rash over a hematoma:

---

### Local inflammatory response

Blood breakdown products — bilirubin, heme, and iron — released during hematoma resolution can irritate the skin and provoke **itching** [^notfound]. Cytokine release from local inflammation further increases pruritus [^114FxJ2y].

---

### Secondary dermatitis

Repeated scratching or friction can cause **lichen simplex chronicus**, characterized by thickened, hyperpigmented, intensely pruritic skin [^notfound]. Topical treatments (antiseptics, analgesics, or corticosteroids) may provoke irritant or allergic contact dermatitis [^notfound].

---

### Allergic reactions

Allergic contact dermatitis may occur with anticoagulants (e.g. heparin), adhesives, or topical agents applied to the hematoma site [^115twhea]. Hypersensitivity reactions to blood components can rarely cause localized or generalized pruritic eruptions [^notfound].

---

### Infection

Secondary bacterial infection of the hematoma can cause localized inflammation, erythema, warmth, and pruritus [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** is essential to determine the underlying cause of the itchy rash:

- **History**: Onset, duration, progression, associated symptoms (pain, fever, systemic symptoms), recent trauma, surgical procedures, anticoagulant use, topical treatments, and personal or family history of allergies or skin diseases [^113F39rh].

- **Physical examination**: Appearance of the rash (morphology, distribution, secondary changes such as excoriations, lichenification), signs of infection, and characteristics of the hematoma (size, consistency, tenderness) [^113F39rh].

- **Diagnostic tests**: Patch testing for suspected allergic contact dermatitis, bacterial culture if infection is suspected, and biopsy if the diagnosis remains unclear or malignancy is a concern [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** of an itchy rash over a hematoma includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Inflammatory | - Lichen simplex chronicus <br/> - Irritant contact dermatitis <br/> - Allergic contact dermatitis [^115twhea] |
| Infectious | - Secondary bacterial infection <br/> - Cellulitis [^notfound] |
| Allergic | - Hypersensitivity reactions to blood components <br/> - Drug-induced rash (e.g. anticoagulants) [^117SfZC7] |
| Systemic | - Urticaria <br/> - Vasculitis <br/> - Paraneoplastic syndromes [^113D181r] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Reduce inflammation and pruritus in inflammatory dermatitis and lichen simplex chronicus [^notfound].

- **Antihistamines**: Oral antihistamines (particularly sedating agents) can help control pruritus, especially if allergic reactions are suspected [^notfound].

- **Avoidance of irritants**: Identify and avoid topical agents or materials causing allergic or irritant reactions [^113paMho].

- **Infection management**: Antibiotics if secondary bacterial infection is present [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Counseling on avoiding scratching, proper skin care, and recognizing signs of infection or worsening symptoms [^113paMho].

---

## Potential complications

If left untreated, an itchy rash over a hematoma may lead to **secondary bacterial infection** from scratching, chronic lichenification with persistent pruritic, thickened skin, and significant sleep disturbance and psychological distress impacting quality of life [^111XYUnR].

---

An itchy rash over a hematoma is most often due to **local inflammation** from blood breakdown products, secondary dermatitis from scratching or topical treatments, allergic reactions, or infection. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management — topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, and avoidance of irritants — are key to symptom control and complication prevention.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^113F39rh]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### Plerixafor [^113iVVgh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the randomized studies, 34% of patients with NHL or MM had mild to moderate injection site reactions at the site of subcutaneous administration of plerixafor injection. These included erythema, hematoma, hemorrhage, induration, inflammation, irritation, pain, paresthesia, pruritus, rash, swelling, and urticaria.

Mild to moderate allergic reactions were observed in less than 1% of patients within approximately 30 min after plerixafor injection administration, including one or more of the following: urticaria (n = 2), periorbital swelling (n = 2), dyspnea (n = 1) or hypoxia (n = 1). Symptoms generally responded to treatments (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, hydration or supplemental oxygen) or resolved spontaneously.

Vasovagal reactions, orthostatic hypotension, and/or syncope can occur following subcutaneous injections. In plerixafor injection oncology and healthy volunteer clinical studies, less than 1% of subjects experienced vasovagal reactions following subcutaneous administration of plerixafor injection doses ≤ 0.24 mg/kg. The majority of these events occurred within 1 hour of plerixafor injection administration. Because of the potential for these reactions, appropriate precautions should be taken.

Other adverse reactions in the randomized studies that occurred in < 5% of patients but were reported as related to plerixafor injection during HSC mobilization and apheresis included abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis, abdominal distention, dry mouth, erythema, stomach discomfort, malaise, hypoesthesia oral, constipation, dyspepsia, and musculoskeletal pain.

Hyperleukocytosis: In clinical trials, white blood cell counts of 100,000/mcL or greater were observed, on the day prior to or any day of apheresis, in 7% of patients receiving plerixafor injection and in 1% of patients receiving placebo. No complications or clinical symptoms of leukostasis were observed.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with plerixafor injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### The case of a painful blue thumb [^114TezeX]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Raynaud syndrome — Incorrect. Raynaud syndrome is the abnormal vasoconstriction of digital arteries and arterioles because of cold temperatures, emotional stress, or systemic disease. Although it may cause pain, it usually lasts for 15 to 20 minutes and is characterized by multiple discolorations (eg, white, blue, red).
B. Polyarteritis nodosa — Incorrect. Several vasculitides (eg, Takayasu arteritis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis) may result in digital purpura. However, these vasculitides are often associated with other systemic findings and do not follow a benign cyclical pattern.
C. Arterial embolism — Incorrect. Although an arterial embolus causes acute pain and discoloration, patients typically have subsequent tissue necrosis, rather than spontaneous resolution, without intervention.
D. Achenbach syndrome — Correct. This is a case of Achenbach syndrome, a rare, self-limiting condition of unknown etiology that predominantly affects middle-aged women. The syndrome is characterized by recurrent paroxysmal hematoma in the fingers, often in the left hand. Clinically, patients present with a sudden burning pain and cyanosis in 1 or more digits (usually the index or middle finger, and less commonly the thumb) that may be associated with swelling, pruritus, coldness, and restricted digit movement, followed by spontaneous resolution without treatment. In the absence of concerning history or alarm symptoms and signs (eg, fever, hypertension, nonpalpable pulses, cutaneous necrosis or ulceration), the diagnosis is established clinically and does not require further testing or procedures.
E. Traumatic hematoma — Incorrect. The patient denied history of repeated trauma or conditions that increase vascular fragility such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

### Practice gaps in pruritus [^112dGSgR]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

There are several practice gaps in the evaluation and management of itch. These gaps include a dearth of objective measures of itch, infrequent use of validated patient-reported outcomes for itch, non-evidence-based treatment, and lack of consensus about the ideal workup for generalized itch. The present article reviews these gaps and presents potential solutions.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic inducible urticaria [^115BgUGQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is defined by pruritic wheals with or without angioedema, associated with severe itch, which persist for greater than 6 weeks. Chronic urticaria can be divided into chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic inducible urticaria. Whereas chronic spontaneous urticaria has no identifiable trigger, chronic inducible urticaria can be induced by both physical and non-physical triggers.​ As many as 7–30% of chronic urticariapatients can have both types.​​ Mast cells are the core effector cells involved in the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria. When activated, they release bioactive mediators including histamine and leukotrienes that bind to histamine receptors causing vasodilation and extravasation of fluid from the blood vasculature, resulting in wheals and itch. However, the pathophysiology of chronic urticaria is much more complex, involving many mast cell surface receptors, cytokines, and cell activation pathways which are targets for many of the currently available and investigational therapies for this condition.​​ Studies have demonstrated that chronic urticaria causes a significant amount of distress and disruption to patients' daily lives that can be measured using various validated patient-reported outcomes measures.​​ In this review, we will explore the epidemiology, pathophysiology, chronic urticaria subtypes, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of chronic urticaria.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^113Maf2z]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CUTANEOUS PRURITUS: ITCH WITH NO PRIMARY PRURITIC DERMATOSIS

Itch typically arises from inflamed skin, which may be the result of allergic inflammation or infectious skin (e.g. fungal, parasitic, and viral infections). On the other hand, a certain population of patients with itch present with uninflamed or normal‐appearing skin. These skin conditions may or may not result in secondary skin changes due to scratching. This itch condition is coined "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese Dermatological Association's guideline", pruritus with no underlying dermatosis", or "generalized pruritus without rash" if itch is generalized, in the British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the investigation and management of generalized pruritus in adults without an underlying dermatosis, 2018, and "pruritus on non‐diseased skin" in a position paper of the International Forum for the Study of Itch. The Japanese guideline further categorizes cutaneous pruritus into two phenotypes: generalized cutaneous pruritus and localized cutaneous pruritus. Generalized pruritus refers to presence of itch on a wide area of the body, while localized pruritus is defined as itch fixed and localized to a specific part of the body.

Hereinafter, the term cutaneous pruritus is used to describe itch without primary pruritic dermatosis and observable primary rash.

### Diagnosis and management of neuropathic itch [^115LVQ6i]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pruritus is a challenging condition that can be caused by injury or dysfunction in any part of the nervous system. A vast array of clinical pictures exist, including both localized and generalized pruritus, and their principal entities are described in this article. Diagnosis is often difficult and depends on patient history, imaging, and neurophysiologic studies. Other causes of chronic itch should be excluded. The management of neuropathic itch is demanding and the majority of interventions are not curative. The best treatment options include anticonvulsants, topical anesthetics, and capsaicin.

### Are environmental factors for atopic eczema in Isaac phase three due to reverse Causation? [^113N3Dfz]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Material and Methods

Study

A detailed description of the ISAAC Phase Three methods can be found elsewhere, and they will be briefly summarized here. ISAAC Phase Three is a multicenter, multicountry, cross-sectional study of two age groups of schoolchildren (6–7-year-old children and 13–14-year-old adolescents) chosen from a random sample of schools in a defined geographical area. The Phase Three survey included a standardized symptom questionnaire, which obtained data on symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and AE. It also included a supplementary questionnaire that obtained data on a wide range of possible risk factors for the development of allergic disorders. Parents or guardians completed the questionnaires for 6–7-year-olds, and 13–14-year-olds answered the questionnaires themselves. Center eligibility is described in the Supplementary Materials online.

Variables

The outcome of interest, AE symptoms in the last 12 months, was defined by positive responses to the questions Has your child/have you ever had an itchy rash which was coming and going for at least six months?, Has your child/have you had this itchy rash at any time in the last 12 months?, and Has this itchy rash at any time affected any of the following places: the folds of the elbows, behind the knees, in front of the ankles, under the buttocks, or around the neck, ears or eyes?

Analyses in this article included only the key environmental variables previously each singly associated with AE in ISAAC at an individual level. Full definitions of the environmental risk factors are in Supplementary Table S5 online. Additionally, the analysis considered confounding by sex and highest level of maternal education (primary, secondary, tertiary, or missing/not stated). Finally, stratification by affluence of country was achieved using standard approaches (see the Supplementary Materials) and information on GNI.

### Dermatitis herpetiformis: an update on diagnosis and management [^112guj9N]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation, Sex, and Age at Diagnosis

Clinical Presentation

The clinical picture of DH consists of an itchy rash occurring in the favored sites of the elbows, the extensor surfaces of the forearms, the knees, and the buttocks, including the sacral area (Fig. 1). The rash is polymorphic, consisting of small blisters, papules, and erythema; however, because of the intense itch and associated scratching, erosions, crusts, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation often dominate the clinical picture. The localization of the rash is so typical for DH that the itchy rash in the predominant skin sites usually raises suspicion of DH. However, the severity of the rash varies between individuals, and a more intense rash may also affect other sites, such as the scalp, face, and upper back. The clinical picture and severity of the DH rash seem to have remained unchanged over recent decades without becoming milder or otherwise nonclassical as seen in celiac disease. The itch in DH is very prominent; in half of the patients, it is a constant finding and correlates with common sleep disturbances. Triggering factors such as taking indomethacin and inadvertent dietary iodide ingestion are known to exacerbate the rash and itching. A few cases of localized DH on the face or elsewhere on the body have been described. Acral purpura is a rare finding in DH and may be seen either with the typical rash or as the only symptom of the disease, especially in children with DH.

Dermatitis herpetiformis lesions on the a elbows and b knees: observe symmetrical distribution and erosions due to scratching. c A close-up view of a small blister. d Direct immunofluorescence finding of uninvolved skin showing pathognomonic granular immunoglobulin A deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction

The differential diagnosis of DH includes various itchy, excoriated, and blistering skin diseases. Linear IgA disease and sometimes bullous pemphigoid may clinically resemble DH, but immunofluorescence examination easily differentiates these disorders. Other itchy skin diseases, such as scabies, atopic and nummular dermatitis, lichen planus, and urticaria may also resemble DH, but the most obvious difference is the symmetrical distribution of the rash on the favored sites in DH.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^112mWfNv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of enoxaparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There have been reports of epidural or spinal hematoma formation with concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture. The majority of patients had a postoperative indwelling epidural catheter placed for analgesia or received additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs. Many of the epidural or spinal hematomas caused neurologic injury, including long-term or permanent paralysis.

Local reactions at the injection site (e.g. nodules, inflammation, oozing), systemic allergic reactions (e.g. pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including shock), vesiculobullous rash, cases of hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis, purpura, skin necrosis (occurring at either the injection site or distant from the injection site), thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] have been reported.

Cases of hyperkalemia have been reported. Most of these reports occurred in patients who also had conditions that tend toward the development of hyperkalemia (e.g., renal dysfunction, concomitant potassium-sparing drugs, administration of potassium, hematoma in body tissues). Very rare cases of hyperlipidemia have also been reported, with one case of hyperlipidemia, with marked hypertriglyceridemia, reported in a diabetic pregnant woman; causality has not been determined.

Cases of headache, hemorrhagic anemia, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury have been reported.

Osteoporosis has also been reported following long-term therapy.

### Nabumetone (nabumetone 500 mg) [^116RLUCV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INFORMATION
FOR PATIENTS

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately [see WARNINGS].
Nabumetone tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up [see WARNINGS].
Nabumetone tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Heart Failure and Edema Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians. Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur [see WARNINGS].
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help [see WARNINGS].
Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of Nabumetone and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with Nabumetone is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy].
Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS Advise patients to stop taking Nabumetone immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see WARNINGS].

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^113JbXQJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of garadacimab for preventing hereditary angioedema attacks: phase 3 open-label extension study [^112tkHYA]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Primary and secondary safety endpoints

In the primary safety analysis set (N = 159; excluding patients with HAE‐nC1INH) for the primary safety endpoint, 133 patients (84%) experienced ≥ 1 TEAE, with a total of 524 TEAEs reported (Table 2). The TEAE rate per administration was 0.23, and the TEAE rate per patient‐year was 2.84.

TABLE 2
Summary of adverse events (primary safety analysis set and overall population).

In the overall population (N = 161), the TEAE profile was consistent with results from the primary safety analysis set, with 135 patients (84%) experiencing ≥ 1 TEAE and a total of 526 TEAEs reported. Of these, 21 patients (13%) experienced a total of 52 TEAEs that were considered to be garadacimab related. No deaths were observed. One patient (1%) discontinued garadacimab due to a garadacimab‐related TEAE occurring after 4 months of treatment (injection‐site irritation in the abdomen of moderate severity, within 24 h after injection; recovered/resolved after 13 days). For most patients, the TEAEs were mild (63% of patients) or moderate (50% of patients); 6% of patients experienced severe TEAEs. Three patients (2%) experienced a total of three SAEs (COVID‐19 [two] and abdominal HAE attack [one]); none were deemed to be garadacimab related, and all recovered or resolved. There were no reports of AESIs per protocol (abnormal bleeding, thromboembolic events, severe hypersensitivity, or anaphylaxis).

The most common TEAEs were COVID‐19 (n = 58; 36%), nasopharyngitis (27; 17%), injection‐site reactions (ISRs; 19; 12%), influenza (11; 7%), headaches (10; 6%), and upper respiratory tract infections (9; 6%). Of the 19 patients with ISRs, there were 43 events, including injection‐site erythema, pruritus, urticaria, bruising, hematoma, and irritation; most were mild (41, 95%) and the remaining two were moderate in severity. ISRs were the most common garadacimab‐related TEAE (36/52 events, 69%).

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^11413nH8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic [^113D181r]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^115UbUbw]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFRI-induced pruritus — epidemiology, mechanisms, and evidence base are summarized as follows. "Pruritus occurs in approximately half of all EGFRI-treated patients", and although it "rarely requires dose modifications or discontinuation of drug therapy", it "can have dramatic impact upon the patient's HQOL". "Because itching can also occur as a consequence of dry skin, it is important to ensure adequate measures are provided to prevent dryness (see the "Xerosis and fissures" section)". "Currently, the mechanism of action behind pruritus induced by EGFRIs is not clearly elucidated". Mechanistic context notes that "Histamine, which is released by mast cells in persons with urticaria, is classically associated with pruritus" and "It is unknown whether other neurotransmitters or receptors (including serotonin, opioids, and gamma-aminobutyric acid) explain the pruritus that is experienced by patients treated with EGFRIs". Regarding evidence, "In the literature, no clinical studies are designed to study specific primary endpoints to evaluate the most optimal therapy for EGFRI-induced pruritus", so "much of the data originated from case series as well as case reports", and "Table 6 displays the recommendations for the treatment of pruritus".

### Recurrent painful ecchymosis in an adolescent female [^1145uzFe]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical vignette

A 16-year-old girl presented to clinic with a 2-month history of painful, waxing and waning unilateral erythematous ecchymotic patches on the right lower extremity (Fig 1). She was otherwise healthy and of normal affect, and she denied any history of trauma to the area. She also denied any psychiatric disturbance or history. Two punch biopsies were obtained that both showed a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Topical corticosteroids were of limited help, and the lesions spontaneously resolved within 1 week (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Psychogenic purpura (PP)
B. Urticarial vasculitis
C. Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP)
D. Livedo reticularis
E. Livedo vasculopathy

Answers:
A. PP – Correct. PP, also known as Gardner-Diamond syndrome or autoerythrocyte sensitization, is a rare syndrome of recurrent painful spontaneous ecchymosis that can be associated with a prodromal phase of itch, pain, and warmth at the site of ecchymosis.
B. Urticarial vasculitis – Incorrect. Urticarial vasculitis is characterized by wheals lasting more than 24 hours accompanied with burning and pain. Wheals can resolve with hyperpigmentation or ecchymosis. However, lesions are typically bilateral and symmetrical.
C. TTP – Incorrect. TTP presents as a pentad of renal failure, fever, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic symptoms. Petechial and purpuric lesions are common cutaneous manifestations.
D. Livedo reticularis – Incorrect. Livedo reticularis classically presents on the lower extremities as a violaceous-erythematous and reticulated pattern caused by slow venous flow. It commonly presents as a physiologic response to cold temperatures but can be secondarily caused by a luminal obstruction or systemic disease.
E. Livedo vasculopathy – Incorrect. Livedo vasculopathy is associated with hypercoagulability and presents as tender, punched out ulcers on a background of livedo reticularis on the lower extremities. Involved areas heal with stellate white atrophic scarring, telangiectasias, and hemosiderin deposition known as atrophie blanche.

### The rash that becomes an erythroderma [^117TVTNh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency with potentially serious consequences. Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data. The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of underlying disease.

### A rapidly fluctuating rash in a stuporous patient [^115fYjqh]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rapidly fluctuating blotchy patches that appear then disappear in a matter of seconds to a minute are a striking clinical presentation that is not well documented in the dermatologic literature. A broader literature review found descriptions of six patients with similar cutaneous findings. Five patients (between 9 and 15 years of age) had an acute elevation in intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus, head trauma, or intraventricular hemorrhage; the sixth patient was a 42-year-old man with head trauma. The cutaneous findings described in all six cases were attributed to an unclear mechanism linking the CNS pathology to the rapidly fluctuating rash.

We propose CNS-driven autonomic neurovascular dysregulation of arteriolar sphincters as the underlying mechanism leading to the rapidly fluctuating erythema. The distribution of dermal arterioles that control ascending umbrella-like cascades of capillaries would explain the observed pattern. Drawing attention to this rather unique clinical presentation and its association with underlying CNS abnormalities beyond head trauma and elevated intracranial pressure should prove useful to dermatologists asked to evaluate such patients.

Cutaneous toxicities — rash or inflammatory dermatitis grading and management (G1–G2): G1 is "Rash covering < 10% BSA, which may or may not be associated with symptoms of pruritus or tenderness", managed by "Continue ICPI", "Treat with topical emollients and/or mild-moderate potency topical corticosteroids", and "Counsel patients to avoid skin irritants". G2 is "Rash covering 10%-30% BSA with or without symptoms (eg, pruritus, burning, and tightness); limiting instrumental ADL; rash covering > 30% BSA with or without mild symptoms", and management states "Consider holding ICPI and monitor weekly for improvement. If skin toxicity is not improved after 4 weeks, then regrade toxicity as grade 3", add topical emollients, oral antihistamines, and medium-to-high potency topical corticosteroids, and "Consider initiating prednisone (or equivalent) at dosing 0.5–1 mg/kg, tapering over 4 weeks", with topical anti-itch remedies for pruritus without rash.

4. **Severe allergic reactions**:

trouble breathing
swelling of the face, tongue, eyes or mouth
rash, itchy welts (hives) or blisters, alone or with fever or joint pain

5. **Abnormal bleeding**: Citalopram tablets and other antidepressant medicines may increase your risk of bleeding or bruising, especially if you take the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin®, Jantoven®), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs, like ibuprofen or naproxen), or aspirin.

6. Seizures or convulsions

7. **Manic episodes**:

greatly increased energy
severe trouble sleeping
racing thoughts
reckless behavior
unusually grand ideas
excessive happiness or irritability
talking more or faster than usual

8. Changes in appetite or weight. Children and adolescents should have height and weight monitored during treatment.

9. Low salt (sodium) levels in the blood. Elderly people may be at greater risk for this. Symptoms may include:

headache
weakness or feeling unsteady
confusion, problems concentrating or thinking or memory problems

10. Visual problems

eye pain
changes in vision
swelling or redness in or around the eye

Only some people are at risk for these problems. You may want to undergo an eye examination to see if you are at risk and receive preventative treatment if you are.

### Unilateral bulge after dermatomal rash [^111Q6MhF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case

A 66-year-old male presented with a unilateral flank bulge (Fig 1) for the past 2 weeks in the area of a resolving dermatomal rash after taking valacyclovir 1g three times a day for 7 days. The patient is a martial arts expert. There was loss of sensation overlying the soft, nontender bulge but patient denied fevers, chills, or abdominal pain. Ultrasound was performed and did not show tumor or herniation. A computed tomography scan was ordered but the patient did not receive the test because the nodule was resolving over the next 4 weeks.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Hernia
B. Pseudohernia
C. Lipoma
D. Anetoderma
E. Hematoma

Answers:
A. Hernia – Incorrect. Hernia is the most dangerous entity to rule out in this patient which is the reason for images. Other bedside tests such as auscultation can be done.
B. Pseudohernia – Correct. This complication occurs in 3% to 5% of patients with herpes zoster with a mean time of onset of skin eruption to pseudohernia is 3.5 weeks. It occurs because the inflammation of the nerve is superimposed on a previous pre-existing condition involving a strain on the innervated abdominal musculature such as distention from constipation or strain from excessive abdominal exercises.
C. Lipoma – Incorrect. While this is certainly in the differential, an ultrasound could be able to characterize this lesion and for a lipoma to appear so rapidly is very rare.
D. Anetoderma – Incorrect. This can present as an asymptomatic bulge after an inflammatory insult; however, these lesions do not resolve over time.
E. Hematoma – Incorrect. These subcutaneous nodules are often much smaller and classically painful. These lesions usually grow over a span of months, not weeks.

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^115TZvuz]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

SD represents the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux and most commonly occurs in the lower extremities of elderly individuals. Cutaneous changes associated with SD are driven by inflammation. The typical clinical presentation involves erythematous and eczematous patches and plaques. Itch is one of the most troublesome symptoms and often leads to scratching that can aggravate wounds and increase the risk of skin infection. SD may also progress to chronic venous ulcerations with oozing and erythema. Accordingly, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to preventing serious complications. However, diagnosis is challenging due to the resemblance of SD to other skin conditions. The cornerstone of treatment includes compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, together with topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes and associated signs and symptoms. No treatments are currently approved for alleviating the symptoms associated with SD; new therapeutic approaches that target inflammation in SD are thereby needed.

### Innovative management of pruritus [^112K3ULj]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Pruritus remains a significant problem facing dermatologists and can be associated with various dermatoses and systemic derangements. At times, one can treat the underlying cutaneous or systemic process to alleviate itch. However, it is frequently challenging to identify the cause of a patient's itch and, in this situation, even more difficult to manage the symptom effectively. In this article, the authors discuss the approach to a patient with generalized pruritus without clinically obvious dermatoses. They also addresses mechanisms and management modalities of itch in common systemic diseases, including cholestasis, uremia, and neuropathic dysfunction.

### Superimposed lateralized exanthem of childhood: report of a case related to adenovirus infection [^114Ww1qn]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

A 6-year-old boy developed a unilateral itchy rash, which was followed by a less severe bilateral involvement. The lesions resolved spontaneously within 4 weeks. Apparently, the rash was triggered by an adenovirus infection of the respiratory tract. Terms used currently for this disorder include 'unilateral laterothoracic exanthem' or 'asymmetrical periflexural exanthem of childhood'. The recently proposed term 'superimposed lateralized exanthem of childhood' implies the new concept that an early postzygotic mutation has rendered the skin on one side of the body more reactive to infective agents. The subsequent bilateral involvement would reflect a less severe reactivity of the contralateral keratinocytes.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^115dNzcg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Plerixafor (Mozobil) [^114C7mnY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the randomized studies, 34% of patients with NHL or MM had mild to moderate injection site reactions at the site of subcutaneous administration of Mozobil. These included erythema, hematoma, hemorrhage, induration, inflammation, irritation, pain, paresthesia, pruritus, rash, swelling, and urticaria.

Mild to moderate allergic reactions were observed in less than 1% of patients within approximately 30 min after Mozobil administration, including one or more of the following: urticaria (n = 2), periorbital swelling (n = 2), dyspnea (n = 1) or hypoxia (n = 1). Symptoms generally responded to treatments (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, hydration or supplemental oxygen) or resolved spontaneously.

Vasovagal reactions, orthostatic hypotension, and/or syncope can occur following subcutaneous injections. In Mozobil oncology and healthy volunteer clinical studies, less than 1% of subjects experienced vasovagal reactions following subcutaneous administration of Mozobil doses ≤ 0.24 mg/kg. The majority of these events occurred within 1 hour of Mozobil administration. Because of the potential for these reactions, appropriate precautions should be taken.

Other adverse reactions in the randomized studies that occurred in < 5% of patients but were reported as related to Mozobil during HSC mobilization and apheresis included abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis, abdominal distention, dry mouth, erythema, stomach discomfort, malaise, hypoesthesia oral, constipation, dyspepsia, and musculoskeletal pain.

Hyperleukocytosis: In clinical trials, white blood cell counts of 100,000/mcL or greater were observed, on the day prior to or any day of apheresis, in 7% of patients receiving Mozobil and in 1% of patients receiving placebo. No complications or clinical symptoms of leukostasis were observed.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with Mozobil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Blood and Lymphatic System: Splenomegaly and splenic rupture

Immune System Disorders: Anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock

Psychiatric Disorders: Abnormal dreams and nightmares

### Unilateral gustatory facial flushing in a child [^1129RqeL]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 2-year old boy presented with episodic right-sided facial flushing occurring immediately after eating. He had a history of an ipsilateral facial hematoma following forceps delivery which had healed without scarring. The flushing was first noted after the introduction of solid foods at 6 months of age. During mastication, right-sided linear erythema and warmth develops in the skin overlying the distribution of the auriculotemporal nerve (Fig 1), lasting approximately 1 hour. It occurs with all food-types and is not associated with sweating, pain, or pruritis. He is otherwise well with no developmental concerns.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Harlequin syndrome
B. Mastocytosis
C. Frey syndrome
D. Food allergy
E. Trigeminal neuralgia

Answers:
A. Harlequin syndrome – Incorrect. Harlequin syndrome is hemi-facial flushing and hyperhidrosis which results from direct injury to the sympathetic fibers of the face. Symptoms are usually triggered by heat, exercise or strong emotions.
B. Mastocytosis – Incorrect. Mastocytosis is a rare condition of uncontrolled mast cell proliferation, with the clinical presentation ranging from maculopapular skin rash to anaphylactic-like reactions.
C. Frey syndrome – Correct. Frey syndrome (Auriculotemporal nerve syndrome) is a rare condition that usually results from direct injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, leading to gustatory flushing and/ or hyperhidrosis. It occurs due to aberrant regeneration of postganglionic parasympathetic neurons to the adjacent sweat glands and cutaneous blood vessels following injury. Frey syndrome is most commonly seen in adults, particularly following parotid surgery. In infants, Frey syndrome can occur following traumatic instrumental delivery, though familial cases have also been reported. Infantile Frey syndrome tends to present with gustatory flushing rather than hyperhidrosis.
D. Food allergy – Incorrect. There are a few key features in this case that are inconsistent with the typical presentation of food allergy. Those include absence of a specific food trigger, as symptoms occur with all food types, absence of IgE-mediated systemic symptoms, and the spontaneous resolution of symptoms. Frey syndrome can often be falsely attributed to food allergy.
E. Trigeminal neuralgia – Incorrect. While trigeminal neuralgia may cause unilateral flushing, it more commonly presents with episodic neuropathic pain that is triggered by physical contact. Absence of facial pain in this case makes the diagnosis less likely.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^11422N3j]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

### Pruritus as a sign of systemic disease [^114FxJ2y]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pruritus, as one of the most common clinical manifestations in medicine, has been recognized for many centuries. Defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in the need to scratch, it is divided into acute and chronic stages, based on the duration of the clinical manifestation. Classically, pruritus is associated with cutaneous disorders; however, it may also accompany various systemic disorders, including renal, hepatic, hematologic, or oncologic, and be the first or solitary manifestation of an underlying systemic disease. Additionally, the clinical manifestation may occur as an adverse reaction to drug administration. The pathogenesis of itch is multifactorial, involving various neuromediators and cytokines, with a prominent role of peripheral and central nervous system in its development. Based on an underlying disorder, the affected patients present different clinical patterns of pruritus. Diagnostic approach is based on detailed history taking and physical examination. Frequently, additional diagnostic measures, including laboratory or imaging tests, are performed, especially when the cause of pruritus is unknown. Pruritus remains a challenging clinical manifestation with a significant importance for physicians managing systemic disorders.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^114gT6rK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^113tgzq7]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

AIUM Practice Parameter — screening for general contraindications states that the appropriate medical history should be reviewed and a focused physical examination performed to ensure that there are no contraindications to performing the procedure. Although there are no known contraindications to the appropriate use of ultrasound guidance to perform a procedure, general procedural contraindications apply, with absolute contraindications including known allergy to the injectate, lack of appropriate equipment or skill to complete the procedure, and inability of the patient to cooperate with the procedure. Relative contraindications include coagulopathy or anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, for which bleeding risk can be minimized by using Doppler ultrasound with light transducer pressure to evaluate for regional vasculature before the procedure and by using ultrasound to guide the smallest gauge needle possible toward the target structure (optimally with a single pass) while avoiding adjacent vasculature, and after the procedure, the area can be monitored with ultrasound for postprocedure bleeding and hematoma formation. Other relative contraindications include underlying medical condition that may be affected by the injectate (eg, diabetes mellitus that may be affected by corticosteroids) and local infection, rash, or skin breakdown.

### Enoxaparin sodium, isopropyl alcohol (enoxiluv kit) [^117EpKnq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of enoxaparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There have been reports of epidural or spinal hematoma formation with concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium injection and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture. The majority of patients had a postoperative indwelling epidural catheter placed for analgesia or received additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs. Many of the epidural or spinal hematomas caused neurologic injury, including long-term or permanent paralysis.

Local reactions at the injection site (e.g. nodules, inflammation, oozing), systemic allergic reactions (e.g. pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including shock), vesiculobullous rash, cases of hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis, purpura, skin necrosis (occurring at either the injection site or distant from the injection site), thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] have been reported.

Cases of hyperkalemia have been reported. Most of these reports occurred in patients who also had conditions that tend toward the development of hyperkalemia (e.g., renal dysfunction, concomitant potassium-sparing drugs, administration of potassium, hematoma in body tissues). Very rare cases of hyperlipidemia have also been reported, with one case of hyperlipidemia, with marked hypertriglyceridemia, reported in a diabetic pregnant woman; causality has not been determined.

Cases of headache, hemorrhagic anemia, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury have been reported. Osteoporosis has also been reported following long-term therapy.

### Heparin sodium injection (Heparin sodium) [^111byy1q]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases.

- Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy.

- Retroperitoneal hemorrhage

- HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)].

- Local Irritation – Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended.

- Histamine-like reactions – Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)].

- Hypersensitivity – Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)]

- Elevations of aminotransferases – Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

- Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported.

Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. (6.1)

### 2020 guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous pruritus [^1116QfuT]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms underlying itch are not fully understood. Physicians usually encounter difficulty controlling itch in generalized pruritus. Since only a small percentage of patients with generalized pruritus respond to antihistamines (H 1 receptor antagonists), a variety of itch mediators and mechanisms other than histaminergic signals are considered to be involved in itch for these non-responsive patients. In 2012, we created guidelines for generalized pruritus. Those guidelines have been updated and revised to make some of the definitions, diagnostic terms, and classifications more applicable to daily clinical practice. Cutaneous pruritus as designated in these guidelines is a disease characterized by itch without an observable rash. Generalized pruritus (without skin inflammation) is defined as the presence of itch over a wide area, and not localized to a specific part of the body. This entity includes idiopathic pruritus, pruritus in the elderly, symptomatic pruritus, pregnancy-associated pruritus, drug-induced pruritus, and psychogenic pruritus. Localized pruritus (without skin inflammation) represents fixed itch localized to a specific part of the body, and includes anogenital pruritus, scalp pruritus, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. These guidelines outline the current concepts and specify the diagnostic methods/treatments for cutaneous pruritus.

### Summertime and the patient is itchy [^114w5QYU]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 36h history of a painful, itchy maculopapular rash and associated vesicles to his arms and neck. He had no history of exposure to new chemicals or hygiene products and no significant medical history. His physiological observations were normal and systemic examination was unremarkable. On close inspection the rash was noted to be present only on areas of skin exposed while wearing a polo shirt. On further questioning it transpired that he had been gardening 12h prior to the development of the rash. A diagnosis of phytophotodermatitis was made. The patient was discharged with chlorphenamine, simple analgesia and the advice to wear a long-sleeved t-shirt and sunscreen when gardening in future. Phytophotodermatitis is a cutaneous reaction caused by contact with light-sensitising compounds found in plants and exposure to ultraviolet A radiation. It is self-limiting and can be managed symptomatically.

### Follicular eruption as a cutaneous manifestation in COVID-19 [^112rRzSo]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 50-year-old man presented to our dermatology clinic with itchy skin rash. The rash began 5 days after systemic symptoms appeared such as mild fever and mild dyspnoea. The rashes were a characteristic of follicular eruption, which started on his stomach and spread all over his body. After a thorough evaluation, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and was started on COVID-19 regimens. Skin lesions disappeared on the ninth day of treatment. Our findings contribute to the growing awareness of dermatological manifestations in patients with COVID-19.

### Itching as a systemic disease [^117CFTGo]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pruritus is a sensation that emanates from the skin and is transferred through peripheral nerve fibers to the central nervous system. It is easily understood that primary skin disorders, such as atopic eczema, skin dryness, psoriasis, and urticaria, can elicit pruritus. However, certain systemic diseases can cause chronic pruritus, which has a significant effect on the patient's quality of life. In this rostrum we provide an overview of the characteristics, pathophysiology, and mechanisms of pruritus of major systemic underlying diseases, including end-stage renal disease, cholestatic liver disease, endocrine/metabolic diseases, and hematologic/lymphoproliferative diseases.

### Sharply demarcated erythematous plaque of the bilateral thighs [^115fBG5E]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following features of the patient's presentation is most classic for this eruption?
A. Onset of rash after receiving piperacillin-tazobactam
B. Location on the extremities
C. Pruritus
D. Absence of fever
E. Leukocytosis

Answer:
A. Onset of rash after receiving piperacillin-tazobactam – Incorrect. ALEP tends to occur within 2 weeks of drug exposure and as quickly as 1 day with repeat medication exposure. The patient received piperacillin-tazobactam 13 days prior to the eruption's onset, while ampicillin was administered 3 days prior. Therefore, the most probable culprit for the patient's presentation is ampicillin.
B. Location on the extremities – Incorrect. ALEP has been reported to most frequently occur on the face, trunk, and upper limbs, in descending order.
C. Pruritus – Correct. Itching or burning sensation is a typical presenting feature of ALEP.
D. Absence of fever – Incorrect. Patients with ALEP may or may not present with fever. In a systematic review, 47.6% of patients with ALEP presented with fever.
E. Leukocytosis – Incorrect. Our patient presented without a leukocytosis, which is typical of ALEP as only 33.3% of patients may present with leukocytosis. Laboratory workup in ALEP is generally within normal limits.

### Pruritus in systemic disease: mechanisms and management [^111MxdNa]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

Pruritus is the most common symptom of skin disease. Even in the absence of primary cutaneous findings, severe and extensive pruritus often is associated with systemic disease. This review considers briefly the physiology of pruritus and discusses the various systemic diseases often accompanied by this bothersome symptom. In addition to exploring the possible mechanisms and potential therapies of itching in selected disorders, this review presents general recommendations for evaluating patients with unexplained pruritus and management guidelines for alleviating their discomfort.

### Pruritus: diagnosis and management [^113paMho]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Pruritus is the sensation of itching; it can be caused by dermatologic and systemic conditions. An exposure history may reveal symptom triggers. A thorough skin examination, including visualization of the finger webs, anogenital region, nails, and scalp, is essential. Primary skin lesions indicate diseased skin, and secondary lesions are reactive and result from skin manipulation, such as scratching. An initial evaluation for systemic causes may include a complete blood count with differential, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, liver function tests, iron studies, fasting glucose or A1C level, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Additional testing, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV screening, hepatitis serologies, and chest radiography, may also be appropriate based on the history and physical examination. In the absence of primary skin lesions, physicians should consider evaluation for malignancy in older patients with chronic generalized pruritus. General management includes trigger avoidance, liberal emollient use, limiting water exposure, and administration of oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. If the evaluation for multiple etiologies of pruritus is ambiguous, clinicians may consider psychogenic etiologies and consultation with a specialist.

### Management of acute hematomas and methods to mitigate risk [^11154Hp5]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complications in dermatologic surgery is postoperative bleeding which can result in hematoma formation and suboptimal healing outcomes. Identifying preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors can reduce the risk of bleeding complications. However, despite best risk mitigation practices, hematomas remain a possible outcome of cutaneous surgery. Expanding hematomas causing functional pain and compromise to the surrounding neurovasculature should be evacuated. The authors herein discuss the risks associated with bleeding complications, methods to manage these risks, and a protocol to follow if an acute hematoma were to occur.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Treprostinil (Remodulin) [^112HSm9W]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse Events Attributable to the Drug Delivery System

In controlled studies of Remodulin administered subcutaneously, there were no reports of infection related to the drug delivery system. There were 187 infusion system complications reported in 28% of patients (23% Remodulin, 33% placebo); 173 (93%) were pump related and 14 (7%) related to the infusion set. Eight of these patients (4 Remodulin, 4 placebo) reported non-serious adverse events resulting from infusion system complications. Adverse events resulting from problems with the delivery systems were typically related to either symptoms of excess Remodulin (e.g., nausea) or return of PAH symptoms (e.g., dyspnea). These events were generally resolved by correcting the delivery system pump or infusion set problem, such as replacing the syringe or battery, reprogramming the pump, or straightening a crimped infusion line. Adverse events resulting from problems with the delivery system did not lead to clinical instability or rapid deterioration. In addition to these adverse events due to the drug delivery system during subcutaneous administration, the following adverse events may be attributable to the IV mode of infusion including arm swelling, paresthesia, hematoma, and pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of Remodulin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The following events have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, and potential connection to Remodulin. These events are thrombophlebitis associated with peripheral intravenous infusion, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, pruritus, dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia/muscle spasm, and pain in extremity. In addition, generalized rashes, sometimes macular or papular in nature, and cellulitis have been infrequently reported.

### Differences and similarities in the mechanisms and clinical expression of bradykinin-mediated vs. mast cell-mediated angioedema [^111pbmJh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Signs and Symptoms Linked to AE Including Wheals

MCM-AE, in most affected patients, is due to urticaria. At least two thirds of urticaria patients with MCM-AE also develop recurrent wheals (hives), whereas recurrent wheals (urticarial skin rash) are not a typical feature of any BK-AE type. Therefore, as a general rule, recurrent wheals with AE indicate MCM-AE due to chronic urticaria, most commonly CSU. Neverthless, the absence of wheals does not rule out MCM-AE, as about 10% of patients with CSU, develop only AE and never have wheals. Urticaria is one of the most common dermatological diseases. Most patients experience urticaria at least once in their lives, mostly acute spontaneous urticaria, which remits within days and weeks. Patients with BK-AE are equally susceptible to contracting urticaria as the general population. This has been shown in a recent publication of Rasmussen and coworkers, where a total of 22 patients (25%) with C1-INH-HAE reported former episodes of urticaria with wheals. Therefore, the occurrence of wheals in the history or physical examination does not rule out BK-AE as a diagnosis.

Recurrent subcutaneous hemorrhage (petechiae) at sites of skin swellings occurring 1 or 2 days after the onset of the swellings was described in some FXII-HAE patients. The hemorrhages were limited to the site of the skin swelling. This phenomenon does not happen in patients with MCM-AE.

1 INTRODUCTION

Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an uncomfortable sensation that provokes an urge to scratch. It impairs the quality of life (QOL) of those experiencing itch and can be debilitating and even lethal when it becomes severe and/or chronic. Therefore, dermatologists and physicians who see patients with itch must be knowledgeable about it. This review will provide an overview of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for itch, with a particular focus on itch with no underlying primary pruritic skin disease.

### Pruritus in the elderly [^113sK21v]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pruritus is an unpleasant sensation leading to the desire to scratch. It is the most common symptom in dermatology, and various skin and systemic diseases can be associated with the presence of itching. Pruritus may also be provoked by numerous drugs. Although the exact epidemiologic data are still absent, it is generally accepted that elderly people frequently suffer from pruritus, and the problem of itching in this population remains a challenge for clinicians. The elderly often complain of numerous comorbidities that complicate the determination of the cause of pruritus, as well as its treatment. Physical and mental deprivation may complicate proper assessment of pruritus severity and negatively impair compliance with complex antipruritic therapies. Taking also into account heterogeneity of possible causes of pruritus, every patient with pruritus must be handled individually, regarding the diagnostic procedures and antipruritic therapy.

### Psychogenic pruritus and its management [^111e5EbH]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic itching can be frustrating for patients and providers, and patients are not always willing to accept that their psychiatric health has an impact on their skin. Psychogenic pruritus is defined as itch not related to dermatologic or systemic causes. When a patient presents with pruritus, regardless of the presumed cause, the standard work-up should include a thorough history, dermatologic examination, and laboratory examinations or biopsies as needed. If no medical source is found, the provider must work in partnership with the patient to explore other causes and that may include acknowledging and treating underlying psychiatric conditions.

### Understanding pruritus in systemic disease [^114PJjKT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

Many pruritic conditions do not originate in the skin, but are the result of systemic abnormality. Among the diseases that can cause pruritus are renal insufficiency, cholestasis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, polycythemia vera, solid tumors, and many others. Other pruritic conditions appear to be iatrogenic; opioid-induced pruritus may be the most important in palliative medicine. Successful treatment of the underlying condition usually relieves itch. But, with time, many diseases progress and treatment of the cause will be impossible. Topical treatments may be of limited value. Strategies involving systemic treatments include use of antidepressants, oral opioid antagonists, or cholestyramine. There is no one cure for all pruritic symptoms. Better understanding of mechanisms of pruritus may help develop better treatments.

### Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis from dalteparin [^112Lfs39]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Heparins are widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism. Several types of immunologically mediated reactions to heparins are reported, among them delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions with erythematous, infiltrated itchy plaques at injection sites. We describe a female patient, whose localized reaction from dalteparin was followed by a generalized rash presenting as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Subcutaneous provocation testing showed cross-reactions to enoxaparin, certoparin, reviparin, nadroparin, danaparoid, fondaparinux, but not to pentosan polysulfate. The danaparoid and in a lesser extent the nadroparin patch showed pustules. Within the next day, a generalized rash developed. The upper aspect of her trunk was highly affected and showed discrete pustules. Despite the fact that low molecular-weight heparins are widely prescribed, this is, to our knowledge, the first observation of a pustular drug eruption attributable to this class of substances.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115mUmpB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) initial evaluation and lesion characterization — The initial patient evaluation should be focused to determine (through history and physical examination) whether the lesions that patients describe are consistent with CU (D). Lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema, are generally pruritic, and individual lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours; painful or burning dysesthesia suggests cutaneous vasculitis, and angioedema is nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema without erythema affecting the lips, tongue, eyelids, and genitalia. The clinician should obtain objective assessments of body surface area covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial and each subsequent visit, and photographic documentation might assist in determining consistency with urticaria or angioedema. The medical work-up should be done while keeping in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases (C).

### Allergic contact dermatitis caused by glucose sensors and insulin pumps: a full review: part 1: sensors and pumps, adverse cutaneous reactions, allergens, and diabetes devices causing allergic contact dermatitis [^115twhea]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

3 CUTANEOUS SIDE EFFECTS OF DIABETES DEVICES

Diabetes devices are associated with a number of cutaneous side effects, including itch, pain, burning, bruising, erythema, oedema, bleeding, hematoma and dermatitis, the latter sometimes resulting in post‐inflammatory hyper‐ or hypopigmentation. Dermatitis may be either irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) or ACD. ICD can be elicited by chemical irritants, physical irritation due to the repetitive removal of adhesive materials, moisture accumulation under the medical device, and a reaction to the plaster itself, which causes direct cutaneous injury. The presence of ICD may promote the development of ACD by diminishing the integrity of the skin barrier, thereby increasing the presentation of allergens to the skin's immune system. The long application time of the devices, notably the sensors (6–14 days) and the presence of acrylates also favour sensitization and development of ACD. Scars, wounds, infections, lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy are side effects seen especially with insulin pumps.

### Key points… [^113swiCX]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Shingles is a painful, usually itchy, rash that develops on one side of the face or body.
- The rash consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days, clearing up within 2 to 4 weeks.
- Long-term nerve pain is the most common complication of shingles. Early symptoms People can have pain, itching, or tingling in the area where the rash will develop. This early warning sign can happen several days before the rash appears. People can also have a fever before the rash appears. Common symptoms The shingles rash most commonly appears in a single stripe around the left or right side of the body. The rash can also occur on one side of the face. The rash can be more widespread on the body and look similar to a chickenpox rash. This is very rare and usually occurs in people with weakened immune systems. In addition to the common rash, symptoms of shingles can also include:

- Fever
- Headaches
- Chills
- Upset stomach.

Testimonial "Five years later, I still take prescription medication for pain. My shingles rash quickly developed into open, oozing sores that, in only a few days, required me to be hospitalized. I could not eat, sleep, or perform even the most minor tasks. It was totally debilitating. The pain still limits my activity levels to this day. " A 63-year-old harpist unable to continue playing because of shingles. Complications Shingles can lead to serious complications. Long-term nerve pain The most common complication of shingles is long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN. PHN occurs where the shingles rash was located, even after the rash clears up. It can last for months or years after the rash goes away. PHN is extremely painful and can interfere with daily life. Other serious complications
- Shingles on the face can affect the eye and cause vision loss.
- The shingles rash can also become infected with bacteria.
- **Very rarely, shingles can also lead to**:

- Infection of the lungs
- Hearing problems
- Brain inflammation
- Death
- Infection of the lungs Who is at risk People with weakened immune systems are more likely to experience complications from shingles. They are more likely to have a severe, long-lasting rash.

### Alprostadil (Caverject impulse) [^116aY5Yi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Local Adverse Reactions: Local adverse reactions derived from 1861 patients in clinical studies of CAVERJECT, including an 18-month, open-label study, are shown in Table 1.

The following local adverse reactions were reported in < 1% of patients: injection site hemorrhage, injection site inflammation, injection site itching, injection site swelling, injection site edema, urethral bleeding, penile warmth, numbness, irritation, sensitivity, pruritus, erythema, painful erection, and abnormal ejaculation.

In these studies, no local adverse reactions were reported in the 294 patients who received placebo, except for penile pain (2%).

Penile Pain: In the majority of the cases, penile pain was rated mild or moderate in intensity. Three percent of patients discontinued treatment because of penile pain

Prolonged Erection/Priapism: Prolonged erection was defined as an erection that lasted for 4 to 6 hours; priapism was defined as an erection that lasted 6 hours or longer. In clinical studies, the frequency of prolonged erection after CAVERJECT was 4%, while the frequency of priapism was 0.4% [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Penile Hematoma/Ecchymosis: In clinical studies, the frequency of penile hematoma and ecchymosis was 3% and 2%, respectively.

Systemic Adverse Reactions: Systemic adverse reactions reported by ≥ 1% of subjects in clinical studies of CAVERJECT included: dizziness (1%).

The following systemic adverse reactions were reported in < 1% of patients: testicular pain, scrotal edema, hematuria, pelvic pain, hypotension, vasodilation, vasovagal reaction, diaphoresis, rash, and non-application site pruritus. Three patients (0.2%) discontinued due to symptomatic hypotension.

No systemic adverse reactions were reported in the 294 patients who received placebo.

6.2	Post-marketing Experience

The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post approval use of CAVERJECT IMPULSE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Injury and procedural complication: device malfunction/failure, needle breakage, drug ineffective and drug effect decreased.

### Itch: epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic workup [^111XYUnR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Itch, or pruritus, is the uncomfortable sensation underlying the desire to scratch. Itch is a very common complaint in the general population that can result from dermatologic, systemic (eg, renal, hepatobiliary, endocrine), paraneoplastic, neuropathic, and psychogenic etiologies. Chronic itch is associated with significant sleep disturbances and profoundly reduces overall quality of life. Certain populations, including elderly and African Americans, are at increased risk of experiencing heightened burden of itch. Because of the variable clinical presentation and wide-ranging etiologies, itch presents a challenge for clinicians. The initial evaluation should include a complete blood count, with differential, hepatic, renal, and thyroid function testing along with diabetes screening. Further testing should be guided by history and physical examination findings. There should be a heightened concern for underlying malignancy in individuals older than 60 years of age who have a history of liver disease and diffuse itch less than 12 months of duration. For individuals with chronic pruritus of unknown origin, increased blood eosinophils may serve as a biomarker of T helper cell type 2 polarization and response to immunomodulator therapies. In this first part of a 2-part continuing medical education series, we describe the broader epidemiology and specific conditions associated with itch and the clinical presentation and diagnostic workup for patients with itch.

### Pediatric patient presenting with bumps within scar [^117AGrRE]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

History

An 8-year-old female with no significant medical history presented with new, rapidly enlarging bumps arising within a cicatrix. The cicatrix formed after an injury 1 year prior and was unchanged until bumps began forming 2 weeks before presentation. The lesions were pruritic and drained white material. The patient's mother reported constant scratching, which led to excoriation of one of the lesions. Physical exam revealed flesh-colored, umbilicated, oozing papules localized within a cicatrix (Fig 1). Shave biopsy was obtained, and histological findings are shown (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Arthropod bite
B. Keloid
C. Molluscum contagiosum (MC)
D. Perforating dermatosis
E. Spitting suture

Answers:
A. Arthropod bite – Incorrect. Commonly present as erythematous, sometimes edematous, papules. If there is more than 1 bite, they are likely to be in a scattered distribution.
B. Keloid – Incorrect. Present as firm, rubbery nodules in an area of prior skin injury and typically develop slowly over months. In contrast to hypertrophic scars, keloidal tissue grows beyond the initial site of injury and involves the entire scar.
C. MC – Correct. MC is an acute infection caused by molluscum contagiosum virus that is transmitted via skin-skin contact. It is common in the pediatric population, with a reported prevalence between 5.1% and 11.5% in children aged 0 to 16. There is increased risk of infection in immunosuppressed patients. Typical lesions are dome-shaped, umbilicated, and white, pink, or flesh-colored papules. Lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be painful or pruritic. Histopathology classically shows epidermal hyperplasia with large intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies within keratinocytes, known as Henderson-Paterson bodies.
D. Perforating dermatosis – Incorrect. Represents a group of skin disorders characterized by pruritic follicular hyperkeratotic papules on the hair-bearing extremities of adults. Lesions are occasionally umbilicated.
E. Spitting suture – Incorrect. Represents a common complication of dermatologic surgery that typically develops 2 weeks to 3 months following closure of cutaneous defect with buried sutures. Manifest as small, erythematous papules along the surgical site, sometimes with visible or palpable threads on the surface.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.
