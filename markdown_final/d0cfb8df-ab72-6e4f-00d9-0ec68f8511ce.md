## Question

A teenager with delayed puberty due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypodontia, and brain MRI showing diffuse hypomyelination is diagnosed with 4H syndrome (POLR3-related leukodystrophy). What ICD-10 code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a teenager diagnosed with 4H syndrome, also known as POLR3-related leukodystrophy, characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a specific ICD-10-CM code for 4H syndrome or POLR3-related leukodystrophy. Then, I should verify whether the condition is classified among leukodystrophies and whether any of those codes map to this entity. Next, I will consider whether to use a generic leukodystrophy code versus a more specific code if available. Finally, I should double-check for any coding nuances or exceptions and confirm the most accurate, billable code with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its classification. 4H syndrome is a POLR3-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, with autosomal recessive inheritance due to biallelic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, or POLR3K, and it is indeed categorized among leukodystrophies in contemporary pediatric neurology references and reviews [^111tWCz1] [^116WD4fo] [^117Ebo4a].

> Wait, let me verify whether ICD-10-CM includes a dedicated code for 4H syndrome or POLR3-related leukodystrophy. I need to check the literature and coding usage patterns. Large epidemiologic studies of leukodystrophies in ICD-10-CM explicitly tracked specific entities such as metachromatic leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, and Hurler disease, but did not list a specific code for 4H syndrome or POLR3-related leukodystrophy, which strongly suggests there is no unique ICD-10-CM code for this entity in those datasets and that it would be captured under a generic leukodystrophy code rather than a disease-specific one [^1157Sx3n] [^112iPMHU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the most appropriate generic leukodystrophy code. The ICD-10-CM category for leukodystrophies includes E75.2, and within that, E75.29 is the "Other leukodystrophy" subcategory, which is the standard catch-all for leukodystrophies not otherwise specified, including POLR3-related disorders when no more specific code exists. This aligns with how other rare leukodystrophies without dedicated codes are handled in claims-based studies and coding practice [^notfound].

> I should double-check whether any adjacent codes could be mistakenly used. E75.25 corresponds to metachromatic leukodystrophy, which is a different disease entity, so using E75.25 would be incorrect for 4H syndrome. Similarly, E71.52x pertains to X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and E75.23 pertains to Krabbe disease, neither of which matches POLR3-related leukodystrophy, reinforcing that E75.29 is the correct choice when a specific POLR3 code is unavailable [^1157Sx3n] [^112iPMHU].

> But wait, what if I should code the endocrine features separately instead of using the leukodystrophy code? Let me consider that. While hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypodontia are key clinical features of 4H syndrome, ICD-10-CM coding for the underlying genetic leukodystrophy should take precedence to capture the disease etiology, with supportive diagnoses like E23.0 for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and K00.0 for anodontia/hypodontia added as secondary codes if clinically relevant for billing or documentation purposes, rather than substituting them for the primary leukodystrophy diagnosis [^notfound].

> Final answer: I should confirm that the most accurate, billable ICD-10-CM code for 4H syndrome (POLR3-related leukodystrophy) is E75.29, with optional secondary codes such as E23.0 for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and K00.0 for hypodontia to fully represent the phenotype when needed for clinical documentation and billing [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for 4H syndrome (POLR3-related leukodystrophy) is **E75.29** (Other leukodystrophy). This code captures the hypomyelinating leukodystrophy due to POLR3A/B/C variants. If additional detail is needed, use **Q87.89** for hypodontia and **E23.0** for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism as supportive diagnoses, but E75.29 should be listed first to reflect the underlying disorder [^notfound].

## ICD-10-CM code for 4H syndrome

The ICD-10-CM code for 4H syndrome is **E75.29** (Other leukodystrophy) [^notfound]. This code encompasses leukodystrophies not otherwise specified, including POLR3-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (4H syndrome). While some clinicians may consider using more specific codes for individual features (e.g. hypodontia or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the most accurate and comprehensive code for the underlying disorder is E75.29.

---

## Clinical features of 4H syndrome

4H syndrome is characterized by the following **clinical features**:

- **Hypomyelination**: Diffuse white matter hypomyelination on brain MRI, often with cerebellar atrophy and thinning of the corpus callosum [^116WD4fo] [^116gZMZd].
- **Hypodontia**: Dental abnormalities, including delayed eruption, missing teeth, and abnormal tooth shape [^116KeXMT] [^117Ebo4a].
- **Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**: Delayed or absent puberty due to impaired gonadotropin secretion [^112kcCEk] [^111cLZTn].
- **Additional features**: Short stature, myopia, cerebellar ataxia, and cognitive impairment are common [^112kcCEk] [^117Ebo4a].

---

## Genetic basis of 4H syndrome

4H syndrome is caused by **biallelic pathogenic variants** in genes encoding RNA polymerase III subunits, most commonly POLR3A, POLR3B, and POLR1C [^116WD4fo] [^115RsT1N]. These variants impair the synthesis of small non-coding RNAs, leading to disrupted myelination and the characteristic clinical phenotype [^114UpdSL].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis of 4H syndrome is based on **clinical features**, **brain MRI findings**, and **genetic testing**. MRI typically shows diffuse hypomyelination with relative sparing of certain structures (e.g. dentate nuclei, optic radiations, anterolateral thalamic nuclei, globus pallidi, and pyramidal tracts) [^116WD4fo] [^116gZMZd]. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis by identifying pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, or POLR1C [^116WD4fo] [^115RsT1N].

---

## Management and treatment

Currently, there is **no curative therapy** for 4H syndrome. Management is supportive and symptomatic, including:

- **Hormone replacement therapy**: Testosterone or estrogen/progesterone to induce puberty and maintain secondary sexual characteristics [^111AChbu] [^1144xvuh].
- **Growth hormone therapy**: Considered in patients with documented growth hormone deficiency [^114z1BKw].
- **Physical and occupational therapy**: To maintain mobility and function.
- **Dental care**: Regular dental evaluation and management of hypodontia [^notfound].
- **Regular monitoring**: Of neurological, endocrine, and ophthalmological complications [^114FnqQV].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of 4H syndrome varies depending on the severity of neurological involvement. Most patients experience **progressive neurological decline**, including motor dysfunction, ataxia, and cognitive impairment. Early-onset disease is associated with more severe outcomes, while some patients with milder phenotypes may have a slower progression [^116KeXMT] [^113nRzML].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for 4H syndrome (POLR3-related leukodystrophy) is **E75.29** (Other leukodystrophy). This code should be used for billing and documentation purposes, with additional codes for specific clinical features (e.g. hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) as needed.

Treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism remains controversial in this patient population; although there are significant benefits, there are also associated risks. One significant treatment advantage is the promotion of bone health by influencing bone remodeling. Another potential benefit is the physical appearance in a period of life where being similar to his or her peers is important. Such a factor is typically not a consideration for severely neurologically impaired children. Treating hypogonadotropic hypogonadism would allow the development of secondary sexual characteristics associated with normal pubertal development, and also induce a growth spurt, which might enhance motor difficulties and behavioral problems. Currently, little information is available in the literature regarding this treatment and its effects on this patient group. It was previously suggested that the same principles of hormone replacement therapy used in patients with other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism should be applied to patients with 4H leukodystrophy. To induce puberty, sex steroids (testosterone for boys and estrogen/progesterone for girls) are the first line of therapy for patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. If fertility induction is intended, pulsatile GnRH therapy could be tried, however, may not be effective, as some individuals with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism respond poorly to short-term stimulation. In this case, treatment with recombinant gonadotrophins could provide an alternative option. In this cohort, sex steroid treatment did not appear to be effective in all cases, however, it could not be established by what criteria response was judged, how long treatment was pursued, and/or by what dose. Collecting additional prospective data on sex hormone treatment for delayed puberty would allow better ascertainment of these situations and allow clinicians to provide further informed recommendations. In the meantime, we recommend that the decision to initiate sex steroid treatment is approached on an individual basis, while weighing the benefits (e.g. bone health) and disadvantages (e.g. rapid growth spurt with motor regression), together with the overall health of the patient (e.g. well vs. severely impaired) and only after measure of abnormal sex hormone levels confirms the diagnosis.

### Recessive mutations in POLR1C cause a leukodystrophy by impairing biogenesis of RNA polymerase III [^113vQ9zg]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our sequencing study of 18 cases with compatible clinical and/or radiological features with 4H or POLR3-related leukodystrophy identified 13 different POLR1C mutations in eight cases. POLR1C joins an emerging group of genes with dual roles in pathogenesis of human diseases, expanding the clinical phenotype associated with constitutional mutations in this gene and opening new aspects in the annotation and assessment of pathogenicity of sequence variants. Furthermore, our functional analyses on the mutational impact of POLR1C bring the first insights into the pathophysiology of POLR3-related disorders.

Growth analysis

Linear growth data were obtained for 115 patients and analyzed using Z-scores. The Z-score for all ages ranged from –4.76 to 1.70 (median, –1.48). To determine whether growth was more severely affected in participants of certain ages, median Z-scores for heights of different age groups of patients were evaluated. For each age group range, an average Z-score was calculated for each patient based on all height data if multiple records were available. Some participants are represented in multiple age groups if records were available spanning different ranges. Z-scores for ages < 5 years (n = 42), 5 to 9 years (n = 37), 10 to 14 years (n = 28), and ≥ 15 years (n = 57) were found to be –0.56, –1.86, –1.83, and –1.16, respectively. Figure 2 shows boxplots of height Z-scores for all patients and for each age group. Across age groups, patients < 5 years of age had a median Z-score closest to that of the general population (0). Additionally, the < 5 years age group had a positive Z-score for the third quartile (0.31), whereas the other age groups (5–9 years, 10–14 years, and ≥ 15 years) each had negative third quartile values (–0.89, –0.57, and –0.62, respectively). Moreover, the maximum height Z-score of the < 5 years group (3.16) corresponds to the maximum value of the entire cohort, and the minimum Z-score for the < 5 years group (–3.23) is closest to 0 when comparing minimum values between all groups. These results suggest that the < 5 year age group seems to be least affected in regard to stature. In contrast, the 5 to 9 year age group is most affected as it has the lowest values for the maximum and median Z-score values of all groups. Moreover, within the 5 to 9 year age group, the median height Z-score was –1.86 and the Z-score of the first quartile was –2.76, where more than one-quarter of these patients had short stature.

Figure 2.
Box plots for Z-scores obtained for the mean height in different age categories. The height Z-score for the general population (mean value) is considered to be 0, and the clinical definition for short stature is two standard deviations below the mean (–2).

Based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician, 57/93 patients (61%; 95% CI, 51–71%) were considered to have short stature. When analyzing the Z-scores of patients' heights, 53/115 patients (46%; 95% CI, 37–55%) had values lower than 2 SDs and thus by clinical definition had short stature. Of 115 patients, 67 (58%; 95% CI, 49–67%) were also reported to have a height > –1.5 SD below the mean. Additionally, 68% of these patients (78/115; 95% CI, 59–76%) had a height lower than 1 SD below the mean. Thus, even if some patients did not meet the criteria for the clinical definition of short stature, our cohort seems to be smaller than the general population.

Head circumference data were analyzed using Z-scores in patients aged 0 to 5 years (n = 35). The Z-scores ranged from –2.93 to 2.44 (median, –0.04). Twenty patients (20/35, 57%; 95% CI, 41–74%) presented with a head circumference within 1 SD from the mean, whereas 31 patients (31/35, 89%; 95% CI, 78–99%) were within 2 SDs from the mean. Three patients (3/35, 9%; 95% CI, 0–18%) had values lower than 2 SDs below the mean and thus by clinical definition had microcephaly. Additionally, 14% of patients (5/35; 95% CI, 3–26%) were reported to have a head circumference lower than 1.5 SDs below the mean, and 34% (12/35; 95% CI, 19–50%) had a head circumference lower than 1 SD below the mean. One patient (1/35, 3%; 95% CI, 0–8%) met the criteria for macrocephaly, with a head circumference greater than 2 SDs above the mean.

### POLR3-related leukodystrophy: a qualitative study on parents' experiences with the health care system [^116jVVUf]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

POLR3-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (POLR3-HLD) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder affecting white matter development of the central nervous system. This disorder is characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H leukodystrophy). Patients with POLR3-HLD require complex and specialized care; however, due to its rarity and limited awareness, parents often assume additional roles as experts and advocates for their child(ren). We aimed to understand parents' experiences navigating the health care landscape and to identify potential targets for improvement.

Methods

Research team members conducted semi-structured interviews with parents of patients with POLR3-HLD. Interview questions focused on the diagnostic odyssey, availability and access to care, and the perceived quality of care. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, and themes surrounding parents' health care experiences were developed.

Results

Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with an international cohort of 24 parents between March and October 2023. Four themes were developed: existing barriers in accessing care, limited knowledge in diagnosis and care, parents as experts and advocates of their child(ren)'s care, and perceived superior care by leukodystrophy specialists. Many parents expressed feeling alone and uncertain, with little guidance provided to them. They also identified perceived gaps in care and challenges faced but found comfort when treated by leukodystrophy experts in specialty clinics.

Conclusions

This study will help better inform health care providers, administrators, and policymakers to expand and improve access to quality care for patients with POLR3-HLD and their families. These conclusions may also be generalizable to other rare diseases.

### New case of 4H syndrome and a review of the literature [^11511GBf]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Different pathologic processes (especially demyelination, hypomyelination, and combinations of these) may underlie leukoencephalopathies. Leukoencephalopathies pose a particular diagnostic problem when they occur in children. To seek associated, non-neurologic signs is of fundamental importance in hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies, because these can help clarify the diagnostic picture. Two new types of leukoencephalopathy have emerged, one classified as ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination, and the other as hypomyelination with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypodontia. Initially described as distinct entities, they were recently brought together in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database under a single code. However, the literature describes only two patients with the characteristics of both these clinical pictures. We present the extended clinical and neuroradiologic follow-up of a patient with ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination, as well as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This patient reinforces the idea that the two syndromes should actually be considered the same disorder, and prompted us to conduct a critical review of the literature on disorders in which hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy is associated with cerebellar atrophy or hypogonadism.

In conclusion, with this addition to the detailed characterization of the disease phenotype, we hope for early recognition and diagnosis of individuals with POLR3-HLD, an important task for clinicians in an era where clinical trial development and advancement in gene therapy for rare neurodegenerative disorders has been booming. Detailed phenotyping of the condition also allows for further genotype–phenotype correlations and contribute to the advancement in understanding the pathophysiology underlying POLR3-HLD.

### Endocrine and growth abnormalities in 4H leukodystrophy caused by variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, and POLR1C [^114FnqQV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results do not suggest a strong genotype-phenotype correlation between patients with biallelic pathogenic variants in the different genes associated with 4H leukodystrophy and short stature. However, a significant difference was observed between genotypes when considering delayed puberty. Patients with variants in POLR3A had the highest incidence of delayed puberty, followed by those with variants in POLR3B. Although no patients in our cohort with pathogenic variants in POLR1C demonstrated delayed puberty, data on only 4 patients were available and further analysis is required before definitive conclusions are formed. Additionally, because most patients in our cohort were compound heterozygous for different variants in each gene, and variants are located across different protein domains, it is difficult to make detailed phenotype-genotype correlations between specific pathogenic variants and clinical features.

It is important to be mindful that patients with 4H leukodystrophy are at risk for endocrine abnormalities, most commonly hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and GH deficiency. Thus, the treating physicians should have a high index of suspicion when signs or clinical symptoms appear. Measurements of relevant hormone levels and stimulation tests when necessary should be made to confirm the diagnosis. Finally, the decision of whether to treat should be evaluated on an individual basis while considering the advantages and disadvantages as no definitive recommendations currently exist.

Female patients.

Delayed puberty was reported in 89% (34/38; 95% CI, 80–99%) of female patients based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician. In analyzing our cohort based on the clinical information that was available for menarche and breast development, 21/25 patients (84%; 95% CI, 70–98%) were considered to have absent, delayed, or arrested puberty. Therefore, most females in our cohort presented with abnormal puberty and differing severities of early-onset hypogonadism.

Of the female patients tested for specific hormone levels, 13/19 (68%; 95% CI, 48–89%) had low levels of estradiol. Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) stimulation tests were performed on 13 female patients, of whom 8 (62%; 95% CI, 35–88%) had abnormally low levels of both LH and FSH. In regard to sex steroid treatment, information was available for 29 patients, of whom 20 (69%) received treatment and 9 (31%) did not. Sex steroid medications induced menstruation and/or puberty in 9/20 (45%; 95% CI, 23–67%) female patients. In one patient, treatment was clearly ineffective, and in several cases, sex steroids were not well tolerated and caused adverse reactions. Of the untreated patients, 6/9 (67%) had abnormally low sex steroid levels, and of the 2/9 (22%) patients with normal levels, one had a clinical diagnosis of delayed puberty. Only 4 of 13 patients who had menarche experienced it spontaneously with no need for sex hormone treatment, at a median age of 12 years (minimum age, 11 years; maximum age, 13 years; n = 4). In patients who were treated with sex hormones, menarche occurred at a median age of 18 years (minimum age, 16 years; maximum age, 32 years; n = 9). For those who experienced treatment-induced menarche, information on spontaneous breast development was only available for 2 patients, who reached onset of breast development at ages 12 and 19 years old. Of the patients for which menarche did not yet occur, 3/4 (75%) were treated with sex hormones, one of which was only 16 years old at the time of data collection. The remaining patient who did not experience menarche had not been treated with sex hormones (1/4; 25%). Summarized results are shown in Fig. 1.

### Endocrine and growth abnormalities in 4H leukodystrophy caused by variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, and POLR1C [^114z1BKw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

When analyzing growth data according to age group, it was found that young patients < 5 years of age were least affected by abnormal growth. This finding is expected given that the typical age of disease onset is during the second year of life. Growth was most affected in children 5 to 9 years of age, followed by children 10 to 14 years of age. We initially hypothesized that growth would be most affected in patients ≥ 15 years of age because of the frequent occurrence of delayed puberty. Per the recommendations for treatment, patients with delayed puberty are not usually treated before age 14; it is therefore possible that our cohort of patients age 5 to 9 years are most affected by growth abnormalities because older patients may have received sex steroids to stimulate puberty and growth, thereby compensating for the deficit caused by this disease. Indeed, in our cohort of patients ≥ 15 years of age, 22 patients received treatment of sex steroids and/or growth hormone. These treatments may have stimulated their growth and puberty. Therefore, the growth data of 22/57 patients may have been affected by a treatment that helped in compensating their short stature. It is clear that, as a whole, patients with 4H leukodystrophy are smaller compared to the general population within each analyzed age group. Thus, growth and height data should be collected by treating physicians so that abnormalities can be clearly identified, thereby facilitating more rapid treatment interventions. If growth anomalies are observed, GH stimulation tests should be considered. In future studies, it would be interesting to systematically follow growth and perform comparisons to bone age in individual patients to identify the subgroups of patients who would benefit most from GH replacement.

When analyzing head circumference data in our cohort of patients < 5 years of age, microcephaly seems to be more prevalent (9%) compared with the general population, in which there is a prevalence of 2%. However, head circumference data were collected only for a limited number of patients. Microcephaly is typically not observed in the context of 4H leukodystrophy; only one case report describes this condition in 2 female siblings with a novel phenotype of 4H leukodystrophy with polymicrogyria and cataracts, who were also included in this study but not analyzed for head circumference because of a lack of head circumference measurements. As our results show an increased prevalence of small head size in the young age group < 5 years old, it would be interesting to further analyze additional data on head circumference to better characterize head size in 4H leukodystrophy.

Summary of endocrine abnormalities in this cohort of patients with 4H leukodystrophy, according to the available clinical information on growth and endocrine features.

Male patients.

Overall, less information was available regarding puberty of males compared to females. Based on the physician's clinical judgment, 23/36 (64%; 95% CI, 48–80%) male patients had delayed puberty. In analyzing our cohort based on the definition of delayed puberty (persistence of Tanner stage 1 for testicular growth at age 14), 6/7 (86%; 95% CI, 60–100%) were considered to have delayed puberty. Many patients lacked information on Tanner staging in adolescence and therefore could not be assessed for early pubertal abnormalities.

Of the male patients in our cohort tested for sex steroid levels, 11/14 (79%; 95% CI, 57–100%) had abnormally low testosterone levels. All patients with low testosterone also presented with delayed puberty (7/7, 100%). LHRH stimulation tests revealed abnormally low levels of LH in all patients that were tested (5/5, 100%). Information regarding sex steroid treatment was available for 23 male patients; approximately one-half of the patients (11/23; 48%) were treated, whereas 12/23 (52%) were not. Nearly all the males who received sex steroid medication were treated with testosterone (10/11, 91%), with the exception of one who was treated with chorionic gonadotropin (1/11, 9%). Treatment, however, was only effective in 5 patients (5/11; 45%; 95% CI, 16–75%), including 4 patients who received testosterone and the single patient who received chorionic gonadotropin treatment. Results are summarized in Fig. 1.

### Stress and quality of life of parents of children with POLR3-related leukodystrophy: a cross-sectional pilot study [^113nRzML]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a group of rare, hereditary disorders affecting the cerebral white matter of the brain. They primarily affect the pediatric population, running a progressively debilitating course leading to premature mortality. Altogether, they have a prevalence of 1:4733 live births. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are a subset of leukodystrophies characterized by a lack of myelin production and deposition during development, and can be diagnosed based on brain MRI findings. RNA polymerase III-related leukodystrophy (POLR3-HLD; MIM: 607694, 614381, 616494) is an autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in genes encoding subunits of RNA Polymerase III (Pol III); POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, POLR3D, and POLR3K. Pol III is an essential enzyme responsible for the synthesis of small noncoding RNAs, the majority of which are crucial for transcriptional control, RNA processing, ribosomal assembly, and protein translation.

POLR3-related leukodystrophy, also known colloquially as 4H leukodystrophy because of its characteristic clinical features of hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, typically presents during childhood with delayed milestones and/or motor regression. Cerebellar features typically predominate, with progressive ataxia, dysmetria, and dysarthria, while pyramidal and extrapyramidal (ie, dystonia,) signs are usually less prominent. Cognitive involvement is common, but variable in severity, and may include learning and intellectual disabilities, behavioral abnormalities, and/or cognitive regression. Endocrine manifestations (ie, delayed/arrested/absent puberty, or short stature) and ocular anomalies (typically myopia) are often seen.POLR3-related leukodystrophy is known to range in severity, spanning from milder forms with late-onset manifestations to more severe early presentations in infants with various defined phenotypes, depending on the specific combination of mutations.,- Although disease manifestations can be variable, patients with biallelic variants in POLR3A have been associated with a more rapid disease progression compared to individuals with variants in POLR3B. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for POLR3-related leukodystrophy beyond symptom management.

### More than hypomyelination in pol-III disorder [^111BXYcA]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The 4H syndrome (hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) is a newly recognized leukodystrophy. The classical form is characterized by the association of hypomyelination, abnormal dentition, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but the recent identification of 2 genes responsible for the syndrome demonstrates that these 3 main characteristics can be variably combined among "Pol-III (polymerase III)-related leukodystrophies". The pathophysiology of this group of diseases is still to be elucidated, and there are no neuropathologic descriptions of brain tissue. We report the clinical, neuroradiologic, and neuropathologic findings of a patient affected by 4H syndrome with confirmed POLR3A mutations. We found a marked loss of oligodendrocytes, varying in severity in different brain regions, and accompanied by severe loss of myelin, moderately severe loss of axons, and patchy perivascular regions of better preserved white matter. There was relatively mild white matter astrogliosis and microgliosis. A macrophage reaction involving viable normal-appearing oligodendroglia suggests the possibility of an immunologic process in this disorder. Cortical laminar astrogliosis and mineralization of Layers I and II in particular were present. Thus, despite the uniformly hypomyelinating pattern seen on magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathologic examination reveals a complex heterogeneous leukodystrophy with prominent neuroaxonal and glial involvement in this disorder.

Discussion

We found that patients of racial/ethnic minorities, including those from black, black Hispanic, and white Hispanic backgrounds, were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with a leukodystrophy. Furthermore, we observed that leukodystrophy disease–associated allele frequencies were the same or higher in populations of Latino or African descent.

There are known examples of genetic founder effects for specific leukodystrophies in some populations. For example, there is a single historical origin of the mutation in ARSA causing MLD in patients of Arabic heritageand there is a single origin from the 19th century causing a higher rate of MLD in the western Navajo Nation. However, our observation of comparable or higher frequencies of disease gene alleles in different racial backgrounds suggests that a genetic founder effect is unlikely to account for the observed differences in diagnosis.

Strengths of this study are the use of specific ICD-10 codes to track specific leukodystrophy diseases. In the past, tracking outcomes for patients with leukodystrophies has been more difficult because ICD-9 codes have a relatively low specificity to the diagnosis of an inherited leukodystrophy, and relatively complex algorithms had to be used. With the use of ICD-10 codes for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, MLD, Krabbe disease, and Hurler disease, we were able to track and compare specific leukodystrophies, which would not have been possible using ICD-9 coding or other less specific ICD-10 codes. Finally, the use of the PHIS national database provides a more comprehensive view of trends across the United States for these relatively rare diseases.

### Cortical interneuron development is affected in 4H leukodystrophy [^112aAYqn]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leukodystrophies are genetic disorders characterized by primary brain white matter involvement. In children, leukodystrophies are often progressive and can lead to early death. Until several years ago, up to half of patients with leukodystrophies did not receive a genetic diagnosis. Since, developments in next generation sequencing techniques have led to the rapid identification of gene mutations underlying different childhood leukodystrophies, such as de novo mutations in structural genes, e.g. TUBB4A, in hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (OMIM 612438) or mutations in genes encoding proteins essential for translation, e.g. DARS (OMIM 615281) or RARS (OMIM 616140) in hypomyelinating leukodystrophies. Insights into genetic causes allowed incredible progress in diagnostics, but our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for disease pathology is still lacking.

One of the more prevalent leukodystrophies is 4H syndrome (OMIM 612440), originally characterized by hypomyelination, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypodontia. Other characteristics are cerebellar atrophy and myopia. Epilepsy has been described in some patients. Whole exome sequencing has revealed that 4H leukodystrophy is caused by abnormal RNA polymerase III (POLR3), and so far variants in genes encoding different POLR3 subunits, POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C and POLR3K, have been identified.POLR3 is responsible for the transcription of many different classes of non-protein coding (nc) RNAs, with diverse biological functions, such as transfer (t), ribosomal (r), small nuclear (sn), small nucleolar (sno) and micro (mi) RNAs. Given the variety of 4H presentations and the diverse regulatory functions of POLR3 genes, there are many potential pathways and tissue-types to research. Interestingly, some POLR3 mutations do not lead to classic brain white matter defects associated with 4H but rather show a predominant neuronal phenotype with involvement of the basal ganglia. Therefore, while 4H was originally described as a typical hypomyelinating disorder, the findings suggest that POLR3 variants could also primarily affect neuronal populations.

### A clinical approach to the diagnosis of patients with leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephelopathies [^1175wN4y]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies (LD) and genetic leukoencephalopathies (gLE) are disorders that result in white matter abnormalities in the central nervous system (CNS). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) has dramatically improved and systematized the diagnosis of LDs and gLEs, and in combination with specific clinical features, such as Addison's disease in Adrenoleukodystrophy or hypodontia in Pol-III related or 4H leukodystrophy, can often resolve a case with a minimum of testing. The diagnostic odyssey for the majority LD and gLE patients, however, remains extensive — many patients will wait nearly a decade for a definitive diagnosis and at least half will remain unresolved. The combination of MRI, careful clinical evaluation and next generation genetic sequencing holds promise for both expediting the diagnostic process and dramatically reducing the number of unresolved cases. Here we present a workflow detailing the Global Leukodystrophy Initiative (GLIA) consensus recommendations for an approach to clinical diagnosis, including salient clinical features suggesting a specific diagnosis, neuroimaging features and molecular genetic testing. We also discuss recommendations on the use of broad-spectrum next-generation sequencing in instances of ambiguous MRI or clinical findings. We conclude with a proposal for systematic trials of genome-wide agnostic testing as a first line diagnostic in LDs and gLEs given the increasing number of genes associated with these disorders.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^113EgWwp]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the global standard for coding diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. Used by providers, auditors, and researchers, ICD codes (ICD‐10‐CM) support documentation, billing, and epidemiological research. Based on ICD coding, medical claims databases (payor‐system databases) are an alternative type of electronic record collection that support collation of patient‐level de‐identified information, irrespective of the hospital or care provider. ICD‐10‐CM codes, tracked through claims databases, can be used to map high‐level information related to the medical journey across hospital systems.

In this study, we evaluate the early features of disease prior to diagnosis using a payor‐system database, specifically focusing on differences by sex and payor type (private vs. public insurance) in the time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and compare this to a natural history study which used medical records to retrospectively map medical events prior to diagnosis.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^112EFsYR]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

All retrospective approaches are influenced by biases in documentation and care. Both ethnicity and race are known to influence the determination of the severity of medical concerns, which would be indirectly reflected in the medical documentation and medical coding. The public payor status and use of claims databases are more likely to include a representative population compared to the natural history cohort. An additional limitation is that the claims databases rely on ICD‐10‐CM codes without access to medical records to allow for confirmation. As such, the data available are dependent on how the provider coded medical concerns. This affects both the diagnosis of MLD as well as disease‐specific symptoms. In particular, we are unable to verify the MLD diagnosis by standard methods (genotype, enzyme level, or sulfatides) or confirm standard definitions of disease‐related symptoms. In addition, the timepoint available for the onset of a given prodromal symptom represents the first use of the ICD‐10‐CM code within the electronic health record and may be delayed compared to when the family first had concern. For example, a child may have had strabismus for several months prior to medical evaluation or diagnosis based on access to care. If this is the case, then our study could potentially be underestimating the time from the onset of prodromal symptoms to MLD diagnosis. To this end, our cohort only captured patients diagnosed in the final year of the database (2023). Based on the range of eligible individuals within the prior years and the incidence of MLD, it is probable that approximately 20–30 patients will have been ultimately diagnosed with MLD.

Frequency (no. of unique variants) and relative proportion (percentage) of types of variants among patients with POLR3-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. Variants can have multiple type classifications; the relative proportion represents the frequency of variants of a particular gene and type divided by the total number of instances of classification for that gene.

(A) HLD is associated with 121 unique POLR3A variants in the database, of which the majority are missense variants (n = 88). The next most frequent variant types are splice (n = 16) and stop-gain (n = 12) variants.

(B) POLR3B is associated with 97 unique variants. The most frequent are missense (n = 57) followed by splice (n = 19) and stop-gain (n = 12) variants.

### Endocrine and growth abnormalities in 4H leukodystrophy caused by variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, and POLR1C [^112kcCEk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

4H or POLR3-related leukodystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder typically characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, and POLR3K. The endocrine and growth abnormalities associated with this disorder have not been thoroughly investigated to date.

Objective

To systematically characterize endocrine abnormalities of patients with 4H leukodystrophy.

Design

An international cross-sectional study was performed on 150 patients with genetically confirmed 4H leukodystrophy between 2015 and 2016. Endocrine and growth abnormalities were evaluated, and neurological and other non-neurological features were reviewed. Potential genotype/phenotype associations were also investigated.

Setting

This was a multicenter retrospective study using information collected from 3 predominant centers.

Patients

A total of 150 patients with 4H leukodystrophy and pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, or POLR1C were included.

Main Outcome Measures

Variables used to evaluate endocrine and growth abnormalities included pubertal history, hormone levels (estradiol, testosterone, stimulated LH and FSH, stimulated GH, IGF-I, prolactin, ACTH, cortisol, TSH, and T4), and height and head circumference charts.

Results

The most common endocrine abnormalities were delayed puberty (57/74; 77% overall, 64% in males, 89% in females) and short stature (57/93; 61%), when evaluated according to physician assessment. Abnormal thyroid function was reported in 22% (13/59) of patients.

Conclusions

Our results confirm pubertal abnormalities and short stature are the most common endocrine features seen in 4H leukodystrophy. However, we noted that endocrine abnormalities are typically underinvestigated in this patient population. A prospective study is required to formulate evidence-based recommendations for management of the endocrine manifestations of this disorder.

### Recessive mutations in POLR1C cause a leukodystrophy by impairing biogenesis of RNA polymerase III [^115RsT1N]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

A small proportion of 4H (Hypomyelination, Hypodontia and Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism) or RNA polymerase III (POLR3)-related leukodystrophy cases are negative for mutations in the previously identified causative genes POLR3A and POLR3B. Here we report eight of these cases carrying recessive mutations in POLR1C, a gene encoding a shared POLR1 and POLR3 subunit, also mutated in some Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) cases. Using shotgun proteomics and ChIP sequencing, we demonstrate that leukodystrophy-causative mutations, but not TCS mutations, in POLR1C impair assembly and nuclear import of POLR3, but not POLR1, leading to decreased binding to POLR3 target genes. This study is the first to show that distinct mutations in a gene coding for a shared subunit of two RNA polymerases lead to selective modification of the enzymes' availability leading to two different clinical conditions and to shed some light on the pathophysiological mechanism of one of the most common hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, POLR3-related leukodystrophy.

### Association of diagnosis of leukodystrophy with race and ethnicity among pediatric and adolescent patients [^111sMcsN]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Limitations for this study are its use of retrospective data and the limited duration of data collection. The time limitation was necessary because ICD-10 has only been in use for the past 3 years, and ICD-10 code use was necessary to have sufficient specificity in determining diagnoses. We cannot exclude the possibility that the differences observed in diagnosis were related to different rates of hospital admission. For example, perhaps black patients with leukodystrophies were admitted less often to the hospital, or their families did not bring them to the emergency department as often. Another limitation is that PHIS consists primarily of in-hospital data, with less outpatient clinic data, so it is not possible to accurately determine population rates of disease or prevalence. Our analysis of leukodystrophy gene allele frequencies used the data deposited in gnomAD, which may not have the same racial group distributions as PHIS. Further work should be done to better understand the nonwhite distribution of patients with leukodystrophies; because many patients with leukodystrophies report multiple for racial categorization, it is unclear whether this reflects interracial heritage or whether it is due to issues inherent in data collection.

References to publications by POLR3-RD gene

The most common POLR3-RD is POLR3-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD; Phenotype MIM (PMIM): 607694, 614381, 616494, and 619310), also known as 4H leukodystrophy for its cardinal features of hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Other clinical presentations with predominant neurological involvement associated with pathogenic variants in genes encoding RNA Pol III subunits include hereditary spastic paraparesis and spastic ataxia (HSP/SA); mild and severe striatal variant forms (SVFs); isolated cerebellar atrophy (ICA); and ataxia, spasticity, demyelinating neuropathy with/without epilepsy (ASDN). Other phenotypes such as intellectual disability or global developmental delay (GDD) with various overlapping features have also been reported. Some subtypes of POLR3-RD have significant involvement of non-neurologic tissues or systems, with or without neurologic involvement. These include Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WRS; PMIM: 264090), Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS; PMIM: 248390), isolated hormonal disorder (IHD; e.g. idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), augmented susceptibility to Varicella zoster infection (VZV), endosteal hyperostosis with oligodontia (EHO; PMIM: 619234), and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Collectively, reports of these clinical entities describe the spectrum of phenotypes caused by variants impacting RNA Pol III (refer to Table S2 for complete references).

### Craniofacial features of POLR3-related leukodystrophy caused by biallelic variants in, and… [^117Ebo4a]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leukodystrophies are a group of rare heterogenous inherited disorders that affect the cerebral white matter and are typically associated with progressive neurodegeneration. Although individually rare, they collectively affect 1 in 4733 live births. The clinical manifestations of this group of disorders can appear at any time from infancy to adulthood and may include developmental delay and/or regression, cerebellar features, gait difficulties, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, seizures, cognitive and psychiatric manifestations.

RNA polymerase III-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (POLR3-HLD; MIM: 607694, 614381, 616494), one of the most common hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C or POLR3K, each encoding subunits of RNA polymerase III. POLR3A and POLR3B encode the largest subunits that form the catalytic core of RNA polymerase III. POLR1C encodes a subunit of both RNA polymerase I and III while POLR3K encodes for a different subunit of RNA polymerase III.RNA polymerase III is a crucial enzyme responsible for the transcription of small RNAs including transfer RNAs, 5S ribosomal RNA and U6 small nuclear RNA. These are implicated in transcriptional activity regulation, RNA processing, ribosomal assembly and translation necessary for protein synthesis.

POLR3-HLD is also known as 4H leukodystrophy in reference to the phenotypic constellation of hypomyelination in addition to hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Onset of symptoms is typically in early childhood with evidence of motor dysfunction including predominant cerebellar signs in addition to cognitive impairment, abnormal dentition including hypodontia, oligodontia or delayed dentition, endocrinological abnormalities including short stature, delayed or absent puberty and ocular abnormalities, particularly progressive myopia. In addition to the classical hypomyelinating leukodystrophy pattern consisting of mild T2 hyperintensity and variable T1 signal of the white matter compared with grey matter structures, brain MRI typically reveals relative preservation of myelination (i.e. hypointense T2 signal) of specific structures including the dentate nuclei, anterolateral nuclei of the thalami, globi pallidi, pyramidal tracts in the posterior limbs of the internal capsules and optic radiations. In addition, cerebellar atrophy and thinning of the corpus callosum are commonly present.

### Endocrine and growth abnormalities in 4H leukodystrophy caused by variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, and POLR1C [^116WD4fo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a group of rare genetic diseases characterized by abnormal white matter in the central nervous system (CNS), which often result in progressive neurodegeneration and premature death. Based on whether the white matter abnormalities seen on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are caused by insufficient initial myelin deposition or altered myelin homeostasis, leukodystrophies can be classified as hypomyelinating or non-hypomyelinating, respectively. 4H leukodystrophy, also known as RNA polymerase III (POLR3)-related leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy associated with several characteristic neurological and non-neurological clinical features, primarily including hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Commonly presenting neurological signs include cerebellar manifestations, such as ataxia and dysmetria, as well as pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and cognitive features. Non-neurological manifestations can include myopia and endocrine features such as growth hormone (GH) deficiency and short stature. 4H leukodystrophy is also typically associated with a unique MRI phenotype, including cerebellar atrophy, progressive thinning of the corpus callosum, and diffuse hypomyelination with relative preservation of specific structures, namely the dentate nucleus, optic radiations, anterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, globus pallidus, and corticospinal tracts at the level of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. 4H leukodystrophy has been found to be caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, and POLR3K, each of which encode subunits of the POLR3 complex.

As this class of leukodystrophies has been discovered relatively recently, secondary features that are typically associated with this phenotype have not been comprehensively described. This study presents a thorough investigation of the endocrine and growth abnormalities associated with 4H leukodystrophy through an international cross-sectional retrospective study of 150 patients with a molecular confirmation of the diagnosis. Moreover, this study provides insight on the endocrine disorders associated with this disease, and how some endocrine abnormalities may have an impact on patients' quality of life, thus highlighting the importance of considering endocrine therapeutic options and the associated impact on medical care.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^111tWCz1]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Leukodystrophy categories and definition — scope and examples are provided: a leukodystrophy is broadly any genetic disease affecting the myelin of the central nervous system (CNS). Leukodystrophies fall into (1) hypomyelination, (2) dysmyelination, and (3) demyelination, with demyelinating examples including Krabbe disease, X-ALD, and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), and hypomyelinating examples including Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), RNA polymerase III–related leukodystrophies/4-H syndrome, and hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. A single disease can fall into more than one category, MRI-based categorization can be subjective, and there is disagreement over the exact definition. One standard published in 2015 classified 30 diseases as leukodystrophies, defined as heritable disorders affecting CNS white matter with or without peripheral nervous system involvement; acquired CNS myelin disorders are not included. Next-generation sequencing is revealing genotype-phenotype relationships that were unsuspected and unknown 5 years ago.

### A novel homozygous mutation in POLR3A gene causing 4H syndrome: a case report [^116KeXMT]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Congenital hypomyelinating disorders are a heterogeneous group of CNS leukoencephalopathies amongst which the Pol III-related leukodystrophies present with varying combinations of motor dysfunction, abnormal dentition, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and share features on brain MRI. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are identified once two MRIs done at least six months apart after the age of one year show no significant improvement in the myelination pattern. These syndromes have recently been recognised to result from mutations involving POLR3A, POLR3B genes and more recently the POLR1C gene and are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. There are five phenotypes emanating from these mutations i.e. 4H syndrome, ADDH, TACH, LO and HCAHC as enumerated earlier with no obvious genotype/phenotype correlation seen. The age of onset shows correlation with the severity of the disorder and the phenotype with an earlier onset correlating with a greater severity while POLR3A mutations lead to a more severely affected phenotype.

The 4H leukodystrophy shows both neurological and non-neurological manifestations. Delayed attainment of motor milestones or regression of previously achieved milestones with delayed walking, ataxic gait and dystonia progressing to wheelchair dependence is noted. Inability to walk by 2 years age indicates poor prognosis in terms of attainment of independent ambulation. Ataxia is the main hindrance to walking while dystonia is not seen commonly. Children with earlier onset show more ataxia, nystagmus and tremors. Prominent cerebellar signs with varying degrees of pyramidal signs are seen. Seizures are infrequent and optic atrophy is also not consistently seen. Deterioration of speech and swallowing occurs with time while comprehension of speech and non-verbal communication remain preserved till late. Intellectual deterioration is gradually progressive with mild to moderate mental subnormality seen in all cases. The non-neurological manifestations include dental abnormalities and endocrinal perturbations. The primary dentition is delayed and an abnormal order of eruption of the deciduous dentition is seen with the deciduous molar erupting before the incisors. Presence of natal teeth, misshapen and missing teeth and hypodontia are the other abnormalities noted. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism results in delayed onset of puberty due to impaired secretion of gonadotropic releasing hormone (GnRH), defect in GnRH receptor or GnRH bioactivity. These patients usually have abnormal baseline FSH and LH levels and there is absence of response to pituitary stimulation with GnRH. GH deficiency has been recognised and has been reported as a cause for clinical deterioration in later years.

### Craniofacial features of POLR3-related leukodystrophy caused by biallelic variants in, and… [^111XoZDS]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Among the 31 participants, there were 21 males (67.7%) and 10 females (32.3%). All thirty-one participants had a confirmed diagnosis of POLR3-HLD on the basis of their clinical and radiological features in addition to molecularly confirmed presence of likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B or POLR1C (table 1). Variants were present either in the compound heterozygous or homozygous state in each patient. Sixteen participants had biallelic variants in POLR3A (51.6%), ten in POLR3B (32.2%) and four in POLR1C (12.9%). One participant (subject 31) had a combination of a pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant in POLR3A in addition to a pathogenic and a deep intronic variant of unknown significance in POLR3B. In this participant, we believe that the POLR3A variants are disease causing, either solely or in combination with the POLR3B variants.

2.3 Diagnosis Determination in the Claims Dataset

In the primary dataset (Veeva), confirmed MLD cases were defined by the use of ICD‐10‐CM E75.25 on two distinct claim IDs separated by at least 30 days in the primary cohort, and by the use of E75.25 on a date following an initial use of either ICD‐9‐CM 330.3 ("Cerebral degeneration of childhood in other diseases classified elsewhere") or ICD‐10‐CM E75.25 ("Metachromatic Leukodystrophy") in the secondary cohort. For confirmed patients, the age at MLD diagnosis, referred to as the index year of life, was defined as the year of the first use of E75.25 minus the year of birth. The age at the occurrence of other diagnoses was determined similarly. When diagnoses are grouped or clustered, the first occurrence of any claim with a diagnosis in the grouping is used.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^113C4nj6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurodegeneration in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) may be preceded by systemic complications. Characterization of these features is critical to define barriers to early diagnosis and treatment eligibility for gene therapy. We utilized medical billing (claims) datasets and a natural history study to capture pre-diagnosis MLD-related events. MLD-related events (ICD-10-CM codes) were aggregated into system-based diagnosis clusters, and time to MLD diagnosis (TTD) computed for each organ-system diagnosis cluster. Differences in TTD distribution, instantaneous diagnosis hazard, and survival to MLD diagnosis were compared by sex and payor type. TTD and regression from onset of first symptoms were described using median and inter-quartile range. The claims dataset identified 174 MLD cases (diagnosis ≤ 6years old) with 14 diagnosed within the first year of life. General neurologic concerns (n = 138; median 257days pre-diagnosis), gastrointestinal (n = 137; 231days), seizures (n = 48; 236days), ophthalmologic (n = 46; 362days), and language-related events (n = 41; 267days) were common. Time to MLD diagnosis from onset of prodromal clusters was longer for children with non-commercial insurance: most prominent with seizures (survival logrank p value < 0.02) and non-degenerative neurological symptoms (survival logrank p value < 0.04). Similar findings were noted in our analysis of a second claims dataset. The natural history cohort demonstrated a similar pattern of prodromal disease features and delayed diagnosis. This study defines barriers to MLD diagnosis and highlights prodromal periods of pre-regression symptomatology, further supporting the need for early screening in this fatal disorder of childhood.

### Association of diagnosis of leukodystrophy with race and ethnicity among pediatric and adolescent patients [^115cmKTx]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Patients with leukodystrophies were identified from any PHIS visit (inpatient, observation, emergency department, ambulatory surgery, clinic visit) as having an ICD-10 code for 1 of the 4 leukodystrophies between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2017. The control PHIS cohort of patients without leukodystrophy consisted of all other patients identified during the same period with an ICD-10 code for diseases other than leukodystrophy.

We estimated the 2-year point prevalence of composite and individual leukodystrophy diagnoses in racial groups using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and logit linkage function. We fit the model with generalized estimating equations to account for correlation between patients within the same hospital. We estimated unadjusted and adjusted point estimates. Adjusted prevalence estimates were obtained by controlling for sex, insurance, urban or rural status, 2010 median household income for patient zip code, number of inpatient days, and age at first PHIS visit. All analyses were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

To compare leukodystrophy gene allele frequencies in different racial groups, we calculated missense and loss-of-function frequencies using the gnomAD databasefor ABCD1, ARSA, GALC, and IDUA. We used a Kruskal-Wallis test to determine significance with subsequent χ² analysis.

Methods

This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort analyses. The study, which used deidentified data, was not considered human subjects research and was exempted by the institutional review boards at the University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare. We conducted a retrospective case-control study on patients aged 18 years or younger admitted to a Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) hospital with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of leukodystrophy (metachromatic leukodystrophy [E75.25], X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy [E71.52x], Krabbe disease [E75.23], or Hurler disease [E76.01]) between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2017.

The PHIS database has information from more than 50 children's hospitals in the United States. Hospitals are affiliated with the business alliance of Child Health Corporation of America. Each patient has a unique entry, but the data are deidentified. Data collected include patient and visit demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, insurance type, type of visit, estimated total visit cost, length of stay, ICD coding, and detailed charge information. The hospital visits included primarily inpatient admissions with additional visit types such as emergency department, observation, ambulatory surgery, and clinic visits. Race and ethnicity were collected as patient- or family-reported answers to separate questions at registration: 1 for race and 1 for ethnicity.

### Association of diagnosis of leukodystrophy with race and ethnicity among pediatric and adolescent patients [^112iPMHU]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

We identified 557 patients with leukodystrophies (221 [40%] female; median [range] age, 7 [0–18] years) in the PHIS database over the 2-year period. The most common racial groups represented were white non-Hispanic (321 patients [58%]), black non-Hispanic (54 patients [10%]), and white Hispanic (51 patients [9%]) (Table 1). Patients had metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) (ARSA gene; 139 patients [25% of cohort]), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ABCD1; 111 patients [20%]), Krabbe disease (GALC; 56 patients [10%]), or Hurler disease (IDUA; 56 patients [10%]). We chose these 4 ICD-10 leukodystrophy codes because they provided specificity of an individual leukodystrophy genetic diagnosis. In contrast, other leukodystrophies coded using different ICD-10 codes, such as sphingolipidoses, are nonspecific and include a large range of genetically discrete disorders, such as vanishing white matter disease, Canavan disease, and others.

Table 1.
Demographic Characteristics of the Study Cohort

Nonwhite race/ethnicity, including black, black Hispanic, and white Hispanic background, was associated with not having a leukodystrophy diagnosis (Table 2). The adjusted prevalence for a leukodystrophy diagnosis in white non-Hispanic patients was 13.8 (95% CI, 10.6–17.9) per 100 000 patients, compared with 5.8 (95% CI, 3.8–8.9), 2.4 (95% CI, 1.1–5.2), and 7.4 (95% CI, 5.2–10.4) per 100 000 in black non-Hispanic, black Hispanic, and white Hispanic patients, respectively. This reduced rate of diagnosis was out of proportion to the frequency of the different races in PHIS. When each leukodystrophy was singly tested, nonwhite race was also associated with not having a diagnosis (Table 2).

### Craniofacial features of POLR3-related leukodystrophy caused by biallelic variants in, and… [^116YTbSX]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

RNA polymerase III-related or 4H leukodystrophy (POLR3-HLD) is an autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy characterized by neurological dysfunction, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C or POLR3K. Craniofacial abnormalities reminiscent of Treacher Collins syndrome have been originally described in patients with POLR3-HLD caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR1C. To date, no published studies have appraised in detail the craniofacial features of patients with POLR3-HLD. In this work, the specific craniofacial characteristics of patients with POLR3-HLD associated with biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B and POLR1C are described.

Methods

The craniofacial features of 31 patients with POLR3-HLD were evaluated, and potential genotype-phenotype associations were evaluated.

Results

Various craniofacial abnormalities were recognized in this patient cohort, with each individual presenting at least one craniofacial abnormality. The most frequently identified features included a flat midface (61.3%), a smooth philtrum (58.0%) and a pointed chin (51.6%). In patients with POLR3B biallelic variants, a thin upper lip was frequent. Craniofacial anomalies involving the forehead were most commonly associated with biallelic variants in POLR3A and POLR3B while a higher proportion of patients with POLR1C biallelic variants demonstrated bitemporal narrowing.

Conclusion

Through this study, we demonstrated that craniofacial abnormalities are common in patients with POLR3-HLD. This report describes in detail the dysmorphic features of POLR3-HLD associated with biallelic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B and POLR1C.

### Novel mutations of the POLR3A gene caused POLR3-related leukodystrophy in a Chinese family: a case report [^115HQJk6]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

POLR3-related leukodystrophy, which includes hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H syndrome); ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (ADDH); tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH); leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO), and hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (HCAHC), is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by onset time ranging from the neonatal period to late childhood and a wide range of severities relating to many systems. The primary clinical features include cerebellar symptoms (i.e. spasticity, ataxia, tremor, and cognitive regression); dental abnormalities (i.e. tooth delay, tooth agenesis, fewer teeth, and abnormal tooth form and arrangement), short stature, dysphagia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and progressive eye abnormalities (e.g. myopia and optic atrophy). Some rare features have also been reported in other studies (Table 1). Myopia is seen in almost all patients and short stature occurs in 50% of patients with POLR3-related leukodystrophy. However, dental issues, difficulty swallowing, endocrine features, and aberrant tooth and hormonal abnormities are not always present. Systematic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the combination of hypomyelination with relative T2 hypointensity of the ventrolateral thalamus, optic radiation, globus pallidus, dentate nucleus, cerebellar atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum indicate POLR3-related leukodystrophy. Rare characteristics were found in other cases as well (Table 1). MRI characteristics are the main supporting evidence for diagnosis of POLR3-related leukodystrophy, especially if classic non-neurological features are absent.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^116qrmbg]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Leukodystrophies in children — clinical presentation and characteristic features — span a wide age range, as "The age of onset of symptoms in leukodystrophies may vary from prenatal to adult", with neonates/infants showing "encephalopathy or developmental delay", and older patients having insidious symptoms including "behavioral or psychiatric changes; loss of formerly achieved milestones; or deterioration in skills, vision changes, or ataxia or gait changes". In late-onset cases, "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other subtle cognitive changes may be the presenting symptoms and often precede motor dysfunction", and patterning differs because "In general, hypomyelinating leukodystrophies present more often with motor delay versus motor regression typically seen in demyelinating leukodystrophies". Seizures are frequent since they "affect up to 40% of children with the disease", and can present initially in some disorders. Distinctive scenarios include acute neurologic decline after febrile illness or head injury where "mitochondrial disease or vanishing white matter (VWM) disease are considerations", and in PMD, infants "present at birth or within the first 2 months of life with hypotonia, rotary nystagmus, head titubation, and sometimes stridor attributable to vocal cord paralysis". Head size can guide suspicion because "Macrocephaly is a common feature in megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), Canavan disease, and Alexander disease, and microcephaly is a feature of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and RNASE T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy". Additional pointers include that "X-ALD can be considered in a school-aged boy with skin color changes and/or adrenal insufficiency (eg, Addison disease)" and that "Children with 4-H syndrome or RNA polymerase III–related leukodystrophies may be identified by their other systemic symptoms including dental abnormalities, progressive myopia (nearsightedness), and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism".

Results

Population Characteristics

A total of 43 caregivers (26 biological mothers, 1 foster mother, and 16 fathers, including 3 families with 2 affected children) participated in the study. The characteristics of the parent population are summarized in Table 3. Most parents reported being in a marital or common law relationship (33 of 43; 77%). The education level was statistically equivalent between genders, with most parents reporting postsecondary-level education (35 of 43; 81%). Employment status differed between parents, with more fathers reporting employment (14 of 16; 88%) compared to mothers (15 of 27; 56%); however, more than half of the total cohort was employed (29 of 43; 63%). All mothers presented as the primary caregiver.

Table 3.
Parent Characteristics. a

32 patients (16 males and 16 females) ranging from 2 to 40 years old with POLR3-related leukodystrophy were included in the study. Characteristics of the patient population are summarized in Table 4. Most patients in the cohort were aged 12 years old or younger (12 of 32; 38%), compared to patients aged 12–18 years (10 of 32; 31%) or > 18 years (10 of 32; 31%). The majority of children had biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A (14 of 32; 44%) and POLR3B (16 of 32; 50%), with only a minority with biallelic variants in POLR1C (2 of 32; 6%). Age of disease onset primarily occurred between 1 and 5 years (20 of 32; 63%). At the time of questionnaire completion, the time elapsed since diagnosis varied from 0 to 5 years (11 of 32; 34%), 5 to 10 years (7 of 32; 22%), 10 to 15 years (3 of 32; 9%), and > 15 years (6 of 32; 19%). The most prevalent clinical features reported were abnormal gait (21 of 32; 66%), ataxia (20 of 32; 63%), delayed cognitive development (19 of 32; 59%), and wheelchair use (19 of 32; 59%). Classification median scores for Gross Motor Function Classification System, Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System, and Manual Ability Classification System were 4, indicating severe functional impairment.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^114QiEPk]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

We performed a retrospective cohort study using a natural history study and claims databases. The natural history study cohort patients were consented under the Myelin Disorders Biorepository Project (MDBP) (IRB #14‐011236) as part of the Global Leukodystrophy Initiative Clinical Trial Network (GLIA‐CTN). Written informed consent for research was obtained from all participants or their legally authorized representatives if unable to provide consent due to age or diminished capacity. Records in claims datasets are de‐identified; therefore, the analysis is not classified as human subjects research.

2.2 Claims Database Cohort

The claims dataset included 3327 patients with at least one use of the MLD‐specific International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM) E75.25 diagnosis code (Table 1, Figure 1A). A primary cohort of 174 patients was selected from Veeva Compass Patient, an anonymized, longitudinal open US‐based medical claims dataset with procedures and diagnoses at patient‐level granularity. This data source comprises over 300 million patients, with 31.9 million born on or after Jan 1, 2017. Data availability spans from January 1, 2017, to Feb 28, 2024. Patients were only eligible for study inclusion if they had a year of birth of 2017 or later and at least two distinct medical claims with an E75.25 diagnosis separated by at least 30 days. Data are detailed at the patient/claim/line‐item/day level and include payor type (e.g. commercial, Medicaid, Medicare). Available demographics include sex and year of birth, and patients are geographically well‐dispersed (Figure S1). The median time between an eligible subject's first appearance in the claim's dataset and their index MLD diagnosis was 658 days (IQR: 334.25–952.25, Table 1).

### Cerebellar hypoplasia with endosteal sclerosis is a POLR3-related disorder [^1172dcoM]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

CHES (cerebellar hypoplasia with endosteal sclerosis) syndrome (OMIM#213002) associates hypomyelination, cerebellar atrophy, hypogonadism and hypodontia. So far, only five patients have been described. The condition is of neonatal onset. Patients have severe psychomotor delay and moderate to severe intellectual disability. Inheritance is assumed to be autosomal recessive due to recurrence in sibs, consanguinity of parents and absence of vertical transmission. CHES syndrome is reminiscent of 4H-leukodystrophy, a recessive-inherited affection due to variations in genes encoding subunits of the RNA polymerase III (POLR3A-POLR3B-POLR1C). POLR3B variants have been identified in one CHES patient. Here we report on a novel CHES patient, carrying compound heterozygous variations in POLR3B. This report confirms affiliation of CHES to POLR3-related disorders and suggests that CHES syndrome represents a severe form of 4H-leukodystrophy.

### A novel homozygous mutation in POLR3A gene causing 4H syndrome: a case report [^116PLmV9]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 4H syndrome (4HS) is a white matter neuroregression syndrome of recent coinage and description which is characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The entity was first described by Timmons et al. as a progressive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy of unknown origin characterized by central and peripheral hypomyelination, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism of pituitary origin with hypodontia in 4 unrelated adults between 20 to 30 year ages and was suggested to have an autosomal recessive or a de novo dominant inheritance. These patients had remained normal up to the prepubertal age. It is now understood that 4H syndrome belongs to a group of Pol III-related leukodystrophies characterized by a combination of three major clinical findings i.e. motor dysfunction, abnormal dentition and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism resulting in several clinical phenotypes. Apart from the 4H syndrome the Pol III-related leukodystrophies includes four other syndromes of ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (ADDH), tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH), leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO) and hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (HCAHC). Pol III-related leukodystrophies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and result from mutations in POLR3A gene on chromosome 10q22 or the POLR3B genes on chromosome 12q23. These genes are responsible for encoding the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) which is a multi-subunit complex composed of 17 subunits. It has been hypothesized that Pol III is crucial for tRNA synthesis and these mutations lead to abnormality in tRNA levels in the brain. There are 14 different mutations in the POLR3A gene which have been described in 19 patients of French-Canadian, Caucasian and Syrian ethnicity. The mutations were spread throughout the gene, and there were no obvious genotype/phenotype correlations. There are two earlier reports of 4H syndrome from India published in medical literature. However mutation studies were not reported in these cases. In this case report we highlight the presentation, evaluation, management and genetic counselling of a 1 ½ year old girl child with 4H syndrome with a novel homozygous mutation in the POLR3A gene.

### Consensus statement on preventive and symptomatic care of leukodystrophy patients [^117N3geh]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are inherited disorders whose primary pathophysiology consists of abnormal deposition or progressive disruption of brain myelin. Leukodystrophy patients manifest many of the same symptoms and medical complications despite the wide spectrum of genetic origins. Although no definitive cures exist, all of these conditions are treatable. This report provides the first expert consensus on the recognition and treatment of medical and psychosocial complications associated with leukodystrophies. We include a discussion of serious and potentially preventable medical complications and propose several preventive care strategies. We also outline the need for future research to prioritize clinical needs and subsequently develop, validate, and optimize specific care strategies.

### Recessive mutations in POLR1C cause a leukodystrophy by impairing biogenesis of RNA polymerase III [^116Fz73h]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing for gene identification

To investigate the genetic aetiology of these unexplained cases, we performed exome sequencing in three cases with typical clinical and/or radiological features of POLR3-related leukodystrophy negative for POLR3A or POLR3B mutation. Genome coverage for these three cases exceeded 56 × (Supplementary Table 1) and yielded more than 4.6 million variants per genome. Review of the data using in-house filters revealed a homozygous mutation in POLR1C (NM_203290; GRCh37/hg19) in two patients (c.221A > G (p. Asn74Ser) and c.95A > T (p. Asn32Ile), respectively), and compound heterozygous mutations in one (c.436T > C (p. Cys146Arg) and c.883_885delAAG (p. Lys295del)), all consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). These four variants were validated using Sanger sequencing. Co-segregation analysis confirmed that the mutations were inherited from heterozygous carrier parents. These variants were not observed in over 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project database, in the ExAc data set nor in our internal variant databases. Furthermore, these variants were not present in more than 300 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) control chromosomes. In silico analysis predicted those to be disease-causing (Supplementary Table 2c). These variants were found to affect highly conserved amino-acid residues (Fig. 1). To identify additional mutations, we sequenced all exons, exon–intron boundaries and 3′ and 5′ untranslated repeat of POLR1C (see Supplementary Table 3 for primers) in 16 other individuals selected on the basis of clinical (compatible neurological features with at least one non-neurological feature such as dental abnormalities or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, together with hypomyelination on MRI) and/or radiological characteristics (typical MRI features of 4H leukodystrophy)but negative for POLR3A and POLR3B mutations and uncovered five additional compound heterozygous or homozygous cases (Supplementary Table 2, Fig. 1). Sequencing of the mutated exons was performed in family members for whom DNA was available to confirm segregation. In total, 13 POLR1C mutations were detected in eight cases (Supplementary Table 2a, Fig. 1). Similar to what is observed in cases with the disease caused by mutations in POLR3A or POLR3B, clinical and radiological characteristics of these eight cases were compatible with POLR3-related leukodystrophy; however, patients did not necessarily have all clinical (that is, neurological, dental, ophthalmological and endocrine abnormalities) and MRI features(Table 1, Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 4 and 5) of the disease.

### Recessive mutations in POLR1C cause a leukodystrophy by impairing biogenesis of RNA polymerase III [^1111Z2jq]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of genetically determined disorders characterized by abnormal white matter on brain imaging. They are classified as hypomyelinating and non-hypomyelinating leukodystrophies based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics, depending on whether the principal problem appears to be a lack of myelin deposition during development or altered myelin homeostasis. RNA polymerase III (POLR3)-related leukodystrophy or 4H (Hypomyelination, Hypodontia and Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism) leukodystrophy (MIM 607694, 614381)was found to be caused by recessive mutations in POLR3A (MIM 614258) or POLR3B (MIM 614366)and is characterized by an expanding spectrum of clinicaland radiological features. POLR3A and POLR3B are, respectively, the largest and second largest of the 17 subunits that constitute POLR3. Together, they form the catalytic centre of the enzyme. POLR3 synthetizes small non-coding RNAs, including tRNAs, 5S RNA, 7SK RNA and U6 RNA, that are involved in the regulation of essential cellular processes, including transcription, RNA processing and translation. A subset of patients (∼5%) presenting with compatible clinical and/or radiological features of POLR3-related leukodystrophy have no detectible mutations in either POLR3A or POLR3B, suggesting that mutations in one or more additional genes may result in this presentation. We hypothesized that genes coding for other POLR3 subunits or for proteins interacting with POLR3 would be strong candidates in these cases.

In this study, we identified recessive mutations in POLR1C, a gene encoding for a subunit common to POLR1 and POLR3, which has thus far been known only to be associated with autosomal recessive Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS). We also demonstrated that the leukodystrophy-causing mutations affect POLR3, but not POLR1 assembly and nuclear import, leading to decrease binding to POLR3 target genes, whereas one TCS mutation leads to normal assembly of both polymerases, but rather affects POLR1 targeting to the nucleolus, the site of POLR1 gene transcription.

### A novel homozygous mutation in POLR3A gene causing 4H syndrome: a case report [^113ScqEN]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

4H syndrome is a congenital hypomyelinating leukodystrophy characterized by hypodontia, hypomyelination and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism belonging to the Pol III-related leukodystrophies which arise due to mutations in the POLR3A or POLR3B gene. The clinical presentation is of neurodevelopmental delay or regression with ataxia, dystonia, nystagmus, delayed deciduous dentition and abnormal order of eruption of teeth. MRI brain shows a characteristic hypomyelination pattern. Several mutations have been described in the implicated genes but there are no reports on mutations seen in patients from India.

Case Presentation

We report a 1½ year old girl, only child of a non-consanguinous couple who presented with delayed developmental milestones and delayed dentition. On physical examination she had downward slanting palpebral fissures, low set ears, smooth philtrum, hypodontia, prominent body hair and clitoromegaly. There was prominent horizontal nystagmus, hypertonia of both upper and lower limbs, exaggerated deep tendon jerks and flexor planter response. She had not attained complete head control and required support to sit. She showed absent waves on brainstem evoked response audiometry and her fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy with prolongation of P100 latencies on visual evoked potentials. MRI Brain showed hyperintensity of entire white matter with involvement of the internal and external capsule, frontal deep white matter and corpus callosum. Her karyotype was 46 XX and her endocrinal profile was unremarkable. Clinical exome sequencing identified an unreported mutation in the POLR3A gene. The same mutation was identified by Sanger sequencing in heterozygous state in both parents. The child is being managed with physiotherapy and developmental therapy. She has been provided with hearing aids and started on speech therapy. Parents were provided anticipatory guidance and genetic counselling about autosomal recessive nature of inheritance, risk of recurrence and need for follow-up.

Conclusion

4H syndrome is a rare congenital hypomyelinating leukodystrophy inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the POLR3A and POLR3B gene. Delay or regression of milestones, abnormalities in dentition and endocrinal perturbations are its hallmark. A novel mutation in the POLR3A gene resulting in amino acid substitution of arginine for glutamine at codon 808 (p.R808Q) was detected in exon 18 in our case.

### Comprehensive genotype-phenotype analysis in POLR3-related disorders [^115MLVe2]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

To address this, we systematically searched the literature for information on POLR3-RD genotypes and phenotypes (see Figures 1 and S1 for search details). Literature was obtained from Medline & Embase, Embase Classic (Ovid), and Web of Science (Clarivate). Our search period included all database history until October 31, 2024. The Medline & Embase records were deduplicated automatically using Ovid and EndNote. A manual filtering process was first completed based on titles and abstracts, along with an additional record review for those with uncertain relevance. Records were automatically reviewed for the presence of genotype/phenotype information if they discussed human research and referred to a POLR3-RD diagnosis, RNA Pol III subunit, or POLR gene/genotype. Records were automatically excluded if they were associated exclusively with pathogenic variants in genes encoding non-RNA Pol III subunits (e.g. POLR1A). Literature was divided and reviewed by five authors (M. A.M.-R. S.G. Q.S. S.P. and A.D.) to ascertain the clinical information for patients reported in the literature, including supplementary data. The final database included patients from 195 published records that reported genetic associations between RNA Pol III subunits and rare developmental or neurological pathologies.

Figure 1
Assembly of patient data by collation of affected individuals from the literature with internal database entries

The literature was searched using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science for literature pertaining to POLR3∗ genes and disease until October 31, 2024. The search details can be reviewed in Figure S1. Source data from the primary search yielded 1,422 records, from which 195 relevant records were filtered. Internally, we started with 333 patient files. These were collated together and reviewed for duplicates through a process of matching patients and previous publication records. The process was conservative, meaning that all patient entries are unique and mapped correctly to prior publications, but several patients that were potential duplicates have been excluded as a result of having the same variants and associated clinical data (e.g. birth year, sex, and/or case description).

### Hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H) syndrome with vertebral anomalies: a novel association [^113XnE2Z]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H) syndrome is a rare hypomyelination disorder with around 40 cases reported worldwide. Children with hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism syndrome present with varying degrees of developmental delay with a spastic ataxic syndrome with delayed eruption of teeth along with disruption in the eruption sequence, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and a fluctuating clinical course with intercurrent infections and varying periods of stability. The disorder is caused by mutations in POL3A and POL3B genes and is collectively termed as pol III-related leukodystrophies. Here we describe 2 children with hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic, hypogonadism syndrome and the association of multiple vertebral fusion anomalies in one of them, which has not been previously described in the literature. We conclude that the spectrum of the disorder is not limited to brain parenchyma alone and involves all the structures arising from neural ectoderm, and this needs further research.

### Revised consensus statement on the preventive and symptomatic care of patients with leukodystrophies [^113ihdLJ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a broad class of genetic disorders that result in disruption or destruction of central myelination. Although the mechanisms underlying these disorders are heterogeneous, there are many common symptoms that affect patients irrespective of the genetic diagnosis. The comfort and quality of life of these children is a primary goal that can complement efforts directed at curative therapies. Contained within this report is a systems-based approach to management of complications that result from leukodystrophies. We discuss the initial evaluation, identification of common medical issues, and management options to establish a comprehensive, standardized care approach. We will also address clinical topics relevant to select leukodystrophies, such as gallbladder pathology and adrenal insufficiency. The recommendations within this review rely on existing studies and consensus opinions and underscore the need for future research on evidence-based outcomes to better treat the manifestations of this unique set of genetic disorders.

### Update on leukodystrophies and developing trials [^1132uXTj]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The field of leukodystrophies has made significant advances of late including improved diagnostic approaches, more accurate prognostic predictions, and a myriad of novel therapeutic options. A better characterization of the underlying pathomechanisms along with the identification of appropriate biomarkers is crucial for the design of effective targeted treatments. It is essential for healthcare professionals and researchers to stay up to date on these advancements and incorporate them into clinical practice to enhance the diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients with leukodystrophies. This review offers healthcare professionals an understanding of leukodystrophies, including clinical and genetic aspects. It also highlights ongoing clinical trials and emerging therapies with the potential to improve patient management and outcomes. Continued research and collaboration are vital for further progress in understanding and addressing the challenges associated with these complex diseases.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^112mfYqF]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

To overcome challenges related to the use of the MLD code as the anchor for MLD diagnosis in this study, we limited the data set to individuals for whom the MLD code was used longitudinally. These more stringent criteria decreased the number of identified cases from 3327 to 174, which is consistent with the predicted incidence of disease. It is also possible that this process also included those for whom MLD was later excluded, such as those with the ultra‐rare MLD‐related disorders multiple sulfatase deficiency or PSAP deficiency. Second, in our cohort identification, we restricted the claims cohort to subjects born on or after Jan 1st, 2017, to prevent left censoring of any pre‐MLD diagnosis events and allow for full claims history from birth. Changes to clinical practice, including diagnostics, over the years may limit the comparability between cohorts. Therefore, we describe the findings from the claims and the natural history cohorts to complement each other. Of note, the findings from both the two claims cohorts and the natural history cohort support the overall findings of delayed diagnosis and a pre‐regression prodromal period. Finally, claims data is independent from confirmation documentation. For this reason, in the claims dataset, psychomotor regression was grouped within the broad category of neurologic features. This limits the study of temporality between the psychomotor regression‐related medical events and other prodromal symptoms using the claims dataset alone. We addressed this limitation through the inclusion of granular natural history data with documentation of the onset of regression.

Overall, this study underscores that early signs and symptoms of MLD begin before disease regression and families are presenting to medical care with symptoms months to years prior to diagnosis. This study also underscores the critical need for early screening platforms and close monitoring of ambiguous cases, both because MLD begins earlier than previously defined and because, without appropriate support, the medical system fails to identify the children within the window for intervention. Lastly, there were differences in the timing to diagnosis based on insurance payor, which has the potential to impact clinical treatment eligibility.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^116FR6fF]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

Methods

Thirty-one individuals were included in this single-centre cross-sectional study. The participants were included based on the clinical and radiological features in keeping with a POLR3-HLD diagnosis in addition to biallelic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B or POLR1C identified by gene panels, exome or genome sequencing using DNA extracted from whole blood according to standard protocols. Interpretation of sequence variants were done as per consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. Only pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were considered as disease causing. Variants were described based on reference sequence GRCh37 (NM_007055.4 for POLR3A, NM_018082.6 for POLR3B and NM_203290.4 for POLR1C). Compliance with HGVS nomenclature has been verified using VariantValidator. In addition, participants were selected based on availability of photographs of adequate quality for craniofacial analysis. The individuals were recruited at the Montreal Children's Hospital of the McGill University Health Center between 2012 and 2021.

Facial images including face front and/or profile views of each individual with POLR3-HLD were independently reviewed by two specialists in dysmorphology (SPG and IDB). Both observers were blinded to the genotype. The two physicians performing the dysmorphologic evaluations of patients reviewed and scored all provided pictures independently using 'Elements of morphology: standard terminology for the head and face' as a reference. All evaluations were subsequently revised jointly. There were no instances of significant discordance in scoring and description. Occasional omissions of scoring of some features was the only noted difference. This was resolved through the joint revision of features initially omitted.

Pearson χ² was used to investigate the association between the presence of craniofacial features and the genotype, that is, POLR3A, POLR3B or POLR1C biallelic variants. Only features present in at least 10% of the patients (> 3/31) were included for comparison. Identified craniofacial features were also grouped based on their location (forehead, eyes, philtrum, lip and chin). The individual carrying variants in POLR3A and POLR3B (subject 31) was excluded from the statistical analysis. Results were considered statistically significant when p values were less than 0.05 (two-sided). All statistical analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS Statistics 28 software (release 28.0.0).

### Emerging treatments for pediatric leukodystrophies [^113SHKVB]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders with broad clinical manifestations and variable pathologic mechanisms. Improved diagnostic methods have allowed identification of the underlying cause of these diseases, facilitating identification of their pathologic mechanisms. Clinicians are now able to prioritize treatment strategies and advance research in therapies for specific disorders. Although only a few of these disorders have well-established treatments or therapies, a number are on the verge of clinical trials. As investigators are able to shift care from symptomatic management of disorders to targeted therapeutics, the unmet therapeutic needs could be reduced for these patients.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^1144eE85]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision) is the next major revision of the ICD by the World Health Organization (WHO). ICD-11 differs dramatically from historical versions, as it is based on an underlying semantic network of terms and meaning, called the Foundation. To function as a mutually exclusive and exhaustive statistical classification, ICD-11 creates derivative linearizations from the network that is a monohierarchy with residual categories such as Not Elsewhere Classified. ICD-11 also introduces the widespread post-coordination of terms, which allows for highly expressive representation of detailed patient descriptions. Phenotyping features are included in many subchapters or the signs and symptoms chapter. Composite phenotype descriptions of specific presentations or syndromes can be represented though post-coordination. Rare diseases are well represented in the Foundation, though not all appear in the relatively shallow linearization hierarchies.

### Novel mutations of the POLR3A gene caused POLR3-related leukodystrophy in a Chinese family: a case report [^115AE4Js]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Our case presented with severe manifestation at early onset and diverse manifestations among those of patients with POLR3-related leukodystrophy, which may be a result of the genotype identified in this patient; further analysis is necessary. To date, four genes (POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, and POLR3K) have been reported to be associated with POLR3-related leukodystrophy. Most of the identified mutations are point mutations in the codon region; however, non-coding DNA variants are suspected to account for a substantial portion of undiscovered causes of rare diseases. Minnerop et al. identified mutations in deep intronic regions of POLR3A as a common cause of hereditary spastic paraplegia and cerebellar ataxia, and > 80% of POLR3A mutation carriers presented the same deep intronic mutation (c.1909 + 22G > A), which leads to a novel, distinct, uniform, and severe phenotype. Jay et al. also reported alteration of mRNA splicing in POLR3A causing neonatal progeroid syndrome with severe clinical manifestations [23]. In this study, we identified the c.1771-6C > G (NM_007055) mutation adjacent to the mRNA splice site demonstrating that exploring non-coding genomic regions was helpful in revealing the causes of related hereditary diseases.

The complexity of clinical phenotypes and the heterogeneity of genotypes raise new challenges in genetic diagnoses. In the present study, medical exome sequencing was used to explore the possible genetic defects resulting in the disease of the patient. Compared to whole genome and whole exome sequencing, medical exome sequencing focuses on clinical interpretable regions of genes; less variants of uncertain significance in medical exome sequencing greatly improve the diagnostic yield and increase the coverage depth of sequencing, improving the accuracy of sequencing and broadening the spectrum of variants. In the present study, we identified novel heterozygous mutations of POLR3A that caused POLR3-related leukodystrophy disease for the first time in a Chinese family. This study will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of POLR3-related leukodystrophy and contribute to further analysis of phenotype–genotype correlations of related disorders.

Next-generation sequencing for leukodystrophies — use of whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) — states that steady advances are making WES a first-tier option for diagnosis of complex genetic disorders with reported yields of 25%. Unbiased genome-wide approaches exemplified by WES or WGS provide the potential for diagnosis of known diseases without stepwise ordering of multiple individual tests, and genome-wide sequencing can contribute to ongoing discovery of novel disease genes. This testing and assistance with interpretation of results can be facilitated with the help of a geneticist and/or genetic counselor.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^116MAX6c]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Leukodystrophies in children — epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis are outlined: Leukodystrophies are a group of genetically determined disorders that affect development or maintenance of central nervous system myelin, with an incidence of at least 1 in 4700 live births and more than 30% mortality by 8 years of age. They can present at any age from infancy to adulthood with manifestations ranging from developmental delay to seizures to spasticity. Diagnosis is based on a combination of history, examination, and radiologic and laboratory findings, including genetic testing. Clinical recognition accelerated with the widespread clinical adoption of MRI in the 1980s and 1990s, and recent improvements in genetic diagnosis techniques have led to specific diagnoses in more than half of all patients with leukodystrophy. The report notes significant morbidity and elevated risk of early death, few cures but significant opportunities for care and improvements in patient well-being, and highlights rapid advances and the addition of leukodystrophy screening to newborn screening.

### Scope and burden of non-standard of care hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric leukodystrophy patients [^117Y4xmD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Inherited leukodystrophies are a group of diseases affecting central nervous system myelin that lead to death or significant health problems. Although for most leukodystrophies there are no curative treatments, for a handful of diseases hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; bone marrow transplant) can stop disease progression, and if initiated in a timely fashion, prevent many or all neurologic and other systems involvement. However, HSCT is a complex procedure with significant morbidity and mortality risks. The study goal was to determine whether HSCT was being more widely used outside of those leukodystrophies for which HSCT is typically employed. The authors conducted a 2-year retrospective review of HSCT performed across the United States in 51 children's hospitals that are part of the Pediatric Health Information System. The authors screened for 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes for leukodystrophies in which HSCT is "nonstandard", including sphingolipidoses, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Niemann-Pick disease, and excluded patients who had ICD-10 codes for leukodystrophies that are HSCT candidates, specifically X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, and Hurler disease. The authors identified 91 patients (from a total cohort of 937) with one of the nonstandard leukodystrophies who had HSCT. HSCT was performed at 20 of the hospitals, with the majority performed at only 6 hospitals. Average costs ($786 846) per patient were more than 6 times higher than patients who did not have HSCT. The data show that an unexpectedly large number of leukodystrophy patients are receiving transplants for conditions in which HSCT is not typically used, and which are associated with high medical costs.

Table 1
Clinical manifestations of POLR3-related leukodystrophy patients

POLR3-related leukodystrophy is caused by biallelic mutations in POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, and POLR3K (through interaction with POLR3B) genes. These genes are responsible for encoding the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which has been hypothesized to be crucial for the synthesis of small RNAs, such as 5SrRNA and transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Mutations of these genes cause abnormal tRNA and non-coding RNA transcription in a cell type and growth state dependent manner, and can impact cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Patients with POLR3A mutations have a more severe disease course and an unfavorable prognosis compared to cases with POLR3B mutations. For this reason, Bernard et al. hypothesized that POLR3A mutations lead to dysregulation of Pol III and its targets, resulting in decreased expression of certain tRNAs during development and impaired protein synthesis. Previous studies have shown that 14 recessive mutations in the POLR3A gene were found in 19 French-Canadian, Caucasian, and Syrian individuals. However, cases among the Chinese population are still unclear. Most published mutations of POLR3A associated with POLR3-related leukodystrophy have focused on mutations that cause a change of amino acid; studies of splice site mutations and copy number variants are rare. In the present study, we report a female patient with a novel compound heterozygous mutation with an uncommon splice site mutation, c.1771-6C > G and c.2611del of POLR3A. The present study has expanded the current evidence concerning mutations associated with POLR3-related leukodystrophy.

### Recessive mutations in POLR1C cause a leukodystrophy by impairing biogenesis of RNA polymerase III [^114UpdSL]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With the advent of exome sequencing, it is becoming increasingly apparent that allelic heterogeneity in genes encoding essential proteins, such as those involved in transcription, results in highly variable phenotypes. A previous report of mutations in POLR1C (ref.) highlighted the discovery of the first cases of TCS with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. TCS (MIM 154500, 613717, 248390) is characterized by an abnormal craniofacial development and is caused, from most to least frequent, by mutations in TCOF1 (dominant), POLR1D (dominant) or POLR1C (recessive). TCS caused by mutations in POLR1D or POLR1C has been proposed to arise as a consequence of a decreased quantity of functional ribosomes in the neuroepithelium and the neuronal crest cells during critical points of embryogenesis. We assessed the role of a TCS-causing mutation (R279Q) in the biogenesis of POLR1 and POLR3. Our results (see Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 6) indicate that this mutation does not impair polymerase assembly, as opposed to leukodystrophy-causing mutations (see Fig. 3), but affect targeting to the nucleolus, the site for Pol I transcription.

Our findings suggest that improper assembly and nuclear import of POLR3 resulting from leukodystrophy-causative mutations lead to decreased availability of the complex at the chromatin. As POLR3 binding is well correlated to tRNA expression, this decreased POLR3 occupancy is likely to cause reduced transcription of tRNAs and other essential small non-coding RNAs. One hypothesis is that mutations in POLR3A, POLR3B or POLR1C lead to decreased levels of certain tRNAs crucial for the synthesis of proteins essential for central nervous system myelin development. tRNA function has also been suggested to be impaired in other white matter disorderscaused by mutations in tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, including hypomyelinating leukodystrophies such as RARS -associated hypomyelinationand Hypomyelination with Brain Stem and spinal cord involvement and Leg spasticity. Of note, tRNA synthetases have not been found in our POLR3 purifications, suggesting that tRNA aminoacylation is not coupled with POLR3 transcription. An alternative hypothesis would involve changes in the expression of other essential small non-coding RNAs synthesized by POLR3.

Leukodystrophies — diagnostic confirmation and referral: A genetic diagnosis offers affected families options including disease-specific therapies in some cases and family planning advice in all cases, and for a few leukodystrophies, early diagnosis can lead to a halt in disease progression and, in some instances, a cure; after a diagnosis is suspected on the basis of clinical presentation and MRI findings, biochemical and/or genetic studies are required for a final determination; depending on available expertise, early referral and involvement of a pediatric neurologist, geneticist, and genetic counselor are important for guiding diagnostic testing, care, and potential further referral (for example, if HSCT is indicated), although in situations in which timely diagnosis is important, with appropriate guidance, a primary physician can initiate diagnostic tests; testing of other organ systems may provide additional information to help confirm a diagnosis or differentiate it from others, and possible testing includes an ophthalmologic examination for indicators of ocular involvement.

Compound heterozygous variants in POLR3A and POLR1C were detected in Pt4, Pt5, and Pt6, respectively. Bi-allelic variants in POLR3A and POLR1C result in recessive HLD7 (MIM: 607694) and HLD11 (MIM:616494), respectively. Both are referred to as POLR3-related leukodystrophies. Consistent with POLR3-related leukodystrophies, motor dysfunction, and diffused cerebral hypomyelination was present in all three patients (Fig. 3). Myopia and cerebellar atrophy were observed only in Pt6.

A de novo heterozygous missense variant in SOX10 was discovered in Pt7. The phenotype of Pt7 included mild developmental delay and diffuse hypomyelination on MRI (Fig. 3). No other obvious clinical symptoms presented.

### Leukodystrophies: a proposed classification system based on pathological changes and pathogenetic mechanisms [^117F1bjJ]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction: what is a leukodystrophy?

Leukodystrophies are heritable, mostly progressive encephalopathies characterized by the selective involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) white matter. The first report of a familial white matter disorder dates back over a century, when Pelizaeus and Merzbacher separately described the familial occurrence of a chronic progressive 'diffuse sclerosis' (as opposed to the already recognized 'multiple sclerosis') with lack of myelin and sclerotic hardening of the white matter. The term "leukodystrophy" (leuko, white and dystrophy, wasting) was used for the first time in 1928 in the context of metachromatic leukodystrophy and coined to define hereditary, progressive diseases characterized by white matter degeneration. In the 1980s, leukodystrophies were considered genetic, progressive disorders primarily affecting myelin, either directly or through oligodendrocytes. At that time, the diseases were pathogenetically poorly characterized with an unknown molecular basis; data were available from pathology, biochemical analyses of brain tissue and knowledge of some metabolic and enzymatic defects, but no gene defects. Soon after, MRI came into use as primary tool to diagnose leukodystrophies, while no pathological data were available to confirm the primary myelin involvement. In the last two decades many gene defects have been identified, first by genetic linkage and more recently by whole exome and genome sequencing. Because many of these disorders prove to be caused by defects in housekeeping processes, the myelin-focused definition of term leukodystrophy has been recently considered too narrow.

### Diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of leukodystrophies [^116KNCZi]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Leukodystrophies comprise a large group of rare genetic disorders primarily affecting CNS white matter. Historically, the diagnostic process was slow and patient prognosis regarded as poor because curative treatment was only available for very few leukodystrophies in early stages of the disease. Whole-exome sequencing has both greatly increased the number of known leukodystrophies and improved diagnosis. Whether MRI keeps its central place in diagnosis and what the role is of whole-exome sequencing are relevant questions for neurologists. Improved diagnosis has revealed the phenotypic variability of leukodystrophies, requiring adaptation of prognostication. Technological advance in molecular techniques and improved insight into the pathophysiology of individual leukodystrophies have led to therapeutic developments, including drug design and gene therapy. Despite this progress, therapies are only beneficial early in the disease course, emphasising the need for a speedy diagnosis and for research on regenerative approaches to repair the damage already present.

### Elevated leukodystrophy incidence predicted from genomics databases [^1144EURy]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Leukodystrophies are genetic diseases affecting the white matter and leading to early death. Our objective was to determine leukodystrophy incidence, using genomics sequencing databases allele frequencies of disease-causing variants.

Methods

From 49 genes, representing the standardly defined group of leukodystrophies, we identified potential disease-causing variants from publications in the Human Genetic Mutation Database and from predictions in the Genome Aggregation Database. Allele frequencies were estimated from Genome Aggregation Database. Allele frequencies for each gene were summed to generate a super allele frequency and we used the Hardy-Weinberg equation to calculate overall expected live birth incidence associated with the gene in question.

Results

We identified 4564 pathogenic variants for 25 discrete leukodystrophies. The largest effect was from GALC variants (Krabbe disease), which had a predicted incidence of one in 12,080 live births, 8.3 times higher than published estimates. The second most frequently predicted leukodystrophy was the RNA polymerase III-related disorders, which had an incidence of 1:26,160. Overall, we found a leukodystrophy incidence of 1 in 4733 live births, significantly higher than previous estimates.

Conclusions

Our data are consistent with a significant underdiagnosis of leukodystrophy patients. An intriguing additional consideration is that there may be genetic modifiers that lead to weaker, absent, or adult-onset disease phenotypes.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^115LVtjK]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for phenotype representation

ICD-11, as with historical ICD revisions, includes a chapter on signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings. This chapter is highly enriched with what many could consider the root of phenotyping features; however, disease signs and symptoms are emphasized more than rare anomalies. A deeply enriched chapter on developmental anomalies, expanded from the ICD-10 chapter on congenital malformations, is informed by contributions from the rare disease community and Orphanet in particular. There are also subchapter groupings, such as inborn errors of metabolism, which include specific phenotype manifestations.

ICD-11 heavily leverages post-coordination to describe anomalies in particular. The table illustrates the recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations for polydactyly. An example of validation post-coordination of polydactyly of the left intermediate phalanx of the hand is:

Combining into the ICD-11 MMS cluster code:

Code: LB78&XA1473556831&XK1694310660

Note that the "&" symbol is a syntactic convention which links codes into a single cluster. This introduces the use of base 34 numbers (0–9; A–Z except O and I) as MMS code values. Also, these code values may change by the June 2018 publication date, as these examples were drawn from a draft version of ICD-11 under review.

Table: Recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations of polydactyly in ICD-11 MMS with the corresponding "X chapter" codes.

Composite phenotype rendering

Recognizing the expressive power of post-coordination, one can create a cluster of a disease or diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or anomalies that can comprehensively describe a given patient. This aligns with the overloaded use of phenotyping as a description of a complex of findings to describe particular categories or subtypes of patients, as opposed to distinct features. ICD-11 is capable of representing these complexes as post-coordinated clusters of specific rubrics.

### Comprehensive genotype-phenotype analysis in POLR3-related disorders [^114HNmZP]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Main text

RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III)-related disorders (POLR3-RDs) are a group of clinical entities characterized by pathogenic variants in genes encoding Pol III subunits, including POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, POLR1D, POLR3D, POLR3E, POLR3F, POLR3G, POLR3GL, POLR3H, and POLR3K (see Tables 1 and S1). RNA Pol III is a constitutively expressed seventeen-subunit polymerase enzyme complex responsible for the transcription of essential non-coding RNAs involved in transcription, RNA processing, and translation (see Zhou and Van Bortle, 2023). Canonical RNA Pol III transcripts include the entire pool of tRNAs and 5S ribosomal RNA, essential for translation; the small nuclear RNA U6, central to the spliceosome; and Alu-derived transcripts, including 7SL and BC200 RNAs functional in ubiquitous and neuron-specific signal recognition particles, respectively. An expanding pool of research on RNA Pol III has produced conflicting results on its role in double-strand DNA repair, and novel implications in the control of the RNA Pol II transcriptome, further expanding its role in biological processes. RNA Pol III has unique subunits encoded by POLR3∗ genes and shares some subunits with RNA Pol I and RNA Pol II, encoded by POLR1∗ and POLR2∗ genes, respectively. Complete loss of RNA Pol III-specific subunits is incompatible with life, underscoring that RNA Pol III is a foundational element of cellular function. Hypomorphic variants, which reduce but do not eliminate RNA Pol III function, are the underlying cause of the majority of this group of rare disease entities, often leading to significant morbidity and early mortality.

### Natural history of adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy [^116Wcou7]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

We performed a literature review, selecting all articles published between 1990 and 2023, concerning all confirmed MLD patients who started their symptoms in adulthood (i.e. ≥ 15 years). We contacted the authors of each article asking to participate to our retrospective study by filling the survey. In cases where the authors could not be reached, we retrieved these data based on the available information in the article.

This study was conducted according to the French legislation and authorized by the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL no. 2211991). All other participating sites (Canada, Italy) received approval from their research ethic board for retrospective use of clinical data.

Time-to-event curves were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method (considering interval-censored data for all events included death). All statistical analyses were performed using R 4.3.3.

Our survey identified 34 patients (18 females and 16 males) from 27 families (referred to as the "survey" cohort). These patients originated from multiples countries: 18 from France, 10 from Italy, one from Canada, and 5 from the papers whose authors accepted to fill our survey. In addition, our literature review covered data from 21 articles, reporting 28 additional cases of adult-onset MLD (15 females, 13 males), which we refer to as the "literature" cohort. Complete data for the two cohorts are available in supplemental Table 2.

In total, combining both the "survey" and the "literature" cohort, we studied 62 patients (33 females, 29 males), in what we named the "global" cohort. The median age at symptom onset was 25 years (range: 15–62) and the median diagnostic delay was 3 years (range: 0–44) (supplemental Table 3).

### De novo variants in POLR3B cause ataxia, spasticity, and demyelinating neuropathy [^113mXfUD]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

POLR3B encodes the second-largest catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase III, an enzyme involved in transcription. Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in POLR3B are a well-established cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. We describe six unrelated individuals with de novo missense variants in POLR3B and a clinical presentation substantially different from POLR3-related leukodystrophy. These individuals had afferent ataxia, spasticity, variable intellectual disability and epilepsy, and predominantly demyelinating sensory motor peripheral neuropathy. Protein modeling and proteomic analysis revealed a distinct mechanism of pathogenicity; the de novo POLR3B variants caused aberrant association of individual enzyme subunits rather than affecting overall enzyme assembly or stability. We expand the spectrum of disorders associated with pathogenic variants in POLR3B to include a de novo heterozygous POLR3B-related disorder.

### Novel mutations of the POLR3A gene caused POLR3-related leukodystrophy in a Chinese family: a case report [^1147ddV7]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurological impairment of our case started in the infantile period with a decline in motor ability, cognitive impairment, and cerebellar features. Although cerebellar signs of this case became progressively obvious, cerebellar atrophy was not observed, which is likely related to the molecular basis or other factors. Previous studies have found that cerebellar anomalies were more severe in patients with POLR3B defects while the pattern of hypomyelinization was more evident in the MRI of patients with POLR3A mutations. This may be another explanation for our case. Our patient also showed classical extraneurologic features, characterized by hypodontia with delayed tooth eruption and short stature. She also displayed polytrichia, an atypical feature of POLR3-related leukodystrophy, which may be due to aberrant endocrine hormone levels or other reasons. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was not detected because she was too young. Previous studies have also shown that the syndrome may or may not be associated with hypodontia and/or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism in many cases. The case did not show myopia and optic atrophy. This is inconsistent with most cases, which are usually accompanied by myopia. Her dysphagia phenotype was striking. She had obvious difficulty with tube feeding and forceful vomiting occurred frequently. This is likely due to the incoordination of swallowing of cerebellar syndrome, or due to other unpredictable reasons. Bronchodysplasia is another feature first observed in POLR3-related leukodystrophy, suggesting that it was not recognized previously in the POLR3-related leukodystrophy spectrum. Thus, in addition to the classical extraneurological features, abnormal body hair and visceral smooth muscle features should be carefully looked for in patients with POLR3-related. When classical features do not exist, rare manifestations will a clue in the diagnosis of this disorder. Although there is no cure for this disease to date, treatment of manifestations such as seizures, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, dystonia, and dysphagia can be managed on an individual basis for an improved quality of life and the prevention of complications.

### National variation in costs and mortality for leukodystrophy patients in US children's hospitals [^116d3sSq]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Inherited leukodystrophies are progressive, debilitating neurological disorders with few treatment options and high mortality rates. Our objective was to determine national variation in the costs for leukodystrophy patients and to evaluate differences in their care.

Methods

We developed an algorithm to identify inherited leukodystrophy patients in deidentified data sets using a recursive tree model based on International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, diagnosis and procedure charge codes. Validation of the algorithm was performed independently at two institutions, and with data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) of 43 US children's hospitals, for a 7-year period between 2004 and 2010.

Results

A recursive algorithm was developed and validated, based on six International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, codes and one procedure code that had a sensitivity up to 90% (range 61–90%) and a specificity up to 99% (range 53–99%) for identifying inherited leukodystrophy patients. Inherited leukodystrophy patients comprise 0.4% of admissions to children's hospitals and 0.7% of costs. During 7 years, these patients required $411 million of hospital care, or $131,000/patient. Hospital costs for leukodystrophy patients varied at different institutions, ranging from two to 15 times more than the average pediatric patient. There was a statistically significant correlation between higher volume and increased cost efficiency. Increased mortality rates had an inverse relationship with increased patient volume that was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

We developed and validated a code-based algorithm for identifying leukodystrophy patients in deidentified national datasets. Leukodystrophy patients account for $59 million of costs yearly at children's hospitals. Our data highlight potential to reduce unwarranted variability and improve patient care.

### Case definition and classification of leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies [^116Uwre4]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

An approved definition of the term leukodystrophy does not currently exist. The lack of a precise case definition hampers efforts to study the epidemiology and the relevance of genetic white matter disorders to public health.

Method

Thirteen experts at multiple institutions participated in iterative consensus building surveys to achieve definition and classification of disorders as leukodystrophies using a modified Delphi approach.

Results

A case definition for the leukodystrophies was achieved, and a total of 30 disorders were classified under this definition. In addition, a separate set of disorders with heritable white matter abnormalities but not meeting criteria for leukodystrophy, due to presumed primary neuronal involvement and prominent systemic manifestations, was classified as genetic leukoencephalopathies (gLE).

Interpretation

A novel classification of genetic white matter disorders based on a cellular pathology approach

Every classification reflects the knowledge of its time. The current classification of white matter disorders recognizes four categories: hypomyelinating (i.e. lack of myelin deposition), demyelinating (i.e. loss of previously deposited myelin), dysmyelinating (i.e. deposition of structurally or biochemically abnormal myelin) and myelinolytic diseases (i.e. myelin vacuolization). This classification has the major value of categorizing white matter disorders according to main mechanism of white matter injury and recognizing the possibility that different pathomechanisms may contribute to a single disease. One could, however, question the choice of terms arguing that, also in the light of more recent insights on white matter integrity and function, their reflection of the different disease categories is no longer tenable and that more pathomechanisms may play a primary role in white matter pathology than those four alone.

### Association of diagnosis of leukodystrophy with race and ethnicity among pediatric and adolescent patients [^115ckFPp]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are there disparities in leukodystrophy diagnosis in patients of different racial and ethnic backgrounds?

Findings

This case-control study of 557 patients with a diagnosis of leukodystrophy found that US patients of racial/ethnic minorities, including those from black, black Hispanic, and white Hispanic backgrounds, were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with a leukodystrophy. Furthermore, leukodystrophy disease–associated gene allele frequencies were the same or higher in populations of Latino or African descent.

Meaning

Patients of racial/ethnic minorities are being underdiagnosed for leukodystrophies, which can result in a lack of treatment or insufficient treatment.

### Transcriptome-wide effects of a POLR3A gene mutation in patients with an unusual phenotype of striatal involvement [^1133Gbd6]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

RNA polymerase III is essential for the transcription of non-coding RNAs, including tRNAs. Mutations in the genes encoding its largest subunits are known to cause hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HLD7) with pathogenetic mechanisms hypothesised to involve impaired availability of tRNAs. We have identified a founder mutation in the POLR3A gene that leads to aberrant splicing, a premature termination codon and partial deficiency of the canonical full-length transcript. Our clinical and imaging data showed no evidence of the previously reported white matter or cerebellar involvement; instead the affected brain structures included the striatum and red nuclei with the ensuing clinical manifestations. Our transcriptome-wide investigations revealed an overall decrease in the levels of Pol III-transcribed tRNAs and an imbalance in the levels of regulatory ncRNAs such as small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs and snoRNAs). In addition, the Pol III mutation was found to exert complex downstream effects on the Pol II transcriptome, affecting the general regulation of RNA metabolism.

Patients and exome sequencing

Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The project was approved by the research ethics committee of the Montreal Children Hospital (11-105-PED), the institutional review board of the VU University Medical Center, Neuroscience Campus, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, the Children's National Health System as part of the Myelin Disorders Bioregistry Project in Washington, DC and the University of Queensland, Australia. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients and family members using the Qiagen Gentra Puregene Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Exome sequencing was performed in two cases by PerkinElmer (Branford, Connecticut, USA) and in a third case by the Institute for Molecular Biology at the University of Queensland. Cases one and two were sequenced using PerkinElmer's sequencing service using the Agilent Sure Select Human All Exon Capture V4 Kit and exome sequencing for these two cases was performed (two paired-end 100-bp reads) with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Reads were aligned to the reference human genome (UCSC Genome Browser hg19) with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), SAMtools, Picard (see web resource) and CASAVA v1.8 (ref.) and annotated using the snpEff software tool, as well as visualization tools from PerkinElmer. Subsequent analyses were performed using the Ingenuity software package (Qiagen, Redwood City, USA). Exome enrichment for case three was performed using the Illumina Nextera Rapid Capture kit and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (2 × 100 bp paired-end). Reads were aligned to the reference human genome (GRCh37) and pedigree-informed variant calling was performed using the Real Time Genomics (RTG) integrated analysis tool rtg Family v3.2. Variants were annotated using SnpEff v3.4. In all cases, filtering queries were created as specific presets that allowed in silico reduction of variant lists down to candidates with correlation to phenotype, transmission mode of inheritance and alteration classification of pathogenicity. Sanger sequencing and co-segregation analysis were performed on genomic DNA using primer pairs designed with the primer3 software package and the genomic sequence of POLR1C (NM_203290; GRCh37/hg19). PCR products were forward- and reverse-sequenced at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre using an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (ABI; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were analysed using SeqMan 4.03 (DNAStar, Wisconsin, USA) and Chromas 1.62 (Technelysium Pty, Ltd, Australia).

### Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern recognition in pol III-related leukodystrophies [^116gZMZd]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Pol III-related leukodystrophies are caused by mutations in POLR3A and POLR3B genes and all share peculiar imaging and clinical features. The objectives of this study are (1) to define the neuroradiologic pattern in a cohort of POLR3A and POLR3B subjects and (2) to compare the neuroradiologic pattern of Pol III-related leukodystrophies with other hypomyelinating disorders. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 13 patients with POLR3A and POLR3B mutations and of 14 patients with other hypomyelinating disorders were analyzed. All the subjects with Pol III-related leukodystrophies presented hypomyelination associated with T2 hypointensity of the thalami and/or the pallida. Twelve subjects (92%) presented T2 hypointensity of the optic radiations. Cerebellar atrophy was observed in most patients (92%). The combination of the analyzed criteria identified patients with Pol III-related leukodystrophies with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 92.9%.

### Mutations in POLR3A and POLR3B are a major cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophies with or without dental abnormalities and / or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [^116EextA]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterised by abnormal central nervous system white matter. Mutations in POLR3A and POLR3B genes were recently reported to cause four clinically overlapping hypomyelinating leukodystrophy phenotypes. Our aim was to investigate the presence and frequency of POLR3A and POLR3B mutations in patients with genetically unexplained hypomyelinating leukodystrophies with typical clinical and/or radiologic features of Pol III-related leukodystrophies.

Methods

The entire coding region and the flanking exon/intron boundaries of POLR3A and/or POLR3B genes were amplified and sequenced in 14 patients.

Results

Recessive mutations in POLR3A or POLR3B were uncovered in all 14 patients. Eight novel mutations were identified in POLR3A: six missenses, one nonsense, and one frameshift mutation. Seven patients carried compound heterozygous mutations in POLR3B, of whom six shared the common mutation in exon 15 (p.V523E). Seven novel mutations were identified in POLR3B: four missenses, two splice sites, and one intronic mutation.

Conclusions

To date, our group has described 37 patients, of whom 27 have mutations in POLR3A and 10 in POLR3B, respectively. Altogether, our results further support the proposal that POLR3A and POLR3B mutations are a major cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophies and suggest that POLR3A mutations are more frequent.

### Recessive mutations in POLR3B, encoding the second largest subunit of pol III, cause a rare hypomyelinating leukodystrophy [^115Q1AGe]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Mutations in POLR3A encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) were found to be responsible for the majority of cases presenting with three clinically overlapping hypomyelinating leukodystrophy phenotypes. We uncovered in three cases without POLR3A mutation recessive mutations in POLR3B, which codes for the second largest subunit of Pol III. Mutations in genes coding for Pol III subunits are a major cause of childhood-onset hypomyelinating leukodystrophies with prominent cerebellar dysfunction, oligodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^1136Y6vX]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a group of genetically determined disorders that affect development or maintenance of central nervous system myelin. Leukodystrophies have an incidence of at least 1 in 4700 live births and significant morbidity and elevated risk of early death. This report includes a discussion of the types of leukodystrophies; their prevalence, clinical presentation, symptoms, and diagnosis; and current and future treatments. Leukodystrophies can present at any age from infancy to adulthood, with variability in disease progression and clinical presentation, ranging from developmental delay to seizures to spasticity. Diagnosis is based on a combination of history, examination, and radiologic and laboratory findings, including genetic testing. Although there are few cures, there are significant opportunities for care and improvements in patient well-being. Rapid advances in imaging and diagnosis, the emergence of and requirement for timely treatments, and the addition of leukodystrophy screening to newborn screening, make an understanding of the leukodystrophies necessary for pediatricians and other care providers for children.

### Comprehensive genotype-phenotype analysis in POLR3-related disorders [^115VFFmF]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In total, 664 affected individuals were included in the POLR3-RD database. All previously reported patients were included in the database, but not all were included in the described analysis. We excluded 113 published individuals with 64 unique variants from further analysis (analysis cohort: 551/664 cases, 83.0%) based on the following criteria: known non-RNA Pol III disorder (n = 51, e.g. patients with TCS and therefore a disorder mainly driven by RNA Pol I dysfunction and not RNA Pol III), uncertain RNA Pol III impact or atypical gene involvement (n = 23), incomplete genetic diagnosis (n = 16, e.g. ≥ 1 variant not defined), known alternate variant(s) that may be causal (n = 12), or limited clinical information (n = 11). For previously reported disease, POLR3∗ variant allele frequency was not an exclusion criterion. For new cases, allele frequencies > 0.01% were excluded as part of our variant-filtering process. Notably, the analysis cohort includes 73 novel affected individuals (73/551, 13.2%), including 36 novel POLR3A (36/325, 11.1% of POLR3A), 33 novel POLR3B (33/179, 18.4% of POLR3B), and 3 novel POLR1C (3/39, 7.7% of POLR1C) patients. Further breakdown of the prior publication statistics for affected individuals is given in Figures 2 A and 2B and Table 2.

### Disease specific therapies in leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies [^116yFofJ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous, often progressive group of disorders manifesting a wide range of symptoms and complications. Most of these disorders have historically had no etiologic or disease specific therapeutic approaches. Recently, a greater understanding of the pathologic mechanisms associated with leukodystrophies has allowed clinicians and researchers to prioritize treatment strategies and advance research in therapies for specific disorders, some of which are on the verge of pilot or Phase I/II clinical trials. This shifts the care of leukodystrophy patients from the management of the complex array of symptoms and sequelae alone to targeted therapeutics. The unmet needs of leukodystrophy patients still remain an overwhelming burden. While the overwhelming consensus is that these disorders collectively are symptomatically treatable, leukodystrophy patients are in need of advanced therapies and if possible, a cure.

### Leukodystrophies: a proposed classification system based on pathological changes and pathogenetic mechanisms [^116cvioS]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

How should we define leukodystrophies at this time? The term leukodystrophy in its intentional meaning is not applicable to all genetic white matter disorders, because many are not progressive or characterized by primary myelin loss. This term has survived because of its popularity, but has lost its precision in the light of the current knowledge. Many use the term "leukoencephalopathy" to define all disorders that affect exclusively or predominantly the brain white matter. Although linguistically correct, this choice does not distinguish genetic from acquired disorders, degenerative from non-degenerative diseases, and progressive from static conditions. Leukodystrophies were recently redefined as "heritable disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system, sharing glial cell or myelin sheath abnormalities, the neuropathology of which is primarily characterized by involvement of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and other non-neuronal cell types, although in many disorders the mechanism of disease remains unknown, and in other cases is suspected to include significant axonal pathology". With this, the word leukodystrophy has become a term to indicate all inherited white matter disorders. Some may consider this choice to be infelicitous as well, because the term would then define both degenerative disorders, as in its original and still widely perceived meaning, and static, episodic or even improving conditions. Obviously, there is no perfect definition of the word leukodystrophy. It is colored by the state of knowledge at the time of the definition and therefore subject of change. Leukodystrophies are currently defined as all genetically determined disorders primarily affecting central nervous system white matter, irrespective of the structural white matter component involved, the molecular process affected and the disease course.

### Diagnostic algorithm for the differentiation of leukodystrophies in early MS [^112foHqW]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are chronic progressive inherited white matter diseases frequently combined with an inborn error of metabolism. Some leukodystrophies clinically resemble chronic variants of multiple sclerosis (MS), while others exhibit multifocal MRI changes mimicking white matter changes known from MS imaging studies. The risk of misdiagnosing leukodystrophy as being MS is especially high in early disease stages comprising the possibility of initiating an inadequate therapy. Patients with clinical isolated syndromes should carefully be screened for positive family history, atypical clinical presentation or MRI pattern, symmetric involvement of long spinal tracts and peripheral nerves using evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocities and lack of oligoclonal bands in CSF all of which are "red flags" which consecutively may implicate consideration of leukodystrophy. Genetic or biochemical testing is widely available giving rise to a specific diagnosis in most patients.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^114gdvxk]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Genetic sequencing — costs, diagnostic yield, and limitations: The cost can be substantial (up to $15 000 to $20 000). In a cohort of 71 patients with suspected leukodystrophy or genetic leukoencephalopathy, diagnostic pathogenic variants were identified in 35% (25 of 71) and potentially pathogenic variants in an additional 7% (5 of 71), giving a total yield of clinical diagnoses in 42%. Despite in-depth testing, a portion (around 25% to 40%) of cases can remain undiagnosed. Sequencing is as cost-effective as a brain MRI, and some recent work suggests that WGS may be useful as a first-line diagnosis tool.

### Comprehensive genotype-phenotype analysis in POLR3-related disorders [^116J39Hy]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

RNA Polymerase III (POLR3)-related disorders (POLR3-RD) are a group of clinical entities characterized by causal variants in genes encoding Pol III subunits, including POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, POLR1D, POLR3D, POLR3E, POLR3F, POLR3GL, POLR3H, and POLR3K. These typically cause developmental phenotypes affecting the central nervous system, the eyes, connective tissues including bones, teeth, endocrine axes, and the reproductive system. Similar phenotypes can be caused by variants in separate subunit genes (multigenic). In contrast, variants in the same gene can cause different phenotypes (pleiotropy), making genotype-phenotype correlation challenging. POLR3-RD, though individually rare, have never been analyzed collectively. To bridge this gap, we developed an extensive database encompassing all published and unpublished cases of POLR3-RD and conducted the first comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation study across their entire spectrum. This work contributed new cases, representing 13% of all documented cases in the literature, along with 31 novel variants, accounting for 8% of all identified variants. This database was constructed by systematically reviewing the literature and integrating data from patients under the care of our international network of collaborators. The dataset includes genotype curation, bioinformatics, prior publications, and individual patient outcome information. By leveraging this comprehensive data, we were able to establish clear genotype-phenotype correlations for some pathogenic variants, which will help provide optimal clinical care, genetic counseling (including insights into disease phenotypes and progression), and offer valuable guidance for future clinical trial design and patient stratification.

### Biallelic POLR3A variants confirmed as a frequent cause of hereditary ataxia and spastic paraparesis [^116zAAA4]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Haplotype analyses of exome data surrounding the POLR3A gene, revealed a maximal possible length of a common haplotype shared by the probands carrying c.1909+22G > A or c.3655G > T, of 1.9 Mb. The absence of longer shared haplotypes makes it unlikely that any of the two variants has a single recent founder. We could not identify any obvious genotype-phenotype correlations in our study. However, the patients carrying the c.1378_1380del had more prominent extra-neurological features.

Importantly, biallelic variants in POLR3A were found to be the second most common cause of recessive ataxia or HSP in our Norwegian cohort of 521 probands, second only to Friedreich's ataxia. In this cohort, 322 probands were classified with autosomal recessive or sporadic ataxia or HSP. Even if less than a third of these probands had exome data available for POLR3A analysis in this study, the 10 identified individuals with biallelic variants in POLR3A represent a frequency of 3.1%, similar to the frequency found by. No additional carriers of the c.1909+22G > A variant were identified in the 95 exomes. However, our sample size is small and could be prone to several aspects of selection bias, and we thus regard it unsuitable for extrapolating any association (or lack of association) of this variant with ataxia/HSP to a general population of ataxia/HSP. Hence, a properly designed association study would be required to replicate the association results previously reported.

In summary, our study confirms that biallelic variants in POLR3A are indeed a frequent cause of disease in hereditary ataxia/HSP patients. In particular, the c.1909+22G > A variant is prevalent, illustrating the importance and complexity of variants in non-coding regions. Furthermore, we delineate a highly characteristic and consistent clinical picture, comprising early onset ataxia with or without tremor, combined with pyramidal and posterior column findings, dental abnormalities and the key MRI finding of high intensities along the superior cerebellar peduncles. The expanding phenotypic spectrum of POLR3A -related syndromes, now including leukodystrophies, a disease of premature ageing — Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome — and hereditary ataxia/HSP, calls for future disease classification which includes both clinical and genetic information, and for increased awareness of also atypical non-neurological symptoms in complex neurological disorders.

Diagnostic algorithm

Figure 3 shows an algorithm that clinicians can use when evaluating adults presenting with a suspected leukoencephalopathy. As described above, initial assessment should focus on the exclusion of common acquired causes and severe small vessel disease (round 1). If these initial tests are negative and the patient is suspected to have a genetic disorder, then the first line of testing should include white cell enzyme activities, a VLCFA profile (in men), plasma cholestanol and bile alcohols and plasma amino acids, to exclude the classical leukodystrophies which can present in adulthood (round 2). This step is important, as enzyme replacement therapy and stem cell transplant are being explored as treatment options for some of these conditions.

Figure 3
A schematic diagram to illustrate currently available sequencing technologies. Single-gene (Sanger) sequencing is widely available and is performed by amplifying coding regions of the gene of interest by PCR, before sequencing these regions. Introns and promoter regions are not routinely sequenced. Next-generation sequencing-based panel or exome sequencing is becoming more widely available clinically. In this technique, DNA is fragmented, and the exons of multiple genes of interest are selected out for sequencing. Although many genes are sequenced, again only the coding regions are selected. In whole genome sequencing, which is not routinely available to clinicians yet, the DNA is also fragmented, but all the resulting DNA is sequencing, without a selection step. This results in a large amount of data, as the coding regions, intergenic regions, introns and promoters of all human genes are sequenced. Advanced bioinformatics and computing technology are a required part of whole genome sequencing.

### Update on leukodystrophies and developing trials [^112U4a4y]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders primarily affecting the white matter of the central nervous system. These conditions can present a diagnostic challenge, requiring a comprehensive approach that combines clinical evaluation, neuroimaging, metabolic testing, and genetic testing. While MRI is the main tool for diagnosis, advances in molecular diagnostics, particularly whole-exome sequencing, have significantly improved the diagnostic yield. Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial to guide symptomatic treatment and assess eligibility to participate in clinical trials. Despite no specific cure being available for most leukodystrophies, gene therapy is emerging as a potential treatment avenue, rapidly advancing the therapeutic prospects in leukodystrophies. This review will explore diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for leukodystrophies, with particular emphasis on new trials.
