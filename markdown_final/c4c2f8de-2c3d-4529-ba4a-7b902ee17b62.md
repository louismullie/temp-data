## Question

Which tests are best for evaluating Eustachian tube function?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tests are best for evaluating Eustachian tube function. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "best" should be defined in the absence of a gold standard. Then, I should categorize the available tests into objective function measures, patient-reported symptom scales, imaging, and endoscopic visualization. Next, I will examine the comparative reliability and detection performance of leading candidates, notably tubomanometry and sonotubometry, and contrast these with tympanometry and PROMs. After that, I should review adjunctive and emerging options, including nine-step testing, tuboimpedance, and dynamic imaging, and consider patulous ETD-specific tools. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, tiered recommendation and a practical testing algorithm, while double-checking limitations and areas where the data remain weak or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the core premise and problem framing, because I need to ensure I am not overpromising an absent gold standard. Multiple systematic reviews and comparative studies emphasize that no single test reliably captures ET function across clinical contexts, so "best" must balance diagnostic accuracy, repeatability, feasibility, and relevance to obstructive versus patulous phenotypes, and this uncertainty should guide a composite approach rather than reliance on any one tool [^112dcDuQ] [^115WKEiA] [^116tJMYR].

> Next, I should review the test landscape to anchor subsequent comparisons. Objective functional tests include tubomanometry, sonotubometry, continuous impedance and tympanometric methods such as the nine-step inflation–deflation test, and manometric approaches like tubo-tympano-aerography, while symptom measures include the ETDQ-7 and CETDA, imaging adds anatomical and limited dynamic information with CT or MRI, and endoscopy allows direct visualization of the nasopharyngeal orifice and mucosa but not whole-tube function; this categorization is consistent with contemporary comparative cohorts and methodologic reviews, but I should remember that technique and patient maneuvers significantly influence detection across many of these methods [^117PeNwD] [^116FiCUa] [^113qgaFP] [^113F5cde] [^115WKEiA] [^116AT1Ad].

> I will now examine the leading candidate, tubomanometry, but hold on, I should verify both detection rates and repeatability before calling it "best". In healthy ears, tubomanometry has among the highest opening detection rates and uniquely demonstrated substantial between-cycle repeatability in a direct eight-test comparison, which supports its reliability signal where many tests falter; moreover, its quantitative R-value latency index provides standardized interpretation and can be performed with or without an intact tympanic membrane, enhancing clinical utility, though equipment and cooperation are required [^113iVeS9] [^116FiCUa] [^1159BfxC]. Let me also double-check prognostication claims; R-values have not reliably predicted subjective outcomes after balloon dilation, and concordance with pressure chamber ET opening pressure can be modest, so TMM should be considered a strong functional assessment tool, not a stand-alone prognosticator of interventional outcomes [^113zRgus] [^111LT1bw].

> Now, sonotubometry deserves a careful look, and I need to ensure I weigh maneuver effects because they matter. In healthy adults, sonotubometry achieves high opening detection, especially with Valsalva or dry swallows, and maneuvers that raise nasopharyngeal pressure increase detection; a newer variant that applies nasopharyngeal pressure further boosts detection into the 93 to 98 percent range and correlates with R-values and sound pressure, which is compelling, although pediatric performance remains less consistent and requires technique standardization; pairing with endoscopy may reduce false positives and refine thresholds, which I should keep in mind for nuanced cases [^117PeNwD] [^112pyDQq] [^1118EXcj] [^114NSPAY].

> Tympanometry is ubiquitous and objective, but wait, let me verify its diagnostic role in functional ETD so I do not overstate it. Across baro-challenge ETD literature, tympanometry demonstrates consistently poor sensitivity but fair to good specificity, and tympanometric peak pressure can be normal in symptomatic patients, underscoring that normal tracings do not exclude ETD; it also has age-related limitations in infants due to compliant ear canals, and guidelines primarily position it for effusion and hearing assessment rather than as a direct ET function test, so it is supportive but not definitive for ETD [^116tJMYR] [^1137B4w1] [^1137B4w1].

> Let me consider symptom scales next, and I should double-check their discriminative performance to avoid over-reliance. ETDQ-7 is reliable and discriminates well versus healthy controls, but its specificity falls when symptomatic otologic controls are included, and its correlation with objective function measures is only moderate, while CETDA cannot reliably distinguish patulous from obstructive ETD in mixed symptomatic populations; nevertheless, ETDQ-7 is responsive to interventions such as BDET and is useful to quantify symptom burden and track change rather than to diagnose subtype or confirm dysfunction alone [^113qgaFP] [^113F5cde] [^116fLNtJ] [^116nwfEv].

> Adjunctive and emerging options warrant a brief, careful review, and I should verify where they best fit. Tuboimpedance may detect openings at lower pressures with strong repeatability, suggesting a potential advantage over tubomanometry, but it remains exploratory and not yet widely available; nine-step inflation–deflation testing is particularly relevant for baro-challenge ETD with variable accuracy across studies, indicating a role when pressure-environment symptom provocation is central; imaging with CT or MRI offers valuable anatomy and limited dynamic assessment but is not recommended for routine functional diagnosis, though dynamic protocols and Valsalva-enhanced CT can visualize segments of opening; endoscopy adds mucosal and valve insight but should be considered supportive rather than a primary function test [^114CcogR] [^116tJMYR] [^115WKEiA] [^1131KeDE] [^116AT1Ad].

> But wait, what if the phenotype is patulous rather than obstructive, because the testing emphasis shifts. For patulous ETD, observation of tympanic membrane movement synchronous with breathing, symptom-based instruments such as the PHI-10, sonotubometry with postural change, and even sitting CT in select cases can aid diagnosis, while nasal-noise masking audiometry shows only small effects with wide variability and limited clinical utility, so objective breath-synchronous signs and posture-modified sonotubometry are more informative than standard obstructive ETD tests in this subtype [^1134J8SP] [^112ZYwFJ] [^117XexvF].

> I need to synthesize a pragmatic hierarchy, but hold on, I should ensure each tier aligns with evidence on repeatability and clinical feasibility. When available, tubomanometry is my Tier 1 choice for objective functional assessment because it combines high detection with the best demonstrated repeatability and standardized quantitative outputs, and it is usable with or without an intact tympanic membrane; Tier 2 choices include sonotubometry, which is noninvasive and performant with optimized maneuvers or applied nasopharyngeal pressure, and nine-step testing in baro-challenge presentations; PROMs like ETDQ-7 should accompany objective tests for baseline and outcomes, while tympanometry should be used as an adjunct to characterize middle ear status rather than to diagnose ETD itself [^113iVeS9] [^117PeNwD] [^112pyDQq] [^116tJMYR] [^113qgaFP].

> Let me propose a practical testing algorithm, and I should double-check that it accounts for common confounders such as rhinitis. Start with targeted history to differentiate obstructive, patulous, and baro-challenge patterns, otoscopy, and baseline tympanometry given its availability; if obstructive ETD is suspected, select tubomanometry as the primary functional test where available, otherwise sonotubometry with optimized maneuvers, and consider nine-step testing when symptoms are pressure-environment linked; if patulous ETD is suspected, prioritize breath-synchronous tympanic membrane observation, posture-modified sonotubometry, and selective imaging if anatomy is in question; throughout, track ETDQ-7 for symptom burden and response to therapy, and remember that comorbid rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis are common in symptomatic patients even with near-normal TPP, which should temper overreliance on tympanometry alone [^1137B4w1] [^113iVeS9] [^117PeNwD] [^1134J8SP] [^113ZG1c6] [^116nwfEv].

> Finally, I should confirm the key limitations so we do not jump to conclusions about any single test. There is no accepted gold standard, technique and maneuver effects are substantial, inter-test concordance can be modest as seen for ET opening pressure between pressure chamber and TMM, and preoperative TMM R-values do not reliably predict subjective outcomes after BDET, so a composite assessment that integrates objective function testing, symptom measures, and clinical phenotype remains the most defensible path until higher-certainty comparative accuracy data are available [^112dcDuQ] [^111LT1bw] [^113zRgus] [^115WKEiA].

The most effective diagnostic tools for assessing Eustachian tube function are **tubomanometry** [^113iVeS9] and **sonotubometry** [^116FiCUa], which provide objective, repeatable measures of ET opening and latency [^112pyDQq]. Tympanometry [^1137B4w1] is a **practical first-line test** to assess middle ear pressure and effusion [^113ZG1c6], while the **ETDQ-7** [^113qgaFP] adds symptom context but cannot distinguish ETD subtypes [^113F5cde]. Endoscopy [^116AT1Ad] and imaging (CT/MRI) [^112dcDuQ] are reserved for **complex or refractory cases** to define anatomy and guide intervention [^115WKEiA]. No single test is definitive [^116tJMYR]; a **combined, patient-tailored approach** yields the most accurate assessment [^117PeNwD].

---

## Objective diagnostic tools

### Tubomanometry

- **Description**: Measures ET opening by detecting pressure changes in the external auditory canal during nasopharyngeal pressure application [^114CcogR] and swallowing [^1159BfxC].
- **Effectiveness**: High repeatability and reliability [^114CcogR]; opening detected in > 85% of healthy ears with substantial agreement (ICC > 0.61) [^113iVeS9].
- **Clinical utility**: Objective, repeatable, and widely used [^113iVeS9]; considered the most reliable single test for ET opening.

---

### Sonotubometry

- **Description**: Assesses ET ventilatory function [^1118EXcj] by measuring sound transmission through the ET during maneuvers [^117PeNwD].
- **Effectiveness**: High detection rates (up to 94%) in healthy ears [^117PeNwD]; non-invasive and well-tolerated [^116FiCUa].
- **Clinical utility**: Useful for detecting ET opening; results can be ambiguous in children, requiring further validation [^1118EXcj].

---

### Tympanometry

- **Description**: Measures middle ear pressure and compliance [^1137B4w1], indirectly assessing ET function [^113ZG1c6].
- **Effectiveness**: Practical first-line test [^1137B4w1]; type B/C tympanograms suggest ETD but are not specific [^113ZG1c6].
- **Clinical utility**: Widely available and non-invasive [^1137B4w1]; best used with other tests due to limited specificity.

---

### Pressure chamber testing

Pressure chamber testing evaluates Eustachian tube function under controlled pressure changes that simulate **barometric stress** [^116tJMYR]. It provides detailed functional data [^115fiSJh] but is limited by availability and patient tolerance. While useful for baro-challenge ETD [^113zWbCq], it is **not routinely available** in clinical practice [^111LT1bw].

---

## Subjective diagnostic tools

### Eustachian tube dysfunction questionnaire (ETDQ-7)

The ETDQ-7 is a seven-item patient-reported measure of Eustachian tube dysfunction symptom severity [^113qgaFP]. It has good internal consistency and test-retest reliability but **cannot distinguish obstructive from patulous ETD** [^113F5cde]. It is **useful for symptom assessment and monitoring** [^113qgaFP], but it is not disease-specific [^113F5cde].

---

### Cambridge ETD assessment (CETDA)

The Cambridge ETD assessment [^113F5cde] is a ten-item patient-reported outcome measure developed to **distinguish patulous from obstructive ETD**. It shows good validity but **limited specificity** in mixed otological populations and is useful for symptom assessment [^113F5cde].

---

## Imaging modalities

### Computed tomography (CT)

Computed tomography [^112dcDuQ] provides **detailed anatomical assessment** of the Eustachian tube and surrounding structures [^112nwuZb]. It is useful for identifying anatomical abnormalities [^115B8AZA] but offers **limited functional assessment** [^112dcDuQ]. CT is valuable for surgical planning and complex cases [^115WKEiA] but is not routinely used for functional assessment [^112dcDuQ] [^115WKEiA].

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Magnetic resonance imaging offers detailed **soft tissue assessment** [^112dcDuQ] and potential dynamic evaluation of Eustachian tube function [^115B8AZA]. It provides good soft tissue definition but **limited functional assessment** [^1131KeDE]. MRI is useful for complex cases and surgical planning but is not routinely used for functional assessment [^112dcDuQ].

## Comparative effectiveness and clinical recommendations

| **Diagnostic tool** | **Effectiveness** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tubomanometry | High repeatability; reliable | Objective; widely used | Requires patient cooperation |
| Sonotubometry | High detection; non-invasive | Useful; well-tolerated | Ambiguous in children |
| Tympanometry | Practical; widely available | First-line; non-invasive | Limited specificity |
| Pressure chamber | Detailed functional data | Useful for baro-ETD | Limited availability |
| ETDQ-7 | Good reliability | Symptom monitoring | Not disease-specific |
| CT/MRI | Detailed anatomy | Surgical planning | Limited functional data |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Tubomanometry and sonotubometry [^117PeNwD] are the **most effective objective tools** for assessing ET function [^113iVeS9], with tubomanometry offering the highest reliability [^113iVeS9]. Tympanometry remains a practical first-line test [^1137B4w1], while subjective tools such as ETDQ-7 provide symptom context but lack specificity [^113F5cde]. Imaging is reserved for complex or refractory cases [^115WKEiA]. A **combined, patient-tailored approach** yields the most accurate assessment [^116tJMYR].

### The repeatability of tests of eustachian tube function in healthy ears [^113iVeS9]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

Many objective tests of eustachian tube (ET) function have been devised for clinical and research use, but they have not been directly compared or characterized. As a first step in identifying tests to incorporate into an outcome set for ET dysfunction, we assessed the repeatability of a panel of eight of these tests in healthy ears.

- **Study design**: Comparison of eight tests of ET function.

- **Methods**: The following tests were investigated in combination with Valsalva, Toynbee, swallow, or sniff maneuvers: 1) patient-reported ET opening, 2) observed tympanic membrane movement, 3) continuous impedance, 4) canal manometry, 5) sonotubometry, 6) nine-step test, 7) tubomanometry, and 8) tympanometry at rest. Forty-two healthy volunteers were recruited. Each test was performed in 20 different ears and repeated immediately three times in each cycle, with four cycles performed at 20-minute intervals. Repeatability of detected ET opening was compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

- **Results**: Mean ET opening rate with each test ranged from 30% to 95%. Variation in detection of ET opening was less when tests were repeated immediately (ICC = 0.61) compared to between cycles (ICC = 0.49), suggesting there may be significant changes in ET function in the short term. Tubomanometry was the only test to combine a detected ET opening rate of > 85% and substantial agreement of results (ICC > 0.61) between test cycles.

- **Conclusions**: Tubomanometry was the most reliable test at detecting ET opening. When tests of ET function are used in clinical practice, tubomanometry can be considered a reliable option.

### Comparison of sonotubometry, impedance, tubo-tympano-aerography, and tubomanometry to test eustachian tube function [^116FiCUa]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to explore the characteristics of sonotubometry, impedance, tubo-tympano-aerography (TTAG), and tubomanometry (TMM) in volunteers with healthy eustachian tubes (ET), as there is currently no gold standard for diagnosing ET dysfunction. This aims to provide an objective basis for the clinical diagnosis of ET dysfunction.

- **Materials and methods**: Sonotubometry, impedance, TTAG, and TMM tests were performed on 110 healthy ears of 55 volunteers, with characteristics of each ET test compared and discussed.

- **Results**: The ET opening rate was compared among sonotubometry with dry swallowing, impedance with the Valsalva maneuver, TTAG with the Valsalva maneuver, and TMM with a nasopharyngeal pressure of 50 mbar in 100 (90.9%), 102 (92.7%), 99 (90.0%), and 104 (94.5%) ears, respectively; there was no significant difference among the four methods (P = 0.575). In sonotubometry, both dry swallowing and the Valsalva maneuver were superior to wet swallowing in detecting ET opening (P = 0.000). In TMM, both the opening rate and the external auditory canal pressure were positively correlated with the nasopharyngeal pressure. Specifically, the opening rate and external auditory canal pressure increased with an increase in nasopharyngeal pressure (r = 0.271, P = 0.000; r = 0.315, P = 0.000, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: Sonotubometry, impedance, TTAG, and TMM each have their own advantages and disadvantages. In clinical practice, the appropriate ET function test should be chosen based on the patient's specific condition.

### The performance of patient-reported outcome measures as diagnostic tools for Eustachian tube dysfunction [^113F5cde]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

To develop and validate a novel patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) to distinguish patulous from obstructive Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD) and determine the accuracy of PROMs and ET function tests as diagnostic tools for ETD, a study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.

- **Study design**: 1) PROM development and validation 2) Test case-control diagnostic accuracy study.

- **Interventions**: Cambridge ETD Assessment (CETDA) and ETDQ-7 PROMs, sonotubometry, and tubomanometry ET function tests.

- **Patients**: Cases with patulous (n = 7) or obstructive (n = 60) ETD, and controls with no ear symptoms (n = 33) or symptoms from hearing loss or Menière's disease (n = 24).

- **Main outcome measures**: PROMs were assessed for internal consistency, ceiling and floor effects, test-retest reliability, and content, structural, and criterion validity. PROMs and function test sensitivity and specificity were determined as diagnostic tests for ETD.

The 10-item CETDA was developed, showing good validity and performance, though five items suffered floor effects. No score differences were observed among the patulous ETD, obstructive ETD, and symptomatic control groups. Both PROMs had excellent diagnostic accuracy using only healthy controls for ETD but showed poor specificity when controls with other otological disorders were included. Both objective tests had a sensitivity and specificity of 63% and 79% for obstructive ETD.

The CETDA and ETDQ-7 are not disease-specific and cannot distinguish obstructive from patulous ETD subtypes.

### Tympanometry [^1137B4w1]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Tympanometry provides useful quantitative information about the presence of fluid in the middle ear, the mobility of the middle ear system, and ear canal volume. Its use has been recommended in conjunction with more qualitative information — such as history, appearance, and mobility of the tympanic membrane — in the evaluation of otitis media with effusion and, to a lesser extent, in acute otitis media. It can also provide useful information about the patency of tympanostomy tubes.

Tympanometry is not reliable in infants younger than seven months because of the highly compliant ear canals of infants. Tympanogram tracings are classified as type A (normal), type B (flat, clearly abnormal), and type C (indicating significantly negative pressure in the middle ear, possibly indicative of pathology). According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines on otitis media with effusion, the positive predictive value of an abnormal (flat, type B) tympanogram is between 49 and 99 percent. A type C curve may be useful when correlated with other findings, but by itself, it is an imprecise estimate of middle ear pressure and does not have high sensitivity or specificity for middle ear disorders.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^112dcDuQ]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

The difficulties associated with clinically testing Eustachian tube (ET) function were recognized over 50 years ago, when imaging was proposed as a non-invasive method of assessing function under more physiological conditions than could be achieved by using pressure-based tests or catheterization. The location, shape, and orientation of the ET, and its mixed tissue composition, mean that no imaging modality has proven to be superior overall.

The ultimate test of a new imaging technique is to assess its impact on the management of patients. Whilst one description of image-guided treatment was found, no identified publications described the use of imaging in clinical decision making for the identification and management of ET disorders.

Radiographic and scintigraphy tests that directly measure ET function could have potential for clinical use if developed. However, despite many being described decades ago, they have not entered standard practice. This is largely due to the same problems that clinic-based tests of ET function face, such as reliance on skilled and experienced technicians and, in many cases, a requirement for a tympanic membrane perforation or grommet. If considered as a test for Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD), the sensitivity and specificity of identified imaging strategies would be poor in most cases, due in part to the heterogeneous mix of pathologies and presentations linked to the condition.

The future of ET assessment, and in particular functional assessment, probably lies in the development of CT and MRI techniques that can demonstrate both detailed anatomy and function.

### Interpretation of normal and abnormal tympanogram findings in eustachian tube dysfunction [^113ZG1c6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between objective tympanogram values and patient-reported symptoms, along with their associations with common comorbid conditions.

A cross-sectional study with prospective data collection was conducted at a tertiary medical center. Patients undergoing routine audiometric evaluation between October 2018 and June 2019 were included. Participants with temporomandibular joint dysfunction, inner ear hydrops, and similar conditions were excluded. Symptoms were assessed using the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire. Demographics and medical comorbidities were recorded from medical records. An analysis of tympanometric peak pressure (TPP), demographics, and comorbidities was performed to determine associations with clinically significant eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) symptoms.

A total of 250 patients were included, with similar demographics: 101 (40.4%) in the asymptomatic group and 149 (59.6%) in the symptomatic group. The median (interquartile range) TPP was -10 (20) daPa for the asymptomatic group and -25 (100) daPa for the symptomatic group. A diagnosis of rhinitis was more likely to be associated with significant ETD symptoms (adjusted odds ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.23–5.63). A subgroup analysis revealed that symptomatic patients with normal TPP values were negatively skewed compared to asymptomatic patients. The symptomatic group had a higher prevalence of rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis than the asymptomatic group.

In conclusion, patients with symptoms of ETD may have a TPP within a range typical for their condition.

### Sonotubometry: Eustachian tube ventilatory function test: A state-of-the-art review [^1118EXcj]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

The disturbance of any of the Eustachian tube (ET) functions may contribute to the development of otitis media. Sonotubometry measures the ventilatory function using sound. The qualities of sonotubometry as a test for ET ventilatory function have been studied by various investigators. The development of the method is described in the review, along with a summary of the study results to estimate the diagnostic potential of this ET function test.

- **Data sources**: The English-language literature on the topic was systematically searched using Medline and PubMed. Keywords included ventilatory function, Eustachian tube, sonotubometry, and function test, with no year of publication limits.

- **Study selection**: Articles that described the method itself (validity, reproducibility, diagnostic value) were studied in detail.

- **Data extraction**: All articles described in the study selection were used for this review.

- **Conclusions**: The technique of sonotubometry has gradually improved. The results are at least as good as those of other function tests. However, the results still tend to be ambiguous in children, where otitis media is most common, necessitating further evaluation of reproducibility and application. Sonotubometry has advantages over other function tests but is not used routinely to assess ET ventilatory function, as its value for clinical practice has not yet been adequately demonstrated. The review indicated that sonotubometry can be… (incomplete text).

### Imaging of the eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^115WKEiA]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube (ET) imaging is increasingly important given the renewed interest in ET disorders generated by novel clinical tests and emerging surgical treatments. No single imaging modality has proven sufficient when examining ET anatomy or function; but if chosen carefully, certain protocols can offer radiologists and otolaryngologists significant useful information. A review of the literature has demonstrated that currently, there is insufficient evidence suggesting that imaging should be part of routine ET assessment, and none of the techniques designed to assess ET function can be recommended for use outside of a research setting. However, MRI and CT can provide significant anatomical detail. New high-resolution and rapid-acquisition MRI and CT scanning techniques are under development and may still provide a clinically useful, non-invasive test of ET function.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^112nwuZb]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Radiological features of obstructive ETD**: The imaging findings associated with ETD have not been extensively described, with only six published papers identified as describing features detectable on imaging that are suggestive of ETD. All except one are based on CT findings.

Two groups found that the bony channel for the Eustachian tube within the temporal bone was of reduced cross-sectional size in individuals with obstructive ETD. One group found that the tube ran at a shallower angle in diseased ears. Kanzaki et al. highlighted one of the weaknesses of using CT to assess soft tissues; by scanning pre- and post-grommet insertion, they demonstrated that mucus and fluid cannot easily be distinguished from soft tissue obstructing the lumen. After grommet insertion, they could localize what appeared to be mucosal thickening in some patients with ETD. This finding was shared with Liang et al, who found that these mucosal changes correlated well with tympanometry results. Tympanometry measures middle ear pressure, which is close to atmospheric pressure if the ET is functioning normally.

In the only study to use MRI, Lukens et al. found good soft tissue definition and were able to analyze ET opening with real-time turbo-gradient echo sequences during a Valsalva maneuver.

### Endoscopic examination of the eustachian tube: a step-by-step approach [^116AT1Ad]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to develop a step-by-step approach for endoscopic examinations of the eustachian tube on awake patients and to report anatomic and functional findings. This prospective study was conducted at a university hospital with a convenience sample of seven individuals without a history of ear disease. The intervention involved diagnostic transnasal-transpharyngeal videoendoscopy of the eustachian tube using 30- and 70-degree rigid Hopkins rod endoscopes, as well as 2.5- and 0.8-mm, 0-degree flexible fiber endoscopes performed under local anesthesia in 12 eustachian tubes.

- **Main outcome measures**: Utility of the various endoscopes for the diagnosis in different parts of the eustachian tube; quality of vision and the patient's comfort during the procedure.

The results indicated that the 2.5-mm flexible endoscope was most useful for examining the pharyngeal ostium and the cartilaginous lumen of the tube. The isthmus region could only be accessed using an 0.8-mm fiberscope. In all cases, it was possible to insert the endoscope into the middle ear cavity. Eleven of the 12 tube examinations showed normal findings. The mobility of the tubal cartilage could be visualized with sufficient quality. In 50% of all examinations, application of local anesthesia via a tube catheter was necessary to make the procedure tolerable.

In conclusion, the presented approach allows an assessment of both anatomic and functional changes to the eustachian tube in awake patients. The assessment of middle ear structures is limited. To ensure a comfortable and safe procedure, the use of topical anesthesia is recommended.

### Validating the clinical assessment of eustachian tube dysfunction: The Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) [^113qgaFP]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is a common condition that is associated with otologic and rhinologic symptoms. The complete assessment of ETD is limited without a valid symptom score. We developed and conducted initial validation of the seven-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7), a disease-specific instrument to assess symptoms with respect to ETD.

- **Study design**: Validation study.

- **Methods**: The ETDQ-7 was developed using standard survey methodology. The ETDQ-7 was completed by a group of 50 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with ETD and 25 non-ETD patients who served as a control group. Tympanometry was used as a criterion standard to distinguish the two groups. A subset of respondents repeated the ETDQ-7 at a time point 4 weeks later.

- **Results**: Content validity for the ETDQ-7 was established by focus group and review of the literature. Reliability testing indicated acceptable internal consistency for the entire instrument (Cronbach α = .71). The test-retest reliability indicated good correlation between the two questionnaires completed by the same patient 4 weeks apart (r = 0.78). The ETDQ-7 was able to discriminate between patients with ETD and those without (P < .001), indicating excellent discriminant validity.

- **Conclusions**: The ETDQ-7 is a valid and reliable symptom score for use in adult patients with ETD that may facilitate clinical practice by highlighting the impact of ETD. Further testing is needed to determine its usefulness in assessing treatment response.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^115B8AZA]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

The Eustachian tube is a complex and inaccessible structure that maintains middle ear ventilation to facilitate the transmission of sound from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. A renewed interest in treatments for Eustachian tube dysfunction has led to a demand for methods of imaging the Eustachian tube and assessing tube opening non-invasively. This review aims to summarize the use of imaging in the anatomical assessment of the Eustachian tube and to explore how radiological techniques can be used to assess tube function.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was performed with narrative data analysis.

- **Results**: With high-resolution images, the soft and bony anatomy of the Eustachian tube can be assessed in detail. CT and MRI are best suited to identifying features associated with obstructive or patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction, although true assessments of function have only been achieved with contrast-enhanced radiographs and scintigraphy. A single modality has yet to provide a complete assessment. No test has entered routine clinical use, but further development and research is underway.

- **Conclusion**: Significant information can be gained from imaging the Eustachian tube, and as faster acquisition techniques are developed, it is possible that dynamic imaging of tubal opening could play an important role in the assessment of patients with ET dysfunction.

### Characterizing the active opening of the Eustachian tube in a hypobaric/hyperbaric pressure chamber [^115fiSJh]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Active and passive opening of the Eustachian tube (ET) enables direct aeration of the middle ear and a pressure balance between the middle ear and the ambient pressure. The aim of this study was to characterize standard values for the opening pressure (ETOP), the opening frequency (ETOF), and the opening duration (ETOD) for active tubal openings, such as those occurring during the Valsalva maneuver and swallowing, in healthy participants.

- **Design/participants**: In a hypobaric/hyperbaric pressure chamber, 30 healthy participants (19 women, 11 men; mean age, 25.57 ± 3.33 years) were exposed to a standardized profile of compression and decompression. The pressure values were recorded via continuous impedance measurement during the Valsalva maneuver and swallowing. Based on the data, standard curves were identified, and the ETOP, ETOD, and ETOF were determined.

- **Results**: Recurring patterns of the pressure curve during active tube opening for the Valsalva maneuver and for active swallowing were characterized. The mean value for the Valsalva maneuver for ETOP was 41.21 ± 17.38 mbar; for the ETOD, it was 2.65 ± 1.87 seconds. In the active pressure compensation by swallowing, the mean value for the ETOP was 29.91 ± 13.07 mbar, and for the ETOD, it was 0.82 ± 0.53 seconds.

- **Conclusion**: Standard values for the opening pressure of the tube and the tube opening duration for active tubal openings (Valsalva maneuver, swallowing) were described, and typical curve gradients for healthy subjects could be shown. This is another step toward analyzing the function of the tube in compression and decompression.

### A systematic review of Eustachian tube procedures for baro-challenge Eustachian tube dysfunction [^113zWbCq]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of Eustachian tube procedures for the treatment of baro-challenge Eustachian tube dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, databases such as PubMed (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health), Scopus (Elsevier), and CINAHL (EBSCO) were searched for articles. The focus was on articles examining the effectiveness of Eustachian tube procedures specifically for baro-challenge Eustachian tube dysfunction. Outcome measures included symptom resolution, ability to return to work, equalization problems (EP) scores, Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) scores, and pressure chamber testing parameters. A pooled meta-analysis was conducted for dichotomous measures and ETDQ-7 scores.

- **Results**: Eleven articles encompassing 81 patients were included in the review. Of these, 72 patients from 10 articles underwent balloon Eustachian tube dilation, while nine patients in one study underwent laser Eustachian tuboplasty (LET). All participants were preoperatively symptomatic with barometric pressure changes, and 26 out of 30 (86.7%) were unable to work due to these symptoms. The meta-analysis found that post-balloon dilation Eustachian tuboplasty (BDET), 82.5% (n = 30 [95% confidence interval: 42%-100%]) reported improvements in their ability to perform the Valsalva maneuver, 79.1% (n = 16 [57.9%-94.1%]) could return to work, and 84.3% (n = 69 [69.8%-94.7%]) experienced improvement in any symptom. Of the 25 patients with individual ETDQ-7 scores, 79.1% [51.4, 96.9] saw improvements after BDET. For four case series with 36 patients, ETDQ-7 scores decreased by 1.2 [0.7, 1.7] (p < 0.00001).

### A novel Eustachian tube test: Preliminary research of sonotubometry with nasopharynx under pressure [^112pyDQq]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to develop a novel Eustachian tube (ET) test consisting of sonotubometry with nasopharynx under pressure to measure the opening of the ET. We assessed the advantages of this novel approach compared with those of sonotubometry only or tubomanometry only, exploring the possibility of quantifying ET patency.

This was a prospective clinical study conducted at a tertiary referral center. Sonotubometry, tubomanometry, and sonotubometry with nasopharynx under pressure were performed on a total of 106 ears. The ET-opening detection rates of the different test methods were compared using McNemar's test or Fisher's exact test. The correlation between the ET-opening latency index (R value) and nasopharyngeal pressure, as well as the correlation between the sound pressure of the external ear canal and the nasopharyngeal pressure, was assessed via Spearman's correlation coefficients.

ET openings were detected most frequently during sonotubometry with nasopharynx under pressure, with opening rates of 93.40%, 98.10%, and 98.10% at 30, 40, and 50 mbar, respectively. These were significantly higher than those of sonotubometry (80.20%) and tubomanometry (74.50%, 86.80%, and 90.60% at 30, 40, and 50 mbar, respectively). Both R values and sound pressures were significantly different at pressures of 30, 40, and 50 mbar. The R value decreased with increased nasopharyngeal pressure (r = -0.298, p = 0.000), while the sound pressure increased with nasopharyngeal pressure (r = 0.251, p = 0.000).

### Accuracy of the ETDQ-7 for identifying persons with Eustachian tube dysfunction [^116fLNtJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to compare the accuracy of the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) in identifying individuals with Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction based on symptoms and an objective ET function test.

- **Study design**: Cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary referral center.

- **Subjects and methods**: Fifty-five subjects, with and without symptoms suggestive of ET dysfunction, completed the ETDQ-7. Their ET function was evaluated by the percentage of middle ear pressure equilibrated after five swallows (PEq 5) during either a pressure chamber test (for those with intact tympanic membranes) or by the inflation-deflation test (for those with nonintact tympanic membranes). An ETDQ-7 score of ≥ 14.5 and PEq 5 < 60% were used to define ET dysfunction. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curves were employed to assess the level of association between ETDQ-7 scores and PEq 5.

- **Results**: The analysis included 25 asymptomatic subjects (group 1: 15 females, 15 white; mean age, 32 ± 12.8 years) and 30 subjects with ET dysfunction symptoms (group 2: 17 females, 25 white; age, 27 ± 16.3 years). The ETDQ-7 demonstrated a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 100% for correct group assignment, and a sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 78% for predicting PEq 5 < 60%. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.53–0.83) at the participant level and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50–0.77) at the ear level, indicating a moderate level of association. The association was lower, though not statistically significant, for nonintact tympanic membranes (AUC = 0.63 at the participant level and AUC = 0.49 at the ear level).

### The rate of Eustachian tube dysfunction in adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is low [^1159BfxC]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

Tubomanometry (TMM) examination by Estève involves sealing pressure probes in the nose and the external ear canal to measure nasopharyngeal (blue) and ear canal pressure changes (red) after swallowing water.

For the tubomanometry according to Estève, pressure is applied via the nasopharynx, and pressure changes in the external auditory canal are simultaneously measured during swallowing. The tubomanometry according to Estève can be performed on patients with either an intact eardrum or a tympanic membrane defect. In both conditions, the ear canal must be completely sealed with the ear canal probe. An adjustment is needed on the device in cases of a tympanic membrane defect.

The R value, known as the opening latency index, indicates the latency between the application of pressure in the nasopharynx and the measurement of a pressure change in the ear canal. A non-measurable or negative R value indicates obstruction of the Eustachian tube. An immediate opening reflects an R value of 1.

Data were analyzed descriptively.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: a systematic review [^1131KeDE]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

CT imaging has been utilised in the analysis of ET opening, which is still not fully understood. In healthy volunteers, Tarabichi et al. found that by performing CT during a Valsalva manoeuvre, the nasopharyngeal third of the cartilaginous ET could be seen in 94%, and the whole length of the tube in 35%. Interestingly, the group went on to use the technique in ears undergoing surgery for chronic disease and visualised a similar rate of patency in the nasopharyngeal third of the ET, suggesting that the obstruction may lie in the protympanic part.

A 3D CT reconstruction from the group is shown in Fig. 8. Another study comes from McDonald et al, who used cine CT to visualise an air bolus moving up the ET towards the middle ear. While they were unable to follow the progress of a single opening over the entire ET length, the team hypothesised that their finding may explain why clinical tests of ET function suggest that the ET may not always open along its full length. This study examining gas exchange along the ET provides a clear contrast to other studies, which have looked at the clearance of secretions.

Earlier work using radiographs suggested ET opening with progressive closure towards the nasopharynx as a method of pumping secretions out of the middle ear, and these findings were replicated by Niwa et al, who used intratympanic contrast with sequential CT repeats at 1 scan per second. Interestingly, this group also tested the same ears with tubo-tympano-aerodynamic-graphy (TTAG), a manometric clinical test of ET opening during Valsalva.

### Concordance analysis of the pressure chamber and tubomanometer according to Estève for the determination of Eustachian tube opening pressure [^111LT1bw]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Low credibility.

For the diagnosis of Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD), clinical procedures such as tympanometry, micro-otoscopy, and maneuvers according to Toynbee and Valsalva only allow an indirect assessment at the moment. With a prevalence of up to 5%, the selection of patients with ETD and its subtypes is clinically relevant. Dynamic methods of Eustachian tube function assessment include a hypo/hyperbaric pressure chamber and Estève's tubomanometer (TMM). One method of assessing ETD is the evaluation of Eustachian tube opening pressure (ETOP).

- **Material and methods**: We performed a concordance analysis between the pressure chamber and TMM to determine ETOP. For this purpose, we analyzed the measurements of both methods from 28 healthy subjects using Bland-Altman plots, regression according to Passing-Bablok, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. The maximum tolerated clinical deviation of measured values was set at 10%.

- **Results**: A maximum of 53 measurements of ETOP between the pressure chamber and TMM were compared. Mean ETOP for TMM was 28.7 hPa, passive opening was 32 hPa, Toynbee maneuver was 28.4 hPa, and Valsalva maneuver was 54.6 hPa. Concordance analysis revealed the following results: Passive opening versus TMM: Bland-Altman mean difference 3.3 hPa, limits of agreement ± 31.8 hPa; Passing-Bablok regression y = 0.67x + 9.36; Lin's rccc = 0.18. Toynbee versus TMM: Bland-Altman mean difference 0.7 hPa, limits of agreement ± 35.8 hPa; Passing-Bablok regression y = 0.47x + 14.03; Lin's rccc = 0.14. Valsalva versus TMM: Bland-Altman mean difference 24.2 hPa.

### Tuboimpedance: A new test of eustachian tube function [^114CcogR]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction is most frequently caused by a failure of the ET to adequately open; however, there is currently no reliable method of assessing this failure. Tubomanometry has recently shown good interindividual repeatability as a measure of ET function by measuring middle ear pressure after the application of regulated nasopharyngeal pressures during swallowing.

We present the first reports of a novel test: middle ear impedance measurements during standard nasopharyngeal pressure application, termed tuboimpedance. We assess repeatability in healthy ears and any advantages over tubomanometry.

- **Study design**: Exploratory cohort diagnosis study.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.
- **Subjects**: Twenty screened healthy ears (10 volunteers).
- **Methods**: Tubomanometry and tuboimpedance tests were performed while individuals swallowed with applied nasopharyngeal pressures of 20, 30, 40, and 50 mbar. Eustachian tube opening detection rate and test repeatability (measured by intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) for immediate and delayed repeats at each pressure were compared.

- **Results**: ET opening was detected more frequently using tuboimpedance, with a 100% detection rate using a nasopharyngeal pressure of 30 mbar or more, compared to 88% to 96% with tubomanometry. Detection of ET opening at 20 mbar was possible with tuboimpedance. Repeatability of both tests was mostly strong (ICC > 0.7) for both immediate and delayed repeats. Repeatability for the tubomanometry R value was only fair to moderate.

- **Conclusion**: Tuboimpedance may provide a repeatable measure of ET opening that is efficient and effective.

### Outcome measures for baro-challenge-induced Eustachian tube dysfunction: A systematic review [^116tJMYR]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Baro-challenge-induced Eustachian tube dysfunction (baro-induced ETD) is characterized by the failure of the Eustachian tube (ET) to open adequately, which is necessary for middle-ear pressure regulation during ambient pressure changes. There are no well-characterized tests for identifying the condition, posing challenges for both patient diagnosis and research into treatment efficacy. This systematic review evaluates ET function tests as potential outcome measures for baro-induced ETD.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception to March 2017, and reference lists were reviewed for all relevant English-language articles.

- **Study selection**: Tests in included studies were required to measure ET function in patients reporting baro-induced ear symptoms or barotrauma.

- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted in a standardized manner, and studies were assessed according to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) criteria. The primary outcome of interest was the accuracy of ET function tests.

- **Data synthesis**: Due to heterogeneity in subject demographics, ET function test methodology, and reference standards, only a narrative systematic review was possible.

In conclusion, sixteen studies involving seven different types of ET function tests were identified. The nine-step test was the most commonly used outcome measure, with overall test sensitivity and specificity ranges of 37 to 100% and 57 to 100%, respectively. Tympanometry test sensitivity was consistently poor (0–50%), while specificity was higher (52–97%). Published accuracy data for other ET function tests were limited.

### Tests of Eustachian tube function: The effect of testing technique on tube opening in healthy ears [^117PeNwD]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

There is no agreement on the best clinical test for Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction. Numerous tests have been developed to detect ET opening, and all require a patient to perform a Valsalva, Toynbee, or sniff maneuver, or to swallow on demand. We aimed to characterize existing tests of ET function in healthy ears and identify the optimal method and patient maneuver for each test. Our own normative data is presented alongside published comparisons.

- **Study design**: Diagnostic test cohort study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: Seventy-five healthy ears from 42 volunteers.

- **Interventions**: Six tests of ET function, each performed using multiple different patient maneuvers.

- **Main outcome measure**: Detected ET opening rate for each test-maneuver combination.

The results showed the highest detected opening rates were as follows: sonotubometry 94%; nine-step test inflation/deflation 93/94%; continuous impedance 88%; patient-reported opening 79%; observed tympanic membrane movement 78%; and tubo-tympano-aerodynamic-graphy 76%. Valsalva maneuvers were most effective at opening the ET. Toynbee and swallow maneuvers were more effective when performed without water compared to with water. For Valsalva and sniff maneuvers, there was a significant correlation between the peak nasopharyngeal pressure generated and the ET opening rate.

Based on ET opening detection rates, we recommend the use of dry swallows with sonotubometry and the nine-step test for optimal results. These methods should also be considered when testing patient-reported opening and observed membrane movement, and when performing tubo-tympano-aerodynamic-graphy.

### Tympanoplasty with eustachian tube balloon dilation for chronic inflammatory middle ear disease: A randomized clinical trial [^1121S9MK]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Eustachian tube balloon dilation (ETBD) is increasingly used to treat Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction, but its benefit in patients requiring tympanoplasty for chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is unclear.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy of additional ETBD on the Eustachian Tube Score (ETS), hearing outcomes, and subjective ET function in patients with obstructive ET dysfunction undergoing tympanoplasty.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This parallel-group, single-blind, monocentric, randomized clinical trial included patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease and ET dysfunction seen at a tertiary referral center and scheduled for tympanoplasty between January 2015 and November 2019. Data were analyzed between June 2022 and December 2023.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomized to tympanoplasty only or an additional ETBD of the affected side.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcome was the change in ETS, and secondary outcome measures were change in the air-bone gap (ABG) and Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) scores.

- **Results**: From 76 randomized participants, 68 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 34 patients in the tympanoplasty group, 20 participants (59%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 53.4 (12.5) years. Of the 34 patients in the tympanoplasty plus ETBD group, 13 participants (38%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 51.4 (14.5) years. During the first 12 months after the procedure, the difference in mean ETS changes between the tympanoplasty (1.62 [95% CI, 0.66–2.59]) and the tympanoplasty plus ETBD groups was.

### Diagnosis of the patulous Eustachian tube [^1134J8SP]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Low credibility.

To review the diagnosis of patulous Eustachian tube (PET), we analyzed the diagnostic criteria proposed by the Japan Otological Society (JOS).

- **Aural symptoms and procedures**: We reviewed typical aural symptoms of PET and the Eustachian tube (ET) obstruction procedure to confirm the diagnosis of PET.
- **Objective findings**: We examined the objective findings of a patent ET, which can be observed from the movement of the tympanic membrane and through ET function tests like tubo-tympano-aerodynamic graphy and sonotubometry.
- **Additional tests**: We discussed the usefulness of other tests, such as the patulous Eustachian tube handicap inventory-10 (PHI-10), sonotubometry with postural change (Ohta method), and sitting computed tomography (CT) for diagnosing PET.

We have described the diagnosis of PET based on the diagnostic criteria for PET proposed by JOS. PHI-10, the Ohta method, and sitting CT are also useful for diagnosing PET. Further investigation is needed for an accurate diagnosis and precise evaluation of the pathophysiology of this challenging disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^111kmBRZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for otitis media with effusion, more specifically concerning hearing tests, the AAO-HNSF 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining a hearing evaluation if otitis media with effusion (OME) persists for ≥ 3 months, and before surgery if a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion.

### Eustachian tube dysfunction in allergic rhinitis [^1124WPda]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess eustachian tube function in patients with allergic rhinitis and compare them with a control group.

- **Study design and setting**: Tympanometry was performed in 130 patients (260 ears), divided into two groups: 80 cases with allergic rhinitis and 50 healthy controls. Cases underwent skin hypersensitivity tests.

- **Results**: The ages of participants were as follows: cases averaged 21.1 ± 14.9 years; controls, 23.9 ± 15.6 years. The most frequent skin hypersensitivities were Dermatophagoides pt (62%), Zea Maiz (44%), and Cockroach (37%). Tympanometry of cases showed negative values of peak tympanometric pressure in both children and adults (P ≤ 0.05). Among children under 11 years of age, 15.5% of tympanograms exhibited abnormal curves (13% C curves and 3% B curves); only normal curves (type A) were found in the control group.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with allergic rhinitis are at a higher risk for eustachian tube dysfunction, particularly during childhood. Tympanometry is a noninvasive, readily available procedure that may be beneficial in preventing chronic middle-ear disease in these patients.

### Balloon dilation of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube [^115V6zaN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Studies of balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET) have shown encouraging results in small series with short follow-ups. Our pilot study suggested that patients with protracted otitis media with effusion (OME) or atelectasis of the tympanic membrane (TM) could benefit from BET.

- **Study design**: A prospective study where subjects act as their own controls. Patients from the pilot study and additional cases were enrolled in this cohort with long-term follow-up.

- **Setting**: Regional academic center.

- **Subjects and methods**: Out of 80 patients who underwent BET, 41 consecutive Eustachian tube (ET) operations were included. Subjects' inclusion criteria were OME and/or TM atelectasis, type B or C tympanograms, and inability to inflate their middle ears by Valsalva maneuver. All patients had longstanding ET dysfunction relieved only by repeated tympanostomies. Outcomes included the ability to perform a Valsalva maneuver, audiometry, tympanometry, videoendoscopy of the ET with mucosal inflammation rating scores, and otomicroscopy.

- **Results**: All cases were dilated successfully, without significant complications. The mean follow-up was 2.5 years (range, 1.5–4.2 years). Eighty percent (33/41) could perform a Valsalva maneuver postoperatively; none of these ears required new tympanostomy tubes, and subjective symptoms were relieved. Tympanometry results showed overall improvement. Nine patients had persistent perforations and 3 declined removal of the tube. Subjective symptoms were not relieved for 10% (4/41).

The results show that BET can effectively improve ET function in ears with OME and TM atelectasis.

### "Physiological" ear clicking: its origin and potential usability as a test tool for the Eustachian tube function [^115bqGPK]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To explore the origin of "physiological" ear clicks during deglutition or other pharyngeal movements. Unlike disturbing frequent clicks under pathological conditions, these mostly remain unnoticed by the patient.

- **Study design**: Clinical experimental study at a tertiary referral center.

- **Methods**: Ear clicks were recorded by a microphone sealing the external ear canal, parallel to endoscopic or manometric evaluations of the Eustachian tube function.

- **Results**: The acoustic signals (clicks) appear when the tube opens. The clicks might be explained by a disruption of fluid or mucus films covering the mucosa. As clicks were regularly recorded in our tests, they might potentially be used as indicators in a new tube function test, which needs further elaboration.

### Balloon eustachian tuboplasty: A systematic review [^111uQbJN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the evidence on balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET) as a treatment modality for Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). The study followed the PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42014009461.

Twelve databases, including PubMed and Embase, were searched for studies on BET from January 1, 2010, to April 7, 2014. The endpoints of interest included changes in symptoms, middle ear pathology, eardrum status, Eustachian tube function tests, hearing, adverse events, complications, and health-related quality of life.

- **Review methods**: Study quality was assessed using the modified Delphi technique quality appraisal tool for case series studies. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias.

- **Results**: Nine case series studies involving 443 patients (642 tubes) were included, with population sizes ranging from n = 4 (7 tubes) to n = 210 (320 tubes). All studies were of poor quality and featured a high risk of bias. Results indicated a reduction of patient symptoms in the ETD questionnaire (p < 0.001), postoperative normalization of the tympanic membrane, conversion of type B or type C into type A tympanograms, reduced mucosal inflammation, increased number of positive Valsalva and Swallowing tests, improvement in Eustachian tube score, reduction in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT)-22 score (P = 0.001), and increased quality of life (P = 0.001). No serious adverse events were reported.

- **Conclusion**: The evidence on BET remains poor and biased. Consequently, no firm conclusions can be drawn to identify patients who will benefit from the procedure or to accurately predict outcomes.

### Tubomanometry-score as predictor of outcome for balloon Eustachian tuboplasty in patients with Eustachian tube dysfunction [^113zRgus]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Selecting patients with a high expectation for a subjective effect of balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET) is crucial. Preoperative type B tympanograms were associated with an increased risk of not achieving a subjective effect of BET. R values were not found to be a prognostic indicator of the subjective outcome. Despite our findings on R values, assessing the nuances of tubomanometry (TMM) could be essential for clinicians seeking to predict outcomes after BET. TMM remains the most obvious tool for measuring Eustachian tube (ET) function. Large-scale studies investigating alternative use of the measure points on TMM's pressure curves are needed to fully unveil the apparatus's potential.

### Assessment of nasal-noise masking audiometry as a diagnostic test for patulous Eustachian tube [^117XexvF]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

The primary objective is to assess the validity of nasal-noise masking audiometry (NNMA) as a clinical diagnostic tool in our patient population.

- **Study design**: Retrospective case review.
- **Setting**: Tertiary ambulatory referral center.
- **Patients**: Patients with patulous Eustachian tube (PET) were identified from referrals to our Eustachian tube disorders clinic, primarily presenting with symptoms including autophony, aural fullness, and hearing their own breathing. Healthy subjects had no history of ear disease.
- **Intervention**: NNMA was measured in 20 ears of 10 healthy subjects and in 42 ears of 21 patients with suspected PET.
- **Main outcome measure**: NNMA mean auditory thresholds were assessed at frequencies ranging from 250 to 8,000 Hz.

Results show that when stratified as definitive or probable PET based on observed tympanic membrane movement with breathing, both groups had significantly higher NNMA mean auditory thresholds compared to normal ears at 250 Hz (p = 0.001, p = 0.003), 1,000 Hz (p = 0.019, p = 0.001), and 6,000 Hz (p = 0.4, p = 0.001). When stratified based on symptoms on the day of testing, both symptomatic ears and non-symptomatic ears demonstrated significantly higher mean auditory thresholds compared to normal ears at 250 Hz (p = 0.001, p = 0.015) and at 1,000 Hz (p = 0.002, p = 0.004).

In conclusion, our results demonstrate a larger masking effect in patients with PET compared to normal subjects in the low-frequency region. In clinical practice, however, the relatively small effect and the wide variability of results between patients have limited its utility.

### Tubomanometry-score as predictor of outcome for balloon Eustachian tuboplasty in patients with Eustachian tube dysfunction [^116fTkAr]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The Eustachian tube (ET) connects the middle ear and nasopharynx and was first described by the Italian anatomist Bartolomeo Eustachio in the 16th century. Despite its diminutive size, the ET plays a significant role in maintaining optimal pressure in the middle ear and facilitating fluid drainage. At rest, the ET is closed and opens briefly for around 200 milliseconds, either spontaneously or provoked by swallowing, yawning, or other jaw movements. This equalizes the middle ear pressure to ambient air pressure. A disruption of normal ET functionality is called Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and can result in ear discomfort, hearing impairment, and susceptibility to middle ear inflammation and infections.

Currently, the number of reliable, objective tools for evaluating ET functions is scarce. Over the years, different methods have been suggested, including reflex decay, tubosonography, video endoscopic examination, and the Nine-step test. None of these have gained ubiquitous footing in ET diagnostics. Tubomanometry (TMM) is a non-invasive, semi-objective tool invented for testing the opening of the ET, introduced by Estevé in 2001. By applying a constant, standardized pressure via a nasal probe, pressure change in the outer ear canal is established via the ET by swallowing a sip of water. The change in pressure is detected and reflects the opening of the ET. The delay of ET opening, as well as the lack of ET opening, is measured. The test is performed at pressures of 30, 40, and 50 mbar and can be used with both an intact and a perforated eardrum. Several countries have implemented TMM in ear diagnostics.

### Action of histamine on eustachian tube function [^112SUSiQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The role of allergy in eustachian tube dysfunction is controversial. In this study, allergy was simulated by exposure to histamine, and eustachian tube function testing was performed in an experimental rat model.

- **Methods**: Ventilatory function was assessed by measuring passive opening and closing pressures of the eustachian tube after challenge with either transtympanic or intranasal histamine. The mucociliary clearance time of the tubotympanum was assessed by observing dye transport from the middle ear to the nasopharynx after challenge with either transtympanic histamine or control solution.

- **Results**: There was a statistically significant increase in passive opening and closing pressures with transtympanic histamine versus intranasal histamine. In addition, mucociliary clearance times of the tubotympanum after transtympanic histamine showed a statistically significant increase when compared with those after transtympanic control solution.

- **Conclusions**: Transtympanic histamine exposure causes eustachian tube dysfunction in the rat by increasing passive opening and closing pressures of the eustachian tube and impairing mucociliary clearance time.

A clinically useful test for eustachian tube function (ETF) is still lacking. Here, we plan to evaluate the mucociliary function of the ET using the saccharin and methylene blue tests, and compare the outcome of surgery with normal and abnormal ET functions.

- **Study design**: Case series with planned data collection.

- **Setting**: Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore (Manipal University), a tertiary care center in South India.

- **Subjects and methods**: The study comprised 86 patients diagnosed with mucosal chronic otitis media in the quiescent/inactive stage. All subjects underwent detailed clinical examination and investigations. Preoperative evaluation of ETF was compared with postoperative surgical outcomes, and the results were analyzed.

- **Results**: The saccharin test and methylene blue dye test exhibited a good correlation in evaluating ETF. The mean value for saccharin perception time was 17.5 minutes, while the clearance time for methylene blue was 8.1 minutes. ETF was optimal in anterior perforations, poorest in posterior, and intermediate in subtotal perforations. Type 1 tympanoplasty was successful in 94% of cases with normal ETF and in 68% with partial dysfunction.

- **Conclusion**: The saccharin test is a simple, cost-effective, and valuable diagnostic tool to assess the mucociliary function of the ET. While normal ETF generally leads to successful middle ear surgery outcomes, partial dysfunction does not necessarily predict surgical failure.

### Tympanometric findings in young children during upper respiratory tract infections with and without acute otitis media [^112e9MGG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections (URI) likely lead to acute otitis media (AOM) by causing Eustachian tube dysfunction, which creates negative middle ear pressure. Children younger than 2 years of age are at the highest risk for AOM compared with older children and adults. There has been no published study comparing the middle ear status during URI in infants and young children by age group.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from a prospective, longitudinal study of virus-induced AOM. Healthy children 6–35 months of age were enrolled in a study designed to capture all AOM after URI during a 1-year follow-up period. Tympanometry was used to assess the middle ear status; tympanometric findings during the first week of URI were compared among different age groups. Tympanograms were classified into type A (normal), type B (middle ear effusion), and type C (negative middle ear pressure).

- **Results**: Children 6–11 months of age with URI experienced abnormal tympanograms more frequently than older children (P < 0.001). The peak day for an abnormal tympanogram was day 2 of the URI. Abnormal tympanograms tended to be type B in children age 6–23 months and type C in children age 24–47 months (P < 0.001). One-third of children older than 24 months of age had a type C tympanogram during the first week of URI.

- **Conclusions**: Eustachian tube dysfunction and middle ear abnormality during URI are more severe in children younger than 2 years of age compared with older children. These findings could help explain the higher incidence of AOM after URI in younger children.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^115CqKba]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

There are two clinical requirements for the radiological assessment of the Eustachian tube (ET): a reliable test of ET function and detailed anatomical imaging of the ET and its surrounding structures for surgical planning. The inaccessibility of the ET has contributed to the current lack of a reliable test for determining ET function, meaning that many diagnoses are based on clinical history alone. The lack of reliable outcome measures for ET dysfunction (ETD) has hindered research into new treatments and complicated patient selection for new therapies. Imaging may provide a useful non-invasive solution to assessing ET function.

Surgeons increasingly require imaging in pre-operative planning for complex skull base surgery, ET resection in malignancy, and new interventions for ETD such as balloon dilatation tuboplasty. The proximity of the ET to the internal carotid artery and other skull base structures, combined with inter-patient anatomical variation, can make surgery in this area hazardous.

In addition to the evolving clinical need, imaging has been instrumental in developing our understanding of the ET's structure and dynamic function, providing valuable information where cadaveric dissection and in vivo endoscopy have failed. It is likely that new imaging techniques will continue to advance our understanding of ETD.

This systematic review aims to answer the following questions:

- **Which anatomical structures of the ET can be defined radiologically**:
	- Radiological characterization of these structures is crucial for accurate diagnosis and surgical planning.

- **What are the radiological features of obstructive ETD**:
	- Identifying these features can aid in differentiating between obstructive and other forms of ETD.

- **What are the radiological features of patulous ETD**:
	- Understanding these features is essential for targeted therapeutic interventions.

- **How can imaging be used as a measure**:
	- Imaging can offer measurable insights into ETD severity and treatment progress.

### Sonotubometric assessment for severity of patulous eustachian tube [^112ZYwFJ]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the morphological patency of the eustachian tube (ET) and sound transmission via the ET.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review and model experiment.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.
- **Subjects**: A total of 56 ears of 28 patients (9 men and 19 women, aged from 12 to 82 years, mean age 40.4 ± 21.5 years) who underwent sonotubometric measurement using postural change as well as computed tomography (CT) of the ET in the sitting position. This included 26 ears with definite patulous ET, 9 ears with possible patulous ET, and 21 ears without patulous ET.
- **Method**: Commercial equipment for sonotubometry (JK-05A; RION Co, Ltd, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan) was used in two investigations. For the retrospective survey, sound patency of 7kHz band noise via the ET was assessed by comparing the acoustic transfer function via the ET in the sitting and forward-bending positions. Sound patency via the ET was compared with morphological patency of the ET (cross-sectional area in the narrowest portion) assessed by three-dimensional CT of the ET in the sitting position. In the model experiment, the effect of the ET caliber on the acoustic transfer function was examined using a simple model constructed with two truncated syringes with silicone barrels and a narrow connecting tube.
- **Results**: Sound patency assessed by sonotubometry was well correlated with the cross-sectional area at the narrowest portion of the ET in the sitting position (r = 0.786, p < 0.001). Correlation between the sound patency via the narrow tube and the caliber of the tube was also confirmed.

### The rate of eustachian tube dysfunction in adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is low [^117EDWS5]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

From all consecutive patients scheduled for "ear surgery" (excluding paracentesis and/or tympanostomy tubes) in our tertiary university referral center, we selected patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease to evaluate for eligibility of a possible additional balloon eustachian tube (BET) dilatation along with the planned middle ear surgery.

Inclusion criteria were chronic inflammatory ear disease (chronic suppurative otitis media, adhesive otitis media [middle ear atelectasis], cholesteatoma) and an age greater than 18 years.

Exclusion criteria included previous BET, technically unfeasible tubomanometry (e.g. due to inability to understand instructions for performing tests), inability to complete questionnaires, craniofacial or middle ear malformations including cleft palate, previous radiotherapy of the cranium or in the head and neck area, otitis media with effusion with planned paracentesis and/or tympanostomy tubes only, implantation of electronic hearing devices, age less than 18 years, and diseases that do not stem from ETD (noninflammatory chronic middle ear disease [e.g. otosclerosis], tumors, solely external auditory canal conditions, etc).

ET function in the 482 patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease was firstly evaluated with the Valsalva maneuver. In those patients in whom the Valsalva maneuver was clearly and immediately positive, it was assumed that there was no (relevant) chronic obstructive ETD and that an additional BET would thus not be useful. In the other patients, ET function was further investigated with the eus.

### A randomized controlled trial of balloon dilation as a treatment for persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction with 1-year follow-up [^116nwfEv]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). High credibility.

Long-term outcomes in all participants undergoing balloon dilation show significant improvement. Figure 3 illustrates the mean overall ETDQ-7 score throughout the 12-month follow-up among all participants who underwent balloon dilation (randomized and crossover). The mean overall ETDQ-7 score decreased significantly from 4.6 at baseline to 2.1 (change = -2.5, p < 0.0001) at 6 weeks postprocedure. This reduction was maintained through the 12-month follow-up.

- **Mean overall ETDQ-7 scores over time**: For all participants undergoing Eustachian tube balloon dilation (randomized or crossover), p-values are based on the mixed effects model of repeated measures (MMRM) analysis for the comparison between baseline and each follow-up visit. Error bars indicate standard deviations. ETDQ-7 scores of 1 to 2 indicate no to mild symptoms, 3 to 5 indicate moderate symptoms, and 6 to 7 indicate severe symptoms. ETDQ-7 represents the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire.

Table 5 presents the changes from baseline for middle ear function assessments during follow-ups through 12 months postprocedure for all participants undergoing balloon dilation. The percentage of participants with a normal tympanic membrane position improved from 51% to over 80% (p < 0.001 at all follow-ups). The ability to clear the ears with a Valsalva maneuver improved from 33% of participants to over 60% (p < 0.01 at all follow-ups). The percentage of participants with type A tympanograms increased from 71% to 80% or more through 12 months, with p < 0.05 at all but the 6-month time point (p = 0.139).

### Laser eustachian tuboplasty [^112rrCe7]. Otology & Neurotology (2004). Low credibility.

The surgery on the eustachian tube for chronic dysfunction has historically been directed at the bony isthmus but failed to produce lasting results. Dynamic video analysis now demonstrates pathophysiology in the tubal cartilaginous portion. This study investigates a new endoluminal procedure focusing on the cartilaginous eustachian tube.

- **Study design**: Prospective surgical trial.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care private practice and outpatient surgical center.

- **Patients**: One hundred and eight eustachian tubes with intractable dysfunction (middle ear atelectasis or effusion) in 56 patients underwent laser eustachian tuboplasty performed by the first author since 1997.

- **Intervention**: Dynamic video analyses of eustachian tube function were performed perioperatively. Laser eustachian tuboplasties were conducted either unilaterally or bilaterally under general anesthesia through a combined endoscopic nasal and transoral approach to the eustachian tube nasopharyngeal orifice. Carbon dioxide or 980-nm diode laser vaporization of mucosa and cartilage from the luminal posterior wall was performed until adequate dilation was achieved, and the tube was packed. Additionally, a laser myringotomy was performed for temporary middle ear aeration while the eustachian tube was packed.

- **Main outcome measures**: There were two outcome measures: 1) the presence or absence of middle ear effusion or tympanic membrane atelectasis and 2) impedance tympanometry. Dynamic videos were also examined to rate the degree of visible opening of the tubal valve.

### Effect of hamulotomy on middle ear pressure and eustachian tube dysfunction in children with cleft palate: A randomized controlled trial [^116QCBqh]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). High credibility.

Hamulotomy is a surgical procedure primarily performed during the palatoplasty procedure in children with cleft palate. This study aims to explore the effects of hamulotomy on middle ear pressure and eustachian tube dysfunction, which are critical factors in maintaining proper ear function and hearing.

- **Material and methodology**: A total of 24 patients under the age of 3 were recruited for the study and underwent primary palatoplasty. Patients were randomly assigned to either have hamulotomy or not undergo hamulus fracture preoperatively. Middle ear pressure, ear canal volume, compliance, reflex, and eustachian tube function were assessed pre- and post-operatively in patients undergoing primary palatoplasty using impedance audiometry. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, McNemar's change test, and Mann-Whitney U test, with a significance level set at P ≤ 0.05.

- **Results**: Otoscopy revealed that there was no significant difference in the improvement of middle ear status between the groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference in impedance audiometry results in either group. However, the test revealed that middle ear peak pressure in children with cleft palate ranged from -324 to 375 daPa, and 58% of these children exhibited a type B tympanogram.

- **Conclusions**: Hamulotomy does not appear to have a significant effect on middle ear pressure changes, suggesting its safe use in palatoplasty without increasing the risk of middle ear dysfunction. Given the potential benefits of hamulotomy in improving surgical access and tension-free closure during palatoplasty, its use can be considered a viable option.

### Balloon dilation Eustachian tuboplasty for dilatory dysfunction with and without effusion: A comprehensive outcome analysis [^114NbFsb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of balloon dilation Eustachian tuboplasty (BDET) for dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and determine whether adjunctive ventilation tube insertion (VTI) is superior to myringotomy in relieving symptoms for patients with ETD and concurrent middle ear effusion (MEE) treated with BDET.

- **Study design**: A retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care academic center.

- **Methods**: Patients with dilatory ETD undergoing BDET with a ≥ 6-month follow-up period were enrolled and evaluated mainly using Eustachian tube function (ETF) tests and Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7 (ETDQ-7). Participants with concurrent MEE were classified into two subgroups: BDET with VTI and BDET with myringotomy. An intergroup comparison and comprehensive outcome evaluation were conducted.

- **Results**: In total, 35 patients with 50 symptomatic ears were enrolled. According to ETF test results, the normalized ETF rate was 94% at the last visit. The mean ETDQ-7 scores decreased significantly from 3.7 ± 1.4 to 2.0 ± 0.9 after interventions, with the most improvement in symptoms occurring for "ear fullness" and "muffled hearing". For the final visit, strong correlations among ETF tests, tympanometry, and Valsalva results were noted. The aforementioned assessment results did not significantly differ between patients with MEE and those without MEE, as well as between the "BDET with VTI" subgroup and the "BDET with myringotomy" subgroup.

In conclusion, BDET was effective for dilatory ETD, even in cases with concurrent MEE.

### Evaluation of predive parameters related to eustachian tube dysfunction for symptomatic middle ear barotrauma in divers [^115kZZdW]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of middle ear barotrauma. This investigation evaluates the predictive value of several parameters related to tubal dysfunction concerning symptomatic middle ear barotrauma in divers.

- **Study design**: The study was conducted prospectively and blinded.

- **Patients**: The study involved thirty-one sport scuba divers with normal predive audiometry, tympanometry, and general otorhinolaryngologic examination.

- **Methods**: Upon the occurrence of middle ear barotrauma, individual diver predive data on smoking, mild septal deviation, history of otitis media, history of rhinosinusitis, Valsalva and Toynbee tests, and nine-step inflation/deflation tympanometric test, as well as the degree of mastoid pneumatization, were registered for the calculation of predictive value related to barotrauma. All symptomatic ears were examined within 24 hours of diving by an investigator blinded to the predive findings. Barotraumas occurring during an upper respiratory tract infection were excluded.

- **Results**: The divers completed a total of 774 dives (median of 25; range of 3–100). Symptomatic middle ear barotrauma occurred in 19 ears (31%) of 14 divers (45%) at least once. The rate of tubal dysfunction measured by the nine-step test and a mastoid pneumatization below average were significantly higher in divers (p < 0.05) as well as in ears (p < 0.005) with barotrauma. Positive and negative predictive values of both parameters for subsequent barotrauma were between 69% and 76%. By combining these results into a two-test battery using a strict approach (positive on both)…

### Synchronous endoscopy and sonotubometry of the eustachian tube: A pilot study [^114NSPAY]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to describe, for the first time, a method of recording Eustachian tube (ET) function through simultaneous and synchronous endoscopy and sonotubometry, exploring its advantages compared to performing these tests independently. This was an observational study conducted in an academic tertiary medical center involving eighteen healthy subjects.

The intervention involved endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy with simultaneous, synchronous sonotubometry. Each subject performed three maneuvers: pronouncing the consonant "k", swallowing, and yawning.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes measured were the number of ET openings as a fraction of all efforts to open the tube, the duration of each opening, and the sound intensity recorded by sonotubometry.

- **Results**: Six (35.3%) of the 17 subjects used for data analysis did not open their ET during swallowing. Excluding non-openers, the ET opened in 3 out of 4 swallows. The average duration of ET opening during swallowing was 0.44 seconds. Notably, the ET does not open every time the endoscopic view notes dilation. A negative sound pressure wave was recorded in several instances, immediately preceding a swallow-related opening. Contraction of the tensor veli palatini muscle was essential for ET opening.

In conclusion, simultaneous synchronous endoscopy and sonotubometry may enhance the accuracy of measuring ET function compared to when either method is performed separately. Sonotubometry may prevent a false-positive endoscopy, where the ET is viewed as open but no functional patency is achieved. Additionally, endoscopy might lower the threshold considered positive for sonotubometry.

### Tubomanometry-score as predictor of outcome for balloon eustachian tuboplasty in patients with eustachian tube dysfunction [^114gbSQ2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The procedure of tubomanometry involves inserting probes in the nasal vestibule and outer ear canal while the patient sips a small amount of water. During the measurement, the yellow curve represents pressure in the nasopharynx, and the blue curve indicates pressure in the outer ear canal.

The latency index, referred to as the R value, is the ratio of time from the onset of pressure increase in the nasopharynx and the outer ear canal, as defined by Estéve et al. It is calculated using the equation R = (P₁ − C₁/C₂ − C₁) and represents an opening of the eustachian tube (ET). By definition, R values are dimensionless and cannot be negative. R values were stratified into three groups: R value ≤ 1 was considered a normal ET opening, R value > 1 was defined as a delayed ET opening, while an unmeasurable R value (R = 0) indicated no detectable opening of the ET.

Statistics were conducted using STATA (MP 18.0). Comparisons of categorical variables between asymptomatic and ET dysfunction (ETD) ears, as well as ETD ears before and after balloon eustachian tuboplasty (BET), were performed using the chi-square test or Fischer's exact test. Correlations between preoperative measurements and postoperative subjective outcomes were compared using odds ratios. The significance level for all conclusions was set at P ≤ .05.

### Postpalatoplasty eustachian tube function in young children with cleft palate [^115nrKhQ]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2012). Low credibility.

To characterize Eustachian tube function using the forced response test in young children with cleft palate, with or without cleft lip, after palatoplasty with tympanostomy tubes inserted pre-palatoplasty, and compare these results with those of a 1986 study that evaluated a similar population using identical methods.

- **Setting**: Outpatient research clinic.

- **Patients/Participants**: A total of 34 children with cleft palate were tested at an average age of 18.6 ± 4.0 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: Passive and active measures for the forced response test.

- **Results**: Of the sample, 13 ears could not be tested, and tests on 24 ears were incomplete. The forced response test showed that the passive Eustachian tube function parameters were similar to those of normal adults and children. The percentage of ears that showed tubal dilation with swallowing was 60%. The active resistance and dilatory efficiency were similar to those of a normal adult population.

- **Conclusions**: A 1986 study of Eustachian tube function in postpalatoplasty subjects with cleft palate (37 ears) aged 15 to 26 months documented Eustachian tube dilation with swallowing in 84% of the ears. In the present study, which focused on a similar population, the frequency of tubal dilation was 60%. Nonetheless, both frequencies are significantly greater than the dilation frequency of 27% reported for 56 ears of subjects with cleft palate tested between 3 months and 18 years with tympanostomy tubes inserted for persistent otitis media with effusion. This suggests that dilation during the forced response test may be a pro.

### Does palatoplasty technique impact resolution of eustachian tube dysfunction [^115gUXE2]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Two primary outcomes were considered: rates of ear tube sets required following palate repair, and rates of secondary velopharyngeal surgery. Postpalatoplasty ear tube requirements were defined as the number of myringotomies with tympanostomy tube placements performed after the primary palatoplasty. During this study's time period, there was not an audiologic protocol for the patient cohort, resulting in inconsistent documentation and assessment of hearing tests. Since the audiologic information was inconsistent for the patients included, and as it was not a primary outcome or evaluation for the study, further details on this topic were not analyzed. Our institution has since developed and authored an audiologic protocol for our patients with cleft palate.

- **Statistical analysis**: Patients were stratified by palatoplasty technique into two repair groups: Furlow and IVV. For descriptive statistics, categorical variables were reported as frequencies and proportions, while continuous variables were reported as medians with interquartile ranges. Pearson χ² test was performed to compare categorical variables between groups, while continuous variables were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon test. A negative binomial generalized linear regression model was used to analyze the association between the primary outcome and other variables. Independent variables were selected based on variables of interest to this study (repair type, Veau classification, age at repair, fistula repair, and speech surgery) and demographics with statistical significance on our univariate analysis.

### Tensor tenopexy: A clinical study to assess its effectiveness in improving Eustachian tube function and preventing hearing loss in patients with cleft palate [^113u2egE]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

There is a consensus about the occurrence of otitis media in children with cleft palate before repair. However, controversy continues regarding the recovery of Eustachian tube function and the level of hearing loss in patients after cleft palate repair. Levator sling palatoplasty is an important component of the cleft repair. Most surgeons routinely transect the tensor tendon (tensor tenotomy) during the course of palatoplasty, but this procedure may pose a risk to Eustachian tube function.

Some authorities feel that the addition of tensor tenopexy during palatoplasty would maintain the Eustachian tube in an open conformation, thereby improving middle ear ventilation. This study assesses the effectiveness of tensor tenopexy in improving Eustachian tube function and preventing hearing loss in cleft palate patients treated with palatoplasty. A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Department of Plastic Surgery at a tertiary care institute in India.

A total of 17 children aged 9–24 months were assigned to one of two groups: palatoplasty with either tensor tenotomy (n = 8) or tensor tenotomy with tensor tenopexy (n = 9). All patients underwent tympanometry, otoscopy, and brainstem evoked response audiometry before surgery and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. Of these patients, 52.9% already had hearing loss at the time of presentation. Hearing loss and middle ear effusion persisted even after palatoplasty. There was no significant difference in hearing loss and middle ear effusion between the two groups.

### Morphologic measurements of 3d Eustachian tube model and their diagnostic value regarding Eustachian tube dysfunction - A cross-sectional observational study [^111z9Mn2]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the diagnostic value of three-dimensional morphologic measurements of the Eustachian tube on computed tomography in Eustachian tube dysfunction, a prospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted. It included forty patients with unilateral Eustachian tube dysfunction. The clinical diagnosis was verified using the Eustachian Tube Score-7 and the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7.

Computed tomography scans of the temporal bone were acquired while performing a Valsalva manoeuvre to improve the visualization of the air-filled Eustachian tube lumen. The Eustachian tubes were delineated on curved planar reconstructions, and three-dimensional models were constructed. Seven morphological parameters were measured for each Eustachian tube, including the cross-sectional size of the tympanic and pharyngeal orifices, visualization length, inclination angles, and curvature angles. These morphological measurements were then correlated with Eustachian tube scores.

The results showed that the mean value of the visualization length of the complete Eustachian tube and its bony segment were significantly higher in healthy sides compared to pathological sides (p = 0.034 and p = 0.029, respectively). There was a significant correlation between the Eustachian Tube Score-7 and the cross-sectional size of the tympanic orifice (r P = 0.361; p = 0.022). The Eustachian Tube Score-7 also correlated significantly with the visualization length of the complete Eustachian tube (r P = 0.436; p = 0.005) and its bony segment (r S = 0.598; p < 0.0001).

The study concludes that the cross-sectional size and visualization length of the Eustachian tube are important diagnostic parameters for assessing Eustachian tube dysfunction.

### Tubomanometry-score as predictor of outcome for balloon eustachian tuboplasty in patients with eustachian tube dysfunction [^117Ht75Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the predictive value of tubomanometry (TMM) in forecasting the subjective outcome of Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty (BET) in patients suffering from long-lasting Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD).

The study design was a retrospective case series conducted at a single tertiary referral center. A total of 111 ETD patients undergoing 194 BET procedures were included. Demographics, TMM measurements, and tympanograms were registered before and 3 to 6 months after BET. The time ratio between the pressure increase in the nasopharynx and the outer ear canal was labeled as the R value.

At follow-up, 58.8% of the patients were satisfied with BET outcomes. The prevalence of normal R values increased significantly at 30 mbar (12%, P = 0.024), 40 mbar (14%, P = 0.0082), and 50 mbar (13%, P = 0.011). The prevalence of R = 0 decreased at all three pressure levels (−20%, P = 0.0001; −15%, P = 0.0013; and −16%, P = 0.0005, respectively). Type A tympanograms increased from 37% to 56% (P = 0.0002), while type B tympanograms decreased from 44% to 25% (P = 0.0006). Stratifying TMM measurements (R ≤ 1, R > 1, and R = 0) showed that preoperative R values were not prognostic of subjective outcomes. However, a preoperative type B tympanogram indicated a risk of poor subjective outcome.

In conclusion, BET appeared to improve Eustachian tube function with reduced prevalence of pathologic R values and tympanograms. Although preoperative R values were not prognostic, TMM remains promising for assessing Eustachian tube function. Further studies are needed to refine TMM's role in predicting BET efficacy.

### Eustachian tube dysfunction in children with unilateral cleft lip and palate: differences between ipsilateral and contralateral ears [^112L2DVy]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2020). Low credibility.

To evaluate Eustachian tube dysfunction in the ipsilateral and contralateral ears, in children with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), a retrospective chart review was conducted at a tertiary care children's hospital. Seventy-four consecutive patients with UCLP, born between 2005 and 2011 and treated at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Cleft-Craniofacial Center, were included.

- **Main outcome measures**: Conductive hearing loss, tympanogram type, number of middle ear effusions, tympanostomy tubes, and complications were assessed. The hypothesis was formulated prior to data collection.

Conductive hearing loss was nearly twice as common in the ipsilateral ear (43.2%) compared with the contralateral ear (23.0%; p = 0.001, McNemar test). No significant differences were found in the frequency of each type of tympanogram between the contralateral and ipsilateral ears. The proportions of ipsilateral (90.5%) and contralateral (91.9%) ears with effusion were not significantly different. The total number of tympanostomy tubes received was not significantly different between the two ears, with a median of two bilaterally. When combined, complications such as retractions, perforations, and cholesteatomas were significantly more common in the ipsilateral ear (29.7%) compared with the contralateral ear (18.9%; p = 0.039, McNemar test).

In conclusion, in children with UCLP, there were significantly more instances of conductive hearing loss and complications on the cleft side compared to the noncleft side. This suggests that Eustachian tube dysfunction may indeed be more severe on the cleft side.

### Usefulness of the saccharin test for assessment of eustachian tube function in patients with chronic otitis media with perforation [^113tXZ82]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

The eustachian tube (ET) has two important functions: ventilation and clearance of the middle ear. We evaluated the ET ventilator function using sonotubometry and the inflation-deflation test, which are widely used today. The ET clearance function was assessed by the saccharin test. Results from these tests were compared with surgical outcomes to determine which test was more closely related to surgical outcomes.

- **Study design**: Prospective case series.
- **Setting**: A single university hospital.
- **Patients and intervention**: One hundred four ears of 95 patients with chronic otitis media with perforation underwent type I tympanoplasty.
- **Main outcomes and measures**:
	- Based on sonotubometry and the inflation-deflation test, patients were classified into normal, stenosis, and patulous types.
	- Based on the saccharin test, patients were divided into a normal function group and a partial/gross dysfunction group.
	- Surgical outcomes were assessed in terms of hearing results and the condition of the eardrum 1 year postoperatively. Preoperative evaluation of ET function was compared with the surgical outcome.

Sonotubometry and inflation-deflation tests showed no significant difference among the groups in terms of hearing improvement and surgical success rate. The saccharin test revealed that the rate of hearing improvement was significantly lower in the gross dysfunction group. Conversely, the success rate of type I tympanoplasty was significantly higher in the normal group compared to the dysfunction group.

There is a relationship between the saccharin test results and the surgical outcomes for patients with chronic otitis media with perforation.
