## Question

New Kp treatments 2024?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about new treatments for Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2024. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "new" in 2024 versus earlier approvals. Then, I should verify which agents have robust clinical data versus promising in vitro or early-phase signals. Next, I will categorize by mechanism and resistance phenotype, especially ESBL, KPC, and NDM producers. After that, I should review non-antibiotic options like phage therapy and vaccines. Finally, I will synthesize practical, stewardship-aligned recommendations and highlight gaps and uncertainties that could change practice soon.

> Let me first confirm the scope and definitions so I don't misclassify older agents as new. By "new", I mean FDA-approved in 2024 or with pivotal data published in 2024 that materially changes practice, whereas "emerging" refers to agents in late-phase trials or with compelling 2024 datasets that are not yet licensed. I should also distinguish incremental β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (BL/BLI) expansions from truly novel classes or targets, because the former dominate the 2024 landscape and the latter remain sparse [^e386c093].

> I will now examine the most consequential 2024 addition: cefepime-enmetazobactam. Wait, let me verify the approval date and indication. The FDA approved cefepime-enmetazobactam in February 2024 for complicated urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis based on the ALLIUM phase 3 trial, which showed higher composite cure/eradication versus piperacillin-tazobactam, supporting carbapenem-sparing therapy for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, including K. pneumoniae [^4e2f2a05]. Hold on, I should confirm spectrum nuances; unlike some newer BL/BLIs, enmetazobactam does not inhibit metallo-β-lactamases, so activity against NDM producers is limited, which matters for regional epidemiology [^af194f59].

> Next, I should review aztreonam-avibactam, which is not newly approved but has accumulating 2024 data that reshape empiric choices. Let me check the pivotal signals. Multiple 2024 studies show aztreonam-avibactam retains potent activity against Enterobacterales, including CRE, and specifically covers MBL producers like NDM that many serine-β-lactamase–targeting BL/BLIs miss, with 100% inhibition of Enterobacterales at ≤ 8 mg/L in large pneumonia surveillance cohorts and robust activity against MBL-CRE, supporting its role when NDM is suspected or confirmed [^notfound] [^230423d1] [^c3af7faa]. I should double-check guideline alignment; contemporary reviews endorse ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam for severe MBL infections, reflecting this mechanistic fit and growing clinical experience, albeit with implementation challenges around coadministration and testing methods [^60315218].

> Let me consider other BL/BLI combinations with 2024 updates that, while not brand-new, have evolving roles. Cefepime-taniborbactam and meropenem-taniborbactam have expanded in vitro datasets in 2024, but I need to ensure I don't overstate clinical availability. These agents remain investigational in many regions, with promising activity against some KPC and OXA-48 producers, yet they are not replacements for cefiderocol or aztreonam-avibactam against MBLs and should be contextualized by local epidemiology and access [^e386c093] [^9ed6a251]. Hold on, I should verify that these remain pipeline rather than newly approved; yes, they are not 2024 FDA approvals in the provided set [^0afee4a8].

> I should confirm the standing of cefiderocol, which, while not a 2024 approval, remains a critical option for KPC/NDM co-producers and other difficult CRE. Recent genomic and phenotypic studies reinforce that cefiderocol and aztreonam-avibactam are the most reliable agents against KPC/NDM co-producing K. pneumoniae, with 96% susceptibility in curated strain sets, which is highly actionable where these co-variants are rising [^9ed6a251]. But wait, what if local resistance to cefiderocol emerges? Surveillance shows variable activity against MBL producers, so I need to ensure susceptibility is verified before relying on it clinically [^c3af7faa].

> Now, I will examine non-antibiotic therapies, starting with bacteriophage therapy. Let me verify the 2024 advances. Experimental evolution studies published in 2024 demonstrate that directed phage training can expand host range against MDR and XDR K. pneumoniae, achieving sustained inhibition in vitro and in vivo, and a separate study in Pseudomonas VAP supports the concept that adjunctive phage can improve antibiotic efficacy and mitigate inflammation, though K. pneumoniae–specific human data remain limited and access is largely via expanded access or trials [^107ab58b] [^0a89b334] [^80f9f85a]. I should confirm that this remains investigational; yes, routine clinical use is not yet standard, but the signal is promising for refractory infections in specialized centers [^notfound].

> Next, I should review vaccine efforts, because prevention could alter treatment needs. A 2024 NPJ Vaccines report details a modular bioconjugate nanovaccine targeting K. pneumoniae O2, showing improved immunogenicity and protective efficacy in preclinical models; however, I need to emphasize that no K. pneumoniae vaccine is licensed, and translation to humans requires phase 1–3 trials, so this remains a future strategy rather than a 2024 clinical tool [^24e5101b]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even if effective, vaccines will complement, not replace, antibiotics in the near term.

> I should also consider diagnostic and stewardship enablers that change how we deploy these therapies. Rapid phenotypic AST systems are increasingly available and, when paired with stewardship workflows, can accelerate targeted therapy for K. pneumoniae, including early identification of ESBL, KPC, and NDM phenotypes to guide carbapenem-sparing or MBL-active regimens, which is crucial as resistance mechanisms shift geographically [^3613b815] [^067fe722]. Let me reconsider whether any 2024 clearance specifically changes K. pneumoniae management; while several systems gained FDA clearance, the key impact is operational — faster de-escalation and earlier use of agents like cefepime-enmetazobactam or aztreonam-avibactam when appropriate [^067fe722].

> I will now synthesize practical recommendations by resistance phenotype, but I should confirm I'm aligning with current evidence. For ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae causing cUTI or pyelonephritis, cefepime-enmetazobactam is a legitimate carbapenem-sparing option based on ALLIUM, with the caveat that local ESBL prevalence and susceptibility should guide empiric use and stewardship oversight is essential to preserve activity [^4e2f2a05]. For KPC-producing CRE, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam remain first-line when active, with cefiderocol reserved for difficult cases or when these are unavailable or inactive; I should double-check that this aligns with labels and contemporary reviews, which it does [^4e349898] [^c6914ee2] [^620680bb]. For MBL producers, particularly NDM, aztreonam-avibactam or cefiderocol are preferred, with ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam as an evidence-based combination strategy when MICs support synergy; I need to ensure I note the administration logistics and the need for susceptibility confirmation, which are real-world barriers [^60315218] [^c3af7faa].

> But wait, what about special syndromes like CNS infections or liver abscesses due to hypervirulent K. pneumoniae? I should confirm that most of the new agents lack robust CNS penetration data, so intraventricular or adjunctive strategies remain case-by-case, and for hvKp liver abscesses, early source control plus appropriate antibiotics are critical, with cefiderocol or aztreonam-avibactam considered when MDR is present, acknowledging limited direct hvKp-specific outcome data for these newer agents [^051a9cbd] [^f67e6d18]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with current reviews; yes, management remains largely extrapolated from general CRE guidance plus surgical drainage principles.

> Finally, I need to highlight uncertainties and what could change practice soon. The pipeline remains dominated by BL/BLI iterations with limited innovation against MBLs, underscoring the need for agents like cefiderocol and aztreonam-avibactam and for vigilant surveillance of emerging variants such as KPC/NDM co-producers, which are rising in some regions and can be pan-β-lactam resistant except to these backbones [^e386c093] [^6fa297f2]. I should also flag that heteroresistance to ceftazidime-avibactam and other BL/BLIs is increasingly reported, so clinical response must be interpreted alongside MICs and clinical course, and repeated susceptibility testing may be warranted in persistent infections [^ec8acf5f].

In 2024, the most significant new options for Klebsiella pneumoniae infections are **cefepime-enmetazobactam** [^4e2f2a05] (approved February 2024) for complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis, offering carbapenem-sparing activity against ESBL producers, and **aztreonam-avibactam** [^bb120a78] (FDA submission 2024), with potent in vitro activity against MBL-producing CRE, including NDM and KPC/NDM co-producers [^9ed6a251]. Cefiderocol remains a key option for **pan-β-lactam resistant K. pneumoniae**, including KPC/NDM co-producers [^9ed6a251]. No new vaccines were approved, but a promising O2 bioconjugate nanovaccine entered preclinical development [^24e5101b]. These additions expand options for MDR and XDR K. pneumoniae, though stewardship and susceptibility testing remain essential [^620680bb].

- **MBL coverage**: Aztreonam-avibactam addresses a critical gap in MBL-producing CRE [^bb120a78].

- **Stewardship**: Rapid diagnostics and susceptibility testing are essential to optimize use and limit resistance [^3613b815].

- **Pipeline gaps**: Limited activity against metallo-β-lactamases persists; continued innovation is needed [^e386c093].

---

In 2024, **cefepime-enmetazobactam** and the investigational **aztreonam-avibactam** are the most notable additions, expanding options for ESBL and MBL-producing K. pneumoniae, respectively. Cefiderocol remains pivotal for pan-β-lactam resistant strains, and phage therapy and vaccines are promising but not yet standard care [^4e2f2a05] [^bb120a78] [^9ed6a251] [^107ab58b] [^24e5101b].

Antimicrobial therapies against highly resistant organisms

Current antimicrobials against most ESBL-producing organisms include beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam, and meropenem-vaborbactam. However, other antimicrobial agents can also be used for the treatment of such infections and include cephamycins (e.g. cefepime), temocillin, aminoglycosides, tigecycline, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In the case of CRE, "second-line" drugs, such as polymyxins, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, and fosfomycin may be considered.

Between 2017 and 2023, only meropenem-aborbactam, imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam, plazomicin, eravacycline, and a siderophore cephalosporin (cefiderocol) received regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of CRE-associated infections (Table 2). Currently, 32 new antimicrobials based upon traditional mechanisms of action are in phase 1–3 clinical trials targeting WHO priority pathogens (excluding Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Traditional mechanisms refer to the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis, bacterial nucleic acid/protein synthesis, metabolic pathways or membrane function. Of those 32 agents, 14 are expected to have some activity against CRE organisms. The majority of antibiotics in clinical trials, which are mainly BLBLI combinations, have limited or no activity against metallo-beta-lactamases such as the bla NDM (Table 2). This highlights that the antibiotic pipeline remains insufficient to address the challenge of AMR. Further, pharmaceutical industry innovation has largely moved away from the development of novel antimicrobials, due to a lack of profit incentives resulting from short dosing regimens and the rapid bacterial evolution of drug resistance. Although antibiotic stewardship programs do lead to more appropriate antibiotic use and are a necessary part of any AMR strategy, these interventions are also fragile as these are dependent on healthcare providers' perception of antibiotic use, adequate infection control practices, and available infrastructure (e.g. microbiology results provided to clinical care teams in a timely fashion). Thus, a systems-level intervention such as the use of vaccines against Enterobacteriaceae may be the key long-term strategy against AMR.

### Challenges in the management of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial meningitis in children: a decade of clinical insights [^051a9cbd]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis highlights the significant variability in bacterial infections regarding demographics, drug resistance, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes. The high prevalence of MDR infections, particularly among E. coli and Klebsiella spp. underscores the need for stringent antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures. Additionally, the prolonged hospital stays and high mortality rates associated with these infections indicate their clinical severity and the necessity for targeted therapeutic strategies.

Bacterial meningitis caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria presents significant treatment challenges due to limited effective antibiotic options. In the current study, 45.5% of the cases were infected with MDR Gram-negative bacteria, while this rate increased to 70% among the deceased cases. The most prevalent agents in our mortal pediatric cases were Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter spp. consistent with the literature. A 2019 study from North India reported that all Gram-negative isolates in hospital-acquired bacterial meningitis cases were multidrug-resistant. The most prevalent pathogens included Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Notably, only colistin and imipenem were effective against these strains. A study published in 2024 highlighted the substantial clinical challenges and poor outcomes associated with health care-associated Gram-negative bacterial meningitis, especially following neurosurgical procedures. The research emphasized the need for effective antimicrobial therapy and infection control measures to address this issue. Similarly, neurosurgical interventions emerged as a prevalent risk factor in the present study, with 70% of participants undergoing such procedures. Research from 2022 focusing on health care-associated ventriculitis and meningitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria underscored the dangers posed by these infections and the necessity for novel therapeutic strategies. A 2023 review discussed the efficacy of intraventricular polymyxin B in treating carbapenem-resistant multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli infections in the central nervous system. The treatment showed a 78% cure rate, though significant mortality remained, highlighting the critical need for effective therapies. These studies collectively highlight the growing concern of MDR Gram-negative bacteria in bacterial meningitis and the pressing need for effective antimicrobial stewardship and novel therapeutic approaches.

### Tracking international and regional dissemination of the KPC / NDM co-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^6fa297f2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

With the growth of global expansion of KPC-CRKP and NDM-CRKP, KN-CRKP has rapidly increased in recent years, particularly in China and USA. Several studies have reported,– that the percentage of KN-CRKP in CRKP was 0.34% before 2017; afterwards, the proportion of KN-CRKP in CRKP was between 1.2% and 4.4% with a significant increase, similar to that in the current study. However, resistance, virulence, dissemination, and evolution characterizations of KN-CRKP lacked thorough analyses, which were necessary for the prevention and treatment of KN-CRKP, owing to its pan- β -lactam resistance and rapid growth. Considering local and worldwide KN-CRKP, 413 genomes of KN-CRKP, isolated from 32 countries of Asia, USA, Europe, and Africa between 2005 and 2024, were involved in rounded analyses.

### Notes from the field: increase in new delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales-new york city, 2019–2024 [^b0df3ee2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Enterobacterales comprise a large group of gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species; infections with these organisms often require treatment with a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics known as carbapenems. Numerous mechanisms can result in the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), including the production of enzymes (carbapenemases) that render the antibiotics ineffective in killing bacteria. CRE cause health care–associated infections resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality; carbapenemase-producing CRE are particularly concerning because carbapenemase genes are easily spread via plasmid-mediated genetic elements. * Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) has been the predominant carbapenemase among Enterobacterales in the United States since 1996. Another carbapenemase, New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM), is less common in the United States, confers resistance to antimicrobials commonly used to treat KPC-positive CRE (e.g. the combination antibiotic ceftazidime-avibactam), and has previously been associated with returning international travelers. The prevalence of NDM-positive CRE has increased in New York City (NYC) health care settings, including long-term care facilities (LTCFs). The NYC Health Department observed a notable and sustained increase in NDM-positive CRE cases from 2019 to 2024, indicating that local treatment recommendations might need to be modified in response to changing carbapenemase epidemiology. This report describes trends in carbapenemase epidemiology in NYC during 2019–2024.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^a8e2b332]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop on experimental models of bacterial pneumonia — scope and key focuses are as follows: the report summarizes an American Thoracic Society workshop on animal models of bacterial pneumonia and includes review of non-animal complementary or alternative models for studying bacterial pneumonia, with emphasis on bacterial pathogens that frequently cause community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia and key aspects in modeling infection. Preclinical models are described as of utmost importance to decipher pathogenesis and develop novel targets for intervention and treatment, and animal models offer the powerful ability to investigate different pneumonia types at varying stages of infection and disease, although the same models can promote important variations in outcome that potentially confound scientific understanding. Animal models discussed included small and large animals based on their strengths, and the ethical considerations in the use of animal modeling for the study of bacterial lung infections was discussed; this workshop report is intended to provide insights to investigators and may serve as a starting point for formal recommendations in the future. The overview underscores that bacterial pneumonia remains a major global health issue and highlights the value of animal and non-animal models for studying key pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; keywords include bacterial infection, lungs, experimental models, animals, and ethical considerations.

### Modular assembly and immunological evaluation of a promising bioconjugate nanovaccine against Klebsiella pneumoniae O2 serotype [^24e5101b]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Kp, identified as the top priority pathogen in the 2024 WHO Bacterial Priority Pathogens List, is an opportunistic bacterium exhibiting significant antibiotic resistance increases, thereby complicating treatment efforts. Vaccination represents an attractive strategy for Kp infections and would help lower antibiotic use, potentially slowing the spread of antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for Kp infections. Since the 1960s, various vaccine candidates, including whole-cell vaccines, proteinaceous subunit vaccines, and PS-based vaccines, have been developed. However, the advancement of these candidate vaccines has been impeded by concerns regarding safety in whole-cell vaccines, limited efficacy in proteinaceous subunit vaccines, and geographic variability in protection coverage for CPS-based vaccines –. Some ongoing research by various groups, including ours, is focused on developing OPS-based conjugate vaccines. These studies have indicated that serotype O2 has low immunogenicity, making eliciting a functional antibody response challenging, which may lead to suboptimal protective efficacy. In contrast, research by Meghan E. Pennini and colleagues has demonstrated that O2 OPS-specific IgG1 antibodies isolated from healthy or convalescent individuals provide robust protection in mouse models of pneumonia and bacteremia. These findings suggest that potent O2 OPS-specific antibodies have the potential to confer protection, thereby setting a target for future vaccine development. Our previous work aimed to enhance Kp O2 OPS-specific immune responses by creating a nanoparticulated carrier modified with Kp O2 OPS via PGCT in one step. However, low productivity has hindered further study. Here, we developed a hepatitis B virus core antigen-based nanocarrier, HBcSpyTag (HBc-ST), and attached a Kp O2 OPS conjugate, SpyCatcher-OPS (SC-OPS), onto its surface via the formation of an isopeptide bond between SpyTag and SpyCatcher, which simplified vaccine production. We present findings on the design, production, immune response, and promising protective effects of this attractive bioconjugate nanovaccine.

### Challenges in the management of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial meningitis in children: a decade of clinical insights [^6e3f7701]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The strong performance of carbapenems and aminoglycosides, particularly meropenem and amikacin, underscores their continued efficacy in severe infections. However, given the global rise in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), these findings necessitate close surveillance to prevent further resistance dissemination. Enterobacter spp. displayed complete resistance to penicillins but retained full susceptibility to carbapenems and colistin, mirroring trends seen in other studies where resistance mechanisms, such as AmpC beta-lactamase production contribute to penicillin and cephalosporin resistance. Klebsiella spp. presented a heterogeneous resistance profile, with low penicillin susceptibility and moderate carbapenem and aminoglycoside sensitivity. The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has been a significant global health concern and the observed moderate susceptibility suggests that resistance may be evolving in this cohort. The universal sensitivity to colistin provides an alternative treatment option, though the development of colistin-resistant Klebsiella strains remains a potential threat. Pseudomonas spp. exhibited complete resistance to penicillins, yet maintained high susceptibility to cephalosporins and carbapenems, consistent with its intrinsic resistance mechanisms. The high efficacy of aminoglycosides, particularly amikacin, aligns with previous findings, reinforcing its potential as a cornerstone in combination therapy for multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections. However, the observed variability in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole highlights the need for individualized antimicrobial stewardship programs.

### The rising threat of antibiotic and multidrug resistance in neonatal urinary tract infections [^a18c34bd]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTıVE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the significant causes of sepsis in neonates. Currently, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms have become an increasingly prevalent issue in newborns. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory findings, causative organisms, associated urinary tract anomalies, AMR patterns, and factors influencing the development of MDR in neonatal UTIs.

Methods

Microorganisms in urine cultures obtained through bladder catheterization from neonates were identified, and AMR profiles as well as MDR organisms were determined. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and VITEK 2 Compact system. The cultures were categorized into two groups: MDR and non-MDR. A retrospective evaluation was conducted to assess the impact of clinical, laboratory, and imaging data on the development of MDR.

Results

Data from 51 neonatal UTIs between 2018 and 2024 were evaluated. The most common microorganisms were Esherichia coli (E. Coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. Pneumoniae). A total of 75% of the E. coli strains demonstrated resistance to ampicillin. Resistance rates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. to gentamicin was 25%, 30.7%, and 80%, respectively. Among the microorganisms 55% of E. coli, 100% of Enterobacter spp., 38.5% of K. pneumoniae, and 20% of Enterococcus spp. were MDR. However, no significant correlation was found between MDR and clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. Blood cultures were obtained from all patients prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy; however, no pathogenic microorganisms were isolated.

Conclusions

AMR and MDR in neonatal UTIs appear to be a serious problem. Treatment options in MDR UTIs remain limited, and it is particularly important to research on the pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of antimicrobials in children is essential to expand treatment options for pediatric populations worldwide.

### Evaluating the innovative potential of the global antibacterial pipeline [^e386c093]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Resistance burden varies widely among WHO regions, and the potential impact of new antibiotics differs in addressing the WHO's critical priority pathogens' resistance challenge.

Objectives

To analyse the current global clinical pipeline in line with public and global health concerns and define innovation in antibacterial drug discovery.

Sources

Monitoring clinical pipelines since 2006, integrating peer-reviewed MEDLINE publications on clinical development of new antibacterial agents, supplemented with disclosed data from developers.

Content

The current clinical pipeline is dominated by derivatives of established antibiotic classes, primarily β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in Phase 3 (six of ten which also include two beta-lactams without β-lactamase inhibitor). This pattern extends to Phase 1. Although incremental improvements in susceptibility rates among derivatives benefit patients in advanced health care systems within specific geographical regions, these concepts are not adequate for carbapenem-resistant strains of Enterobacterales (especially Klebsiella and Escherichia coli), Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas. This limitation arises from the diverse distribution of resistance mechanisms across global regions. Innovation in this context refers to absence of cross-resistance because of class-specific resistance mechanisms. This can most likely be achieved by exploring new chemical classes and new targets/binding sites, and new mode of action. An initial glimpse of progress is evident as innovative agents progressed to Phase 1 clinical trials. However, an influx of more agents advancing to clinical development is essential given the inherent risks associated with novel chemistry and targets.

Implications

The limited innovation in the global clinical pipeline inadequately serves public and global health interests. The complexities of antibacterial drug discovery, from scientific challenges to financial constraints, underscore the need for collective researcher efforts and public support to drive innovation for patients globally.

### Cefepime-enmetazobactam: a drug review of a novel beta-lactam / beta-lactamase inhibitor [^4e2f2a05]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe and analyze the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and clinical evidence supporting the efficacy and use of cefepime-enmetazobactam (FEP-EMT).

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (January 2015 to May 2024). Search terms included: "cefepime-enmetazobactam" or "cefepime" or "enmetazobactam" or "cefepime" or "novel beta-lactamase inhibitor" and "complicated urinary tract infection" or "cUTI". Conference abstracts, bibliographies, clinical trials, and drug monographs were included for review.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant studies in English and clinical trials conducted in humans were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

In February 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (BL/BLI) FEP-EMT for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and acute pyelonephritis following the completion of the Phase III ALLIUM trial comparing it to piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP). The trial resulted in 79.1% of the FEP-EMT group versus 58.9% of the TZP group meeting the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication (95% CI 21.2 [14.3 to 27.9]). Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice in Comparison to Existing Agents:This review describes the use of FEP-EMT for the treatment of cUTI and compares its use to other novel BL/BLI combinations including utility in drug-resistant infections.

Conclusions

FEP-EMT provides an antimicrobial option to reduce overuse of carbapenems for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. However, unlike other novel BL/BLI combinations, its limited spectrum of antibacterial effect for more difficult-to-treat pathogens and cost may also impact its overall utilization.

### How I manage patients with new delhi metallo-β-lactamase and OXA-48-producing enterobacterales infections: a practical approach [^eb946f4c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past decades, the global spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) has become one of the greatest challenges for human health. Until the early 2010 s, KPC was the most prevalent carbapenemase worldwide in the United States, Europe, and Israel. This led to widespread use of the terms CRE and "carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales" as near-synonyms. At that time, metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) were primarily reported in Enterobacterales in the Indian subcontinent but were sporadic in Europe. OXA-48 was historically more commonly detected in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from North Africa and Turkey. In recent years, the epidemiological landscape has greatly changed. Both NDM- and OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales have expanded beyond their original endemic regions, becoming increasingly prevalent in several settings.

Thus, knowledge of local epidemiology, use of rapid diagnostic testing methods and implementation of therapeutic strategies to manage infections caused by NDM- or OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales are critical for an optimal patient management. Here, the practical management of a patient with NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection is discussed.

### Activity of aztreonam-avibactam and other β-lactamase inhibitor combinations against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia in United States medical centers (2020–2022) [^87a6d952]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial pneumonia represents one of the most frequent healthcare-associated infections and it is generally related to prolonged hospitalization and increased morbidity and mortality. Moreover, resistance to antimicrobial agents represents a great challenge to the treatment of patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Antimicrobial therapy is frequently empirical, and the most effective regimen is determined mainly by recognizing the most common causative pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility. The application of timely and effective antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce complications and mortality.

A few antimicrobial agents with potent activity against Gram-negative organisms were licensed in the last few years, including ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, and cefiderocol. The approval of these antimicrobials represented a significant improvement in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE); however, with the exception of cefiderocol, these agents are not active against metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing strains. Furthermore, resistance to recently approved β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLICs), such as ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem-vaborbactam, appears to be increasing among CRE in some US hospitals.

Aztreonam-avibactam is under clinical development to treat patients with Gram-negative infections, including those caused by MBL-producing CRE. Aztreonam is not hydrolysed by MBLs, but it can be inactivated by serine β-lactamases, such as extended-spectrum β-lactamases, chromosomal derepressed AmpC, and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC). Since MBL-producing Enterobacterales isolates usually coproduce a serine β-lactamase, aztreonam was combined with avibactam. In the present study, we evaluated the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria causing pneumonia in United States (US) hospitals.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^f67e6d18]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past 30 years, a distinct pathotype of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) has emerged, characterized by its ability to cause severe tissue-invasive infections, including liver abscesses in otherwise healthy individuals. Klebsiella liver abscesses (KLA) are most prevalent in East and Southeast Asia; however, their global incidence is rising, with hvKp now recognized as an important pathogen in Europe and the United States. While K. pneumoniae often colonizes the gut asymptomatically, KLAs develop when hvKp disseminates from the gut to the liver via the portal vein. Strains expressing K1 and K2 capsule types demonstrate the highest resistance to clearance by Kupffer cells, the liver resident macrophages, and are responsible for most KLA cases. KLAs present as fibrously encapsulated lesions composed of bacteria, pus, and immune cells. Treatment typically involves a combination of abscess drainage and antibiotic therapy; however, clinical outcomes are often poor, even in the absence of antibiotic resistance. This is due, in part, to significant barriers to achieving effective antibiotic efficacy within abscesses that can result in devastating complications such as metastatic infection, liver resection, or death. The emergence of KLA caused by multidrug-resistant hvKp strains, although still rare, represents an additional and alarming therapeutic challenge. This review explores the pathogenesis of KLA and highlights critical obstacles to effective management and therapy.

### Clinical outcomes of flomoxef versus cefmetazole in hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections: combined retrospective analyses of two real-world databases and in vitro data [^896a4511]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The increase in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria has complicated the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and intra-abdominal infections due to resistance to various classes of antimicrobials. Currently, carbapenems are the preferred treatment option for severe infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria. However, carbapenem-resistant strains have emerged and spread, which has raised interest in treatment strategies that spare carbapenems.

Cefmetazole and flomoxef are antimicrobial agents that were originally developed in Japan. Cefmetazole is a cephamycin that has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against Enterobacterales, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as anaerobic bacteria, and is widely indicated for the treatment of UTI and intra-abdominal infections. Flomoxef is an oxacephem that, like cefmetazole, is active against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacterales and is indicated for the treatment of UTI and intra-abdominal infections. Flomoxef has been approved in Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea and has been used in clinical practice since 1988. Both cefmetazole and flomoxef have a methoxy group at the 7-position of cephalosporanic acid and are stable to hydrolysis by ESBL. Cefmetazole and flomoxef demonstrate in vitro efficacy against ESBL-producing bacteria and are of increasing clinical importance as carbapenem-sparing therapeutic options for infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales.

Although accumulated clinical data have reported comparable effectiveness of cefmetazole with carbapenems against infections due to ESBL-producing bacteria, clinical data regarding flomoxef remain limited. To the best of our knowledge, no national study has compared the susceptibility rates of flomoxef and cefmetazole among ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. Furthermore, no large study has compared the effectiveness of treatment with flomoxef and cefmetazole. In recent years, the resistance rate of cefmetazole in ESBL-producing E. coli has been shown to be higher than that of flomoxef. However, cefmetazole is more widely used in clinical practice, and given the recent instability in antimicrobial supply, it would be beneficial to clarify the potential of flomoxef as a treatment option against ESBL-producing bacterial infections.

This study aimed to compare the usefulness of the two drugs by integrating in vitro data using a retrospective analysis of two real-world databases (National claims database and Nosocomial infections surveillance database).

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^d104dac2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

IMMUNOMODULATORY TREATMENT

Given high rates of macrolide resistance and the occurrence of macrolide refractory M. pneumoniae infections, immunomodulatory treatment is a relevant treatment option. Indeed, immunopathology is known to enhance disease, especially in severe M. pneumoniae infections. There is sufficient evidence that adding steroids in refractory M. pneumoniae pulmonary infections is beneficial, although there is limited evidence for the exact dose and duration. During the 2023–2024 resurgence, there are no new studies in children that provide more evidence for immunosuppressive treatment during severe M. pneumoniae infection, however a study in adults found that adjunctive corticosteroid treatment shortened duration of fever.

THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR MBL-PRODUCING CARBAPENEMASE-PRODUCING ENTEROBACTERALES

Limited therapeutic landscape and clinical impact

The management of infections caused by MBL-producing Enterobacterales represents a challenge in the clinical practice due to limited treatment options. This therapeutic gap might contribute to the poor outcomes in patients infected with MBL-producing strains. In the prospective ALARICO study including more than 1200 patients with BSIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, the attributable mortality for MBL-producing Enterobacterales was 35%, substantially higher than that reported for KPC-producing strains (5%). This difference likely reflects the lack of effective antimicrobial options for MBL, in contrast to the last decade's wave of development targeting KPC. Currently available and new treatment options for MBL-producing CRE are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Therapeutic options for MBL-producing CRE

Ceftazidime/avibactam plus aztreonam

Current guidelines recommend the use of ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) in combination with aztreonam (ATM) as preferred option for the treatment of severe infections due to MBL-producing Enterobacterales. Avibactam inhibits serine β-lactamases (e.g. ESBLs, AmpC), thereby protecting ATM from degradation by serine enzymes, that are coproduced in these isolates. This combination was found to be active against MBL in more than 97% of isolates. Clinical studies support the efficacy of this combination. A large recent cohort study including 343 patients with infections caused by MBL-producing CRE showed that the combination CZA plus ATM was associated with reduced mortality compared to colistin-containing regimens, also after propensity score matching.

However, some limitations to the use of CZA plus ATM should be underlined:
(1) a major challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to assess the in vitro activity. Several approaches, including the disc approximation method, the broth disc elution method, and the gradient test superposition method, are used but all these methods are not standardized and results are prone to subjective interpretations;
(2) the simultaneous administration of CZA plus ATM may be difficult in patients without multiple vascular lines. It is not known whether the nonsimultaneously administration of CZA plus ATM may affect the serum levels and pharmacokinetics of the drugs;
(3) some cases of NDM-producing Escherichia coli resistant to ATM/AVI have been reported, potentially limiting the use of CZA plus ATM.

### Activity of aztreonam-avibactam and other β-lactamase inhibitor combinations against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia in United States medical centers (2020–2022) [^230423d1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Initial antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia is frequently empirical and resistance to antimicrobial agents represents a great challenge to the treatment of patients hospitalized with pneumonia. We evaluated the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria causing pneumonia in US hospitals.

Methods

Bacterial isolates were consecutively collected (1/patient) from patients hospitalized with pneumonia and the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacilli (3,911 Enterobacterales and 2,753 non-fermenters) was evaluated by broth microdilution in a monitoring laboratory. Isolates were collected in 69 medical centers in 2020–2022. Aztreonam-avibactam was tested with avibactam at fixed 4 mg/L and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic susceptible (S) breakpoint of ≤ 8 mg/L was applied for comparison. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE; isolates with MIC values of > 2 mg/L for imipenem and/or meropenem) isolates were screened for carbapenemases by whole genome sequencing.

Results

Gram-negative bacilli represented 71.1% of organisms. The most common Gram-negative species were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.4% of organisms), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Escherichia coli (6.6%), Serratia marcescens (6.2%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae complex (4.8%). Aztreonam-avibactam inhibited 100.0% of Enterobacterales at ≤ 8 mg/L and 99.9% at ≤ 4 mg/L and showed potent activity against CRE (MIC 50/90, 0.25/1 mg/L). Ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem-vaborbactam were active against 89.4% and 88.5% of CREs, respectively. Aztreonam-avibactam retained activity against Enterobacterales non-susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam and/or meropenem-vaborbactam (n = 19; MIC 50/90, 0.25/4 mg/L). The most common carbapenemases were KPC (69.2% of CREs), NDM (9.6%), and SME (4.8%). A carbapenemase gene was not identified in 16.3% of CREs. Ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem-vaborbactam were highly active against KPC and SME producers but showed limited activity against MBL producers. The most active comparators against CRE were tigecycline (95.2%S), amikacin (73.1%S), and gentamicin (60.6%S). Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 79.1% were inhibited at ≤ 8 mg/L of aztreonam-avibactam, 77.2% were meropenem susceptible, and 77.2% were piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible. Aztreonam-avibactam was highly active against S. maltophilia, inhibiting 99.5% of isolates at ≤ 8 mg/L.

Conclusions

Aztreonam-avibactam displayed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of contemporary Gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia, including CRE isolates resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam and/or meropenem-vaborbactam. Results of surveillance programs are valuable for planning empiric antimicrobial therapy guidelines and infection control measures.

### Aztreonam (Azactam) [^ac117478]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AZACTAM (aztreonam for injection, USP) and other antibacterial drugs, AZACTAM should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

AZACTAM is indicated for the treatment of the following infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms:

Urinary Tract Infections (complicated and uncomplicated), including pyelonephritis and cystitis (initial and recurrent) caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca *, Citrobacter species*, and Serratia marcescens *.

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections, including pneumonia and bronchitis caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter species, and Serratia marcescens *.

Septicemia caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis *, Serratia marcescens *, and Enterobacter species.

Skin and Skin-Structure Infections, including those associated with postoperative wounds, ulcers, and burns, caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Citrobacter species*.

Intra-abdominal Infections, including peritonitis caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species including K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter species including E. cloacae *, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter species* including C. freundii *, and Serratia species* including S. marcescens *.

Gynecologic Infections, including endometritis and pelvic cellulitis caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae *, Enterobacter species* including E. cloacae *, and Proteus mirabilis *.

AZACTAM is indicated for adjunctive therapy to surgery in the management of infections caused by susceptible organisms, including abscesses, infections complicating hollow viscus perforations, cutaneous infections, and infections of serous surfaces. AZACTAM is effective against most of the commonly encountered Gram-negative aerobic pathogens seen in general surgery.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^16813f9c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of respiratory tract infections in children. M. pneumoniae is a member of the bacterial class of Mollicutes and can be divided into two subtypes. Although M. pneumoniae is a well known cause of atypical pneumonia in children, the incidence of M. pneumoniae infections in adults is less clear. Apart from pulmonary disease, which is the main burden of M. pneumoniae infection, M. pneumoniae can lead to extrapulmonary manifestations, most notably mucocutaneus and neurological disease. M. pneumoniae infections occur in a distinct pattern of upsurges every 1–5 years. Crowding leads to increased rates of transmission, for instance within families, schools, army barracks or residential healthcare institutions. Diagnosing M. pneumoniae infections can be challenging as the interpretation of positive PCR results for M. pneumoniae in upper respiratory tract samples is complicated by the presence of upper respiratory tract carriage. Upper respiratory tract carriage can occur in children, in particular during M. pneumoniae upsurges, when it can reach a prevalence up to 50%. Furthermore, M. pneumoniae serology can be positive due to previous M. pneumoniae infection, hindering decision-making based on test results of acute phase single-sample serology. Due to the absence of a cell wall, options for antibiotic treatment in M. pneumoniae infections are limited to macrolides, tetracyclines and/or fluoroquinolones. Macrolides are first choice for antibiotic treatment in children, given the potential side effects of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones in young children. Macrolide resistance is a growing concern, in particularly in East Asia, where the prevalence of macrolide resistance amongst M. pneumoniae isolates ranges up to 90%.

Many key features of M. pneumoniae epidemiology, diagnostics and treatment are still unknown. In this review, we will describe recent advances in our understanding of M. pneumoniae pathophysiology and disease characteristics in children. We will especially focus on the 2023–2024 global resurgence of M. pneumoniae, as this was the first M. pneumoniae outbreak after the COVID-19 epidemic. The impact on M. pneumoniae epidemiology by social distancing and other nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented because of the COVID-19 epidemic, has provided new insights.

### Adjunctive phage therapy improves antibiotic treatment of ventilator-associated-pneumonia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^80f9f85a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In summary, adjunctive phage therapy holds significant potential for mechanically ventilated patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). While our murine VAP study focused on P. aeruginosa, (adjunctive) phage therapy is also suitable for other MDR bacterial infections, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, a major cause of both community-acquired and nosocomial infections. In general, combination therapy offers key advantages over monotherapies, including the mitigation of excessive inflammation and associated lung barrier destabilization, as demonstrated in our study. Additionally, improved eradication of MDR bacteria, restoration of antibiotic sensitivity, and reduced bacterial virulence in phage-resistant strains offer further advantages. These effects could translate into significant clinical benefits, potentially limiting acute lung injury while reducing the side effects of conventional antibacterial therapies and minimizing antibiotic overuse, thereby supporting a safer and more effective treatment option for future clinical applications.

### Experimental phage evolution results in expanded host ranges against antibiotic resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates [^107ab58b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Antimicrobial resistance among bacteria has become a rising and persistent global threat. Particularly amongst the ESKAPEE pathogens, there is a critical need to pursue alternative options outside of conventional antibiotics for the treatment of the life-threatening infections caused by these microbes. Klebsiella pneumoniae is prominent amongst these microbes, as it has a propensity to develop multi-drug resistance through the acquisition of ESBL plasmids, and extensive drug resistance through the presence of KPCs (Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemases). It also produces a highly mucoid outer coating that can render the organism difficult to access and more resilient to treatment. Because bacteriophages often are limited in their host ranges to select bacterial isolates, and resistance to them often develops rapidly, they often are at a distinct disadvantage compared to conventional antibiotics when considering treatment for bacterial pathogens. However, given that many bacterial pathogens such as K. pneumoniae are becoming resistant to most conventional antibiotic therapies, phage therapies are now being revisited.

Similar to a prior study by our groups, that demonstrated that we could significantly extend the host ranges of laboratory adapted E. coli isolates using experimental evolution techniques, we extended similar techniques to a group of MDR and XDR clinical Klebsiella isolates. We found that the same principles that apply to microbes that have spent years adapting to laboratory conditions also apply to microbes that are recently derived from patients with clinical infections. We evolved a small group of phages against clinical K. pneumoniae isolates and found that the trained phages significantly improve in their ability to inhibit clinical MDR and XDR K. pneumoniae isolates longitudinally (Figs. 4, 5). This change coincides with an expansion in host ranges for the phages (Fig. 3), a presumed reduction in the ability of the host to develop rapid resistance, and significant changes in the phages that allowed them to infect their host over extended time periods. Most of the changes that were observed were in a gene cluster of five tail fiber related proteins and a holin (Fig. 6). In both training experiments, the protein that accumulated the most changes was the tail fiber adhesin. This suggests that the observed changes played a role in phage adhesion to bacteria.

### Burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance 1990–2021 in China: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^1fc52dbf]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Carbapenem antibiotics are considered last-resort antibiotics for the treatment of severe bacterial infections. In the WHO's update of the list of drug-resistant bacteria most threatening to human health, two of the four critical priority pathogens are carbapenem-resistant (carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae). Our findings show that carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) also impose a substantial AMR burden in China. For example, data from CHINET show that carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in China exhibits resistance rates exceeding 50% to most antimicrobial agents, with susceptibility remaining only to polymyxins, colistin, and tigecycline. The severe burden of CRGNB stems largely from extensive drug resistance or pan-resistance, so antimicrobial treatment options are limited. Furthermore, although some novel antibiotics have been approved for the treatment of CRGNB infections, their introduction in China has been relatively delayed. Most CRGNB infections are hospital-acquired, and effective preventive measures are essential for controlling the infections. Relevant studies have proved that interventions such as active screening of specific populations for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in hospitals, single-room isolation of CRGNB-infected patients, and removal of handwashing from infected patient wards can all effectively reduce the incidence of CRGNB infections.

Novel BL/BLI combinations offering alternatives for KN-CRKP

AST showed all 25 non-duplicate KN-CRKP strains were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, and ceftazidime/avibactam, exhibiting pan- β -lactam resistance. To deal with the intractable KN-CRKP strains, cefiderocol and BL/BLI combinations were chosen to perform AST for the 25 KN-CRKP strains (Table 1). Rates of resistance to imipenem/relebactam, meropenem/taniborbactam, cefepime/taniborbactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, cefepime/zidebactam and meropenem/nacubactam were 100.00%, 96.0%, 92.0%, 100.00%, 96.0% and 100.00%, respectively, exhibiting poor antibacterial activity. Fortunately, the incidences of susceptibility to both aztreonam/avibactam and cefiderocol were 96.0%. Consequently, aztreonam/avibactam and cefiderocol could be considered the last alternatives for treating KN-CRKP.

### Experimental phage evolution results in expanded host ranges against antibiotic resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates [^0a89b334]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Resistance to antibiotics is approaching crisis levels for organisms such as the ESKAPEE pathogens (includes Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli) that often are acquired in hospitals. These organisms sometimes have acquired plasmids that confer resistance to most if not all beta-lactam antibiotics. We have been developing alternative means for dealing with antibiotic resistant microbes that cause infections in humans by developing viruses (bacteriophages) that attack and kill them. One of these pathogens, K. pneumoniae, has one of the highest propensities for antimicrobial resistance. We identified many phages that have lytic capacity against limited numbers of clinical isolates, and through experimental evolution over the course of 30 days, were able to vastly expand the host ranges of these phages to kill a broader range of clinical K. pneumoniae isolates including MDR (multi-drug resistant) and XDR (extensively-drug resistant) isolates. Most interestingly, they were capable of inhibiting growth of clinical isolates both on solid and in liquid medium over extended periods. That we were able to extend the host ranges of multiple naïve antibiotic resistant K. pneumoniae through experimental phage evolution suggests that such a technique may be applicable to other antibiotic-resistant organisms to help stem the tide of antibiotic resistance and offer further options for medical treatments.

### Activity of aztreonam-avibactam and other β-lactamase inhibitor combinations against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia in United States medical centers (2020–2022) [^c3af7faa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Very few compounds exhibited adequate in vitro activity against S. maltophilia. Aztreonam-avibactam (MIC 50/90, 2/4 mg/L) inhibited 99.5% of isolates at ≤ 8 mg/L, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC 50/90, ≤ 0.12/0.5 mg/L) inhibited 97.5% of isolates at the CLSI susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 2 mg/L and minocycline (MIC 50/90, 0.5/1 mg/L) inhibited 93.5% of isolates at the 2024 CLSI susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 1 mg/L (Table 1). It is important to note that CLSI is currently revising S. maltophilia breakpoints and these susceptibility rates may change. Moreover, tigecycline (MIC 50/90, 1/2 mg/L) inhibited 91.5% of isolates at ≤ 2 mg/L (CLSI breakpoint for Enterobacterales) but only 49.5% at ≤ 0.5 mg/L (EUCAST breakpoint for E. coli; data not shown) and levofloxacin was active against 83.5% of isolates per current CLSI criteria.

A carbapenemase gene was identified in 83.7% (87/104) of CRE isolates. The most common carbapenemase genes identified among CRE isolates were bla KPC (69.2% of CRE isolates), bla NDM (9.6%), and bla SME (4.8%; Fig. 3). Overall, 10.6% of CREs produced an MBL and were resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam (Fig. 3). Aztreonam-avibactam retained potent activity against carbapenemase-producing CRE independent of carbapenemase type (MIC 50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L; highest MIC, 2 mg/L). Ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem-vaborbactam were highly active against KPC and SME producers but showed limited activity against MBL producers.

Meropenem was the most active carbapenem against Enterobacterales with 97.3% susceptibility. The aminoglycosides gentamicin and amikacin were also very active against Enterobacterales with susceptibility rates of 91.0% and 95.1%, respectively; however, these compounds showed limited activity against CRE, with susceptibility rates of 60.6% for gentamicin and 73.1% for amikacin (Table 1).

The most active compounds against P. aeruginosa were imipenem-relebactam (MIC 50/90, 0.25/1 mg/L; 97.1% susceptible), ceftolozane-tazobactam (MIC 50/90, 0.5/2 mg/L; 96.9% susceptible), ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC 50/90, 2/8 mg/L; 96.1% susceptible), and tobramycin (MIC 50/90, 0.5/2 mg/L; 89.4% susceptible; Table 1; Fig. 2). Aztreonam-avibactam (MIC 50/90, 0.25/1 mg/L) inhibited 79.1% of isolates at the PK/PD breakpoint of ≤ 8 mg/L, which is comparable to the susceptibility rates for piperacillin-tazobactam (77.2%), meropenem (77.2%), and ceftazidime (81.2%; Table 1; Fig. 2).

### Activity of aztreonam-avibactam and other β-lactamase inhibitor combinations against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia in United States medical centers (2020–2022) [^24c03281]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although other investigators have evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility data from organisms recovered from patients with pneumonia, those evaluations usually rely on susceptibility results provided by the participant institutions and may have some limitations. Participant centers apply distinct susceptibility testing methods and/or breakpoint interpretative criteria, may test different agents within a drug class, or may perform selected testing (cascade testing). All these factors can introduce bias. Moreover, data on the activity of recently approved antimicrobial agents, such as meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-relebactam, are scarce.

Our results on the antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterobacterales indicates that the prevalence of CRE appears to be stable in the last few years at around 1.0%, but the epidemiology of carbapenemases among CRE has been changing, mainly due to the decrease of KPC and increase of MBLs, which can hydrolyze newer β-lactamase inhibitor combination, such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam. Estabrook et al. evaluated 5,728 Enterobacterales collected in 2018 and 2019 from North American hospitals and found that 1.9% of isolates were meropenem nonsusceptible, and 15.5% of those were MBL producers.

Aztreonam-avibactam inhibited 100.0% of Enterobacterales at ≤ 8 mg/L and 99.9% at ≤ 4 mg/L (MIC 50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/L) and showed potent activity against CRE (MIC 50/90, 0.25/1 mg/L; Table 1; Fig. 2). Ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC 50/90, 0.12/0.5 mg/L; 99.6% susceptible) and meropenem-vaborbactam (MIC 50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 99.7% susceptible) were also highly active against Enterobacterales, but these compounds showed somewhat limited activity against CRE with susceptibility rates of 89.4% for ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC 50/90, 1/ > 32 mg/L) and 88.5% for meropenem-vaborbactam (MIC 50/90, 0.06/8 mg/L). Imipenem-relebactam was slightly less active than ceftazidime-avibactam or meropenem-vaborbactam against Enterobacterales overall (MIC 50/90, 0.12/0.5 mg/L; 95.2% susceptible) and CRE (MIC 50/90, 0.12/8 mg/L; 79.8% susceptible) (Table 1; Fig. 2). Notably, aztreonam-avibactam retained activity against Enterobacterales non-susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam and/or meropenem-vaborbactam (n = 19; MIC 50/90, 0.25/4 mg/L [data not shown]).

### Flash optimization of drug combinations for Acinetobacter baumannii with IDentif. AI-AMR [^1ddc1a25]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is a Gram-negative bacterium and exists ubiquitously, and it is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infection globally. Notably, it can lead to a variety of nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection. The bacterium-associated infections may lead to mortality rates of up to 30%. Furthermore, multi-drug resistance (MDR) A. baumannii strains are resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics including carbapenems, which are considered the last-resort antibiotics against multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens. Typically, MDR is geographically specific. For example, a recent study that surveyed 453 hospitals in 48 countries reported that A. baumannii has a high chance of being multi-drug resistance. The MDR rates in Europe may exceed 93%, while North America has the lowest rates of 47%. Consequently, widespread resistance to antibiotics within the A. baumannii family results in unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Moreover, this pathogen has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the "ESKAPE" pathogens, a list of highly virulent and resistant pathogens. On May 17, 2024, WHO published a bacterial priority pathogens list categorizing A. baumannii as a pathogen of critical priority, further suggesting that there is an urgent need to develop treatment strategies for this pathogen.

Carbapenems have conventionally played a critical role in A. baumannii treatment strategies. The emergence of carbapenem- and multi-drug resistant strains has substantially exhausted treatment options for the pathogen. To further explore other strategies, combination therapies have been prioritized for treating this bacterial infection. However, combinatorial designs have not been developed or well-studied specifically for A. baumannii. Aside from carbapenems, colistin is also prescribed as a last-resort defense against MDR gram-negative bacteria, and it is sometimes paired with other drugs including carbapenems, serving as the backbone of combination therapies. However, multiple studies including a clinical trial (NCT01597973) have reported that colistin monotherapy is not superior to colistin-based combination therapies in the context of clinical outcomes –. These outcomes can be attributed to the absence of drug-dose optimization. For instance, previous studies have reported that properly pairing drugs in combinations and determining the optimal dosage ratios are critical to improved clinical outcomes –. Therefore, it is important to specifically design drug combinations for A. baumannii.

### Non-KPC attributes of the newer β-lactam / β-lactamase inhibitors, part 2: Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii [^85b16a9b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The BL/BLI combination drugs, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, and imipenem/relebactam, have proven especially useful for treating carbapenemase producing, carbapenem resistant organisms (CRO), specifically Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs). However, non-KPC mechanisms of resistance are rising in prevalence among Gram-negatives and are increasingly challenging to treat. These newer BL/BLIs, including sulbactam/durlobactam, have an array of activity against mechanisms of carbapenem resistance beyond KPC and therefore play an important role in the treatment of non-KPC CRO. This review, the second in a two-part series, lays out the non-KPC attributes of the newer BL/BLIs with a focus on clinical utility against Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and other rare pathogens.

### Enhertu approved for any HER2-Positive solid cancer-NCI… [^43a33e85]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

FDA Approves Trastuzumab Deruxtecan for Any HER2-Positive Solid Cancer, by Carmen Phillips The drug trastuzumab deruxtecan can now be used to treat a wide variety of cancers, thanks to a new approval from the Food and Drug Administration. On August 5, the agency gave an accelerated approval for trastuzumab deruxtecan — often called T-DXd — to treat anyone with any advanced solid cancer if their tumors produce high levels of the protein HER2, or HER2-positive. To receive the drug, a patient must already have received at least one prior treatment. The approval makes T-DXd the first cancer therapy of its type, an antibody─drug conjugate, that can be used in such a "tumor agnostic" manner. T-DXd is already approved to treat people with several specific cancers, including breast and stomach. The new approval was based on results from three midsized clinical trials in which treatment with T-DXd shrank tumors in many people with advanced HER2-positive cancers.

In many instances, their tumors did not start growing again for many months, or even several years. In its approval, FDA highlighted that T-DXd can have serious side effects, including a dangerous lung inflammation called interstitial lung disease. In the trials, some patients died from ILD. Oncologists will have to consider T-DXd's potential side effects when evaluating whether to recommend it to their patients, said Funda Meric-Bernstam, M. D., of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the lead investigator on one of the three trials. But there's now substantial evidence that it has "compelling activity" in many different types of cancer, Dr. Meric-Bernstam continued. Based on that evidence, she said, "I expect there will be substantial uptake " among oncologists.

From breast cancer to clinical trials in a host of cancers Trastuzumab, a type of drug known as a monoclonal antibody, was one of the first FDA-approved targeted therapies for cancer. It works by seeking out and latching on to HER2 proteins on cancer cells, preventing the protein from helping tumors grow and encouraging immune cells to attack the cells. Trastuzumab was developed in the 1990s specifically to treat breast cancer. That's because studies at the time had shown that tumors in about 20% of people with breast cancer had an overabundance of HER2 on their surfaces, known as HER2 overexpression. Over the past 10–15 years, however, scientists have repeatedly found that this HER2 overload occurs in many other cancers. During that same time, FDA has approved multiple drugs that target HER2, including T-DXd.

With convincing data and multiple treatments available to them, many clinical trials were launched to test the different HER2-targeted therapies in people with cancers in which HER2 overexpression is common. Among them were the three phase 2 trials of T-DXd — funded by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, the drug's manufacturer — on which this new FDA approval was based. Strong and often long-lasting responses to T-DXd in many cancer types Of the three trials, one enrolled only people with advanced lung cancer, one only people with advanced colorectal cancer, and the third people with a variety of advanced solid cancers. Participants in all three trials had HER2-positive tumors. However, while most participants' tumors had the highest HER2 levels, a measure known as IHC3+, others had somewhat lower levels, known as IHC2+. In the "pan-tumor" trial, more than half of people with IHC3+ tumors responded to the treatment.

### New treatment options for critically important WHO fungal priority pathogens [^380f918e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Yet often overlooked in public health discourse, fungal infections pose a crucial global disease burden associated with annual mortality rates approximately equal to tuberculosis and HIV. In response, the WHO published its first global priority list of fungal pathogens in 2022 assigning Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Cryptococcus neoformans to the critical group.

Objectives

This review provides succinct insights into novel antifungals in development, aiming to contribute valuable information and perspectives with a focus on recent clinical findings and new treatment approaches for critical members of the WHO fungal pathogen priority list.

Sources

PubMed literature search using 'Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Cryptococcus neoformans', 'Candida auris', and 'Candida albicans', along with the names of novel antifungal substances, including 'fosmanogepix', 'ibrexafungerp', 'opelconazole', 'oteseconazole', 'MAT2203', 'olorofim', and 'rezafungin' was conducted.

Content

For each critical pathogen, current issues and global clinical data from recent trials are covered. The remarkable development of three new antifungal therapeutics recently receiving Food and Drug Administration approval (ibrexafungerp-June 2021, oteseconazole -April 2022, and rezafungin-March 2023) is outlined, with two more exciting new antifungal substances, namely, olorofim and fosmanogepix expecting approval within the next years. Ibrexafungerp, fosmanogepix, and rezafungin have additionally been granted orphan drug status by the European Medicines Agency in Europe (ibrexafungerp-November 2021, fosmanogepix-July 2022, and rezafungin-January 2024).

Implications

Although the limited number of targets and the emergence of resistance have posed challenges to antifungal treatment, new drugs such as ibrexafungerp, rezafungin, fosmanogepix, or olorofim have shown promising clinical efficacy. These drugs not only provide alternative options for invasive fungal infections but also alleviate treatment in outpatient settings. More clinical data, implementation of stewardship programmes, and surveillance, including utilization of drugs in agriculture, are necessary to prevent resistance development and to ensure the safety and efficacy of these new agents.

### Meropenem-vaborbactam (Vabomere) [^6eea10b3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

VABOMERE demonstrated efficacy with regard to clinical and microbiological response at the EOIVT visit and TOC visits in the m-MITT population as shown in Table 6.

In the m-MITT population, the rate of clinical and microbiological response in VABOMERE- treated patients with concurrent bacteremia at baseline was 10/12 (83.3%).

In a subset of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, genotypic testing identified certain ESBL groups (e.g. TEM, CTX-M, SHV and OXA) in both treatment groups of the Phase 3 cUTI trial. The rates of clinical and microbiological response were similar in the ESBL-positive and ESBL-negative subset at EOIVT; at TOC, clinical and microbiological response was lower in the ESBL-positive as compared to ESBL-negative subset in both treatment groups.

### Local treatment of wound infections: a review of clinical trials from 2013 to 2024 [^b323b52a]. Advances in Wound Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Significance: Management of infection is a critical aspect of wound care. It involves the application of various interventions to treat the wound and prevent the infection from spreading to other parts of the body, which may lead to serious complications, including sepsis. Local treatment of skin wound infections is the favored route of administration, reducing the risk of adverse systemic effects while providing very high therapeutic concentrations at the target site. The purpose of this article was to review clinical trials from 2013 and onward, focusing on local treatment of acute wounds and burns as well as chronic wounds as their primary outcome measurement. Recent Advances: Based on our literature search, 49 clinical trials were focusing on treating infected chronic wounds, and 6 trials studied infection as their primary outcome in acute wounds during the last 10 years. Critical Issues: Currently commercially available local treatments do not prevent the onset of invasive infection. Therefore, there is a need for more effective local therapies. Future Directions: Despite multiple preclinical studies introducing novel and promising strategies in terms of novel antimicrobial agents and delivery methods to prevent and treat skin wound infections locally, many have yet to be tested in a clinical setting. These preclinically tested approaches could still be valuable additions to today's care of infected skin wounds.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^39e9d54c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile Infections

Outside the urinary tract, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) remain another hot area for the development of new antibiotics and therapeutics. A novel bis-benzimidazole antibiotic, ridinilazole, was the subject of the Ri-CoDIFy 1 and 2 phase 3 RCTs published in 2024. Ridinilazole binds with high specificity to C. difficile DNA, which gives it a very narrow spectrum as it lacks activity against most other bacteria. This allows it to selectively kill C. difficile while preserving the rest of the gut microbiota. In these superiority trials, patients were randomized to receive 10 days of either ridinilazole or oral vancomycin. Although ridinilazole was not superior to vancomycin with regard to the primary outcome of sustained clinical responses and lack of recurrence within 30 days, it did have a significantly lower rate of recurrence, with only 8% of patients experiencing recurrence versus 17% for vancomycin. In addition, ridinilazole, compared with vancomycin, better preserved patients' microbiome diversity. Based on this RCT data, ridinazole is unlikely to receive FDA approval without further trials; however, it is encouraging to see the potential of this narrow-spectrum antibiotic for CDI.

Syphilis

While not a new antibiotic, linezolid was tested for a new potential indication in the Trep-AB RCT published in April 2024. In that study, linezolid was tested for the treatment of early syphilis based on its success in in vitro and animal models. Patients received either 600 mg of oral linezolid daily for 5 days or a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G. Ultimately, the study was halted early due to safety concerns as only 70% of the patients in the linezolid arm met the primary end point of serologic response at 48 weeks, compared with 100% in the penicillin G group. The question remains whether more frequent dosing or longer courses of linezolid would be effective; at this time, however, linezolid does not appear to be a suitable alternative.

### Interim estimates of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness among adults aged ≥ 18 years-VISION and IVY networks, September 2024-January 2025 [^bb845ed0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During September 2024–January 2025, 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination provided additional protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters and hospitalizations among adults with and without immunocompromising conditions, compared with not receiving a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. These results support current CDC recommendations for 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination, irrespective of previous COVID-19 vaccination and infection history, and represent the added benefit of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination above existing protection from previous vaccination or infection.

During the analytic period, the primary circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages were descendants of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, including KP.2, KP.3, and XEC. XEC is closely related to the KP.2 and JN.1 strains in the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines, which might account for the sustained protection from COVID-19 vaccination observed during the analysis period, despite the emergence and increasing prevalence of XEC. Starting in January 2025, prevalence of LP.8.1 (a JN.1 and KP.1.1 descendent) began to increase, accounting for 31% of sequences in CDC's national genomic surveillance as of February 15, 2025. The pace and frequency with which new SARS-CoV-2 lineages have become predominant underscores the need for ongoing monitoring of COVID-19 VE and genomic surveillance.

### Patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases remain at risk for hospitalisation for COVID-19 infection in the omicron era (2022–2024): a retrospective cohort study [^52190d05]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a temporal decline in the risk of death and other severe outcomes (eg, hospitalisation, mechanical ventilation) in the general population and among people with rheumatic disease. Since December 2021, Omicron variants have been the dominant circulating strains, with the KP.2, KP.3 and LB.1 variants having the highest current prevalence in the USA as of August 2024. Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate a > 60% reduction in hospitalisations for COVID-19 infection since 2021 and a marked reduction in deaths due to COVID-19. Similarly, among individuals with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs), we reported that those infected during the Omicron era had over a threefold lower odds of hospitalisation compared with those infected in the early pandemic.

While COVID-19 outcomes have improved, factors associated with severe COVID-19 among individuals with SARDs in the Omicron era — during which > 95% of the population has antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and in which multiple treatments are available — remain unclear. Since the early pandemic, individuals with SARDs have been identified as having increased risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes because of immunosuppressive medication use, comorbidity burdens and immune dysregulation. Multiple medications that are regularly used to treat immune-mediated diseases, including CD20 inhibitors, glucocorticoids and several conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), have been associated with impaired humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 and other vaccines, risk of breakthrough infection and/or risk of more severe outcome of acute COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we investigated the risk factors for severe outcomes among individuals with SARDs and COVID-19 in a large healthcare system in the USA during the Omicron era.

### Meropenem-vaborbactam (Vabomere) [^430e08a7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

The meropenem component of VABOMERE is a penem antibacterial drug. The bactericidal action of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem is stable to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases, including penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, with the exception of carbapenem hydrolyzing beta-lactamases.

The vaborbactam component of VABOMERE is a non-suicidal beta-lactamase inhibitor that protects meropenem from degradation by certain serine beta-lactamases such as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Vaborbactam does not have any antibacterial activity. Vaborbactam does not decrease the activity of meropenem against meropenem-susceptible organisms.

### Ceftazidime, avibactam (Avycaz) [^548e6768]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

The ceftazidime component of AVYCAZ is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug with in vitro activity against certain gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal action of ceftazidime is mediated through binding to essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The avibactam component of AVYCAZ is a non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inactivates certain beta-lactamases that degrade ceftazidime. Avibactam does not decrease the activity of ceftazidime against ceftazidime-susceptible organisms.

AVYCAZ demonstrated in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae in the presence of some beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) of the following groups: TEM, SHV, CTX-M, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPCs), AmpC, and certain oxacillinases (OXA). AVYCAZ also demonstrated in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa in the presence of some AmpC beta-lactamases, and certain strains lacking outer membrane porin (OprD). AVYCAZ is not active against bacteria that produce metallo-beta lactamases and may not have activity against gram-negative bacteria that overexpress efflux pumps or have porin mutations.

### High prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in hanoi, Vietnam, 2023–2024 [^26c653ed]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Ceftriaxone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an escalating global health concern, threatening the efficacy of empiric treatment. In the Asia-Pacific region, a rapid surge in ceftriaxone resistance has been observed, primarily associated with the penA-60.001 allele. This study, conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam between 2023 and 2024, analyzed 352 N. gonorrhoeae isolates and found a 27% prevalence of ceftriaxone resistance. Whole-genome sequencing identified that resistance was predominantly driven by the mosaic penA-237.001 allele, with a smaller contribution from penA-60.001. The high prevalence of resistance and the emergence of new alleles underscore the urgent threat to ceftriaxone as an empiric treatment option.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^61321089]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

Porcine pneumonia models — mechanically ventilated pig studies and applications: Animal models of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated pigs allow the study of various aspects, including pathophysiology, prevention, and new treatments for pneumonia, and porcine pneumonia models caused by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae have been developed and used in numerous studies. A model of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia in mechanically ventilated pigs with bacteremia have been described using serotype 19A. These models have supported research on ceftolozane/tazobactam, nebulized antibiotic agents such as colistin, inhaled bacteriophage, antimicrobial effects on endotracheal tube biofilms, and inflammatory mechanisms, and nonantimicrobial preventive measures involving body positioning, biofilms, novel devices, mucus clearance interventions, and live bacteria treatment; the clinical translatability of the findings obtained from these models is noteworthy.

### Ceftazidime, avibactam (Avycaz) [^cb5eb4e1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the Phase 3 HABP/VABP trial, 54.1% (236/436) of patients treated with AVYCAZ were 65 years of age or older, including 129 (29.6%) patients 75 years of age or older. The incidence of adverse reactions in patients ≥ 65 years of age was similar to patients < 65 years of age. The 28-day all-cause mortality was similar between treatment groups for patients 65 years of age or older (12.7% [29/229] for patients in the AVYCAZ arm and 11.3% [26/230] for patients in the meropenem arm).

Ceftazidime and avibactam are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney; therefore, the risk of adverse reactions to ceftazidime and avibactam may be greater in patients with decreased renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Healthy elderly subjects had 17% greater exposure relative to healthy young subjects when administered the same single dose of avibactam, which may have been related to decreased renal function in the elderly subjects. Dosage adjustment for elderly patients should be based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.000000000000000e+00 6 Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment is required in adult patients with moderately or severely impaired renal function (CrCl 50 mL/min or less). For patients with changing renal function, CrCl should be monitored at least daily, particularly early in treatment, and dosage of AVYCAZ adjusted accordingly. Both ceftazidime and avibactam are hemodialyzable; thus, AVYCAZ should be administered after hemodialysis on hemodialysis days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Dosage adjustment is also required in pediatric patients with renal impairment from 2 years to less than 18 years of age with eGFR 50 mL/min/1.73 m² or less. There is insufficient information to recommend a dosing regimen for pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The Phase 3 HABP/VABP trial included 436 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) administered intravenously over 120 minutes and 434 patients treated with meropenem. The median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 66 years (range 18 to 89 years) and 54.1% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly male (74.5%) and Asian (56.2%).

Death occurred in 9.6% (42/ 436) of patients who received AVYCAZ and in 8.3% (36/434) of patients who received meropenem. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.7% (16/436) of patients receiving AVYCAZ and 3% (13/434) of patients receiving meropenem.

Adverse reactions occurring at 5% or greater in patients receiving AVYCAZ were diarrhea and vomiting.

1.400000000000000e+01 1 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections

Adult Patients

A total of 1058 adults hospitalized with cIAI were randomized and received trial medications in a multinational, multi-center, double-blind trial comparing AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) intravenously every 8 hours plus metronidazole (0.5 grams intravenously every 8 hours) to meropenem (1 gram intravenously every 8 hours) for 5 to 14 days of therapy. Complicated intra-abdominal infections included appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, gastric/duodenal perforation, perforation of the intestine, and other causes of intra-abdominal abscesses and peritonitis.

The microbiologically modified intent-to treat (mMITT) population, which included all patients who had at least one baseline intra-abdominal pathogen, consisted of 823 patients; the median age was 51 years and 62.8% were male. The majority of patients (64.9%) were from Eastern Europe; 7.5% were from the United States. Less than 1.0% of patients were of Pacific Island or African descent. The most common primary cIAI diagnosis was appendiceal perforation or peri-appendiceal abscess, occurring in 44.7% of patients. Bacteremia at baseline was present in 4.3% of patients.

### An evaluation of bimekizumab for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa [^1ac138c0]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Until recently, the biological treatment options for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) were largely restricted to adalimumab and secukinumab. In 2024, bimekizumab, an IL-17A and IL-17F antibody was introduced to the clinical practice.

Areas Covered

Bimekizumab offers a new therapeutic approach for managing HS. It was approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2024. The available biologic therapies in HS treatment are described. The data from phase II and phase III clinical trials were analyzed to evaluate the bimekizumab effectiveness in HS treatment. Data from those trials and latest summaries of product characteristics (SmPC) were retrieved to investigate its safety profile. The current preliminary data regarding its long-term effectiveness from BE HEARD EXT (NCT04901195) trial were presented.

Expert Opinion

The common side effects of bimekizumab were upper respiratory infections, candida infections and eczematous reactions across all indications. The favorable side effects profile and strong clinical effectiveness proved in clinical trials gave the bimekizumab potential to become the first-choice drug in HS treatment.

### Epidemiology, mechanisms, and clinical impact of bacterial heteroresistance [^ec8acf5f]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Heteroresistance to carbapenems has also been widely studied and reported from different countries. In Spain, 18 strains of VIM-producing bacteria were examined, and it was found that 16.7% of them exhibited heteroresistance to carbapenems. In six CRKP isolates, heteroresistance to meropenem was investigated, and it was found that all of them demonstrated positive results. Considerable research has been conducted on the heteroresistance of E. coli to carbapenems. However, the results of these studies have been found to vary considerably. A selection of hospital isolates from Sweden, the USA, and China, was specifically chosen for investigation into the heteroresistance patterns of E. coli to imipenem, ertapenem, and meropenem. The prevalence of heteroresistance exhibited considerable variation across these countries: Imipenem showed 0, 25, and 25% heteroresistance in Sweden, the USA, and China, respectively. Ertapenem heteroresistance prevalence were 27.3, 35, and 17.2%, and meropenem heteroresistance prevalence were 0, 30, and 3.9% for the same countries in order. It has been reported that all eight screened A. baumannii susceptible to carbapenems exhibited colony growth within the inhibitory circle, suggesting the existence of a heteroresistance subpopulation. However, it has also been reported that the heteroresistance prevalence of A. baumannii to imipenem and meropenem were at 20 and 0%, respectively.

Heteroresistance to ceftazidime-avibactam was reported in China. 11.55% ceftazidime/avibactam-susceptible KPC-KP isolates exhibited ceftazidime/avibactam heteroresistance, with the primary mechanism being the presence of KPC mutant subpopulations. Heteroresistance to tigecycline has been reported at varying rates in small epidemiological studies involving hundreds of isolates: up to 56% in A. baumannii (data from South Korea), 20% in E. cloacae (data from China), and 7.8% in K. pneumoniae (data from China). Fosfomycin heteroresistance is frequently observed in Enterobacterales, with prevalence estimated at ~10%.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, therefore adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of durlobactam with or without sulbactam was evaluated in 380 adult subjects across six phase 1 trials, one phase 2 trial in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) including acute pyelonephritis, and one phase 3 trial (also referred to as Trial 1) in adult patients with infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex including hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), and ventilated pneumonia (VP) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

In the randomized, active-controlled portion of the phase 3 trial, 91 patients received XACDURO (1 g sulbactam and 1 g durlobactam, or renally adjusted dose) intravenously over 3 hours every 6 hours and 86 patients were treated with colistin 2.5 mg/kg (or renally adjusted dose) intravenously over 30 minutes every 12 hours after an initial loading dose of colistin 2.5 to 5 mg/kg. Both treatment arms also received 1 g imipenem/1 g cilastatin (or renally adjusted dose) intravenously every 6 hours as background therapy for potential HABP/VABP pathogens other than Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. The mean duration of XACDURO therapy was 9 days versus 8 days for colistin.

Serious Adverse Reactions and Discontinuation of Treatment

Thirty-six patients (40%) in the XACDURO treatment group and 42 patients (49%) in the colistin treatment group experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reaction occurred in 10/91 (11%) patients treated with XACDURO and in 14/86 (16%) patients treated with colistin. One patient treated with XACDURO developed anaphylactic shock which led to discontinuation of treatment.

Common Adverse Reactions

Adverse reactions were reported in 88% (80/91) of patients in the XACDURO treatment group and 94% (81/86) of patients in the colistin treatment group. The most common adverse reactions reported in > 10% of patients treated with XACDURO were liver test abnormalities, diarrhea, anemia, and hypokalemia. Table 2 lists selected adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of > 5% in Trial 1.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^6ce845ec]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — community-acquired pneumonia/bacteremia empiric therapy — children with HIV whose immune systems are not seriously compromised and who are not neutropenic should be treated for the most likely bacterial organisms (AIII). Based only on expert opinion, mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia in children with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with only mild or no immunosuppression who are fully immunized can be treated with oral antibiotics (usually oral amoxicillin) according to the same guidelines as for healthy children (BIII). For hospitalized children outside of the neonatal period with suspected community-acquired bacterial pneumonia or bacteremia, options for empiric therapy include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone), respectively (AIII). The addition of a macrolide or fluoroquinolone can be considered for hospitalized individuals with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens. If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns and adjusted according to culture results). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug if infection with Pseudomonas spp. is likely. Severely immunocompromised children with HIV and invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### In vitro activity of cefepime-enmetazobactam on carbapenem-resistant Gram negatives [^af194f59]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Cefepime-enmetazobactam is a new β-lactam/βlactamase inhibitor combination with broad-spectrum activity against multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers. This study evaluated the in vitro activity of cefepime-enmetazobactam towards a collection of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii compared to the other β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Methods

The MIC of cefepime, cefepime-enmetazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem, imipenem-relebactam, and ertapenem were determined by broth microdilution on 2212 CRE, including 2089 carbapenemase producers (1000 OXA-48-like, 49 KPC, 697 NDM, 180 VIM, 1 IMP, 9 IMI, and 158 multiple carbapenemases) and 123 CRE that do not produce carbapenemase received at the French National Reference Centre (from March 1, 2023 to August 31, 2023), 50 P. aeruginosa, and 30 A. baumannii. All strains were fully sequenced.

Results

We confirmed the absence of inhibitory activity of enmetazobactam towards metallo-β-lactamases. Cefepime-enmetazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam exhibited a similar susceptibility (96.7% vs. 99.5%, respectively) on OXA-48-producers. Cefepime-enmetazobactam exhibited 66.9% and 63.3% susceptibility for CRE non-EPC and KPC, whereas those rates rose to 96.7%/95.9%, 93.4%/95.9%, and 95.9%/98.0% for ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-relebactam, and meropenem-vaborbactam, respectively. Low MICs (≤ 0.25 mg/L) were obtained for ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant KPC variants. Cefepime-enmetazobactam did not display a significant added value when compared with cefepime alone on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.

Discussion

OXA-48 producers displayed high susceptibility to cefepime-enmetazobactam, which is similar to ceftazidime-avibactam, including for OXA-48 producers that coproduce a ceftazidime hydrolyzing enzyme (extended-spectrum β-lactamases or AmpC). In vivo experiments have to be implemented to confirm if cefepime-enmetazobactam might be a relevant alternative to ceftazidime-avibactam for the treatment of infections caused by OXA-48 producers.

### Genomic and phenotypic insights into antibiotic resistance and virulence of Klebsiella pneumoniae from the environment in Southern Taiwan [^807e8ce9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Environmental K. pneumoniae Can Mediate AMR Transfer

A plasmid conjugation experiment was conducted using K. pneumoniae as a donor strain and E. coli as a recipient strain to evaluate the potential for environmental strains to mediate AMR transfer. Whole-genome sequencing analysis identified the presence of the ciprofloxacin resistance gene qnrS1 on a plasmid in the environmental MDR-Kp WKP4. Following conjugation between K. pneumoniae WKP4 and the ciprofloxacin-sensitive E. coli J53, transfer of the qnrS1 gene was successfully demonstrated (Table 3, J53 conjugant #1 and #2). Minimum inhibitory concentration testing revealed increased ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli conjugants, confirming the acquisition of resistance. These results demonstrate the potential of environmental K. pneumoniae for plasmid transfer of AMR genes, highlighting its role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.

Table 3.
Transfer of Ciprofloxacin Resistance by Conjugation Between the Environmental Strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (WKP4) and Escherichia coli (J53)

The spatial distribution of environmental strains was mapped against nearby livestock farms, hospitals, wastewater treatment plants, and population density (Figure 4). Three MDR-Kp strains were located near potential anthropogenic or animal sources: one near a livestock farm, one near a hospital, and one near both a livestock farm and a treatment plant. Four hvKp strains were more broadly distributed across communities, with one located near a hospital. These patterns suggest possible environmental links to human and agricultural activities, though further source tracking is needed.

### Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium (Zevtera) [^e896b3ed]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial Design

The efficacy of ZEVTERA in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.

The study enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CABP based on clinical signs and symptoms, fever and/or leukocytosis/leukopenia, and new radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with known bronchial obstruction, pulmonary malignancies, cystic fibrosis, lung abscess, pleural effusion as the primary source of infection, active tuberculosis, or pneumonia known or suspected to be caused by atypical bacteria, were excluded from study participation, as were patients with known or suspected extrapulmonary complications such as concomitant meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis.

The ITT primary analysis population comprised all patients randomized. The clinically evaluable (CE) population comprised patients in the ITT population who received at least 48 hours of study medication and met protocol-defined criteria regarding clinical evaluability.

The protocol-specified primary efficacy analyses included clinical cure rates at TOC visit, 7 to 14 days after the end-of-treatment (EOT) in the co-primary ITT and CE populations. The ITT population comprised 638 patients (314 ZEVTERA, 324 ceftriaxone ± linezolid), in 103 centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CE population comprised 469 patients, and the microbiological ITT (mITT) population comprised 184 patients with at least one valid baseline pathogen.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^2abcc826]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — treatment duration and cautions: Duration — For most patients, 5–7 days, and patients should be afebrile for 48–72 hours and clinically stable before stopping antibiotics; longer duration is often required if severe CAP or bacteremia is present, particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or complicated S. aureus pneumonia. Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but is not being treated. Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII), and patients receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have bacterial resistance to macrolide due to chronic exposure. For patients begun on IV antibiotic therapy, switching to PO should be considered when they are clinically improved and able to tolerate oral medications. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for developing drug resistance and drug toxicities (AII).

An important component in achieving realization of the benefits of RAST will be in fostering rapid action following the results. Others have demonstrated that having a team, such as an infectious disease pharmacy team or an antimicrobial stewardship team, responsible to rapidly act on bacteremia test results can improve patient care, and integrating an antimicrobial stewardship team into the process of caring for patients with bacteremia is becoming an essential component of standard of care.

Most RAST systems require identification of the bacteria using a separate test system. It is not clear if laboratories will adopt MALDI or molecular testing methods to achieve rapid organism identification. Currently, molecular identification tests for PBC are relatively financially expensive, and MALDI workflows for rapid identification from PBC require substantial human time. However, tools are being developed to reduce the complexity of MALDI identification from PBC (bioMérieux MiTube publication pending). An additional benefit of molecular tests for PBC is the detection of genes associated with resistance (e.g. bla KPC or mecA), but the value of detecting these genes may decrease if RAST can be performed within a similar timeframe and with comparable clinical utility in guiding antimicrobial selection. Pairing RAST with rapid identification is essential, and the systems used for rapid identification will continue to change in parallel with RAST changes.

Getting novel neonatal therapeutics to the clinic – updates and next steps

There have only a few examples of novel therapy translation in neonatal medicine in the last decade, including antenatal glucocorticoids (administered to the mother), postnatal surfactant and caffeine. Postnatal glucocorticoids and probiotics are used in some centres and clinical circumstances, but ongoing challenges prevent widespread adoption. Generally, progress in neonatology research and novel therapies is slow and there are ongoing misconceptions of patient outcomes, with neonatal pathophysiology still being discovered. To support therapeutic innovations, our field needs to encourage generation of a body of robust evidence, comprising extensive datasets gathered in the form of observational clinical data (generating associative evidence and establishing clinical relevance), as well as in vitro and in vivo preclinical small and large animal models to generate proof-of-concept. This strategy, with accumulating research since 2008, – has enabled the 2022 Anakinra Pilot. This is a Phase I/IIa dose-escalation trial in preterm infants to establish safety, feasibility and pharmacokinetics of anakinra (an inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1). With safety, feasibility and pharmacokinetics of anakinra now established, international multi-site Phase III trials are planned to demonstrate the efficacy of anakinra at ameliorating preterm inflammatory diseases. Following the success of anakinra, there are now several other novel therapies under investigation for fetal growth restriction (FGR) and other placental and metabolic complications in perinatology.

### Updates on neonatal cell and novel therapeutics: proceedings of the second neonatal cell therapies symposium (2024) [^d183280b]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 17% of all newborn babies will require transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or special care nursery. Over time NICU processes have improved for newborns, including mechanical ventilation, feeding supplementation, infection control, pain management and medical stabilization. Infant survival and the rate and severity of adverse neurological outcomes, including cerebral palsy, have also improved. However, translation of new therapies to further reduce the risk of neurological impairment, metabolic complications or chronic diseases is sparse compared with adult medicine. Historically, neonates have been underrepresented in research, the experimental risks have been deemed too high, and the ethics of parental proxy consent are complex. It has been documented that as a result, most newborns in NICUs are exposed to off-label and unlicensed drugs. Neonates at risk of poor neurodevelopmental and physical health outcomes require ongoing innovation, with translation of safe and effective therapies from research into care. Cell therapies are under investigation as potential solutions for these neonates, with a range of sources, types and administration strategies being pursued.

The term 'cell therapies' refers to a range of regenerative and non-regenerative stem, progenitor and/or immune cell biologicals, typically sourced from gestational or adult tissues. The number of clinical trials investigating cell therapies for neonatal conditions is on the rise, with a focus on treating preterm lung injury such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and brain injury including periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), ischaemic stroke and hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). Many of these trials aim to prevent permanent brain injury and reduce the severity of motor impairments like cerebral palsy. In addition, there is a burgeoning of novel therapeutic research that includes drugs, small molecules and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Clinical trials of cell and novel therapies have stemmed from hundreds of small and large animal research studies to elucidate the mechanism of action, efficacy, timing of treatment and dose. At the same time, the neonatal field has been uniquely informed by adult and pediatric research, where cell and other novel therapies have progressed from the lab through to later phase trials. However, many questions and unique challenges for neonatal cell therapy research remain.

CONCLUDING CONSIDERATIONS FOR NOW AND THE FUTURE

Many new and established companies are working to improve the rapidity with which AST can be performed for clinical testing. In the past couple of years, several commercial AST IVD systems have received FDA clearance for RAST (Table 3). Although achieving regulatory clearance is a substantial hurdle, implementing these systems in clinical practice has additional challenges. Simons and Capraro have recently written a thoughtful description of the barriers to successful and impactful implementation of these RAST systems, which can include financial costs, technical expertise, existing workflows, stakeholder buy-in, and the rapidity of post-analytical action.

### Adjuvant keytruda improves kidney cancer survival-NCI… [^6d1ab0da]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Pembrolizumab Is First Adjuvant Therapy to Improve Overall Survival in Kidney Cancer, by Carmen Phillips The immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab has rapidly become one of the most widely used cancer treatments. Based on updated results from a large clinical trial, the drug is now part of an important milestone in the treatment of kidney cancer — specifically, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, the most common form of the disease. All participants in the trial had earlier-stage kidney cancer and their tumors could be removed with surgery, but they were also at increased risk of their cancer coming back, or recurring. So after undergoing surgery, they were randomly assigned to get pembrolizumab for up to a year or a placebo and routine monitoring. At 4 years after starting the post-surgical treatment, about 91% of people given pembrolizumab were still alive, compared with 86% of those who received a placebo, according to results published April 17 in the.

New England Journal of Medicine. Overall, people who received pembrolizumab had a nearly 40% reduced risk of dying during that period. The findings mark the first time a post-surgical, or adjuvant, treatment for kidney cancer has been shown to help people live longer. Based on earlier results from this trial, called KEYNOTE-564, the Food and Drug Administration approved pembrolizumab in 2021 as an adjuvant treatment for kidney cancer. At the time of the approval, the trial had only gone on long enough to show an improvement in how long people lived without their cancer returning. But even with the approval, many oncologists haven't been using pembrolizumab routinely as an adjuvant treatment in their higher-risk patients, explained Martin Voss, M. D., and Robert Motzer, M. D., of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in an editorial that accompanied the updated findings.

Instead, they've been waiting to find out whether the treatment improves how long people live overall, Drs. Voss and Mosser wrote. With that question now answered, they continued, "the anticipated effect" on the everyday care of patients "cannot be overstated. " Some experts, however, anticipate a measured change in treatment. "It's not going to be a total paradigm shift, " said Mark Ball, M. D., of NCI's Center for Cancer Research, who specializes in treating kidney cancer. In part, that's because the updated findings also show that many patients appear to do very well with surgery alone, Dr. Ball said. Giving all patients who meet the approval criteria an expensive drug that can have serious side effects, he continued, would clearly be "overtreatment. " So from a research perspective, he said, the next steps are clear: "We have to get smarter about identifying who is at the highest risk of recurrence".

Adjuvant therapy is used in many early-stage cancers that can be treated with surgery. It serves as an insurance policy of sorts, reducing the chances of the cancer coming back by killing any cancer cells missed by surgery or that had already escaped from the tumor before surgery. Until now, only a single adjuvant therapy for kidney cancer has been available: the targeted therapy sunitinib, which was approved by FDA for this use in 2017. That approval was based on one clinical trial in which adjuvant sunitinib improved disease-free survival. But the improvement came with severe side effects, and there's no evidence that the treatment helps people live longer, Dr. Ball explained. As a result, Dr. Ball said, "sunitinib is really never prescribed" for this use. In the absence of an adjuvant therapy that's proven to help people with earlier-stage kidney cancer live longer, many patients only get routine monitoring, or surveillance, afterward.
