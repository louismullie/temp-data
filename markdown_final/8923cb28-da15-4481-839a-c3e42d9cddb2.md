## Question

Why do we use famotodine for angioedema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why famotidine is used for angioedema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic mechanisms of angioedema and whether famotidine's H2 blockade is mechanistically relevant. Then, I should verify guideline-supported indications where famotidine is recommended, especially in alteplase-associated orolingual angioedema. Next, I will examine the evidence base and dosing. After that, I need to distinguish when famotidine is inappropriate, particularly in bradykinin-mediated hereditary angioedema. Finally, I should consider safety, alternatives, and synthesize a practical takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of action and whether it plausibly intersects with angioedema biology. Famotidine is a selective histamine H2-receptor antagonist that reduces histamine-mediated gastric acid secretion and may blunt some histamine-driven vascular effects when combined with H1 blockade, which is relevant to mast cell–mediated processes but not to bradykinin-driven disease, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize its utility across all angioedema phenotypes [^116XnTfH] [^112XZ1Lt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should classify angioedema by mechanism before assigning a role to famotidine. Angioedema broadly falls into mast cell–mediated (histaminergic) forms, which can respond to antihistamines, and bradykinin-mediated forms, such as hereditary angioedema and ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema, which are characteristically unresponsive to antihistamines and corticosteroids, so famotidine would not be expected to help in bradykinin-mediated disease [^1159hmfG] [^113iQNF2].

> Next, I should review where guidelines explicitly recommend famotidine. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for alteplase-associated orolingual angioedema recommend IV methylprednisolone, IV diphenhydramine, and either ranitidine 50 mg IV or famotidine 20 mg IV as part of early management, with escalation to epinephrine if swelling progresses, and consideration of icatibant or C1 inhibitor for refractory cases, which directly supports famotidine in that specific scenario [^115FnbLe] [^117NxVZU].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale in that alteplase context. Although alteplase-induced orolingual angioedema is thought to involve bradykinin pathway activation, the recommended initial regimen mirrors anaphylaxis-style care with steroids, H1, and H2 blockade, likely to mitigate overlapping mast cell–mediated components and stabilize vascular permeability while preparing for airway protection and targeted therapy if needed; famotidine's role here is adjunctive rather than disease-modifying, and escalation to bradykinin-targeted agents is reserved for refractory cases [^115FnbLe] [^114d8bKZ].

> I will now examine the evidence base supporting H2 antagonists in urticaria and angioedema, because that informs the plausibility of famotidine's benefit in histaminergic presentations. Limited randomized data suggest that adding an H2 antagonist to an H1 antihistamine can modestly improve urticaria outcomes compared with H1 alone, although the overall evidence quality is low and heterogeneous, so expectations should be tempered and individualized [^111XxWic] [^1179SnLv].

> Let me consider practical dosing and context to avoid overpromising. In alteplase-associated orolingual angioedema, the recommended famotidine dose is 20 mg IV alongside methylprednisolone 125 mg IV and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, with close airway monitoring and readiness to escalate; outside this specific indication, famotidine may be considered as an adjunct in suspected histaminergic angioedema when combined with H1 therapy, but data are sparse and decisions should be individualized [^115FnbLe] [^1179SnLv].

> But wait, what if the patient has hereditary angioedema or ACE inhibitor–related angioedema; I should confirm that famotidine is not appropriate there. Guidelines consistently advise that epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines, including H2 blockers like famotidine, are ineffective for bradykinin-mediated HAE and are not recommended; instead, on-demand therapy with C1 inhibitor, icatibant, or ecallantide should be used, and famotidine should be avoided as a primary treatment in these entities [^113iQNF2] [^114cyf2r] [^111rp1m4].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. Famotidine is generally well tolerated, but rare hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema have been reported, and cross-reactivity within H2 antagonists can occur, so it is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to famotidine or other H2 blockers; in acute settings, monitor for CNS effects such as confusion or delirium, especially with IV use, and consider drug interactions that prolong QT in susceptible patients [^111DvoVW] [^113a5cDJ] [^1144SqN1].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to avoid overgeneralization. Famotidine is used for angioedema primarily as part of the early management of alteplase-associated orolingual angioedema, where it is guideline-endorsed as an adjunct with steroids and H1 antihistamine while preparing for airway protection and escalation to bradykinin-targeted therapy if needed; outside this context, famotidine may be tried as an adjunct in suspected histaminergic angioedema alongside H1 therapy, but evidence is limited and it should not be used for bradykinin-mediated HAE or ACE inhibitor–related angioedema where disease-specific therapies are required [^115FnbLe] [^1179SnLv] [^113iQNF2].

---

Famotidine is used for angioedema because it **blocks H2 receptors** to reduce histamine-mediated vascular permeability and edema, providing additional benefit when combined with H1 antihistamines [^112XZ1Lt] [^111XxWic]. It is **not effective for bradykinin-mediated angioedema** (HAE, ACE inhibitor-induced) [^113iQNF2], where icatibant or C1 inhibitor is required [^114cyf2r]. Famotidine is a guideline-supported adjunct in mast cell–mediated angioedema, especially with urticaria, but is not first-line monotherapy and should be used with caution in patients with QT risk or H2 antagonist hypersensitivity [^1179SnLv] [^1168Mmv9] [^113a5cDJ].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of famotidine

Famotidine is a selective H2 receptor antagonist that **reduces histamine-mediated gastric acid secretion**; it also inhibits H2 receptors on vascular endothelial cells, decreasing vascular permeability and edema. This mechanism is relevant in **mast cell–mediated angioedema**, where histamine release increases vascular permeability and causes edema.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting famotidine use in angioedema

Evidence supporting famotidine in angioedema is **limited but suggestive**, particularly for mast cell–mediated disease:

- **Urticaria evidence**: H2 antagonists, including famotidine, provide modest benefit when added to H1 antihistamines for urticaria, which shares pathophysiology with mast cell–mediated angioedema [^111XxWic] [^112zZBZ8].
- **Anaphylaxis adjunct**: Famotidine is recommended as an adjunct to H1 antihistamines in anaphylaxis for possible synergistic effect, though evidence quality is low [^115Nzd46] [^1161okEd].
- **Alteplase-induced angioedema**: Guidelines recommend famotidine as part of a standard regimen (with corticosteroids and H1 antihistamines) for alteplase-associated orolingual angioedema, reflecting clinical practice patterns despite limited direct evidence [^115FnbLe] [^117NxVZU].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Famotidine is **not effective in bradykinin-mediated angioedema** (HAE, ACE inhibitor-induced) [^113iQNF2]; these forms require specific therapies such as icatibant or C1 inhibitor [^115FnbLe]. It is also contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to famotidine or other H2 antagonists [^1168Mmv9] and should be used cautiously in those with QT prolongation risk [^113a5cDJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support famotidine as an adjunct in mast cell–mediated angioedema, particularly with urticaria, but **not as first-line monotherapy**. It is recommended alongside H1 antihistamines and corticosteroids in specific scenarios such as alteplase-induced angioedema [^115FnbLe] [^117NxVZU].

---

## Comparison with other H2 antagonists

Famotidine is preferred over other H2 antagonists (e.g. ranitidine) due to **fewer drug interactions and a more favorable safety profile**, including lower risk of QT prolongation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient-reported benefits

Clinical outcomes with famotidine in angioedema are modest; it provides additional symptom relief when combined with H1 antihistamines, particularly for urticaria-associated angioedema. Patient-reported benefits include **reduced pruritus and swelling**, though responses vary and are generally less robust than with H1 antihistamines alone.

---

Famotidine is a **modestly effective adjunct** for mast cell–mediated angioedema, especially with urticaria, but is not effective for bradykinin-mediated disease. It is best used with H1 antihistamines and corticosteroids in selected cases, with attention to contraindications and QT risk.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — management of orolingual angioedema associated with IV alteplase prioritizes airway protection, cessation of alteplase and ACE inhibitors, and staged medications. Maintain airway; endotracheal intubation may not be necessary if edema is limited to anterior tongue and lips, but edema involving the larynx, palate, floor of mouth, or oropharynx with rapid progression (within 30 min) poses higher risk of requiring intubation; awake fiberoptic intubation is optimal, with nasal-tracheal intubation carrying epistaxis risk after IV alteplase and cricothyroidotomy rarely needed and also problematic after IV alteplase. Discontinue IV alteplase infusion and hold ACE inhibitors. Administer IV methylprednisolone 125 mg, IV diphenhydramine 50 mg, and ranitidine 50 mg IV or famotidine 20 mg IV. If angioedema progresses, administer epinephrine (0.1%) 0.3 mL subcutaneously or by nebulizer 0.5 mL. For refractory cases, icatibant 3 mL (30 mg) subcutaneously with the option for an additional 30 mg at intervals of 6 h not to exceed 3 injections in 24 h, or plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitor 20 IU/kg, has been successfully used in hereditary angioedema and ACE inhibitor-related angioedema; provide supportive care.

### Icatibant averting mechanical ventilation in acute ischemic stroke patient with alteplase-induced orolingual angioedema [^114d8bKZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute management of OA remains a great challenge. There are no official first‐line treatment recommendations for OA caused by alteplase infusion. However, standard anaphylactic treatment is clearly recommended in these patients, including immediate discontinuation of intravenous alteplase infusion and intravenous administration of methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, and ranitidine or famotidine. In cases with further angioedema increase/expansion, epinephrine administration (subcutaneously or alternatively by nebulizer) is highly recommended. Moreover, novel agents including icatibant, a selective bradykinin B2‐receptor antagonist and a plasma‐derived human C1 esterase inhibitor, are more commonly recommended in severe, resistant cases.

Icatibant is a synthetic bradykinin B2‐receptor antagonist and has been approved for the symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema in adults, adolescents, and children aged 2 years and older with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. It has been observed that icatibant reduces median onset‐to‐symptom relief time from 12.0 to 2.0 h. In patients with ACE inhibitor‐induced angioedema who received icatibant, the time to symptomatic improvement was similar to that seen with icatibant in cases of hereditary angioedema. Moreover, in 2015 a randomized phase 2 clinical trial involving patients with ACE inhibitor‐induced angioedema demonstrated that subcutaneous icatibant administration achieved a complete angioedema resolution more quickly than the standard therapy consisting of glucocorticoids and antihistamines. Based on the hypothesis that angioedema following alteplase infusion is bradykinin‐mediated, limited cases have been published, where icatibant was successfully given in refractory alteplase‐induced OA, resulting in complete edema resolution. The baseline characteristics and outcomes of these cases are summarized in Table S1.

### A novel approach to the treatment of orolingual angioedema after tissue plasminogen activator Administration [^115qB8QD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Orolingual angioedema is a rare adverse effect of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), with an incidence of 1% to 5%. There are currently no published reports describing resolution of tPA-induced orolingual angioedema with complement inhibitor therapy. A 72-year-old man receiving home angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy presented to the emergency department with newly developed orolingual angioedema after treatment with tPA for acute ischemic stroke. Therapy was initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg, famotidine 20 mg, and diphenhydramine 50 mg, without significant improvement. Because of increased concern for airway protection, plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitor was administered. Concerns about progressive and airway-threatening orolingual angioedema subsided 2 hours after administration, and invasive airway maneuvers were avoided. Orolingual angioedema is an infrequent, severe adverse effect of tPA for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Complement inhibitors may be an additional therapeutic option for patients presenting with orolingual angioedema with potential airway compromise that is refractory to standard anaphylactic therapies.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The adverse reactions listed below have been reported during domestic and international clinical trials in approximately 2500 patients. In those controlled clinical trials in which famotidine tablets were compared to placebo, the incidence of adverse experiences in the group which received famotidine tablets, 40 mg at bedtime, was similar to that in the placebo group.

The following adverse reactions have been reported to occur in more than 1% of patients on therapy with famotidine in controlled clinical trials, and may be causally related to the drug: headache (4.7%), dizziness (1.3%), constipation (1.2%) and diarrhea (1.7%).

The following other adverse reactions have been reported infrequently in clinical trials or since the drug was marketed. The relationship to therapy with famotidine has been unclear in many cases. Within each category the adverse reactions are listed in order of decreasing severity:

Body as a Whole: fever, asthenia, fatigue

Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, AV block, palpitation

Gastrointestinal: cholestatic jaundice, liver enzyme abnormalities, vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth

Hematologic: rare cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia

Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, orbital or facial edema, urticaria, rash, conjunctival injection

Musculoskeletal: musculoskeletal pain including muscle cramps, arthralgia

Nervous System/Psychiatric: grand mal seizure; psychic disturbances, which were reversible in cases for which follow-up was obtained, including hallucinations, confusion, agitation, depression, anxiety, decreased libido; paresthesia; insomnia; somnolence

Respiratory: bronchospasm

Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis (very rare), alopecia, acne, pruritus, dry skin, flushing

Special Senses: tinnitus, taste disorder

Other: rare cases of impotence and rare cases of gynecomastia have been reported; however, in controlled clinical trials, the incidences were not greater than those seen with placebo.

The adverse experience profile seen with FLUXID™ was similar to that seen with famotidine tablets.

### Histamine H2-receptor antagonists for urticaria [^111XxWic]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urticaria is a common skin disease characterised by itching weals or hives, which can occur almost anywhere on the body. There are a number of different subtypes and a range of available treatment options. There is lack of agreement on the efficacy of H2-receptor antagonists used in the treatment of urticaria.

Objectives

To assess the safety and effectiveness of H2-receptor antagonists in the treatment of urticaria.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 7 October 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of H2-receptor antagonists in people with a clinical diagnosis of urticaria of any duration or of any subtype. Studies including H1-antihistamines for chronic urticaria are the topic of a separate Cochrane review; thus, they were not included in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted and analysed data.

Main Results

Four studies of a relatively small size, involving 144 participants, were included in this review. A combination of ranitidine with diphenhydramine was more effective at improving the resolution of urticaria than diphenhydramine administered alone (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.36). Although there was a similar improvement in itching, weal size, and intensity, cimetidine provided no statistically significant greater overall improvement in symptoms of urticaria when compared to diphenhydramine. However, a combination of these medications was more effective than diphenhydramine alone (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.94). Adverse events were reported with several of the interventions, i.e. ranitidine and diphenhydramine, causing drowsiness and sedation, but there was no significant difference in the level of sedation from baseline with either famotidine or diphenhydramine.

Authors' Conclusions

The very limited evidence provided by this review was based on a few old studies of a relatively small size, which we categorised as having high to unclear risk of bias. Thus, at present, the review does not allow confident decision-making about the use of H2-receptor antagonists for urticaria. Although some of these studies have reported a measure of relief of symptoms of urticaria and rather minimal clinical improvement in some of the participants, the evidence was weak and unreliable. We have emphasised the lack of precision and limitations in the reported data where appropriate in this review.

### Current and prospective targets of pharmacologic treatment of hereditary angioedema types 1 and 2 [^117K79Ej]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new and more targeted therapies. The availability of more easily administered ODT options has improved both patients' safety and quality of life. The anticipated shift towards highly effective, less frequently administered, and easily used LTP will hopefully further reduce the frequency and severity of HAE attacks and ameliorate the burden on HAE patients.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^112zZBZ8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Dermatographism — Patients promptly have a wheal‑and‑flare response to pressure applied to the skin, and it is the most common form of physical urticaria reported to be present in 2% to 5% of the general population, although only a minority have symptoms prompting medical attention. Diagnosis of symptomatic dermographism can be confirmed by stroking the skin with a firm object; a dermographometer can also be used, with thresholds of 4900 g/cm² for simple (nonpruritic) dermatographism and 2300 to 2600 g/cm² for symptomatic dermatographism. The wheal‑and‑flare response should develop within 1 to 3 minutes; with symptomatic dermographism, urticaria occurs less than 5 minutes after provocation and can last for more than 30 minutes, whereas delayed pressure urticaria responses might manifest after several hours. Symptomatic dermatographism has been reported in association with bacterial, fungal, or scabies infection and after treatment with penicillin or famotidine, although in most cases it is idiopathic. Management generally includes avoidance measures, skin hydration, and antihistamines; both first‑ and second‑generation H1‑antagonists (eg, hydroxyzine and cetirizine) have been demonstrated to improve symptom control. The addition of H2‑antagonists to H1‑antagonists might be beneficial but has not improved symptom control in all studies, and improvement with UVB light therapy has also been reported.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^114QG6ns]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Desensitization protocols — premedication and on-protocol management are outlined as follows: Patients are advised to use 20 mg of oral cetirizine on the evening before desensitization, the morning of desensitization, and immediately before initiation of desensitization; those with initial skin symptoms can be given oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 25 mg and oral ranitidine 150 mg (intravenous ranitidine 50 mg or famotidine can be substituted), and patients with mild cutaneous symptoms may benefit from oral aspirin 325 mg on the night before their desensitization and again 1 hour before their desensitization protocol begins; during desensitization, mild reactions are treated with intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg, more severe or recurrent reactions with intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg, and systemic anaphylaxis with intramuscular epinephrine 0.3 mg; in select settings, patients with a negative repeat skin test have safely received their chemotherapeutic dose using a modified 8-step desensitization protocol, and low-risk patients may receive carboplatin by infusion at 50% of the standard infusion rate in an outpatient infusion center setting.

### H2-antihistamines for the treatment of anaphylaxis with and without shock: a systematic review [^1161okEd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, which is rapid in onset and sometimes can prove fatal. Although H2-antihistamines are often administered for emergency treatment in anaphylaxis, there is uncertainty about their effectiveness in this disease.

Objective

To assess the benefits and harms of H2-antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Methods

A systematic review was performed of randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing H2-antihistamines with placebo or no intervention in patients with anaphylaxis.

Results

The authors failed to identify any eligible studies for inclusion in this systematic review.

Conclusion

When H2-antihistamines are recommended for anaphylaxis treatment, the status of the evidence base supporting their use should be described. Well-designed randomized controlled trials investigating the role of H2-antihistamines in anaphylaxis treatment are urgently needed.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115RwN1T]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia — Management of grade 1–2 asparaginase reactions allows continuation with premedication and infusion adjustments when specific features are absent. If the patient has grade 1 or grade 2 reactions including rash, flushing, urticaria, and drug fever ≥ 38°C without bronchospasm, hypotension, edema, or need for parenteral intervention, the causative asparaginase may be continued with consideration for anti-allergy premedication such as hydrocortisone, famotidine or ranitidine, diphenhydramine or cetirizine, and acetaminophen. Measures can be considered to prevent or limit infusion reaction severity including slowing infusion to ≥ 2 hours, infusing normal saline concurrently, and using premedications.

### Urticaria and angioedema: a practical approach [^113qfUoj]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria (i.e., pruritic, raised wheals) and angioedema (i.e., deep mucocutaneous swelling) occur in up to 25 percent of the U.S. population. Vasoactive mediators released from mast cells and basophils produce the classic wheal and flare reaction. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially if symptoms are chronic or minimally responsive to therapy. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and methodical investigation are necessary to uncover diagnostic clues. Although serious medical illness can occur concurrently with chronic urticaria, acute urticaria generally is benign and self-limited. The mainstay of therapy for urticaria is avoidance of known triggering agents, judicious use of oral corticosteroids, and treatment with long-acting second-generation antihistamines, H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory leukotriene antagonists. Consultation for investigative therapy may be necessary if symptoms continue despite a stepwise approach to diagnosis and therapy.

The patient had 2 episodes of anaphylaxis as a young child. The frequency and severity of these anaphylactic reactions increased when she was around 14 years of age, prompting reengagement with specialty teams. She was initially prescribed omalizumab (300 mg every 4 weeks), which allowed for weaning off high-dose steroids (prednisone, 2 mg/kg per day). The patient has been taking famotidine (20 mg per day) and fexofenadine (180 mg twice per day) long term.

### New drugs for the treatment of hereditary angioedema [^117CYt5y]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Revolutionary drugs have been developed and approved in the last 5years for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). Increased knowledge of HAE pathophysiology has led to the development of innovative drugs for self-administered on-demand therapy and for short- and long-term prophylaxis (LTP). This has rendered possible a personalized approach for patients, allowing greater control of symptoms, better quality of life and reduction in the incidence of adverse effects linked to old treatments.

Areas Covered

In this review we have highlighted which treatments are currently approved for HAE and some of the promising future therapies under development.

Expert Opinion

While the first generation of approved treatments improved disease control for most patients, innovative therapies may allow individualized action plans and reduce complexity of treatment. Switching therapies due to insufficient efficacy, patient preference or adverse events is becoming progressively feasible and common. New LTPs may lead to the achievement of attack-free remission, allowing us to hopefully reach complete disease control for all patients and further improving their quality of life. In particular, LTPs with longer administration intervals, and on-demand therapies administered via the oral route will have a key role and will set more prominent targets for the upcoming drugs.

### Creating a comprehensive treatment plan for hereditary angioedema [^115mHBMw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has changed dramatically in recent years because of the availability of several HAE-specific medications. This paradigm shift in therapy provides the opportunity to dramatically improve the care of HAE patients, but has increased the complexity of treatment. Patient education and communication with health care providers is crucial. Early treatment of HAE attacks has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of rapid and reliable treatment. This review summarizes the current evidence for best practices in HAE management, and suggests practical steps toward developing a comprehensive treatment plan.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1179SnLv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — antihistamines — In most cases antihistamines are effective therapy, and after eliminating identifiable triggers, high-quality evidence supports antihistamines as first-line therapy. Second-generation antihistamines are designed to limit transfer across the blood-brain barrier and have less sedating effects than first-generation agents; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills and should be prescribed with caution in older adults, and higher than FDA-approved doses of some second-generation antihistamines can cause sedation. Second-generation antihistamines are effective for acute urticaria when used regularly and titrated to an effective dose in most patients, with reassuring long-term safety, even in small children; other medications with potent antihistaminic activity, such as doxepin, might have efficacy when FDA-approved antihistamines lack sufficient efficacy, and Histamine 2 blockers, in combination with H1-antihistamines, might be considered, although the evidence supporting this combination is weak.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^112XZ1Lt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — histamine receptor–targeted therapies are outlined: First-generation H1R antihistamines include diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and chlorpheniramine, but a limitation is their sedative action, impairing driving ability and leading to cognitive decline, particularly in elderly patients, with concern about use in patients with MCAS who are prone to cardiovascular events. Cyproheptadine would function as a sedating H1R blocker and a serotonin receptor antagonist and has been used to treat diarrhea and nausea in MCAS, and ketotifen is available as a compounded medication in the United States and is used to treat dermatologic, gastrointestinal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Rupatadine, an H1R blocker that also blocks platelet-activating factor binding to its receptor, is approved for use in many countries but not in the United States, and in patients with mastocytosis improved control of pruritus, flushing, tachycardia, and headache but not gastrointestinal symptoms; studies for treating MCAS were promising, but not conclusive. H2R blocking agents are commonly used to treat abdominal and/or vascular signs or symptoms of MCAS, with options including nizatidine, famotidine, and cimetidine; H2R antihistamines prevent histamine-mediated acid secretion from parietal cells and blunt vasoactive effects of intravenously infused histamine if combined with an H1R antagonist. Importantly, H1R and H2R blocking agents, especially those with anticholinergic effects, can be associated with cognitive decline that is worse in elderly populations, and therapeutic antagonists for H3 and H4 receptors are in development and might have novel clinical value, particularly H4 receptor antagonists, which reduce pruritus and inflammation in atopic dermatitis.

Objective

To provide a context to understand the opportunity for novel therapeutic modalities to transform the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE).

Data Sources

MEDLINE and PubMed were searched to identify studies involving current treatment of HAE in the United States.

Study Selection

Studies were selected based on their relevance to the treatment of HAE.

Results

The current HAE treatment strategy is far from satisfactory, and its limitations create an unmet clinical need. Current prophylactic treatment exposes patients with HAE to significant risk of adverse effects, and the efficacy of prophylactic treatment, although generally good, is far from perfect.

Conclusions

No specific treatment is currently available in the United States for acute HAE attacks that will reliably work, resulting in a significant unmet clinical need. The emergence of several promising drugs for the treatment of HAE attacks is, thus, an extraordinarily important development in the management of these patients.

### Efficacy of treatment of non-hereditary angioedema [^116wsqJm]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

We opted for a broad overview of the level of evidence of treatment options when performing this systematic review. This was deemed appropriate with regard to the research question and the therapeutic problems physicians face in daily practice. The results may be an overestimation since case reports generally represent one or few patients with positive effects of treatment, and only few cases without response are available possibly due to underreporting. Due to the use of different outcome measures, such as percentage of patients with response or the time to response, it was difficult to compare the results of the studies. Additionally, we found there to be a low level of prior research evidence. Fortunately, in the last couple of years, more extensive research has been published, allowing for the inclusion of several RCTs in this review. Still, our results illustrate the need for further research in these patient groups, including prospective cohort studies and controlled studies. The lack of available guidelines underlines this further. Not included in this review but worthy of mention is the fact that it is known that AE is known to have a detrimental effect on quality of life (QoL). While the impact on the QoL was not a part of this review, it is striking that this aspect was not addressed in many of the included studies. Disease-specific questionnaires have been developed for AE patients, both with regard to disease activity and QoL, and we consider QoL an important additional outcome measure both in acute attacks and prophylactic setting studies.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^112dPCuM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) long-term prophylaxis selection — Summary Statement 21: The need for long-term HAE prophylaxis must be individualized based on the patient's situation. (D). The goal of long-term prophylaxis is to decrease the frequency and severity of HAE attacks, and not all patients with HAE require long-term prophylaxis, so the decision must be individualized. As an alternative (or in addition) to prophylactic management, on-demand treatment with an HAE-specific agent (Table E2) for attacks should be considered for management of patients with HAE.

### Many faces of angioedema: focus on the diagnosis and management of abdominal manifestations of hereditary angioedema [^112UCtUo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Angioedema of the intestinal tract is an infrequent but well-described cause of abdominal pain that can occur because of inherited, acquired, allergic, or drug-induced causes. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a genetic disorder that causes recurrent attacks of severe edema of various body parts, including the intestinal tract. Moderate to severe abdominal pain occurs in 43–93% of such attacks due to intestinal edema. Laryngeal edema is a potentially life-threatening manifestation. Failure to recognize and diagnose HAE or other causes of intestinal angioedema can lead to years of delay in diagnosis, and in the case of HAE, often to unnecessary abdominal surgeries. Recognizing the typical history of recurrent attacks of abdominal pain, oropharyngeal/laryngeal angioedema or cutaneous angioedema, family history of similar symptoms, association of attacks with stress or menses, and exacerbation of attacks after administration of estrogens or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will increase diagnostic accuracy. Interdisciplinary treatment is often necessary after the diagnosis of HAE, first with acute management in the emergency room or the intensive care unit, followed by either drug prophylaxis against future attacks using a C1-esterase inhibitor concentrate or attenuated androgens and discontinuation of medications known to trigger attacks. Newer drugs approved for treatment of acute attacks may have future roles in the prevention of attacks if further studies support their efficacy. Gastroenterologists in particular should maintain a high index of suspicion for the possibility of HAE or other causes of intestinal angioedema in patients with a history of recurrent abdominal pain.

### Atorvastatin hypersensitivity reaction within 24 hours of first dose [^115QL8it]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We report a case of atorvastatin-induced hypersensitivity reaction in a 58-year-old male following first exposure to the drug. The patient took one dose of atorvastatin 40 mg and presented to the emergency department (ED) within 24 h with a chief complaint of throat swelling, trouble swallowing, and throat pain. The patient did not have pruritis or skin manifestations. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits. However, the patient had leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.68 × 10³/mcL. Eosinophils were within normal limits at 1.6 × 10³/mcL. Bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 mg/dL. The patient was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, and diphenhydramine, and his symptoms began to resolve within 15 min. Statin-induced hypersensitivity reactions could be explained by statins' effects on bradykinin 2 receptors that potentiate vasodilation and leading to angioedema. In the literature, cases of hypersensitivity associated with atorvastatin present after months of cumulative exposure. Therefore, this case is unique in that a reaction developed within 24 h of that first dose.

### A consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema in the emergency department [^111yKS4p]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite its relatively common occurrence and life-threatening potential, the management of angioedema in the emergency department (ED) is lacking in terms of a structured approach. It is paramount to distinguish the different etiologies of angioedema from one another and more specifically differentiate histaminergic-mediated angioedema from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, especially in lieu of the more novel treatments that have recently become available for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. With this background in mind, this consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema attempts to provide a working framework for emergency physicians (EPs) in approaching the patient with angioedema in terms of diagnosis and management in the ED. This consensus parameter was developed from a collaborative effort among a group of EPs and leading allergists with expertise in angioedema. After rigorous debate, review of the literature, and expert opinion, the following consensus guideline document was created. The document has been endorsed by the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM).

Risk of Bias

Risk of bias (RoB) for each study was assessed by one reviewer (MG) and verified by a second reviewer (ME). To allow for a careful assessment of observational studies as well as intervention studies, criteria for risk of bias assessment from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions were supplemented with items from the CARE guidelines checklist. The risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and selective reporting bias was assessed. A low risk of bias was preferred and therefore displayed as a positive finding (+), whereas a high risk of bias was undesirable and displayed as a negative finding (−). The risk of selection bias was considered low (+) for observational studies when symptoms and important clinical findings were described. The risk of performance bias was considered low (+) when the chosen treatment option and dose regimen were both recorded. The risk of detection bias was assessed with regard to (1) effect of treatment and (2) adverse events and was considered low if this was noted in the article. In case of multiple patient groups including more than one type of AE, the risk of detection bias was considered low only when results could be extracted for the subgroups separately and unclear (+/−) when results were described for the total group. The risk of attrition bias was low (+) when reasons for exclusion or dropout were reported, and for controlled studies, the dropouts were balanced between treatment and placebo groups. The risk for reporting bias was low (+) when all prespecified outcomes were fully addressed in the results. Authors of RCTs were contacted to retrieve missing trial details. All evaluations were compared and disagreements between authors were discussed and resolved.

### Current and emerging therapeutics in hereditary angioedema [^1159hmfG]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is characterized by transient movement of fluid from the vasculature into the interstitial space leading to subcutaneous or submucosal non-pitting edema. Current evidence suggests that most angioedema conditions can be grouped into 2 categories: mast cell-mediated (previously termed histaminergic) or bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Although effective therapies for mast cell-mediated angioedema have existed for decades, specific therapies for bradykinin-mediated angioedema have more recently been developed. In recent years, rigorous studies of these therapies in treating hereditary angioedema (HAE) have led to regulatory approvals of medication for HAE management thereby greatly expanding HAE treatment options.

CUA step-care approach — Step 1 is "Monotherapy with second generation antihistamine" with "Avoidance of triggers (e.g. NSAIDs) and relevant physical factors if physical urticaria/angioedema syndrome is present". Step 2 states "One or more of the following:" including "Dose advancement of 2nd generation antihistamine used in Step 1", "Add another second generation antihistamine", "Add H2 antagonist", "Add leukotriene receptor antagonist", and "Add 1st generation antihistamine to be taken at bedtime". Step 3 directs "Dose advancement of potent antihistamine (e.g., hydroxyzine or doxepin) as tolerated". Step 4 advises "Add an alternative agent" such as "Omalizumab or cyclosporine" or "Other anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, or biologics". The figure further notes to "Begin treatment at step appropriate for patient's level of severity and previous treatment history", that "At each level of the step-approach, medication(s) should be assessed for patient tolerance and efficacy", and that "Step-down in treatment is appropriate at any step, once consistent control of urticaria/angioedema is achieved".

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^1173m7ES]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only 1 medication is approved for treatment of children < 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for treatment of young children in the United States. The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

### What's new in the treatment of urticaria and angioedema [^111qSgoj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria and angioedema are diseases often managed by Allergy and Immunology specialists. Recent international guidelines have outlined a stepwise approach to management of patients using dose escalation of second-generation antihistamines followed by use of omalizumab and finally cyclosporine in more refractory cases. In select patients (those with refractory chronic urticaria), nonbiologic alternative medications with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant activity may be considered. Angioedema without wheals may have several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Optimal management of mast cell-mediated angioedema is less clear but is often managed similar to chronic spontaneous urticaria. Drug-induced angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a common cause of angioedema in the emergency department. Although bradykinin is thought to be a primary mediator for this type of angioedema, studies of targeted therapies have been generally disappointing. In contrast, several targeted therapies have been proven successful using acute and preventive approaches for management of hereditary angioedema. Further developments, including novel biologics, novel oral therapies, and gene therapy approaches, may hopefully continue to broaden therapeutic options to ensure optimal individual management of patients with hereditary angioedema.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113nkuXF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Asparaginase hypersensitivity and infusion reactions — management uses severity-based actions: ERW-rywn should be used as a second-line agent in patients who have developed a systemic allergic reaction or anaphylaxis due to PEG hypersensitivity; anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions of Grade 3–4 severity (CTCAE v5.0) merit permanent discontinuation of the type of asparaginase that caused the reaction; for Grade 1 reactions and Grade 2 reactions (rash, flushing, urticaria, and drug fever ≥ 38°C) without bronchospasm, hypotension, edema, or need for parenteral intervention, the asparaginase may be continued with consideration for anti-allergy premedication (hydrocortisone, famotidine or ranitidine, diphenhydramine or cetirizine, and acetaminophen); preventive measures that can be considered include slowing the infusion to ≥ 2 hours, infusing normal saline concurrently, and using the premedications above; if anti-allergy premedication is used prior to PEG or ERW-rywn administration, therapeutic drug monitoring using commercially available asparaginase activity assays is highly recommended since premedication may mask reactions indicating neutralizing antibodies; hypersensitivity is significant, and TDM can be considered for low-grade systemic reactions with potential rechallenge when adequate asparaginase activity is demonstrated.

### US HAEA medical advisory board 2020 guidelines for the management of hereditary angioedema [^116iocJR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Scientific and clinical progress together with the development of effective novel therapeutic options has engendered multiple important changes in the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE). We now update and extend the 2013 United States Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board guidelines for the treatment and management of HAE. The guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review with recommendations indicating both the strength of our recommendation and the quality of the underlying evidence. Guidelines are provided regarding the classification, diagnosis, on-demand treatment, prophylactic treatment, special considerations for women and children, development of a comprehensive management and monitoring plan, and assessment of burden of illness for both HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and HAE with normal C1 inhibitor. Advances in HAE treatment now allow the development of management plans that can help many patients with HAE lead a normal life. Achieving this goal requires that physicians be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic transformations that have occurred in recent years.

### Hereditary angioedema [^112vRaBu]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usual results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH and clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For each study, data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer (ME and MG). Data regarding the study design, therapy, previous therapies, and effect of the described therapy were recorded in tables. For treatment of acute attacks and prophylactic treatment of AE, available efficacy results were described per subtype and per treatment option. Definitions for response were adopted from the original articles. Articles describing ineffective treatment options were described separately. If information about adverse effects was available, this was collected additionally for each type of treatment. A distinction between serious adverse effects (SAEs) and less severe treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was made. Additionally, only adverse events possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment were reported. Adverse effects reported by placebo-treated patients were not taken into account. Due to the high amount of available case reports and low amount of controlled studies, and since outcome measures varied among the study studies, a meta-analysis could not be performed. Instead, results are described using narrative summary technique.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111CGBHE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, and if urticaria of less than 6 weeks' duration has features suggesting it might progress, patients should be periodically re-evaluated until a diagnosis is clarified. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and although many cases are infectious, extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism, and skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases though it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines are rapidly acting but can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills compared with second-generation agents, patients should be warned about drowsiness or impaired performance, and in poor responders a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating triggers and forming an effective plan.

Eligibility was then checked by a second reviewer. Disagreements regarding the inclusion of full-text articles were resolved through discussion with an additional reviewer, until consensus was reached. For each included article, data were extracted on the publication characteristics and study design, the treatment characteristics (LTP agent and dose, duration of treatment, and comparator), the proportion of attack-free patients in each treatment group, the attack characteristics (attack frequency, location, duration, and severity at baseline and after commencing study treatment), and on-demand therapy use. Assessments for risk of bias were performed for included studies using the Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs (rated as high, moderate, or low risk of bias) and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for observational studies (rated on a star system on the selection of study groups, the comparability of the groups, and the ascertainment of the outcome of interest). All transcribed data and risk of bias assessments performed by one reviewer were checked for accuracy and completeness by a second reviewer, with any disagreements being resolved through discussion until consensus was reached.

Data Reporting and Feasibility Assessment for Meta-analyses

Data on outcomes of interest were collectively summarized, reporting the findings of high-quality, phase 3, placebo-controlled RCTs first, followed by phase 2 trials and large extension or registry studies in which data were prospectively collected. Percentages extracted from publications were rounded to the nearest whole number. Means, standard deviations (SDs), standard errors (SEs), and confidence intervals (CIs) were rounded to the nearest first decimal. P values were included as reported in the source publication. A feasibility assessment for conducting meta-analyses was conducted. However, because of substantial limitations of data availability in RCTs and real-world evidence studies on the endpoints of interest, a meta-analysis was not considered feasible.

### Oral famotidine versus placebo in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, data-intense, phase 2 clinical trial [^116KWgef]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Famotidine is a widely available, safe, low-cost candidate medication for COVID-19. This selective histamine H2-receptor (H2R) antagonist reduced type-I interferon release from SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells in a TLR3-dependent manner. Famotidine intake as an antacid has been associated with improved clinical outcome in several retrospective cohort studies of hospitalised patients, but some studies found no effect or negative associations. In a case series of unvaccinated outpatients with moderate COVID-19, oral famotidine at 80 mg three times a day was well tolerated and associated with rapid symptomatic and physiological improvement. Famotidine, as a result, has been frequently prescribed to non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19, without clinical trial data supporting biological or clinical efficacy.

We performed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial of oral famotidine (80 mg three times a day) and deeply profiled the enrolled diverse, non-hospitalised patients with mild to moderate symptoms from COVID-19. We devised a fully remote clinical trial strategy to reduce patient burden and exposure of the public and healthcare personnel. We aimed to assess the benefit of famotidine on resolution of symptoms and inflammation in patients with COVID-19.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^113f7X92]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — acute attack management — states that epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE, and neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs provide reliably effective treatment for acute attacks. Fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating HAE attacks but might acutely exacerbate some attacks, and caution is required; management can involve symptomatic treatment based on the region of swelling. Guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and randomized trials demonstrate efficacy and safety for treatment of attacks with C1INH concentrate, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the therapeutic management of angioedema owing to hereditary C1 inhibitor deficiency: consensus report of an international working group [^112V9NUU]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Angioedema owing to hereditary deficiency of C1 inhibitor (HAE) is a rare, life-threatening, disabling disease. In the last 2 years, the results of well-designed and controlled trials with existing and new therapies for this condition have been published, and new treatments reached the market. Current guidelines for the treatment for HAE were released before the new trials and before the new treatments became available and were essentially based on observational studies and expert opinion. To provide evidence-based HAE treatment guidelines supported by the new studies, a conference was held in Gargnano del Garda, Italy, from September 26 to 29, 2010. The meeting hosted 58 experienced HAE expert physicians, representatives of pharmaceutical companies and representatives of HAE patients' associations. Here, we report the topics discussed during the meeting and evidence-based consensus about management approaches for HAE in adult/adolescent patients.

### Life-threatening severe allergic reactions: urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis [^117DoAko]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Urticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis are life threatening skin diseases. Allergological emergencies are common; drugs, food, food ingredients/additives, insects, and many other factors have been reported to elicit anaphylactic reactions. The severity of symptoms ranges from pruritus to generalized skin eruptions, gastrointestinal, bronchial problems to systemic anaphylaxis and cardiovascular emergencies. The pathomechanisms and treatment of urticarias, angioedema and anaphylaxis are described. In some situations emergency kit: antihistamines, steroids, betamimetics and adrenaline is needed. Familiarity with the early diagnosis and correct management should be acknowledegable for dermatologists to recognize these allergic reactions and must be prepared to administer emergency kit.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) treatment structure — The treatment of HAE can be classified into 2 approaches: treatment of acute attacks and prophylactic treatment (short-term and long-term). All patients with HAE, irrespective of their past history, are at risk for severe angioedema attacks, and patients with HAE should have an established plan in place regarding how to respond to a severe attack. Historical surveys suggest a mortality rate in patients with HAE caused by laryngeal angioedema of approximately 30% or higher.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — trigger identification and avoidance — Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by a detailed history and eliminated, if possible; management should focus on identifying specific triggers based on history with focused testing and symptomatic relief. A delayed syndrome has been recognized with acute urticaria/angioedema with a delay of 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of beef, pork, lamb, or venison. Medication-induced disease requires careful history: ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema after months or even years of therapy, and over-the-counter aspirin or NSAIDs (including aspirin-like remedies) can be associated with acute relapsing urticaria/angioedema; aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided, as feasible, with substitution of an equally efficacious alternative not commonly associated with urticaria.

### Review of select practice parameters, evidence-based treatment algorithms, and international guidelines for hereditary angioedema [^114mgZBL]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare bradykinin-mediated disease that is characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema, which can be life threatening. HAE affects all ethnic groups equally and does not differentiate between age, sex, or race. However, the availability of therapies varies amongst countries resulting in a lack of uniformity of care. Not only is there a disparity of medication availability, but since HAE is a rare disease, it is frequently overlooked and the diagnosis is missed. Even with diagnosis, treatment and management is often less than optimal. For these reasons, it is essential to have practice parameters and guidelines. In this chapter, we focus on recent guidelines. These guidelines deal with recognition, diagnosis, medical care, patient management, and assessment, all which are essential to provide optimal care to people with a rare and orphan disease. The intent of the guidelines, and thus this chapter, is to reduce morbidity and mortality, and restore a normal quality of life for the patient with HAE. We will review the guidelines from various regions of the world as well as international group recommendations. In addition, specific patient populations such as the pregnant, elderly, and juvenile require modified treatment regimens, and for this reason, we have included these data as well. The intent of this chapter is to aid the practitioner in holistic care of the patient with HAE in order to ultimately provide the best standard of care possible.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112S2PRG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Summary of Key Criteria for the Diagnosis of HAE for Published Guidance

International/Canadian guidelines on the management of HAE were published in 2019. Although not the focus of the guideline, the guidance relating to diagnosis notes that "HAE-C1-INH should be suspected in patients who have recurrent angioedema without concomitant urticaria and also in patients who have recurrent abdominal pain for which no cause is identified, particularly if there is a family history". The authors encourage caution in patients who are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, as although these agents may cause angioedema, their use does not rule out underlying HAE.

Insights from an international expert panel that considered opportunities for improvement in the patient journey of people with HAE were split into (1) onset of symptoms and initial evaluation, (2) referral and diagnosis, and (3) management of HAE. Key findings were that readily available information for patients and health care providers, including emergency physicians, is lacking and that health care providers may refer patients to physicians other than allergists or immunologists, resulting in difficulties in formulating global guidance. However, several tools to aid diagnosis of patients with HAE and GI symptoms have been published since 2010. In a review of the role of the health care provider in diagnosing HAE in patients presenting with unexplained abdominal pain, the authors note that unexplained abdominal pain, particularly when accompanied by swelling of the face and extremities, suggests the diagnosis of HAE. A family history of HAE and radiologic imaging (Fig. 2) demonstrating edematous bowel can also support the diagnosis. An alphabetic mnemonic can also be used in cases where HAE is suspected, where A = angioedema, B = bradykinin, C = C1-INH, D = distress factors, E = epinephrine nonresponsive, F = family history, and G = glottis/GI edema.

### Use of C1 inhibitor for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema decreases mechanical ventilation time [^115gT7mY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is a rare, albeit serious emergency that can result in airway compromise and potentially death if not treated promptly. Currently, there are no agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration to target ACE inhibitor angioedema and to prevent intubation. C1 inhibitors are approved for hereditary angioedema but may show promise in alleviating inflammation associated with ACE inhibitor angioedema.

Case Report

A 41-year-old man presented to the emergency department with swelling of his lips a few days after starting lisinopril for hypertension. Despite receiving diphenhydramine, ranitidine, and methylprednisolone, the swelling progressed to the patient's tongue. A C1 inhibitor was ordered in an effort to prevent intubation. Before the arrival of the medication, the patient was intubated emergently for airway protection. After receipt of the C1 inhibitor, the swelling dramatically improved, and the patient was successfully extubated after less than 18 hours from presentation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case illustrates a potential role for C1 inhibitors in the emergency setting for treating drug-induced angioedema, which may prevent or minimize mechanical ventilation time.

### Emerging therapies in hereditary angioedema [^116xwPvF]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of bradykinin-mediated angioedema with the advent of multiple new therapies. Patients now have effective medications available for prophylaxis and treatment of acute attacks. However, hereditary angioedema is a burdensome disease that can lead to debilitating and dangerous angioedema episodes associated with significant costs for individuals and society. The burden of treatment must be addressed regarding medication administration difficulties, treatment complications, and adverse side effects. New therapies are being investigated and may offer solutions to these challenges. This article reviews the emerging therapeutic options for the treatment of HAE.

Summary Statement 39: The severity of cholinergic urticaria ranges from mild pruritus to serious and potentially life-threatening reactions. (C) Reported manifestations span from mild pruritus and urtication to systemic mediator release with generalized urticaria and angioedema, bronchospasm, and hypotension. Management highlights that avoidance measures are important, and because these are often incomplete, most patients benefit from regular use of antihistamines advanced as tolerated to achieve control of the condition.

Table 25: Drug reactions — management in ovarian cancer chemotherapy specifies platinum versus non-platinum (taxane, liposomal doxorubicin, or biotherapeutic agents) approaches by severity, with prior exposure defined as 0 for mild platinum reactions, ≥ 1 for mild non-platinum reactions, and ≥ 0 for severe or life-threatening reactions in both classes. Typically, the infusion should be stopped for patients having a reaction, with the exception that mild infusion reactions during first exposure to a platinum agent may be managed by decreasing the infusion rate and administering an H1 blocker antihistamine, and usually resolve after stopping the infusion. H1 blocker antihistamine such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine is recommended for managing drug reactions, regardless of severity, whereas H2 blockers such as cimetidine and famotidine are reserved for severe or life-threatening reactions. Corticosteroids are also generally reserved for severe or life-threatening reactions, but may be needed for mild reactions to platinum agents in patients with prior exposure if symptoms do not quickly resolve after administering an H1 blocker. IM epinephrine is recommended for life-threatening reactions, but may sometimes be needed for severe (but not life threatening) reactions, or for mild reactions to platinum agents if symptoms are not responding to other interventions. Life-threatening reactions require oxygen and nebulized bronchodilators, and saline bolus may also be needed for life-threatening reactions to platinum agents. Standard resuscitation procedures (ie, ACLS) should be followed for patients with acute cardiopulmonary arrest.

### International consensus on the use of genetics in the management of hereditary angioedema [^112si9wD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is becoming much more genetically complex than was initially considered. Thus, the role of HAE genetics is expanding beyond research laboratories, and the genotyping of subjects suffering from HAE has become diagnostically indispensable in clinical practice. The synthesis and interpretation of the clinical and biochemical analyses to facilitate appropriate genetic test selection has thus also become significantly more complex. With this in mind, an international multidisciplinary group of 14 experts in HAE genetics and disease management was convened in October 2018. The objective was to develop clear, actionable, evidence- and consensus-based statements aiming to facilitate the communication between physicians treating patients with HAE and clinical geneticists, and thus promote the effective use of genetics in the management of the disease. Eleven consensus statements were generated, encompassing considerations regarding the clinical indications for genotyping patients with angioedema, the methods of detection of HAE-causative variants, the variant pathogenicity curation, the genotyping of patients with HAE in the clinic, and genetic counseling. These statements are intended both to guide clinicians and to serve as a framework for future educational and further genetic testing developments as the field continues to evolve rapidly.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute management emphasizes avoidance of ineffective therapies, selective use of plasma, and access to on-demand agents: Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE; fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating attacks but might actually exacerbate some attacks and therefore requires caution; management can include symptomatic treatment based on the region of body swelling; neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs are likely effective for acute attacks; guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and evidence from double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials demonstrates efficacy and safety for treatment with C1INH concentrates, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

A total of 168 papers were found using the reported search, of which one represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of this best paper are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is there is promising evidence for the use of the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema.

### Premedication protocols to prevent hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapy: a literature review [^111NmyBy]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to chemotherapy may prevent patients from receiving the most effective therapy. This review was undertaken to identify evidence-based preventive premedication strategies that reduce the likelihood of HSR in the first instance and improve the safety of subsequent infusions in patients who have demonstrated HSR to a certain class of chemotherapy. PubMed was searched until October 2021 using the key words: "hypersensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs", "hypersensitivity to antineoplastic agents", "taxanes hypersensitivity", "platinum compound hypersensitivity", "premedication", "dexamethasone", "prednisone", "hydrocortisone", "antihistamine", "diphenhydramine", "cetirizine", "famotidine", "meperidine", "aspirin", "ibuprofen", and "montelukast". The search was restricted to articles published in English. A total of 73 abstracts were selected for inclusion in the review. Most premedication regimens have been derived empirically rather than determined through randomized trials. Based on the available evidence, we provide an update on likely HSR mechanisms and a practical guide for classifying systemic HSR. The evidence indicates that a combination of prevention strategies using newer antihistamines, H2 antagonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids and other interventions used judiciously reduces the occurrence and severity of HSR and improves safety.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^112rikzV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Delayed pressure urticaria/angioedema (DPUA) management — Management differs from other types of chronic urticaria/angioedema and is often very difficult to treat; additional pharmacotherapeutic treatment is frequently required with avoidance measures, and conventional antihistamine dosing frequently lacks efficacy. Patients should be made aware of pressure or trauma triggers and avoidance is a critical element. Antihistamines at conventional doses might be efficacious for chronic urticaria but are frequently ineffective for prevention of angioedema provoked by pressure; advancing doses beyond FDA‑approved levels might be associated with greater efficacy, including a double‑blind study of cetirizine at a dose of 30 mg/d. A short course of systemic corticosteroids might be required for ongoing episodes, although long‑term systemic corticosteroid treatment is not generally regarded as favorable. Reports on nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are mixed; no benefit was observed in a double‑blind trial of 25 mg of indomethacin 3 times daily, and COX‑1–inhibiting drugs can provoke a flare in aspirin‑exacerbated urticaria/angioedema, so prescribing aspirin or aspirin‑like drugs should be approached with caution. Uncontrolled reports describe salutary effects from agents including montelukast, sulfasalazine, chloroquine, dapsone, intravenous gamma globulin, sulindac, acitretin, and anti–TNF‑α, but randomized controlled trials are required to substantiate their utility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attack characteristics — HAE is characterized by relatively prolonged attacks of angioedema involving the extremities, genitourinary tract, abdomen, face, oropharynx, or larynx (C). Patients typically present with discrete episodes of nonpruritic, nonpitting angioedema at these sites; HAE attacks are usually distinguished from allergic or idiopathic angioedema by their longer duration and lack of response to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. The typical HAE attack tends to progressively worsen for 24 hours and then slowly remit over the following 48 to 72 hours, although attacks can occasionally last longer, particularly if the swelling moves from site to site.

Step 3. Exclude Medication-Associated Angioedema

Stop the suspected medication and assess response, which may take 1–2 months or longer depending on the frequency of the episodes.

Step 4. Genetic Screening for Pathogenic Variants

A detailed family history for evidence of recurrent angioedema or a diagnosis of HAE in other family members is essential in all patients with recurrent angioedema. If the patient has a strong family history of angioedema or known relatives with HAE-nC1INH, then consider targeted gene sequencing (see step 6 below).

Step 5. Exclusion of Mast Cell–Mediated Angioedema (AE-MC)

Evaluate for mast cell–mediated angioedema based on clinical symptoms (Table 2) as well as response to mast cell–directed therapy. This must include an adequate trial of daily second-generation H1 antagonist (fourfold times the standard dose assuming lower doses fail to prevent angioedema attacks) for a duration sufficient to clearly determine the treatment effect. When H1 antihistamines fail as a single treatment, daily montelukast is added unless there is a contraindication. If unresponsive to high-dose antihistamines plus montelukast, a course of omalizumab (4–6 months) is warranted. Most cases of AE-MC respond well to omalizumab. Response to any of these medications suggests the diagnosis of mast cell–mediated angioedema. If no response, we strongly recommend seeking assistance of an angioedema expert prior to proceeding with the next steps.

Step 6. If Unresponsive to Step 5, Targeted Gene Sequencing

Targeted sequencing (next-generation sequencing [NGS] or Sanger sequencing), for known HAE pathogenic variants is recommended if accessible. If a pathogenic variant is found, the diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH is established. A novel variant in one of the known genes needs to be considered a variant of unknown significance (VUS) and not a cause of HAE-nC1INH until confirmed by further research. Depending on the availability and cost of sequencing, this step may best be undertaken prior to a course of omalizumab (step 5). If sequencing is not available, the clinician can proceed with step 7.

### How we manage persons with hereditary angioedema [^114DtjHT]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous and mucosal swelling that can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Several novel therapies introduced since 2008 have dramatically transformed the approach to management. In this review we will discuss the current understanding of the pathophysiology of HAE, diagnostic evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria, and the therapeutic approach to HAE. We advocate taking an integrative approach to care in order to normalize the lives of affected patients.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^114k4E8V]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute HAE on-demand pharmacotherapy and airway management — There are currently 3 medications approved in the United States for the treatment of acute attacks of angioedema: plasma-derived C1INH, the B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant, and the plasma kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide, and on-demand treatment is most effective when administered as early as possible in an attack. Standard angioedema treatment modalities, such as epinephrine, corticosteroids, or antihistamines, do not have a significant effect on swelling; fresh frozen plasma can sometimes cause a sudden worsening and carries the inherent risk of viral transmission, and attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytic agents are not effective; the use of one of the newer specific medicines is preferred. If specific effective on-demand medication is not available, symptomatic care can include narcotic medications for abdominal pain, antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, and aggressive hydration; out-of-hospital use of potent narcotics, such as fentanyl patches or oxycodone, should be avoided. Management of oropharyngeal and laryngeal attacks is focused on maintaining airway patency; all such patients should be observed in a medical facility that can perform intubation or tracheostomy and should be closely monitored for change in voice, loss of ability to swallow, and difficulty breathing.

### Molecular dambusters: what is behind hyperpermeability in bradykinin-mediated angioedema? [^113NQnCm]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

The picture of pathophysiology of angioedema is more complicated than we thought earlier. Research in the recent years has shown that BK also has a role in certain types of angioedemas that were not classified as BK-mediated before. For instance, heparin-initiated BK production plays a fundamental role in MC-mediated diseases. It was recently proposed that BK also has a critical role in the lung inflammation of COVID-19. Consequently, targeted therapies originally developed for the management of BK-mediated angioedemas might also be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.

BK-mediated angioedema involves a variety of plasma enzyme cascades (KKS, coagulation, fibrinolysis, and complement), vascular endothelium, lymphatic endothelium, and cells of the immune system (e.g. neutrophil granulocytes). Various signaling pathways (such as ANGPT1-Tie2 signaling in HAE patients with ANGPT1 mutation), hormonal effects, the autonomic nervous system, and other mechanisms yet to be discovered may also contribute to the pathogenesis.

Maintaining the hemodynamic balance of an organism — including the P/B state of the endothelium — is a complex process, which requires the precise cooperation of many organ systems. The pathophysiology of ECs in C1-INH deficiency provides a good example for such complexity. In this review, we aim to provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms of permeability-increasing and permeability-decreasing agents. Furthermore, we expose some of the current controversies in angioedema from the perspective of ECs, and finally, attempt to outline an alternative, complex hypothesis on the role of ECs in the pathogenesis of BK-mediated angioedema.

Regarding medical management for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to prophylactic treatment, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to administer any of the following options for long-term prophylaxis in patients with HAE:

- low-to-moderate doses of anabolic androgens as effective and relatively safe option in many patients

- antifibrinolytic agents as somewhat effective and relatively safe option, recognizing that it is generally less effective than androgens

- plasma-derived C1 inhibitor replacement as effective and safe option.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) control and exacerbating factors — attack frequency without prophylaxis can be high and should prompt evaluation of triggers; modifiable medications and hormonal factors warrant avoidance: Patients not taking prophylactic medications often have swelling every 10 to 20 days, a small subset swell very frequently up to twice per week, and some never swell; changes in attack frequency should trigger a search for exacerbating factors. Because ACE‑Is decrease the catabolism of bradykinin, these drugs can precipitate attacks of angioedema and should be avoided in patients with HAE. Women appear relatively protected at parturition but have dramatically increased risk postpartum; estrogen‑containing birth control pills and estrogen replacement therapy should be avoided in all women with HAE, and counseling on alternative contraception is important. Critical appraisal indicates H pylori infection is not a significant precipitant for most patients.

### Late angioedema caused by ACE inhibitors underestimated… [^113oPu1d]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

1 It was believed that most cases of angioedema occur within the first week of treatment with ACE inhibitors; however, recent reports 1–3 indicate that late-onset angioedema may be more prevalent than initially thought. While early-onset angioedema should not be a diagnostic problem, late-onset angioedema often goes undiagnosed because many physicians are unfamiliar with it. 1, 4 This oversight may occur because of the lack of a temporal relationship between the use of ACE inhibitors and the onset of angioedema, because this side effect can occur after many years of uneventful use. 1, 4 Consequently, many patients experience recurrent episodes before the correct diagnosis is made. 4 Blacks are at increased risk. 3, 4. Angioedema associated with the use of ACE inhibitors is not an allergic reaction. 2 The pathogenesis is probably related to the increased levels of bradykinins; however, an exclusive role of bradykinins is unlikely.

1 Less frequently, angioedema has been reported with angiotensin-receptor antagonists which lack the bradykinin-potentiating activity.
2. The clinical presentation is highly variable and unpredictable. In most cases, the symptoms are mild and regress spontaneously while the patient continues the medication, thus erroneously prompting an alternative diagnosis. 4 If the diagnosis is missed, recurrent and more severe episodes may occur with potentially serious consequences. 4 Fatal cases have also been described.
5. Angioedema associated with the use of ACE inhibitors usually presents as episodic attacks of swelling of the face, tongue, and airways, but it may also involve visceral tissues. A recent report 6 described two patients with recurrent severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. 6 The patients underwent three unnecessary laparotomies before the correct diagnosis was made.

All patients taking ACE inhibitors, particularly blacks, should be monitored for this potentially serious side effect. They should be informed that angioedema can occur even after many years of uneventful drug use. Patients should be advised to report mild and self-limited episodes and stop taking the ACE inhibitor immediately. On the other hand, physicians should consider the diagnosis of angioedema associated with the use of ACE inhibitors in every case of orofacial angioedema or otherwise unexplained acute or recurrent abdominal pain until it is definitely excluded by a thorough review of medications.
