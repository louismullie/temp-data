## Question

Was time-to-event improved with flenoril in the NEXORA study for dementia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether time-to-event outcomes were improved with flenoril in the NEXORA study for dementia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the provided references mention the drug name "flenoril" or the study name "NEXORA". Then, I should verify if any dementia trials in the corpus include time-to-event analyses that could be mistakenly attributed to these terms. Next, I'll check for possible synonyms or misspellings. After that, I will review how time-to-event endpoints are typically handled in dementia trials to ensure I'm not overlooking a relevant analysis. Finally, I'll synthesize an evidence-based conclusion and outline limitations and next steps, grounded strictly in the supplied sources [^115jPFNp] [^1175EVAT] [^111w8uqq].

> Let me first confirm the presence of the exact terms. I need to check systematically whether "flenoril" or "NEXORA" appears anywhere in the provided corpus. Wait, let me verify the highest-yield sources that catalogue Alzheimer's and dementia drug programs and trials; comprehensive reviews of AD trial failures, systematic reviews of monoclonal antibodies, and meta-analyses of progression measures are natural places where a named compound or trial would surface if relevant. Hold on, I should verify carefully: neither "flenoril" nor "NEXORA" is indexed or discussed in these broad, trial-encompassing references, which makes it unlikely that the provided materials contain results answering the question as posed [^115jPFNp].

> I should double-check for potential spelling variants or synonyms. Let me consider common near-miss variants like "flenoryl", "flonoril", or case variants for "NEXORA". Hmm, wait a minute, I need to ensure I'm not missing class-level discussions that might hide the agent under a mechanism rather than a proprietary name; however, the major clinical guidelines and broad treatment overviews do not mention "flenoril" or any obviously related synonym or acronym resembling "NEXORA". Hold on, I should verify once more — these guideline syntheses enumerate established agents and do not include these terms, further supporting that the supplied corpus has no coverage of them.

> Next, I should review how time-to-event endpoints are typically handled in relevant trials to avoid misclassification. Initially, I thought some Alzheimer's agent programs, like verubecestat, might have used time-to-event "time-to-clinical-worsening" endpoints, but wait, let me verify the primary outcomes: the pivotal verubecestat trials used continuous change measures such as ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL at 78 weeks and showed no significant benefit, which are not time-to-event outcomes, so my initial thought was off and I should correct that interpretation [^111w8uqq] [^113F3tbH]. I need to check other exemplars; for instance, the Leqembi pivotal trial primarily used change from baseline in CDR-SB at 18 months rather than a time-to-event analysis, reinforcing that many dementia trials rely on continuous endpoints, not TTE designs [^1175EVAT]. For contrast, truly time-to-event frameworks are common in other therapeutic areas, such as Revatio's time to clinical worsening analysis and Lyrica's time-to-loss-of-response constructs, illustrating what "improved time-to-event" would look like if present, but these are outside dementia and cannot substitute for flenoril/NEXORA evidence in the supplied set [^115QcD8u] [^1126UvdG].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing trial design details that could answer the question indirectly. Hold on, I should verify whether any study characteristics, hazard ratios, Kaplan-Meier plots, or event definitions pertinent to "NEXORA" are described; without a study synopsis, population, endpoint definitions, or statistical outputs, I cannot infer whether any time-to-event outcome improved. Let me reconsider whether surrogate context could help; even MCID frameworks and progression-measure reviews focus on continuous scales rather than time-to-event constructs, so there is no bridge in the provided documents to infer TTE results for a trial that is otherwise unmentioned here [^115jPFNp] [^116kXcEF].

> Based solely on the provided materials, I should confirm the bottom line. I will now examine whether any evidence supports that time-to-event outcomes improved with flenoril in NEXORA; there is no mention of flenoril or NEXORA anywhere in the corpus, and therefore no extractable or citable time-to-event result for dementia tied to those terms. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions beyond the corpus: I cannot impute efficacy from other agents or trials to an unreferenced drug and study, so the evidence-based answer from these sources is that there is no available information to determine whether time-to-event outcomes were improved with flenoril in the NEXORA study for dementia [^115jPFNp].

> Finally, I need to outline limitations and appropriate next steps while staying within the evidence provided. I should double-check that I've exhausted the broad syntheses, labels, and major guidelines in this set; given their breadth and the absence of these terms, the gap appears real within this corpus. But wait, what if the trial is very recent, uses a different compound name, or is outside the scope of these documents? To resolve that, one would typically verify the trial registry entry, peer-reviewed publication, or sponsor communications, recognizing that such steps would go beyond the supplied references; as it stands, no conclusion can be drawn from this dataset regarding flenoril or NEXORA time-to-event outcomes in dementia.

I **can't find any evidence** for a drug called "flenoril" or a dementia trial named "NEXORA". Could you **confirm the exact drug and study names** (for example, alternate spellings or the sponsor)? Also, what **specific time-to-event outcome** are you asking about (e.g. time to institutionalization, time to clinical worsening, or something else)? If you meant a different dementia therapy or trial, please specify so I can check the evidence.

### Differential effects of current specific treatments on behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A 12-month, randomized, open-label trial [^116MX6au]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in up to 80% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and represent one of the most common reasons for early institutionalization and increased management costs.

- **Objectives**: This study evaluated the effects of four drugs — memantine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine — on BPSD in AD patients.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, longitudinal, randomized, open-label, 4-arm, parallel-group, 12-month clinical trial conducted in 177 AD patients. The severity of BPSD was evaluated at baseline and after treatment with memantine (n = 48), donepezil (n = 42), rivastigmine (n = 46), and galantamine (n = 41), using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) scales.

- **Results**: The NPI and BEHAVE-AD total scores improved from baseline to month 12 in all groups. The improvements in both scales were statistically significant in the memantine, donepezil, and rivastigmine groups but not in the galantamine group. Responder analyses showed that treatment with memantine and rivastigmine resulted in more patients improving on the NPI and BEHAVE-AD scores, respectively. Agitation/aggression was the NPI item with the highest improvements (significantly better than baseline in both the memantine and rivastigmine groups). In contrast, aggression and anxiety/phobias were the most improved BEHAVE-AD items (significantly in the rivastigmine group for both and in the rivastigmine group only for anxiety/phobias). All treatments were well tolerated; most of the adverse events reported were not severe.

### Function and clinical meaningfulness of treatments for mild Alzheimer's disease [^115ujnzz]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

Similarly, the other five studies that reported results for MCI or mild AD patients did not demonstrate an effect on function even when an effect on cognition was shown. In a study of galantamine treatment assessing caregiver time, differences versus placebo were statistically significant for patients with moderate dementia (MMSE 11 to 18) and greater than for patients with mild dementia (MMSE 19 to 24, statistical significance not reported).

In another study of galantamine among mild-to-moderate AD patients (MMSE 10 to 22), the largest and only statistically significant treatment-versus-placebo difference in ADCS-ADL scores occurred in patients with more severe dementia (MMSE 10 to 15) at baseline; additionally, in placebo-treated patients, worsening of ADCS-ADL scores was greater in patients with more severe dementia.

In a study of donepezil and vitamin E in patients with MCI, statistically significant differences relative to placebo in a modified ADAS-Cog were demonstrated but without significant differences in the ADCS-ADL (modified for use in MCI patients). Gauthier et al. combined results from six studies of donepezil to assess individual ADL items among patients stratified by disease severity.

In an analysis of over 1000 mild (MMSE 18 to 26) patients, no statistically significant differences in any instrumental or basic ADL items were found compared with placebo, although differences were observed in the moderate (MMSE 10 to 17) patients. Farlow et al. compared the response of two doses of a rivastigmine patch, one dose of rivastigmine capsule, and placebo.

### Alzheimer's disease: Key insights from two decades of clinical trial failures [^113zxz6Y]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

We describe here the approach to evaluation by detailing methods used to search and select the clinical trials for analysis. This includes the commonly used cognitive, functional, and global assessment batteries, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers employed in these clinical trials. We also elucidate the putative mechanism of action (MOA) of the compounds pursued and discuss the limitations of our approach and evaluation methods.

An exhaustive review was performed of AD compound and clinical trial failures occurring between 2004 and 2021. The primary information sources included ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trial database, PubMed for scientific publications, Alzforum, the Alzheimer Research Forum AD database, AdisInsight, a pharmaceutical drug database, relevant company websites, and news releases. Phase II and III compounds were categorized as failures if the trial efficacy endpoint was not met, significant adverse events occurred preventing continuation, or reports indicated that the program was discontinued.

### Namendaxr [^116rjAuY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, 677 patients were randomized to one of the following two treatments: NamendaXR 28 mg/day or placebo, while still receiving an AChEI (either donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine).

- **Effects on severe impairment battery (SIB)**: At 24 weeks of treatment, the mean difference in the SIB change scores for the NamendaXR 28 mg/AChEI-treated (combination therapy) patients compared to the patients on placebo/AChEI (monotherapy) was 2.6 units. Using an LOCF analysis, NamendaXR 28 mg/AChEI treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo/AChEI.

Figures showing graphical data are not included. The data indicated that the NamendaXR 28 mg/AChEI group was more likely to show improvement or a smaller decline compared to the placebo/AChEI group.

- **Cumulative effects**: At 24 weeks of treatment, the mean difference in the CIBIC-Plus scores for the NamendaXR 28 mg/AChEI-treated patients could not be completely detailed due to incomplete data provided at the end of the study description.

### Decentralized clinical trials for medications to reduce the risk of dementia: Consensus report and guidance [^116T4jFd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Following the third questionnaire, discussion at two expert videoconference panel meetings and three one-to-one meetings resulted in agreed final draft recommendations with 40 statements, offering three responses: "Agree, Neutral, Disagree". Eleven panel members completed the final questionnaire and reached consensus for all 40 statements [Supplementary Text A], with additional clarification added to five statements based on final free-text comments from the expert panel.

Figure 2 shows the final recommendations from the expert panel. Overall, the recommendations indicate that the delivery of decentralized trials in dementia prevention is feasible with adequate safety checks and balances.

- **Validation and comment by the CTAM PIA**: Twenty members of the PIA provided informed consent to participate in the working group review of the recommendations. Seventeen members provided responses, with one electing to remain anonymous. One member completed the questionnaire twice with 73% agreement between attempts; the most recent completion was used for analysis. Almost 90% (n = 15) reported their primary employer as a university or non-profit research institute; one person (6%) was employed in the pharmaceutical industry, and one (6%) by government. Four (24%) identified primarily as clinicians, with the remainder (76%) describing themselves as researchers. Experience with medication trials in dementia risk reduction ranged from 0 to 5 years (47%, n = 8), 6 to 10 years (24%, n = 4), 11 to 15 years (6%, n = 1), and four (24%) reported having more than 20 years of experience. Twelve PIA members completed the review.

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^113CGjTY]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

- **Cognitive, global, functional, and behavioral outcomes**: The mean differences between cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), memantine, and placebo in these outcomes were evaluated from meta-analyses of clinical trials. Functional outcomes were based on various measures, including the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale, and the Progressive Deterioration Scale.

	- **Abbreviations**: AD (Alzheimer's disease), ADAS-cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale), CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating scale), ChEI (cholinesterase inhibitor), CIBIC-Plus (Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus caregiver input), ND (not determined), NPI (neuropsychiatric inventory), SIB (Severe Impairment Battery).

	- **Dosing details**: The mean doses were donepezil 10 mg, galantamine 24 mg, and rivastigmine 8.5–10.4 mg. The range of mean differences in individual studies was noted. For donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, doses ranged from 5–10 mg, 16–32 mg, and 6–12 mg, respectively.

### Treatment of vascular dementia — evidence from clinical trials with cholinesterase inhibitors [^11155nBM]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular disease (CVD), as well as secondary ischemic brain injury from cardiovascular disease, are common causes of dementia and cognitive decline in the elderly. In addition, CVD frequently contributes to cognitive loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progress in understanding the pathogenetic mechanism involved in vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and vascular dementia (VaD) has resulted in promising treatments for these conditions. Cholinergic deficits in VaD are due to ischemia of basal forebrain nuclei and cholinergic pathways and can be treated with the use of cholinesterase inhibitor agents used in AD. Controlled clinical trials with donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine in VaD, as well as in patients with AD plus CVD, have demonstrated improvements in cognition, behavior, and activities of daily living.

### Antipsychotics for agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia [^11534Av4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Typical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia; however, their benefits remain uncertain as some trials have yielded negative results, and their effectiveness may be outweighed by harms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

- **Search methods**: A comprehensive search was conducted in several databases including ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization's meta-register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the results, and further assessed the full texts of studies that passed this screening.

- **Selection criteria**: The review included randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for treating agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both. This was irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. Participants were required to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression), psychosis, or both at baseline. Studies on antipsychotics no longer available in the United States or EU or used for emergency short-term sedation were excluded.

### A European academy of neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^112vTV86]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Summary of evidence

Eight references [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82] reporting on the effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics were identified from six studies. Three studies were single-center and three were multi-center RCTs. Some references reported on the same two studies. Specifically, Devanand et al. [78, 79] and Ballard et al. [81, 82] each reported on the same cohort but with different outcomes relevant for the PICO, such as mortality in one study and neuropsychiatric symptoms in another. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis [83] on discontinuation of antipsychotics assessed three studies not included in the present guideline. One study did not report on any PICO outcomes [84] and two did not test a relevant intervention [85, 86] as defined in the PICO. One additional study that met the inclusion criteria for the present guideline, but not included in the Cochrane review [82], was incorporated.

Study durations ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months, with one study reporting a 42-month follow-up [82]. For studies reporting on mortality, there was a low event rate. Relative risk point estimates varied from 0.19 to 3.11. Most studies [75, 77, 78, 79, 80], but not all [82], showed no significant differences. One study reported on serious adverse events.

### Pharmacodynamics of cholinesterase inhibitors suggests add-on therapy with a low-dose carbamylating inhibitor in patients on long-term treatment with rapidly reversible inhibitors [^116qQDYu]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Despite three decades of intensive research in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and numerous clinical trials of new therapeutic agents, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) remain the mainstay of therapeutics for AD and dementia with Lewy bodies. Pharmacodynamic analyses of ChEIs provide paradoxical observations. Treatment with the rapidly reversible, noncarbamylating ChEIs, such as donepezil, galantamine, and tacrine, increases acetylcholinesterase (AChE) protein expression, whereas the carbamylating agent, rivastigmine, produces sustained inhibition without significant change in AChE protein expression. Nevertheless, the symptomatic clinical efficacies of all these agents are similar.

We report here for the first time that treatment with phenserine, another carbamylating ChEI, achieves sustained but mild inhibition of AChE in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients. Additionally, phenserine treatment reverses donepezil-induced elevation of AChE expression. Further analyses of CSF from another larger patient cohort treated with donepezil revealed that donepezil, besides its primary mode of action, resulted in two other pharmacodynamic effects with potentially contradictory outcomes. Donepezil-induced AChE expression favored AChE-driven amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) aggregation, whereas donepezil itself, depending on concentration, counteracted the AChE-induced Aβ aggregation, likely by competing with the Aβ peptides for the peripheral anionic site on the AChE protein. The reduction of AChE protein expression in donepezil-treated patients through concomitant administration of the carbamylating agent suggests that…

### Evaluating the cognitive effects of donepezil 23 mg/d in moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease: Analysis of effects of baseline features on treatment response [^116yDVoP]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Donepezil is a reversible and highly selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) that is approved for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In numerous clinical trials since 1997, donepezil 5 and 10 mg/d has been shown to provide clinical benefits, with acceptable tolerability in the core symptom domains of cognition, global functioning, and function in activities of daily living. Although both 5 mg and 10 mg doses have been shown to be effective in AD, an early systematic review of donepezil treatment, and several subsequent clinical trials, have indicated a relationship between benefits in cognition and higher donepezil dose. Moreover, the cognitive benefits of a higher donepezil dose seem to be most prominent at more advanced stages of AD.

In 2010, a higher daily dose of donepezil (23 mg) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe AD. This approval was based on results from a large phase 3 clinical trial comparing the 23 mg/d donepezil dose with the standard 10 mg/d donepezil dose. In that trial, donepezil 23 mg/d provided statistically significant cognitive benefits over those achieved with donepezil 10 mg/d, as measured by the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). On the co-primary measure of global function (the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-plus caregiver input [CIBIC-plus]), no significant benefit was observed with higher-dose versus standard-dose donepezil.

Although symptomatic benefits have been widely reported with donepezil and other AChEIs, treated patients typically…

- **Effects on the SIB**: Figure 8 shows the time course for the change from baseline in SIB score for the two treatment groups over the 6 months of the study. At 6 months of treatment, the mean difference in the SIB change scores for donepezil-treated patients compared to patients on placebo was 5.9 points. Donepezil treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo.

	- **Figure 8**: Time course of the change from baseline in SIB score for patients completing 6 months of treatment.

Figure 9 illustrates the cumulative percentages of patients from each of the two treatment groups who attained the measure of improvement in SIB score shown on the X-axis. While patients assigned to both donepezil and placebo have a wide range of responses, the curves show that the donepezil group is more likely to exhibit a greater improvement in cognitive performance.

	- **Figure 9**: Cumulative percentage of patients completing 6 months of double-blind treatment with particular changes from baseline in SIB scores.

- **Effects on the ADCS-ADL-severe**: Figure 10 illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADCS-ADL-severe scores for patients in the two treatment groups over the 6 months of the study. After 6 months of treatment, the mean difference in the ADCS-ADL-severe change scores for donepezil-treated patients compared to patients on placebo was 1.8 points. Donepezil treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo.

### Monotherapy is good enough for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: A network meta-analysis of 76 randomized controlled trials [^117WYq7j]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). High credibility.

Memantine and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are two classes of drugs used to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease. We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the treatment effectiveness of monotherapy versus combination therapy. A total of 23,707 AD patients across 76 randomized trials were identified. In patients with mild-to-moderate AD, monotherapy with donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine was superior to placebo in enhancing cognitive functions and activities of daily living (ADL), whereas monotherapy with donepezil or memantine was superior to placebo in improving behavioral symptoms. However, combination therapy with AChEIs and memantine did not show additional benefits over monotherapy. In patients with moderate-to-severe AD, neither monotherapy nor combination therapy was superior to placebo in any domain measurement. Combination therapy with memantine and AChEIs is confirmed to have no additional benefits over monotherapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

### Olanzapine [^114FoSUm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice.

- **Clinical trials in adults**: The information below for olanzapine is derived from a clinical trial database for olanzapine consisting of 10,504 adult patients with approximately 4,765 patient-years of exposure to olanzapine, plus 722 patients with exposure to intramuscular olanzapine for injection. This database includes: (1) 2,500 patients who participated in multiple-dose oral olanzapine premarketing trials in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, representing approximately 1,122 patient-years of exposure as of February 14, 1995; (2) 182 patients who participated in oral olanzapine premarketing bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials, representing approximately 66 patient-years of exposure; (3) 191 patients who participated in an oral olanzapine trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimer's disease, representing approximately 29 patient-years of exposure; (4) 5,788 additional patients from 88 oral olanzapine clinical trials as of December 31, 2001; (5) 1,843 additional patients from 41 olanzapine clinical trials as of October 31, 2011; and (6) 722 patients who participated in intramuscular olanzapine for injection premarketing trials in agitated patients with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), or dem.

### Cardizem CD [^1159GK7c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a double-blind, parallel dose-response study of doses from 60 mg to 480 mg once daily, Cardizem CD increased time to termination of exercise in a linear manner over the entire dose range studied. The improvement in time to termination of exercise utilizing a Bruce exercise protocol, measured at trough, for placebo, 60 mg, 120 mg, 240 mg, 360 mg, and 480 mg was 29, 40, 56, 51, 69, and 68 seconds, respectively. As doses of Cardizem CD were increased, overall angina frequency decreased. Cardizem CD, 180 mg once daily, or placebo was administered in a double-blind study to patients receiving concomitant treatment with long-acting nitrates and/or beta-blockers. A significant increase in time to termination of exercise and a significant decrease in overall angina frequency was observed. In this trial, the overall frequency of adverse events in the Cardizem CD treatment group was the same as the placebo group.

- **Intravenous diltiazem**: In doses of 20 mg, it prolongs AH conduction time and AV node functional and effective refractory periods by approximately 20%. In a study involving single oral doses of diltiazem hydrochloride 300 mg in six normal volunteers, the average maximum PR prolongation was 14% with no instances of greater than first-degree AV block. Diltiazem-associated prolongation of the AH interval is not more pronounced in patients with first-degree heart block. In patients with sick sinus syndrome, diltiazem significantly prolongs sinus cycle length, up to 50% in some cases.

### Safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished clinical trials [^117CSUbn]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

- **Study selection**: Studies were initially selected based on their titles and abstracts. Duplicates were removed, and full texts of all selected studies were gathered for independent assessment. Further potentially relevant articles were also retrieved from the references of identified studies. Selected studies were applied predefined eligibility criteria. All trials reporting safety and efficacy data on any type of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of subjects with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD at any stage were included. Studies enrolling healthy participants, participants with any diagnosis other than MCI or AD at any stage, and all studies investigating any drug other than mAbs were excluded. In the case of studies enrolling both healthy participants and patients with AD, only data on patients with AD were considered. Case reports, case series, non-systematic or narrative reviews, letters, commentaries, and editorials were also excluded. Systematic reviews (SRs) were only considered to check for references and consistency of results.

Study selection and data extraction and evaluation were performed by four independent reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, consensus, or a third researcher. All available data up to July 7, 2021, were gathered and analyzed.

- **Data extraction and quality assessment**: A list of all registered studies investigating mAbs for the treatment of AD or MCI was defined. For each trial, information on trial identification number, phase, and status were gathered. Trials were classified as completed, terminated, and ongoing.

### Leqembi [^1175EVAT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

After the 79-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period of Study 1, patients could enroll in an open-label extension period for up to 260 weeks, which was initiated following a gap period (range 9 to 59 months; mean 24 months) off treatment.

- **Study 2**: In Study 2, 1795 patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive Leqembi 10 mg/kg or placebo once every 2 weeks. Of the total number of patients randomized, 69% were ApoE ε4 carriers and 31% were ApoE ε4 non-carriers. The overall median age of patients was 72 years, with a range of 50 to 90 years. Fifty-two percent were women. The racial distribution was 1381 (77%) White, 303 (17%) Asian, and 47 (3%) Black.

	- The randomization was stratified according to clinical subgroup (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of the disease), the presence or absence of concomitant approved therapies for Alzheimer's disease at baseline (cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine), ApoE ε4 carrier status, and geographical region.

	- The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline at 18 months in the CDR-SB. Key secondary endpoints included the change from baseline at 18 months in the following measures: amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) using Centiloids, ADAS-Cog14, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS MCI-ADL).

### Ziprasidone mesylate [^114Xsj2Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis**: Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature. Ziprasidone mesylate for injection is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.

- **Cerebrovascular adverse reactions, including stroke, in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis**: In placebo-controlled trials in elderly subjects with dementia, patients randomized to risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine had a higher incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack, including fatal stroke. Ziprasidone mesylate for injection is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.

### Association between anti-dementia treatment persistence and daily dosage of the first prescription: A retrospective analysis in neuropsychiatric practices in Germany [^111FvXp7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

High adherence and persistence are important for the efficacy of anti-dementia treatments.

- **Objective**: The goal of this study was to analyze the association between anti-dementia treatment persistence and daily dosage of the first prescription in patients treated in neuropsychiatric practices in Germany.

- **Methods**: This study included patients aged 60 years or over who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and received anti-dementia prescriptions (galantamine, donepezil, memantine, and rivastigmine) for the first time between 2005 and 2014. The main outcome measure was the treatment persistence rate within 12 months after the index date as a function of the first dose. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the relation between persistence and daily dosages after adjusting for age, gender, and residence in nursing homes.

- **Results**: In this study, 2,442, 5,669, 4,416, 642, and 2,334 patients received galantamine, donepezil, memantine, oral rivastigmine, and patch rivastigmine, respectively. After 12 months of follow-up, continuation rates were similar for individuals using different doses of galantamine, donepezil, oral rivastigmine, and patch rivastigmine, but were significantly different for those taking memantine. Patients using 20mg of memantine were less likely to discontinue their treatment than patients using 10mg (HR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80–0.96). There was no significant association between daily dosages and persistence for the other drugs (HRs ranging from 0.86 to 1.15).

### Long-term exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication in relation to dementia risk [^112jpZop]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

Currently, no preventative disease-modifying treatments for dementia are available. Our results show reduced risk with the use of both amyloid-lowering and non-lowering NSAIDs, suggesting that the potential beneficial effects of NSAID use go beyond the lowering of amyloid deposition. Additionally, we did not observe an association in ApoE4-positive individuals. NSAID use might exert effects on different pathological pathways than ApoE4, resulting in positive results in ApoE4-negative individuals and absence of an association in ApoE4-positive individuals. Alternatively, it is possible that the harmful effects of ApoE4 might outweigh the potential beneficial effects of NSAID use.

Furthermore, we observed stronger effect estimates in clinical AD compared to all-cause dementia. All-cause dementia includes various subtypes of dementia; each of these subtypes has distinct pathways that may not be affected by NSAID use. Including these subtypes in the analysis could result in weaker effect estimates. NSAIDs can reduce dementia risk by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of COX-1 and COX-2, thereby reducing chronic neuroinflammation and associated harmful effects, such as vascular damage and accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau.

Previous RCTs were halted due to severe side effects of NSAID use, cautioning against prolonged use. Despite this, our results offer valuable insights for the future development of preventative therapeutics against dementia. Our results suggest that long-term inhibition of detrimental inflammatory processes, rather than exposure to a high cumulative dose, is crucial.

### Exelon [^111BWSbz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

In a study of 26 weeks duration, 702 patients were randomized to doses of 3, 6, or 9 mg/day of Exelon or to placebo, each given in divided doses. The fixed-dose study design, which included a 12-week forced-dose titration phase and a 14-week maintenance phase, led to a high dropout rate in the 9 mg/day group because of poor tolerability. At 26 weeks of treatment, significant differences were observed for the ADAS-cog mean change from baseline for the 9 mg/day and 6 mg/day groups, compared to placebo. No significant differences were observed between any of the Exelon-dose groups and placebo for the analysis of the CIBIC-Plus mean rating of change. Although no significant differences were observed between Exelon treatment groups, there was a trend toward numerical superiority with higher doses.

The effectiveness of Exelon as a treatment for dementia associated with Parkinson's disease is demonstrated by the results of one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical investigation in patients with mild to moderate dementia, with onset at least two years after the initial diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease was based on the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank clinical criteria. The diagnosis of dementia was based on the criteria stipulated under the DSM-IV category "Dementia Due To Other General Medical Condition" (code 294.1x), but patients were not required to have a distinctive pattern of cognitive deficiency.

### The Italian guideline on diagnosis and treatment of dementia and mild cognitive impairment [^114Uzq35]. Age and Ageing (2024). High credibility.

Treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) typically involves the use of one of the three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) during its mild to moderate stages and memantine during its moderate to severe stages. Evidence suggests that adding memantine to ongoing treatment with one AChEI can be more effective than maintaining treatment with one AChEI alone in people with moderate to severe AD, improving functional abilities, global functions, and behavioral symptoms.

Two research questions examined the co-prescription of AChEIs and memantine, as well as the impact of discontinuing these treatments in people with AD. Ten studies (including two from the literature update) assessed the efficacy of the combined treatment with AChEIs and memantine, while four studies (including one from the literature update) analyzed the effects of treatment withdrawal.

The working group (WG) recommended considering memantine in addition to the AChEI for people in moderate AD who are already receiving an AChEI and offering memantine in addition to the AChEI for those with severe AD who are already taking an AChEI. The WG also recommended against discontinuing AChEIs or memantine solely due to disease severity.

- **Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for Parkinson's disease dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies**: Two research questions explored the comparative effectiveness of AChEIs and memantine in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Overall, six studies focused on PDD (four on AChEIs and two on memantine), while four studies focused on DLB (three on AChEIs and one on memantine).

### Rexulti [^117AKR56]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical trials experience reveals that adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

- **Adverse reactions in adult patients**: The most common adverse reactions in adult patients in clinical trials (≥ 5%) were weight increased, akathisia, headache, somnolence, and insomnia.

- **Adverse reactions in pediatric patients**: The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients in clinical trials (≥ 5%) were weight increased, somnolence, headache, akathisia, and nasopharyngitis.

Brexpiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 12,550 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose clinical trials for major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar mania, and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Among them, 3,870 patients were treated with brexpiprazole for at least 180 days, and 1,910 patients were treated for at least one year of exposure. Additionally, brexpiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 119 pediatric patients who participated in short-term trials, and 314 patients in long-term multiple-dose clinical trials for pediatric schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

### Current treatments for Alzheimer's disease: cholinesterase inhibitors [^115SqvhP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The recommended standard of care for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease is cholinesterase inhibitors. In short- and long-term studies, the three cholinesterase inhibitors most commonly used — donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine — have demonstrated efficacy in improving not only cognition but also function and behavior in patients suffering from mild to severe cases of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. However, the benefits of cholinesterase inhibitors in treating the broad spectrum of symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease are not sustained indefinitely, and the illness continues to progress even while patients are receiving treatment. Additionally, while temporary stabilization may occur, there is typically only a modest improvement from baseline. Side effects from treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors can be too severe for some patients to tolerate. Therefore, additional therapies for Alzheimer's disease still need to be developed that include more tolerable agents with alternative mechanisms of action and broader efficacy.

### Revatio [^115QcD8u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients on Revatio achieved a statistically significant reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) compared to those on placebo. A mean placebo-corrected treatment effect of -3.9 mmHg was observed in favor of Revatio (95% CI: -5.7, -2.1) [p = 0.00003].

- **Time to clinical worsening of PAH**: Defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event (death, lung transplantation, initiation of bosentan therapy, or clinical deterioration requiring a change in epoprostenol therapy), Kaplan-Meier estimates and a stratified log-rank test demonstrated that placebo-treated patients were three times more likely to experience a clinical worsening event than Revatio-treated patients and that Revatio-treated patients experienced a significant delay in time to clinical worsening versus placebo-treated patients [p = 0.0074].

- **Improvements in WHO functional class for PAH**: Also demonstrated in patients on Revatio compared to placebo; more than twice as many Revatio-treated patients (36%) as placebo-treated patients (14%) showed an improvement in at least one functional New York Heart Association (NYHA) class for PAH.

### Cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease [^112F2bdM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). High credibility.

Since the introduction of the first cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) in 1997, most clinicians, and probably most patients, would consider the cholinergic drugs donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine to be the first line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. These drugs have slightly different pharmacological properties, but they all work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine — an important neurotransmitter associated with memory — by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The most that these drugs could achieve is to modify the manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Cochrane reviews of each ChEI for Alzheimer's disease have been completed. Despite the evidence from the clinical studies and the intervening clinical experience, the debate on whether ChEIs are effective continues.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine in people with mild, moderate, or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched using the terms 'donepezil', 'E2020', 'Aricept', galanthamin*, galantamin*, reminyl, rivastigmine, exelon, "ENA 713", and ENA-713 on 12 June 2005. This register contains up-to-date records of all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trial databases.

- **Selection criteria**: All unconfounded, blinded, randomized trials in which treatment with a ChEI was compared with placebo or another ChEI for patients with mild, moderate, or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease were included.

### Ariceptodt [^116CFwcf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received Aricept 5 mg or 10 mg, where the occurrence rate was greater for patients treated with Aricept than with placebo.

- **Moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (Aricept 23 mg/day)**: Aricept 23 mg/day has been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months, and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days.

- **Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation**: The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of Aricept 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day, are shown in Table 5. The majority of discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the 23 mg group occurred during the first month of treatment.

- **Most common adverse reactions with Aricept 23 mg/day**: The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of Aricept and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of Aricept in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses.

### Decentralized clinical trials for medications to reduce the risk of dementia: Consensus report and guidance [^1121ooNK]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

There were two consensus statements where the responses were most mixed, both related to trial medication. For the first statement, "Clinical trial medication in stable tablet form (with adequate shelf life and stability in the potential storage conditions it may be exposed to) can be safely dispensed remotely and delivered to participants", 53% of the PIA group responding to this statement agreed (n = 10), 46% were neutral, and no one disagreed. Similarly, for the subsequent statement, "Clinical trial medication that is unstable or administered intravenously can only be dispensed in a person's home if it is administered by a health professional trained in the delivery of the medication and in the trial protocol and only following a stable maximal dose is achieved (e.g. after two or three administrations at a maximal dose)", 53% of the PIA group responding to this statement agreed (n = 10), 20% were neutral; however, four people disagreed.

There were no free text comments that provided additional insight into the responses to these two statements. The comments that were received from this group highlighted additional areas to evaluate, including the potential for validating additional tools for remote use, and the applicability of remote trials to specific population groups, including the potential preference of participants from some population groups for face-to-face contact.

### Lyrica [^1126UvdG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

When considering the return of pain or withdrawal due to adverse events as loss of therapeutic response (LTR), treatment with Lyrica resulted in a longer time to loss of therapeutic response than treatment with a placebo. Fifty-three percent of the pregabalin-treated subjects, compared to 33% of placebo patients, remained on the study drug and maintained a therapeutic response to Week 26 of the study. Treatment with Lyrica also resulted in a longer time to loss of response based on the FIQ, and a longer time to loss of overall assessment of patient status, as measured by the PGIC.

- **Time to worsening of the FIQ**: Was defined as the time to a 1-point increase from the double-blind baseline in each of the subscales, and a 5-point increase from the double-blind baseline evaluation for the FIQ total score.

- **Time to PGIC lack of improvement**: Was defined as the time to PGIC assessments indicating less improvement than "much improvement".

### Aricept odt [^112v1KMj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Alzheimer's disease is a disorder occurring primarily in individuals over 55 years of age. The mean age of patients enrolled in the clinical studies with Aricept was 73 years; 80% of these patients were between 65 and 84 years old, and 49% of patients were at or above the age of 75. The efficacy and safety data presented in the clinical trials section were obtained from these patients. There were no clinically significant differences in most adverse reactions reported by patient groups who were ≥ 65 years old and those who were < 65 years old.

- **Lower weight individuals**: In the controlled clinical trial, among patients in the Aricept 23 mg treatment group, those patients weighing < 55 kg reported more nausea, vomiting, and decreased weight than patients weighing 55 kg or more. There were more withdrawals due to adverse reactions as well. This finding may be related to higher plasma exposure associated with lower weight.

### Mortality in patients with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: a registry-based study [^116m7CEB]. Aging & Mental Health (2021). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common in patients with dementia. In the elderly population, comorbidities frequently coexist with dementia, and mortality in dementia is high. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of BPSD on mortality in severe dementia.

- **Methods**: This study involved 11,448 individuals and was based on linked information from the Swedish BPSD registry, the National Patient Register, and the Cause of Death register. BPSD was assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed for survival analysis. To study different degrees of BPSD, data was categorized into groups: no (NPI, 0 points), mild (NPI, 1–3 points on ≥ 1 item), moderate (NPI, 4–8 points on ≥ 1 item), and severe (NPI, 9–12 points on ≥ 1 item) BPSD, based on the highest score on any of the BPSD assessed (NPI items).

- **Results**: The presence of moderate or severe BPSD was associated with a stepwise increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08–1.60 and HR 1.74; 95% CI 1.44–2.12, respectively) compared with individuals with no BPSD. Additionally, there was an association between total NPI score and mortality (HR 1.01; 95% CI 1.007–1.010). The results remained significant after multivariable adjustment for age, sex, dementia diagnosis, medication, previous myocardial infarction, hip fracture, and stroke.

The results show a stepwise increase in mortality risk with increased BPSD, highlighting the importance of adequate management of BPSD to reduce mortality in dementia patients.

### Patterns of dementia treatment in older adults with Parkinson's disease using nationwide medical claims data [^112mzVvg]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews reported limited evidence wherein acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine slightly improved the global impression; however, only AChEIs enhanced cognitive function. Among the AChEIs, only rivastigmine is considered "efficacious and clinically useful", whereas donepezil and galantamine are considered "possibly useful" because of insufficient evidence. For memantine, practice implications have been investigational with insufficient evidence.

However, in addition to evidence, the approval indication from the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, ease of use, or adverse events would have influenced actual treatment by clinicians in the real world. The rivastigmine patch, for example, has a broader treatment spectrum with approval to treat mild to severe dementia, whereas rivastigmine capsules have been approved to treat only mild to moderate dementia. Donepezil is taken once a day; however, rivastigmine is taken twice a day. Patches, in general, require far more care and assistance from caregivers than oral medications. It is well known that adverse event rates increase proportionately with drug dosage. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 6–12 mg/day dosage of rivastigmine was superior to placebo, while 1–4 mg/day was not, suggesting a greater risk of adverse events to reach an effective dose. These factors must be taken into account when considering the treatment of Parkinson's disease with dementia (PD + D) patients in real-world practice. The goal of the present study was to investigate the incidence of dementia in patients with…

### Galantamine for Alzheimer's disease [^115PWx3a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Galantamine is a specific, competitive, and reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical effects of galantamine in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease (AD) and potential moderators of effect.

- **Search strategy**: The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, last updated on 25 August 2005, using the terms galanthamin*, galantamin*, and Reminyl. Published reviews were inspected for further sources. Additional information was collected from unpublished clinical research reports for galantamine obtained from Janssen.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials selected were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparisons of galantamine with placebo for a treatment duration of greater than 4 weeks in subjects with AD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by the reviewers and pooled where appropriate and possible. Outcomes of interest include the clinical global impression of change (CIBIC-plus or CGIC), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Disability Assessment for Dementia scale (DAD), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Potential moderating variables of treatment effect assessed included trial duration, dose, and diagnosis of possible vs. probable Alzheimer's disease.

- **Main results**: Seven trials with a total of 3,777 subjects were included in the analysis. Treatment with galantamine led to a significantly greater improvement.

### Ariceptodt [^115xC6AM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Aricept as a treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease is demonstrated by the results of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical investigations in patients with Alzheimer's disease (diagnosed by NINCDS and DSM III-R criteria, Mini-Mental State Examination ≥ 10 and ≤ 26, and Clinical Dementia Rating of 1 or 2). The mean age of patients participating in Aricept trials was 73 years, ranging from 50 to 94. Approximately 62% of patients were women, and 38% were men. The racial distribution was 95% white, 3% black, and 2% other races.

The higher dose of 10 mg did not provide a statistically significantly greater clinical benefit than 5 mg. However, based on the order of group mean scores and dose trend analyses of data from these clinical trials, there is a suggestion that a daily dose of 10 mg of Aricept might provide additional benefit for some patients. Accordingly, whether or not to employ a dose of 10 mg is a matter of prescriber and patient preference.

- **Study outcome measures**: In each study, the effectiveness of treatment with Aricept was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy.

The ability of Aricept to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, and reasoning.

### Minimal clinically important difference in Alzheimer's disease: Rapid review [^116kXcEF]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

We conducted a rapid systematic review of minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial endpoints.

- **Methods**: Two reviewers searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed from inception to June 4, 2023.
- **Results**: Ten articles were retrieved. For mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a change of +2 to +3 points on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), +1 point on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDR-SB), -5 points on the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), or -1 to -2 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was considered meaningful. For patients with mild AD, a change of +3 on the ADAS-Cog, +2 points on CDR-SB, -9 points on the iADRS, or -2 points on the MMSE was considered meaningful. For patients with moderate to severe AD, a change of +2 points on the CDR-SB or a change of -1.4 to -3 points on the MMSE was considered meaningful.
- **Conclusion**: This review identified previously published MCIDs for AD trial endpoints. Input from patients and caregivers will be needed to derive more meaningful endpoints and thresholds.

This systematic rapid review identified thresholds for minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for recently used Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial endpoints: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDR-SB), integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MCIDs were higher for more severe stages of AD.

### Cholinesterase inhibitors for vascular dementia and other vascular cognitive impairments: A network meta-analysis [^114SHW9r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) describes a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments caused by cerebrovascular disease, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. There are currently no pharmacological treatments recommended for improving either cognition or function in people with VCI. Three cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) are licensed for the treatment of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. They are thought to work by compensating for reduced cholinergic neurotransmission, which is also a feature of VCI. Through pairwise comparisons with placebo and a network meta-analysis, we sought to determine whether these medications are effective in VCI and whether there are differences between them with regard to efficacy or adverse events.

- **Objectives**: (1) To assess the efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of adults with vascular dementia and other VCI. (2) To compare the effects of different cholinesterase inhibitors on cognition and adverse events, using network meta-analysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 19 August 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials in which donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine was compared with placebo.

### Donepezil for dementia with Lewy bodies: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113V4EVd]. Annals of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia in the elderly and constitutes the second largest group of patients with dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). The core clinical features of DLB include neuropsychiatric symptoms and motor symptoms of parkinsonism, as well as cognitive impairment characterized by deficits of attention, executive function, and visual perception. Fluctuating cognition, hallucinations, and delusions are major sources of difficulties and distress for both patients and caregivers. The motor and autonomic features further impair activities of daily living and lead to poorer quality of life. However, pharmacological management of DLB remains challenging because it is complicated by the risk of adverse reactions to medication. Treatments for one aspect of the disease may exacerbate other symptoms. It is well recognized that DLB patients can be exquisitely sensitive to antipsychotic agents and can develop life-threatening sensitivity reactions. Antiparkinson medication given to improve motor symptoms can exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations. There are no approved treatments for DLB.

Cholinergic loss in DLB is associated with deficits in attention and cognition, and also with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that cholinergic neurotransmission is more defective in DLB than in AD. Although cholinergic losses in DLB affect both brainstem and basal forebrain presynaptic nuclei, in contrast to AD, postsynaptic cortical muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are more…

### Efficacy and safety of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YRs2c]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The role of currently available drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been controversial, with some national formularies restricting their use and health economists questioning whether the small clinical effects are economically worthwhile.

- **Objective**: To estimate the efficacy and safety of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine for the treatment of AD.

- **Methods**: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, with random assignment to a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine trials were included in the pooled studies.

- **Results**: Cognitive effects were significant for all drugs, ranging from a -1.29 points mean difference (95% CI -2.30 to -0.28) in the 20 mg daily memantine trials to -3.20 points (95% CI -3.28 to -3.12) in the 32 mg daily galantamine group. Only memantine had no effect on the Clinicians' Global Impression of Change scale. No behavioral benefits were observed, except for -2.72 (95% CI -4.92 to -0.52) in the 10 mg daily donepezil group and -1.72 (95% CI -3.12 to -0.33) for the 24 mg daily galantamine trial. Only 5 mg daily donepezil had no effect on the function outcome. Compared with placebo, more dropouts and adverse events occurred with the cholinesterase inhibitors, but not with memantine.

- **Conclusions**: Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are able to stabilize or slow decline in cognition, function, behavior, and global change.

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^113ZKF3r]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

- **Coadministration of cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist**: Coadministration of memantine and ChEIs has been evaluated in several trials and is proposed to have a synergistic effect. A fixed combination of memantine and donepezil in capsule form was approved in 2014 for moderate to severe AD. The recommended dose of the combination treatment is 28 mg memantine XR and 10 mg donepezil once daily. The use of memantine and donepezil in combination is bioequivalent to coadministration of individual memantine ER capsules and donepezil.

Generally, evidence suggests but does not definitively prove significant benefits with memantine and ChEI combination therapy over ChEI monotherapy. A meta-analysis conducted by the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) found evidence supporting combination therapy over monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe AD. Significant benefits were observed for behavior and mood (standardized mean difference, –0.19; p = 0.002), cognitive function (–0.27; p = 0.00001), and global outcomes (–0.20; p = 0.0004), but not for activities of daily living (–0.08; p = 0.12). Similar results were observed in a meta-analysis of seven trials in patients with mild to severe AD that demonstrated small but significant improvements in behavior (standardized mean difference, –0.13; p < 0.03), activities of daily living (–0.10; p < 0.02), and global outcomes (–0.15; p < 0.04) with combination therapy versus ChEI monotherapy. There were nonsignificant improvements in cognitive function (–0.13; p < 0.06).

### German society of neurology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and affective disorders in people with Parkinson's disease: New spotlights on diagnostic procedures and non-pharmacological interventions [^116F3umj]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatments for Parkinson's disease dementia focus on the efficacy of different medications. Evidence for AChEI treatment has been updated, with data from a meta-analysis confirming the positive treatment effects of rivastigmine and donepezil on PDD patients' global cognitive state, memory, and speech. However, there is stronger evidence for rivastigmine in meta-analyses. Meta-analyses did not consistently report positive effects of donepezil on cognitive tests, and its positive effects on ADL functioning have not been demonstrated yet.

In this guideline, positive changes in cognition (referred to as "pathophysiological validity") and ADL functions ("ecological validity") are rated higher than a change in the "Clinical Global Impression of Change" because the latter is dichotomized in meta-analyses ("improvement" versus "stable or worsening") and thus loses some of its statistical significance. Both changes in cognition (better effectiveness) and positive ADL functions favor rivastigmine. Improvements in neuropsychiatric symptoms have been verified with rivastigmine but not with donepezil.

Additionally, it has been shown that treatment with donepezil, compared to a placebo, leads to improvements in ADL. The occurrence of side effects, including worsening PD symptoms and tremors, has been reported with rivastigmine use but is less prominent with donepezil use. No effect for galantamine treatment has been identified.

Two meta-analyses reported only small improvements in cognitive function and global clinical impressions for memantine in people with PDD. However, treatment effects were considerably higher in mixed cohorts of PDD and Lewy body dementia.

### Randomized trial of verubecestat for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease [^113F3tbH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The study "Verubecestat in Alzheimer's Disease (40 mg)" was published by Egan MF and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to Alzheimer's disease. The trial question was: What is the effect of verubecestat in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease? The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, RCT with a population of 1,305 patients (733 female, 572 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
- **Exclusion criteria**: History of stroke; neurological disorder other than Alzheimer's disease; seizures or epilepsy within the last 5 years; alcohol use disorder or drug dependency/abuse within the last 5 years; hepatitis or liver disease active within the 6 months prior to screening visit; long QT syndrome.
- **Interventions**: n = 652 received verubecestat (40 mg/day) and n = 653 received a matching placebo.
- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in change in ADAS-cog score at 78 weeks (8 points vs. 7.7 points; MD 0.4, 97.5% CI -0.8 to 1.5).
- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference in change in ADCS-ADL score at 78 weeks (-8.2 points vs. -8.9 points; MD 0.7, 97.5% CI -0.9).

### Effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for treating dementia: Evidence review for a clinical practice guideline [^114J3b84]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of the five U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic therapies for dementias in achieving clinically relevant improvements is unclear.

- **Purpose**: To review the evidence for the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine) and the neuropeptide-modifying agent memantine in achieving clinically relevant improvements, primarily in cognition, global function, behavior, and quality of life, for patients with dementia.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, AgeLine, and PsycINFO from January 1986 through November 2006.

- **Study selection**: English-language randomized controlled trials were included in the review if they evaluated pharmacologic agents for adults with a diagnosis of dementia, did not use a crossover design, and had a quality score of at least 3 on the Jadad scale.

- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted on study characteristics and outcomes, including adverse events. Effect sizes were calculated and data were combined when appropriate.

- **Data synthesis**: 96 publications representing 59 unique studies were eligible for this review. Both cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine had consistent effects in the domains of cognition and global assessment, but summary estimates showed small effect sizes. Outcomes in the domains of behavior and quality of life were evaluated less frequently and showed less consistent effects. Most studies were of short duration (6 months), which limited evaluation.

### EFNS guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease [^113Lw1JM]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Alzheimer's disease, specifically in relation to cholinesterase inhibitors, the EFNS 2010 guidelines suggest offering cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine) to patients at the time of diagnosis, taking into account expected therapeutic benefits and potential safety issues. Benefits on cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms have been demonstrated in patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease.

### Withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine or both, in people with dementia [^112vXXh6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Dementia is a progressive syndrome characterized by deterioration in memory, thinking, and behavior, and by impaired ability to perform daily activities. Two classes of drugs — cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) and memantine — are widely licensed for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and rivastigmine is also licensed for Parkinson's disease dementia. These drugs are prescribed to alleviate symptoms and delay disease progression in these and sometimes in other forms of dementia. There are uncertainties about the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs in the long term and in severe dementia, about effects of withdrawal, and about the most appropriate time to discontinue treatment.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, in people with dementia on cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional outcomes, rates of institutionalization, adverse events, dropout from trials, mortality, quality of life, and carer-related outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 17 October 2020 using terms appropriate for the retrieval of studies of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. The Specialized Register contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries, and grey literature sources.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) which compared withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine.

### Clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs: A revised (third) consensus statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^116cVY3B]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). High credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology coordinated a meeting of experts to review and revise its previous 2011 guidelines for clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs. As before, levels of evidence were rated using accepted standards which were then translated into grades of recommendation A-D, with A having the strongest evidence base from randomized controlled trials and D the weakest from case studies or expert opinion. Clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia have sufficient accuracy to be applied in clinical practice (B), and both structural (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and functional (positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computerized tomography) brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy in particular situations (B).

Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are effective for cognition in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (A). Memantine is effective for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (A), and combination therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine may be beneficial (B). Drugs should not be stopped just because dementia severity increases (A). Until further evidence is available, other drugs, including statins, anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin E, nutritional supplements, and Ginkgo biloba, cannot be recommended either for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease (A). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor memantine are effective in those with mild cognitive impairment (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors are not effective in frontotemporal dementia and may cause agitation (A).

### Efficacy and adverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in vascular dementia: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116csKyT]. The Lancet Neurology (2007). High credibility.

Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine do not have regulatory approval in most of the world for the treatment of vascular dementia. A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the evidence for the efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in vascular dementia.

- **Methods**: PubMed, BIOSIS, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Cochrane registries were searched for randomised, placebo-controlled trials on cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in patients with vascular dementia. Trial methods, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and adverse events were extracted and checked. Meta-analytic methods using fixed-effects models were used to provide summaries of each drug's effects.

- **Findings**: Three donepezil, two galantamine, one rivastigmine, and two memantine trials, comprising 3,093 patients on the study drugs and 2,090 patients on placebo, met the selection criteria. Trials were of 6-month duration with similar vascular dementia criteria and outcome measures. Cognitive effects on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale were significant for all drugs, ranging from a -1.10 point mean difference (95% CI -2.15 to -0.05) for rivastigmine to -2.17 for 10 mg daily donepezil (95% CI -2.98 to -1.35). Only 5 mg daily donepezil had an effect on the Clinicians' Global Impression of Change scale (odds ratio 1.51 [95% CI 1.11–2.07]). No behavioural or functional benefits were observed, except for a -0.95 point difference (95% CI -1.74 to -0.16) with 10 mg daily donepezil on the Alzheimer's Disease Functional Assessment and Change Scale.

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^113LAoUq]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Galantamine is a short-acting, reversible, competitive ChEI that was approved in 2001 in the United States for mild to moderate AD. It is available in three formulations: extended-release (ER) capsules, tablets, and oral solution, which differ slightly in their pharmacokinetics. The ER capsules and tablets are bioequivalent for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h and C min; however, the C max of the ER capsule is 25% lower, and the time to reach C max occurs in 4.5 to 5.0 h after administration compared with 7.0 to 8.0 h with the tablets. The bioavailability of the tablet formulation is equivalent to the oral solution formulation.

- **Effectiveness of ChEIs**: All three ChEIs appear to improve global, cognitive, and functional outcomes. A meta-analysis of 23 ChEI clinical studies demonstrated significant benefits on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) with 5 and 10 mg donepezil (mean difference versus placebo, –1.95 and –2.48, respectively; p < 0.00001), 24 and 32 mg galantamine (–3.03 and –3.20, respectively; p < 0.00001), and 12 mg rivastigmine (–2.01; p < 0.00001) versus placebo in mild to moderate AD. Similar results were observed in two other meta-analyses. Weighted mean differences (ChEIs versus placebo) from individual studies varied from –2.12 to –3.20 for donepezil 5 and 10 mg, from –1.6 to –3.96 for galantamine 24 and 32 mg, and from –1.6 to –4.6 for rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg. Donepezil also demonstrated significant cognitive benefits over placebo in severe AD. Treatment with ChEIs is usually associated with a…

### Adlarity [^116qNDU4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a study of 30 weeks' duration, 473 patients were randomized to receive single daily doses of placebo, 5 mg/day, or 10 mg/day of donepezil tablets. The 30-week study was divided into a 24-week double-blind active treatment phase followed by a 6-week single-blind placebo washout period. The study was designed to compare 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day fixed doses of donepezil tablets to placebo. To reduce the likelihood of cholinergic effects, the 10 mg/day treatment was started following an initial 7-day treatment with 5 mg/day doses.

- **Effects on the ADAS-cog**: Figure 2 illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADAS-cog scores for all three dose groups over the 30 weeks of the study. After 24 weeks of treatment, the mean differences in the ADAS-cog change scores for donepezil-treated patients compared to the patients on placebo were 2.8 and 3.1 points for the 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day treatments, respectively. These differences were statistically significant. While the treatment effect size may appear to be slightly greater for the 10 mg/day treatment, there was no statistically significant difference between the two active treatments.

### What outcomes are important to patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, their caregivers, and health-care professionals? A systematic review [^112joGWZ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Low credibility.

The systematic review protocol is available in the PROSPERO database.

- **Search strategy**: We developed a search strategy for the MEDLINE database, balanced for sensitivity and specificity, and adapted it for use in Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Groups of search terms for each research question were created using input from ROADMAP partners. Terms related to Alzheimer's disease across the disease spectrum, stakeholder groups, and study methods were combined with terms related to outcomes and priority for research question 1. For research question 2, they were combined with terms related to a meaningful delay in disease progression. All searches were combined to remove duplicates. Gray literature was searched using "Alzheimer" in combination with "outcome" or "progression", applying date limits from 2008–2017 on relevant websites.

- **Study inclusion and additional searches**: Relevant studies were included regardless of language through translation into English by colleagues. Additional relevant studies were sought through manual searches of key articles' citation lists and checking relevant conference abstracts for full publications.

- **Study screening and quality appraisal**: Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to guide the selection of relevant studies for inclusion. Titles and abstracts of all retrieved citations were screened, with a 95% agreement on decisions to include or exclude by two independent members of the research team (Cohen's kappa, 0.53 [0.42–0.64]). Discrepancies were discussed with a third member of the team.

### Composite cognitive and functional measures for early stage Alzheimer's disease trials [^112PNTMX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods (search strategy)**: We identified 12 newer composites using literature searches in ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed as of September 1, 2017: composite AND preclinical AD; composite AND MCI; composite AND prodromal AD. In ClinicalTrials.gov, we generated a list of possibly relevant studies by a search conditioned by the following term: Alzheimer's and outcome and composite. We also utilized Vellas et al. (2015), Mortamais et al. (2016), and our own specialized knowledge of the literature to identify composites.

We operationally defined composites as instruments that combined several clinical tests of multiple domains and a derived single outcome score (e.g. z‐score), and wherein the instrument was proposed for, or used in a clinical trial for preclinical, prodromal, or mild AD populations. We do not discuss efforts to improve sensitivity of individual scales through item-response theory or Rasch statistics, and we do not comment on composites based on a single cognitive domain.

### A European academy of neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^114DcgFB]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Aggression or agitation may occur during the course of dementia without obvious reasons or when patients experience stress, such as changes in the environment during hospitalization. It can also result from a physical condition or as side effects of drug treatment. A number of meta-analyses have found that the efficacy of antipsychotics for treating agitation/aggression in patients with dementia is modest and associated with increased mortality and risk of cerebrovascular accidents [50, 51, 52].

In 2007, European regulatory agencies and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with dementia. This was extended by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and the FDA in 2009 to include all antipsychotics, based on several large observational studies and meta-analyses showing increased mortality associated with treatment [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. This finding has been confirmed in subsequent studies [2, 60].

However, under certain preconditions, antipsychotics may be used as first-line pharmacological treatment for agitation/aggression — specifically, after all non-pharmacological measures have been proven ineffective or in cases of severe self-harm or harm to others [61]. This includes the use of risperidone, haloperidol, and aripiprazole. Antipsychotics confer modest benefits for the short-term treatment of aggression/agitation in dementia [50, 51, 52].
