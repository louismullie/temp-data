## Question

What are the surgical options for a physically active 50-year-old patient with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the surgical options for a 50-year-old, physically active patient with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, goals, and prognosis in an active middle-aged patient. Then, I should verify the tear etiology and characteristics that drive timing and technique. Next, I will decide on surgical approach and fixation strategy, consider biologic augmentation, address concomitant stiffness, outline postoperative rehabilitation and pain control, and finally project outcomes, return-to-activity expectations, and follow-up imaging needs, ensuring each step is anchored to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me consider the clinical context and goals first. At age 50 with high activity demands, younger age and higher sports/activity levels are favorable prognostic factors for tendon healing and functional recovery, which supports a strategy aimed at durable repair, early motion recovery, and expedited return to function, while minimizing pain and retear risk; I should confirm that long-term comparative data in small to medium tears also show sustained benefit of repair versus physiotherapy in appropriately selected patients, which they do over 15 years, reinforcing the value of operative management when symptoms and function warrant it [^113JTmwy].

> Wait, let me verify the drivers of timing: traumatic versus degenerative etiology and symptom burden. If the tear is traumatic, best practice is repair as soon as reasonably possible, ideally within 12 weeks, to optimize outcomes; if degenerative, a short, structured nonoperative trial is reasonable, but persistent pain, weakness, or functional loss in this active patient often leads to repair, noting that both operative and nonoperative arms tend to improve over time but with differing risks and trajectories; I should also factor in that untreated full-thickness tears have a substantial rate of progression radiographically over time, and patient expectations and activity level influence the likelihood of transitioning to surgery, especially beyond 6 months [^115nnM7M] [^116myXMQ] [^114YmC9A] [^111kq92U].

> Hold on, I should choose the surgical approach carefully. Although open and arthroscopic repairs yield similar long-term outcomes and healing, arthroscopic-only techniques are associated with better short-term recovery of motion and lower early pain, which is meaningful for an active 50-year-old; a randomized trial comparing open versus arthroscopic acromioplasty with mini-open repair showed earlier quality-of-life gains favoring the minimally invasive approach at 3 months, aligning with my preference for an all-arthroscopic repair when feasible [^116Xeegb] [^116Xeegb].

> I will now examine fixation strategy based on tear size and tissue quality. For small to medium tears (generally ≤ 3 cm), a single-row construct is acceptable with reasonable retear rates at 2 years, whereas larger tears or compromised tissue often benefit from double-row or transosseous-equivalent suture-bridge fixation to potentially lower structural failure risk; I should double-check that contemporary guidelines endorse tailoring among single-row, double-row, and suture-bridge options with consideration for larger tears, which they do [^1135VGJ6] [^116ZXjrr].

> But wait, what if tissue quality is poor or the tear is larger or chronic for its biology. In that scenario, I should consider augmentation strategies to enhance the mechanical and biologic milieu, including dermal allograft or other adjuncts when indicated, while avoiding xenograft augmentation for large and massive tears per AAOS guidance; additionally, I should confirm whether adding platelet-rich plasma at the time of repair may reduce pain, disability, and retear risk in selected patients, which APTA guidelines suggest considering [^117JatAv] [^117WAcJt] [^1127E481].

> Let me not overlook concomitant stiffness, because that can derail recovery if unmanaged. If adhesive capsulitis is present, both immediate repair with capsular release and a staged approach after preoperative rehabilitation are reasonable, with similar functional outcomes and retear rates, so I should individualize based on the severity of stiffness, symptom acuity, and patient priorities for timing and recovery [^112dFfVN].

> Next, I should review postoperative rehabilitation, and I need to ensure I am not accelerating load too quickly. A randomized trial comparing progressive early active exercise therapy versus usual care after repair of traumatic full-thickness tears showed no superiority of the early progressive program at 12 weeks or 1 year, suggesting a criterion-based progression that protects the repair during early healing is prudent; I should verify that our plan includes protected passive motion, gradual active motion, and staged strengthening calibrated to tear size, fixation, and tissue quality [^113k3ByC].

> I should also confirm a multimodal, opioid-sparing pain plan to facilitate early motion without compromising safety. The PROSPECT procedure-specific recommendations endorse baseline acetaminophen and NSAIDs, regional anesthesia techniques, and judicious adjuncts tailored to pain severity after rotator cuff repair, which aligns with minimizing opioids and optimizing early rehabilitation in this active patient [^1117PRwF] [^116j3BnW].

> Now, let me think about expected outcomes and activity resumption. In patients under 55, repairs generally yield high satisfaction, pain relief, and strength gains, including in traumatic tears, though I should caution that measured shoulder activity levels may not universally increase despite improved symptoms and function; still, active-duty and athletic cohorts demonstrate durable improvements over long-term follow-up, supporting an expectation of return to demanding activity with appropriate protection and rehab [^112wGcr7] [^111R715R] [^113kYfMv].

> I should double-check healing expectations and how to monitor them. Arthroscopic supraspinatus repairs achieve watertight or partial healing in the majority of patients, and retear risk scales with tear size and tissue quality; for small to medium tears repaired with single-row constructs, retear rates around 10 to 20% by 24 months have been reported, while clinical outcomes may remain favorable even with partial structural failure; incorporating a 12-month integrity check with ultrasound or MRI can be considered when results would change management, but routine imaging without clinical concern is not mandatory [^1157uNma] [^1135VGJ6].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit for this 50-year-old active patient. If the full-thickness tear is traumatic or subacute, I recommend timely arthroscopic repair, ideally within 12 weeks, using single-row fixation for a small to medium tear and double-row or suture-bridge for larger lesions or compromised tendon, with selective biologic augmentation and consideration of PRP as appropriate; if the tear is degenerative, a brief, structured nonoperative trial is reasonable, but persistent pain, weakness, or functional limitation in this active patient justifies arthroscopic repair, given favorable age-related prognosis and long-term benefits in selected small to medium tears, followed by criterion-based rehabilitation and multimodal analgesia to expedite safe return to activity while protecting the repair [^115nnM7M] [^116ZXjrr] [^116Xeegb].

For an active 50-year-old with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear, **early arthroscopic repair** is recommended to restore function, reduce pain, and enable return to activity [^112iZYYB], especially for traumatic or acute tears [^115nnM7M]. Arthroscopic repair offers **faster recovery, less pain, and lower complication rates** than open surgery, with similar long-term outcomes [^1177N6sG]. Double-row or suture-bridge constructs are preferred for larger tears to reduce retear risk [^116ZXjrr]. Postoperative rehabilitation includes early passive motion [^113k3ByC], gradual strengthening, and return to activity by 4–6 months. Delaying surgery increases the risk of **tear progression, fatty infiltration, and poorer outcomes** [^115nnM7M] [^114YmC9A] [^112iZYYB].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical repair is indicated in **active patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears**, particularly when [^116Xeegb]:

- **Traumatic tears**: Acute traumatic tears or acute-on-chronic tears with acute symptoms [^115nnM7M] [^111LCrzf].

- **Functional impairment**: Significant functional limitations, weakness, or inability to perform daily activities or occupational tasks [^1114qNNC].

- **Failure of conservative treatment**: Persistent symptoms despite adequate conservative management (physical therapy, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections) [^116Xeegb] [^114T9uzz].

- **Tear progression**: Evidence of tear progression, fatty infiltration, or muscle atrophy on imaging [^114YmC9A].

---

## Surgical techniques

Several techniques are used for rotator cuff repair: arthroscopic repair (minimally invasive and associated with less postoperative pain, faster recovery, and lower complication rates than open surgery); open repair, typically reserved for massive or complex tears; and mini-open repair, a hybrid technique combining arthroscopic and open approaches. Arthroscopic repair is generally preferred due to its **minimally invasive nature and favorable short-term outcomes** [^1177N6sG].

---

## Prognostic factors influencing surgical outcomes

Several factors influence **surgical outcomes** in active patients [^113JTmwy]:

- **Age**: Younger patients generally have better outcomes, although age alone should not preclude surgery [^113JTmwy].

- **Tear size and chronicity**: Larger, chronic tears with significant retraction and fatty infiltration have higher retear rates and poorer outcomes [^113JTmwy].

- **Patient activity level**: Higher activity levels are associated with better functional outcomes [^113JTmwy].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, obesity, and smoking negatively impact healing and increase complication rates.

---

## Postoperative rehabilitation protocols

Postoperative rehabilitation focuses on **early passive range of motion**, initiated within the first week to prevent stiffness. This progresses to active ROM and strengthening beginning around 6 weeks, with return to full activity generally achieved by 4–6 months, depending on tear size and patient factors.

---

## Potential complications and risks

Surgical repair carries **potential risks**, including:

- **Re-tear**: Occurs in approximately 10–20% of cases, higher in larger or chronic tears [^1135VGJ6].

- **Infection**: Rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases.

- **Stiffness**: Occurs in approximately 5–10% of cases, typically managed with physical therapy.

- **Nerve injury**: Rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases.

---

## Long-term functional outcomes and patient satisfaction

Long-term outcomes after surgical repair are **generally favorable**, with significant reductions in postoperative pain and improvements in shoulder function, strength, and range of motion [^1157uNma]. Most patients report high satisfaction and often return to preinjury activity levels.

---

## Comparison with non-surgical management

Non-surgical management may be appropriate for **select patients**, particularly those with **small, asymptomatic tears** or minimal functional impairment, or for individuals with **significant comorbidities** or low activity levels [^116myXMQ]. However, it **carries risks of tear progression**, persistent pain, and functional limitations, especially in active patients [^114YmC9A].

---

## Timing of surgical intervention

Early surgical intervention (within 12 weeks of injury) is recommended for **traumatic tears** to prevent tear progression, fatty infiltration, and muscle atrophy, which negatively impact outcomes [^115nnM7M] [^112iZYYB].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

**Current guidelines recommend surgical repair** for active patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears, particularly traumatic tears or those with significant functional impairment. Arthroscopic repair is generally preferred due to its minimally invasive nature and favorable outcomes [^116Xeegb].

Management of partial-thickness tears of the rotator cuff should include consideration of tear size, tear depth, patient age and activity level, and tear etiology. We present an arthroscopic technique for repair of articular surface partial-thickness tears that may promote healing by closing the tendon side-to-side and placing the debrided tendon end in contact with an abraded humeral surface. By repairing selected partial-thickness tears, the progression of the tear and the need for subsequent repair may be prevented. Our preliminary results in 28 patients are encouraging and suggest that this technique is a useful adjunct to tendon debridement for articular surface partial-thickness tears of the rotator cuff.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON shoulder prospective cohort [^112aaDBB]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). Low credibility.

The primary aim of this study was to identify predictors of failure of nonoperative treatment for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears (RCTs) in order to help identify potential indications for surgery. Our data demonstrate that the predictors of failure change over time. Early surgery (within 6 months) is driven by low expectations regarding the efficacy of physical therapy. For patients who underwent surgery after 6 months, activity level and Workers' Compensation status were strong predictors.

- **Patient expectations**: Modifying patient expectations through education has been shown to improve outcomes in total knee arthroplasty, physical therapy for neck pain, and the use of kinesiotape for shoulder pain. It is not known whether expectations can be modified in patients with shoulder pain; however, there is currently a trial underway to study this question. If low patient expectations regarding therapy could be modified, the overall rate of surgery might be similar to what we observed between 6 months and 10 years, and the effectiveness of physical therapy as a treatment would likely exceed 88%.

- **Activity level and Workers' Compensation status**: Activity level was found to be a significant predictor of both early and later surgery, whereas Workers' Compensation status was a significant predictor of later surgery. These variables were more important than age, pain intensity, the number of tendons involved, and the duration of symptoms in predicting the likelihood of surgery. Physicians should strongly consider a patient's activity level and Workers' Compensation status.

### Long-term results of arthroscopic repair of full-thickness traumatic rotator cuff tears in active duty military patients under the age of 40 years [^111R715R]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is an effective procedure for decreasing pain and increasing strength, with favorable long-term outcomes demonstrated in older patient populations with full-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, the long-term outcomes after this procedure in younger, higher-demand patients are not as clearly defined.

- **Purpose**: To report on the long-term outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears in active duty military patients under the age of 40 years at the time of surgery.

- **Study design**: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: Preoperative, midterm, and final evaluations were collected, including scores on the visual analog scale for pain, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder form. A total of 42 patients were screened for inclusion: 3 underwent additional surgical procedures on the operative shoulder, and 2 were lost to follow-up, leaving 37 patients with a mean follow-up of 104.51 months available for analysis. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing outcomes between patients with Southern California Orthopaedic Institute grade 1 or 2 tears and those with grade 3 or 4 tears.

- **Results**: At final follow-up, pain per the visual analog scale decreased to 1.16 from 8.03 (P < .0001); the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score increased to 87.32 from 48.24 (P < .0001); and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score increased to 88.68 from 41.00 (P < .0001). There was no statistically significant difference in outcome scores between the groups analyzed.

### Indications for rotator cuff repair: A systematic review [^1114qNNC]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Despite the popularity of surgical repair for rotator cuff tears, literature regarding the indications for and timing of surgery is sparse. We performed a systematic review of the literature to investigate factors influencing the decision to surgically repair symptomatic, full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Specifically, how do demographic variables, duration of symptoms, timing of surgery, physical examination findings, and size of tear affect treatment outcome and indications for surgery?

We reviewed the best available evidence, which offers some guidelines for surgical decision-making. Variables suggest earlier surgical intervention may be needed in cases of weakness and substantial functional disability. Regarding demographic variables, the evidence is unclear about their association with treatment outcome. However, older chronological age does not seem to portend a worse outcome. Pending worker's compensation claims appear to negatively affect treatment results.

Further research is required to define the indications for surgery for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, designing and conducting an ethical study to obtain Level I evidence on this issue will be a major challenge.

### Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears in older adults: A retrospective case-series study [^115UmfBe]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain and dysfunction can indicate rotator cuff tears (RCTs), primarily affecting the supraspinatus tendon. Approximately 30% of adults over 60 have some degree of RCTs. They usually occur because of traumatic injuries, degenerative changes, or a combination of both. However, there seems to be no distinction in degenerative alterations observed in ruptured tendons between patients with acute, trauma-related rotator cuff tears and those with non-traumatic, chronic tears. The RCTs can also progress as a long-lasting process, beginning with shoulder impingement that gradually gives rise to partial tears, full-thickness tears, massive tears, and eventually shoulder arthropathy. The degenerative tears typically affect the bursal surface or the main substance of the tendon. In contrast, younger athletes participating in overhead activities usually sustain tears at the articular surface secondary to repetitive tensile overload with subsequent fiber tension failure.

The incidence of RCTs increases with age, partially because of age-related degeneration affecting the tendons and their attachments, and partly because of other possible associated comorbidities that can affect the quality of tendons and their response to overload, such as osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It is estimated that over 60% of people over 80 years have RCTs, mostly asymptomatic despite being bilaterally affected. Progression to symptomatic tears is common within five years, mainly in patients with cuff muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration.

### Functional outcome and health-related quality of life after surgical repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tear using a mini-open technique [^1146JKpt]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff tear, a common shoulder injury, can lead to shoulder pain and functional loss. The hypothesis was that surgical repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears using the mini-open surgical technique would improve shoulder function and health-related quality of life.

- **Study design**: Cohort study. Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: Patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear who underwent a mini-open repair were evaluated for (1) active shoulder range of motion preoperatively, and 6 months and 12 months postoperatively and (2) health-related quality of life preoperatively, 6 months postoperatively, and annually up to 5 years postoperatively. Satisfaction with the repair and return to work status were ascertained 1 year postoperatively. A subgroup analysis of tear size and patient age was also undertaken.

- **Results**: Of the subjects, 61 (73%) were men, and the average age was 53.2 (± 9.9) years. According to repeated-measures analysis of variance, shoulder range of motion (flexion and external rotation) improved significantly from before surgery to 1 year after surgery (P < .001). The mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from 53.3 (± 20.6) preoperatively to 90.6 (± 11.7) 1 year postoperatively (P < .001). The mean Western Ontario Rotator Cuff scores also improved from 43.2 (± 20.2) preoperatively to 87.2 (± 14.3) 1 year postoperatively (P < .001). No differences were seen in either the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores or Western Ontario Rotator Cuff scores between the 1-year examination and the last follow-up assessment.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^117N2aCM]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for rotator cuff disorders, and more specifically with respect to rotator cuff repair, the AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend performing either conversion to full-thickness or transtendinous/in situ repair in patients with high-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears that have failed conservative management.

### Editorial commentary: Progression of degenerative full-thickness rotator cuff tears: Are we finally using natural history data to define at-risk tears [^111661jS]. Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Defining and understanding natural history data for any disease is paramount to developing effective treatment strategies; degenerative rotator cuff disease is no different. The natural history defines disease progression without treatment or intervention. Given the persistent variable indications for surgical intervention for painful rotator cuff tears, a more thorough understanding of the rate of progression of full-thickness rotator cuff tears can help refine surgical indications and potentially define the risks of nonoperative treatment. This systematic review synthesizes existing literature and takes the surgeon one step closer to understanding the rates of tear progression for untreated tears — one small step.

### Prospect guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: Systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^117W73eP]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

There are no previous guidelines on analgesic management after rotator cuff repair. Nevertheless, the procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) approach to developing guidelines is unique in that the available evidence is critically assessed for clinical relevance, considering the use of simple, non-opioid analgesics such as paracetamol and NSAIDs as baseline analgesics. This approach reports true clinical effectiveness by balancing the invasiveness of the analgesic interventions with the degree of pain after surgery, as well as balancing efficacy and adverse effects.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON Shoulder prospective cohort [^116zSPLW]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) are a leading cause of shoulder pain and disability, accounting for 272,148 surgical procedures in the U.S. in 2006. In the US, rotator cuff repair rates have been accelerating, with a 141% increase in procedures from 1996 to 2006. The likelihood of an RCT increases with age. Due to an increasingly aging population and the fact that more than two-thirds of patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery are of working age, these injuries represent a substantial economic burden to the U.S. health care system.

Historically, the presence of the condition served as the indication for rotator cuff repair surgery for many surgeons. Surveys of the members of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons show little agreement in clinical decision-making for RCTs, which may contribute to the tremendous geographical variation noted for rotator cuff surgery in the U.S. These data suggest there is uncertainty regarding the indications for surgery for patients with RCTs.

To gain insight into the indications for rotator cuff repair surgery, our Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder Group performed a prospective cohort study of 452 patients with nonoperatively treated symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness RCTs. We hypothesized that specific variables related to the medical history, physical examination, and imaging would serve as predictors for the failure of nonoperative treatment. The primary aim of this study was to assess how the predictors of surgery change over the course of the 10-year follow-up period.

### Indications and technique: Rotator cuff repair augmentation [^117JatAv]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Rotator cuff repair (RCR) augmentation is often considered for patients with large-to-massive rotator cuff tears or chronic tears with poor tissue quality. Augmentation can provide mechanical stability and improved biology to improve the likelihood of a successful repair. This article discusses the indications, diagnosis, surgical techniques, and outcomes for RCR augmentation using an acellular dermal allograft, partially demineralized cancellous allograft, dermal xenograft, bone marrow aspirate concentrate, and platelet-rich plasma.

### Fifteen-year results of a comparative analysis of tendon repair versus physiotherapy for small-to-medium-sized rotator cuff tears: A concise follow-up of previous reports [^114T9uzz]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

In the report, we present the 15-year results of a single-center, randomized, two-arm, parallel-group, single-blinded superiority trial performed at a secondary care institution in Norway. The 1, 5, and 10-year results were previously published. The study was approved by the Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00852657). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after study information was provided both orally and in writing.

Between September 2004 and October 2007, a total of 103 patients referred from primary care services for the treatment of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear of not more than 3 cm in diameter were included in the study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are not included here, but the patient flow through the study is depicted in the trial flowchart: screening, randomization, and primary outcome population. Patients who crossed over to secondary surgery remained in the physiotherapy group for analysis in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^113e6yQk]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with degenerative and traumatic full-thickness tears involving the supraspinatus tendon both show satisfactory functional results at the short-term follow-up after ARCR. Although patients with traumatic tears have lower baseline functional scores, such as the CMS, they rehabilitate over time and demonstrate significantly greater score changes up to the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. At 12 to 24 months after ARCR, clinical differences in functional and patient-reported outcomes are no longer evident. Likewise, structural outcomes are comparable between degenerative and traumatic rotator cuff tears, which indicates that degenerated tendons retain healing potential.

### Open repair of massive rotator cuff tears in patients aged sixty-five years or over: Is it worthwhile [^114Cgqpz]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the functional outcome and identify possible preoperative prognostic factors in patients aged 65 years or over undergoing open repair for a massive (> 5 cm) full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Patients were assessed following a mean of 48 months by an independent observer using the Constant score and the Oxford Shoulder Questionnaire. The outcome was excellent or good in 44% and poor in 23%. The patient satisfaction rate was 84%. Pain relief was obtained in 93%. We found three preoperative variables to be significantly associated with a poor outcome: female sex, duration of symptoms greater than 34 months before surgery, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade. The results of our study suggest that appropriately selected patients who are aged 65 years or over with a massive full-thickness rotator cuff tear can be expected to have a good functional outcome and pain relief after repair.

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^1112yX77]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The restriction of full-thickness tears involving the supraspinatus tendon in our study is of great importance. Within the initial cohort of 973 patients, a substantial proportion of partial tears were degenerative (80%), and a significant proportion of massive tears were of traumatic origin (64%). The registry study of Kukkonen et al. included 306 patients and reported a higher rate of larger tear sizes in patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears, which is in line with our findings that massive tears are more likely to derive from trauma. Therefore, including massive and partial tears would inevitably introduce selection bias.

Because of previously unaddressed methodological issues, the literature comparing degenerative and traumatic tears has been inconsistent. Tan et al. investigated the influence of the cause of tear on outcome in a cohort of 1300 patients at a single center. They found a more restricted range of motion pre- and postoperatively in the traumatic group but no difference in retear rates between groups. Besides the retrospective design and the short follow-up duration of 6 months, a major limitation was the definition of traumatic tears. Patients were considered to have sustained a traumatic tear if a trauma event was recalled. No information was provided regarding previous shoulder complaints. Furthermore, patients in the traumatic group were included until 24 months after trauma. This duration alone can lead to tendon degeneration in the event of a persisting tear. Braune et al. reported significantly higher CMS for patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^112xWUUV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for rotator cuff disorders, specifically with respect to rotator cuff repair, the AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend there is insufficient evidence to express a preference for the choice of debridement versus repair of high-grade partial-thickness cuff tears that have failed physical therapy. However, they do consider performing repair of high-grade partial tears to improve outcomes.

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^115G1YSY]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical outcome parameters — including active range of motion, strength at 90° of abduction, and CMS — were assessed 6 months and 1 year after surgery. All consultations with clinical examination were conducted in a face-to-face study visit. Overall patient satisfaction, OSS, SSV, pain, and the EQ5D5L utility index were documented via online or paper-based patient questionnaires at the 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups or, in the absence of a response, via phone calls.

Adverse events were documented according to a standardized core set on separate adverse event forms throughout the 2-year postoperative period and reviewed for plausibility by two fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons. Adverse events included symptomatic rotator cuff defects diagnosed by ultrasound or MRI, leading to a change in treatment. Patients also underwent a routine ultrasound check of their operated shoulder 1 year after surgery to document asymptomatic defects of the repaired tendons.

A Delphi process with all ultrasound operators was conducted before the follow-up examinations, and training videos were provided to improve comparability among the ultrasound assessments. The ultrasound operators were radiologists with musculoskeletal specialty training, experienced rheumatologists, or orthopedic surgeons. Of all sonographers, 72% had more than 10 years of work experience. Repair integrity was documented at 12 months via a composite outcome parameter combining the occurrence of a symptomatic rotator cuff adverse event within 12 months after surgery.

### Patient outcome following rehabilitation for rotator cuff repair surgery: The impact of selected medical comorbidities [^111jqQjP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

This study employed a prospective, multicenter research design.

- **Objectives**: To assess functional and health status outcomes in patients following a physical therapy program after rotator cuff repair surgery, and to determine the impact of selected patient medical comorbidities on rehabilitation outcomes.

- **Background**: While authors have studied the influence of multiple factors on patient outcomes after rotator cuff repair surgery, little research has been done on the impact of comorbidities, particularly as it relates to establishing an accurate patient prognosis. Eighteen patients who had recently undergone a rotator cuff repair surgical procedure were recruited at one of 30 Physiotherapy Associates, Inc. outpatient clinics located in 13 states. A rehabilitation protocol was implemented and included the following interventions, as indicated: therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, electrotherapeutic modalities, and physical agents. Patient health history factors were documented during the initial examination, including age, race, body mass index, smoking, rotator cuff tear size, type of surgical procedure, and selected medications and comorbidities. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) were completed prior to rehabilitation, at discharge, and at 6 months post-discharge.

- **Results**: DASH and most SF-36 domain mean scores obtained post-rehabilitation were significantly improved from pre-therapy scores. Most health status outcomes were maintained at 6-month follow-up, with slight further improvement noted in SF-36 physical dimensions and DASH score.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON shoulder prospective cohort [^113geEDg]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). Low credibility.

This multicenter prospective cohort study was designed to identify predictors of failure of nonoperative treatment for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears (RCTs). This study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00762580) was approved by the institutional review boards of each participating institution. Patients aged 18 to 100 years with symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness RCTs were invited to participate. Exclusion criteria included a history of injury, pain related to the cervical spine, scapular pain, previous shoulder surgery, glenohumeral arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, adhesive capsulitis, previous proximal humeral fracture, known bilateral RCTs, or dementia.

At the initial visit, patients completed a questionnaire that collected demographic data and included validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The following PROMs were collected: Short Form-12 (SF-12) score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score, Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire, and the Shoulder Activity Scale. Patient expectations were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System (MODEMS) survey, which includes six items, each scored from 1 (lowest expectations) to 5 (highest expectations). Physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments were conducted by the surgeons participating in the study, according to the methods and cohort data detailed in previous reports.

### Rotator cuff repair in patients fifty years of age and younger [^1134qDGH]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no information on the long-term results of rotator cuff repair in young patients. The purpose of the present study was to determine the results, the risk factors for an unsatisfactory outcome, and the rates of failure of this procedure in patients fifty years of age and younger.

- **Methods**: Thirty-two patients (thirty-six shoulders) who were fifty years of age or younger underwent repair of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear between 1976 and 1987. Seven patients (seven shoulders) died after less than thirteen years of follow-up. The remaining twenty-nine shoulders, which had been followed for a minimum of thirteen years or until revision surgery, were included in the analysis. The most recent follow-up was performed in the clinic for five shoulders and by means of a questionnaire for twenty-four shoulders.

- **Results**: There were three small, fifteen medium, six large, and five massive tears. Rotator cuff repair was associated with significant long-term pain relief (p = 0.0001). However, there was no significant long-term improvement in active abduction or external rotation. Postoperative pain, active abduction, and external rotation did not vary significantly according to gender, tear size, repair type, or whether a distal clavicular excision had been performed. There were eleven excellent, five satisfactory, and thirteen unsatisfactory results. Seven shoulders had additional surgery for the treatment of a retear (five), instability (one), or osteoarthritis (one). Three of the five repairs that were done for the treatment of a retear…

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^115FVJaj]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

**Quality of life and level of satisfaction**: The mean EQ5DL utility indices were similar for the degenerative and traumatic groups at 12 and 24 months after ARCR (P = 0.215) (see, available online). The mean overall levels of patient satisfaction at 12 months were 8.8 (SD, 1.8) and 9.1 (SD, 1.4) for the degenerative and traumatic groups, respectively (P = 0.083). By 24 months, the respective mean satisfaction levels were 9.2 (SD, 1.7) and 9.3 (SD, 1.6) (P = 0.595). At 12 months, most patients in the degenerative (84%) and traumatic (90%) groups stated that they would undergo the surgery again (adjusted P = 0.185). By the final follow-up, the proportions of patients with degenerative (92%) and traumatic tears (91%) opting for ARCR again remained high (adjusted P = 0.777).

### Arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears: Is there tendon healing in patients aged 65 years or older [^111kjSXB]. Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess tendon healing and clinical outcomes of rotator cuff tears (RCTs) repaired arthroscopically in patients aged 65 years or older. Between January 2001 and December 2004, 88 patients with a mean age of 70 years (range, 65 to 85 years) underwent arthroscopic RCT repair. The repairs were performed on 54 women (61%), and the dominant arm was involved in 72 patients (82%). More than two tendons were involved in 45 cases. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Constant score and the Simple Shoulder Test. Tendon healing was estimated using a computed tomography (CT) arthrogram obtained 6 months postoperatively, categorized into three stages: stage 1 - watertight and anatomic healing; stage 2 - watertight and partial healing; and stage 3 - not watertight and retear.

The mean follow-up duration was 41 months (range, 24 to 77 months). The mean clinical outcome scores significantly improved at the time of the final follow-up (P < .01). CT arthrogram imaging showed 27 shoulders with stage 1 repair, 20 with stage 2 repair, and 34 with stage 3 repair. The retear rate was 42% (34 of 81). Patients with tendon healing stages 1 or 2 demonstrated significantly superior functional outcomes regarding overall scores and strength compared with stage 3 repairs (P < .01). Among the 39 isolated supraspinatus tears (small or medium), 11 (28.9%) re-tore (stage 3).

Arthroscopic repair in patients aged 65 years or older can yield tendon healing with significant clinical improvement.

### Does arthroscopic rotator cuff repair improve patients' activity levels [^113kYfMv]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff repair decreases pain, improves range of motion, and increases strength. Whether these improvements translate to an improvement in a patient's activity level postoperatively remains unknown. The Shoulder Activity Level is a valid and reliable outcomes survey that can be used to measure a patient's shoulder-specific activity level; however, currently, there are no studies that examine the effect of rotator cuff repair on shoulder activity level.

- **Methods**: Preoperative patient-determined outcomes scores were collected prospectively for patients undergoing rotator cuff repair and compared with postoperative scores at a minimum of two years. These scores included the Shoulder Activity Level, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and simple shoulder test. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

- **Results**: The study included 281 shoulders from 273 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. The postoperative median Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (42 vs. 94), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (41 vs. 95), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (30 vs. 95), and simple shoulder test (4 vs. 11) scores were statistically significantly improved compared with preoperative scores (p < 0.0001). However, the postoperative median Shoulder Activity Level score decreased compared with the preoperative score (12 vs. 11; p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: Patients reported a statistically significant deterioration of their Shoulder Activity Level score after rotator cuff repair.

### A randomized clinical trial comparing open to arthroscopic acromioplasty with mini-open rotator cuff repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tears: Disease-specific quality of life outcome at an average 2-year follow-up [^1177N6sG]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tears significantly affect patients' quality of life. The advancement towards less invasive operative techniques for rotator cuff repair necessitates appropriate comparisons with the standard open procedure, using validated outcomes in a randomized fashion.

- **Hypothesis**: There is no difference in disease-specific quality of life outcomes at 2 years between an open surgical repair (open) versus an arthroscopic acromioplasty with mini-open (scope mini-open) repair for patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears.

- **Study design**: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

- **Methods**: Patients with unremitting pain, failed nonoperative treatment, and imaging indicating full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included in the study. Massive irreparable cuff tears were excluded. Patients were assessed using the disease-specific Rotator Cuff-Quality of Life index, which produces a maximum score of 100, representing a high quality of life. Secondary shoulder-specific outcomes (American Shoulder and Elbow Society, Shoulder Rating Questionnaire, and Functional Shoulder Elevation Test) were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.

- **Results**: The mean Rotator Cuff-Quality of Life scores at an average follow-up of 28 months were not statistically different: open, 86.9 (95% confidence interval: 81.8–92.0); and scope mini-open, 87.2 (95% confidence interval: 80.6–93.8). At 3 months, patients who underwent scope mini-open showed statistically significantly better outcomes (55.6 vs. 71.3; p = 0.005). The baseline to 3-month difference in Rotator Cuff-Quality of Life scores highlights the effectiveness of the minimally invasive approach.

### Natural history of nonoperatively treated symptomatic rotator cuff tears in patients 60 years old or younger [^1166326h]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are the most frequent tendon injury in the adult population. However, the natural history of nonoperatively treated full-thickness tears is poorly defined. Knowledge of the expected evolution in tear size is important when considering nonoperative versus surgical care, especially in relatively young, active patients.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate the size change of nonoperatively treated full-thickness rotator cuff tears over 2 to 3 years' follow-up.

- **Study design**: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: The authors prospectively followed patients 60 years old or younger who had a full-thickness rotator cuff tear equal to or larger than 5 mm, as diagnosed by bilateral shoulder ultrasound, and who were treated nonoperatively. At 2 to 3 years after the index ultrasound examination, a repeat ultrasound examination was performed by the same ultrasonographer. Results of the follow-up ultrasound examinations of both shoulders were compared with those of the index ultrasound examinations for change in rotator cuff tear size. The correlations were examined between these changes and age, sex, history of initial trauma, size of tear on the index ultrasound, and shoulder symptoms.

- **Results**: Fifty-one patients with 61 rotator cuff tears were evaluated. At a follow-up of 25 to 39 months (mean, 29), 49% of the tears (30 tears) increased in size, 43% (26 tears) had not changed, and 8% (5 tears) decreased in size. For 25% (10 shoulders) of initially intact shoulders (41 shoulders), a new full-thickness rotator cuff tear was diagnosed. No correlation was found between these changes and the factors studied.

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^111LCrzf]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) is among the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedures. Several factors — including age, sex, and tear severity — have been identified as predictors for outcome after repair. The influence of the tear etiology on functional and structural outcome remains controversial.

- **Purpose**: To investigate the influence of tear etiology (degenerative vs. traumatic) on functional and structural outcomes in patients with supraspinatus tendon tears.

- **Study design**: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing ARCR from 19 centers were prospectively enrolled between June 2020 and November 2021. Full-thickness, nonmassive tears involving the supraspinatus tendon were included. Tears were classified as degenerative (chronic shoulder pain, no history of trauma) or traumatic (acute, traumatic onset, no previous shoulder pain). Range of motion, strength, the Subjective Shoulder Value, the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), and the Constant-Murley Score (CMS) were assessed before (baseline) and 6 and 12 months after ARCR. The Subjective Shoulder Value and the OSS were also determined at the 24-month follow-up. Repair integrity after 12 months was documented, as well as additional surgeries up to the 24-month follow-up. Tear groups were compared using mixed models adjusted for potential confounding effects.

- **Results**: From a cohort of 973 consecutive patients, 421 patients (degenerative tear, n = 230; traumatic tear, n = 191) met the inclusion criteria. The traumatic tear group had lower mean baseline OSS and CMS scores but showed significant improvement post-surgery.

### Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^117LJi23]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

The arthroscopic operation for the repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears is successful and offers several advantages. These include the inspection of the glenohumeral joint, treatment of intra-articular lesions, smaller incisions, no deltoid detachment, less soft tissue dissection, reduced pain, and more rapid rehabilitation. However, these benefits must be weighed against the technical difficulty of the method, which limits its application to surgeons skilled in both open and arthroscopic shoulder operations.

### Indications for surgery in clinical outcome studies of rotator cuff repair [^113E1GeF]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff are common, but there is no clear consensus regarding indications for rotator cuff surgery. Because some patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears who are asymptomatic or symptomatic can be successfully treated nonoperatively, clinical outcome studies of rotator cuff repair should describe the subjects in detail to allow appropriate interpretation of the results. However, we hypothesized the indications for surgery are poorly described in outcome studies of rotator cuff surgery. We undertook a detailed literature review over 11 years of six major orthopaedic journals to assess whether the indications for surgery were described adequately in studies of rotator cuff repair. Eighty-six papers fit the criteria for the study and were reviewed.

- **Limitations of activities of daily living**: Reported in 31% of papers.
- **Failure of nonoperative treatment**: Reported in 52% of papers.
- **Duration of nonoperative treatment**: Reported in 26% of papers.
- **History of nocturnal pain**: Reported in 16% of papers.

The patients' characteristics and indications for surgery were not described in a majority of clinical outcome studies of rotator cuff repair. It is important for these factors to be considered and reported because, without this information, the reasons for and results of rotator cuff repair are difficult to interpret.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III, prognostic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Arthroscopic repair of full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus: Does the tendon really heal [^1157uNma]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Good functional results have been reported for arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears, but the rate of tendon-to-bone healing is still unknown. Our hypothesis was that arthroscopic repair of full-thickness supraspinatus tears achieves a rate of complete tendon healing equivalent to those reported in the literature with open or mini-open techniques.

- **Methods**: Sixty-five consecutive shoulders with a chronic full-thickness supraspinatus tear were repaired arthroscopically in sixty-five patients using a tension-band suture technique. Patients ranged in age from twenty-nine to seventy-nine years. The average duration of follow-up was twenty-nine months. Fifty-one patients (fifty-one shoulders) had a computed tomographic arthrogram, and fourteen had a magnetic resonance imaging scan, performed between six months and three years after surgery. All patients were assessed regarding function and the strength of shoulder elevation.

- **Results**: The rotator cuff was completely healed and watertight in forty-six (71%) of the sixty-five patients and was partially healed in three. Although the supraspinatus tendon did not heal to the tuberosity in sixteen shoulders, the size of the persistent defect was smaller than the initial tear in fifteen. Sixty-two of the sixty-five patients were satisfied with the result. The Constant score improved from an average (and standard deviation) of 51.6 ± 10.6 points preoperatively to 83.8 ± 10.3 points at the time of the last follow-up evaluation (p < 0.001), and the average University of California at Los Angeles score improved significantly.

### Prognostic factors for successful recovery after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: A systematic literature review [^113JTmwy]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

The systematic literature review aimed to evaluate prognostic factors for successful recovery following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Rotator cuff lesions are common shoulder disorders with a prevalence that increases with age, affecting 13% of individuals over 50 and more than 50% of those over 80. Understanding the factors influencing recovery can improve insights into patient outcomes.

A systematic literature search spanning from 1995 to November 2013 identified studies discussing prognostic factors for recovery post-surgery. Out of an initial 455 studies, 10 were included in the review. Complete tendon healing among patients at final assessment ranged from 60% to 88%.

Twelve prognostic factors, categorized into four groups, were identified as positively influencing recovery:

- **Demographic factors**: Younger age and male gender.
- **Clinical factors**: Higher bone mineral density, absence of diabetes mellitus, higher levels of sports activity, greater preoperative range of motion, and absence of obesity.
- **Cuff integrity factors**: Smaller sagittal size of the cuff lesion, less cuff retraction, less fatty infiltration, and no multiple tendon involvement.

This comprehensive review highlights the complexity and variety of factors influencing recovery after rotator cuff repair, offering valuable insights for medical professionals.

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^1178LmGV]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

It is generally believed that degenerative rotator cuff tears have poorer healing capacity compared to traumatic rotator cuff tears after repair, although the evidence to prove this theory is meager. Tan et al. assessed postoperative tendon integrity in correlation with tear size and did not find any significant differences in retear rates between the traumatic and degenerative groups for each tear size, but did report higher retear rates for larger tears. Similarly, Raman et al. found insufficient evidence for the influence of the cause of tear on postoperative tendon integrity in their systematic review summarizing 490 patients from 3 studies. In line with these published findings, we could not show any significant differences in retear or revision surgery rates between the two groups, which indicates that healing potential is preserved, even in the case of degenerated tendons.

The retear rates for our patient groups were surprisingly low at around 6% when compared with the reported rates of 5% to 92%. Repair failure may be considered a multifactorial issue because of the biological properties of the tendon and biomechanical factors, and expected healing after ARCR correlates with tear size. The retear rate of isolated full-thickness supraspinatus repairs was previously reported to be 13%. Moreover, the relatively younger mean age of our patient groups may also play a role in supporting the healing potential of affected tendons.

- **Strengths and limitations**: We acknowledge the following limitations of our study. Our classification of rotator cuff tears as traumatic was based on su…

### A comparison of outcomes after arthroscopic repair of partial versus small or medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears [^1135VGJ6]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Little is known about the outcomes after repair of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. The aim of this study was to assess the outcome after repair of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears compared with full-thickness tears. Our hypothesis was that repair of partial-thickness tears leads to more shoulder stiffness but fewer retears compared with repair of full-thickness tears.

- **Methods**: A group of 105 consecutive patients who had a full-thickness tear measuring less than 3 cm² was compared with a group of sixty-four patients who had a partial-thickness tear. All tears were repaired with the use of a knotless single-row arthroscopic repair. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and standardized patient and examiner-determined outcomes were obtained preoperatively and at six, twelve, and twenty-four weeks, and at two years after surgery. Rotator cuff integrity was determined by ultrasound examination at six months and two years after surgery.

- **Results**: Examiner-determined postoperative stiffness at six weeks was common in both groups (50% of those with a partial-thickness tear and 47% of those with a full-thickness tear) but decreased compared with preoperative findings in both groups to 21% and 19%, respectively, at three months, and to 15% and 14% at six months. The ultrasound-determined retear rate was small (5% in the partial-thickness group and 10% in the full-thickness group) at six months, but increased to 10% and 20%, respectively, at twenty-four months. The ASES score, patient-determined overall shoulder function, and all pain scores were superior in the…

### Harms-related data are poorly reported among randomized controlled trials underpinning the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline recommendations for rotator cuff injuries [^113hscUP]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Results produced from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) help guide clinical decision-making and health policy. Therefore, it is essential that RCT outcomes, including harms (e.g. adverse events), are adequately reported so that clinicians, patients, and policy makers are equipped with all necessary information to complete a risk-benefit assessment of the RCT's intervention. We evaluated the quality of reporting of harms (e.g. adverse events) in RCTs cited as supporting evidence for recommendations in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Rotator Cuff Injuries clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Extension for Harms Checklist.

- **Methods**: To quantify adherence to CONSORT Extension for Harms items, each RCT was screened for pertinent information satisfying each checklist item. Screening of CPG reference sections for RCTs underpinning CPG recommendations, as well as data extraction from each of the included RCTs, was performed in a blind and duplicate manner. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals, were used to summarize overall percent adherence to checklist items. A linear regression model assessed the relationship of CONSORT Harms reporting over time.

- **Results**: Ninety-nine RCTs were included in our final sample. Fifty-seven RCTs (of 99; 57.6%) were conducted at a single center. Common funding sources included private (non-industry) (17/99; 17.2%), private (industry) (8/99; 8.1%), and public (7/99; 7.1%) sources.

### Repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients aged younger than 55 years [^112wGcr7]. Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the available evidence regarding clinical outcomes after open or arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in young patients.

Medline, PubMed, and Embase were reviewed to find all studies examining full-thickness rotator cuff repairs in patients aged younger than 55 years and with a minimum of 1 year of follow-up.

We found 7 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The mean patient age was 41.7 years (range, 16.2 to 54 years), and the mean time from injury was 66.1 months. Eighty-one percent of the included patients had a traumatic tear. The rotator cuff repair was supplemented by acromioplasty in 96.6% of patients, distal clavicle resection in 34.6%, and biceps tenodesis in 16.1%. Postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment was the most commonly reported outcome score, with a mean postoperative score of 82.0 (4 studies). Improvement was shown in all studies that reported on postoperative strength. All studies that assessed pain showed an improvement in the postoperative setting. Overall, 82% of the shoulders had satisfactory results.

Full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients aged younger than 55 years are mostly traumatic in origin and respond well to open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, as shown by good patient-reported outcomes, significant pain relief, improvement in strength, and high satisfaction postoperatively.

### Full-thickness rotator cuff tear prevalence and correlation with function and co-morbidities in patients sixty-five years and older [^115jbghN]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients aged 65 and older and to correlate these tears with comfort, function, and co-morbidities. Two hundred shoulders without prior surgery were evaluated using a Simple Shoulder Test, a Constant Score, and ultrasound. Full-thickness tear prevalence was found to be 22%. After adjusting for age and gender, those with tears had lower scores than those without (P < .001 for each). With a 10-year increase in age, the odds of having a tear increased 2.69-fold (P = 0.005). Among participants with tears, there was no difference in scores between those who had seen a physician for their shoulder and those who had not. The prevalence of full-thickness cuff tears was 22% in individuals aged 65 and above, with tear prevalence increasing with age. Shoulder scores were poorer for individuals with tears.

### Partial-thickness rotator cuff tears [^112Vsnns]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Partial-thickness tears of the rotator cuff have been diagnosed with increased frequency due to heightened awareness among clinicians and improved diagnostic methods. Research into the causes, natural history, and optimal treatment of this condition lags behind that of full-thickness tears. However, despite the limitations in the existing literature, a consensus has emerged among shoulder experts that partial-thickness rotator cuff tears should be aggressively treated in active athletes. This is due to the unfavorable natural history of these lesions and the success of accepted surgical algorithms.

This review will provide an overview of the theories regarding the origins of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, discuss the relative accuracy of accepted diagnostic techniques, and summarize the indications and methods of operative repair, with an emphasis on the results of various treatment approaches.

### An isolated bioinductive repair vs sutured repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tears: 2-year results of a double blinded, randomized controlled trial [^1156V3Gx]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Partial-thickness rotator cuff tears treated with an isolated bioinductive repair (IBR) instead of a completion-and-repair have shown complete healing. This treatment option is possible due to the structural integrity of the remaining tendon, which is similar to that present in small/medium full-thickness tears (FTTs) when the rotator cable remains intact. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated whether an IBR for small/medium full-thickness tears resulted in superior healing and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) compared with a sutured repair.

- **Methods**: This prospective, double-blinded (patients and outcome assessors), single-center randomized controlled trial enrolled patients ≥ 18 years with a small/medium (≤ 2.5 cm) full thickness supraspinatus tear and intact rotator cable. Patients were randomized and blinded to arthroscopic transosseous-equivalent repair (control, n = 30) or IBR (n = 30). The primary outcome was tendon quality on biopsy at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were PROs (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES], Constant-Murley Shoulder [CMS], and pain visual analogue scale scores) along with tendon thickness and healing measured via MRI at 6, 12, and 24 months; satisfaction at 12 and 24 months; and time to return to work.

- **Results**: Baseline demographic, tear, and surgical characteristics were comparable between the groups (IBR: mean age, 54.2 years, 14 male; control: mean age, 56.4 years, 16 male). Measured via a 6-month biopsy, highly organized, parallel bundles of collagen without inflammation were present in all IBR patients, whereas poorly organized structure was found in the control group.

### Are delayed operations effective for patients with rotator cuff tears and concomitant stiffness? An analysis of immediate versus delayed surgery on outcomes [^112dFfVN]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of immediate rotator cuff repair with capsular release and those of rotator cuff repair after the stiffness was treated with rehabilitative therapy.

- **Methods**: Between June 2007 and December 2010, we recruited 63 patients with rotator cuff tears and stiffness. In 33 patients, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed with capsular release simultaneously (group I). In 30 patients, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed after 6 months of preoperative rehabilitation for stiffness (group II). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test score, Constant score, and visual analog scale score for pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed at the start of the study; at 3, 6, and 12 months; and at the last visit. The postoperative cuff tendon integrity was assessed between 6 and 12 months using magnetic resonance or ultrasound images.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences in preoperative demographic data between the groups (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 21.54 months. After treatment, there was significant improvement in ROM and functional scores in both groups, as measured at the last follow-up (P > .05). On assessment of the magnetic resonance or ultrasound images taken 6 to 12 months postoperatively, the retear rate for the repaired cuff tendon in each group was 12.1% in group I and 13.4% in group II.

- **Conclusions**: In the treatment of rotator cuff tears with concomitant stiffness, both immediate and delayed surgical strategies yield similar improvements in ROM and functional outcomes.

### Effects of 12 weeks of progressive early active exercise therapy after surgical rotator cuff repair: 12 weeks and 1-year results from the CUT-N-MOVE randomized controlled trial [^113k3ByC]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears are typically managed surgically, followed by rehabilitation, but the load progression to reach an optimal clinical outcome during postoperative rehabilitation is unknown.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate whether there was a superior effect of 12 weeks of progressive active exercise therapy on shoulder function, pain, and quality of life compared with usual care.

- **Study design**: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

- **Methods**: Patients with surgically repaired traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were recruited from two orthopedic departments and randomized to progressive active exercise therapy (PR) or limited passive exercise therapy (UC [usual care]). The primary outcome was the change in the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) score between groups from before surgery to 12 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes included changes in the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire score, pain, range of motion, and strength. Adverse events were registered during the intervention period.

- **Results**: A total of 82 patients were randomized to the PR (n = 41) or UC (n = 41) group. All 82 patients (100%) participated in the 12-week assessment and 79 in the 1-year follow-up. At 12 weeks, there was no significant difference between the groups in the change in the WORC score from baseline adjusted for age, sex, and center (physical symptoms: P = 0.834; sports and recreation: P = 0.723; work: P = 0.541; lifestyle: P = 0.508; emotions: P = 0.568). Additionally, there was no between-group difference for

### Arthroscopic management of isolated partial-thickness rotator cuff tears [^1178zfn6]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study is to provide a comprehensive review on the surgical outcomes following arthroscopic treatments of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears (PT-RCTs) and to compare the postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score following in situ transtendon repair and tear completion, followed by repair.

Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, and CENTRAL bibliographic databases were searched. Papers including patients with PT-RCTs of any grade who underwent treatment using debridement, in situ transtendon repair, tear completion and repair, or bioinductive collagen implants were reviewed. Primary PT-RCTs were the sole indication for surgery. Primary postoperative outcomes assessed included: the ASES score, the Absolute Constant-Murley score, the Simple Shoulder Test, the Visual Analogue Scale, the University of California-Los Angeles Shoulder Scale, the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Score, range of motion, complications, and revisions. A meta-analysis of comparative studies compared the postoperative ASES score between patients treated with in situ transtendon repair versus tear completion repair.

Twenty-eight studies were included. The ASES score was reported by four comparative studies with contrasting results. The heterogeneity was high (I² = 86%), and effect sizes ranged from -0.49 in favor of the tear completion and repair technique to an effect size of +1.07 favoring in situ transtendon repair. The overall effect size of 0.02 suggests an equivalence between the two techniques in terms of the ASES score.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON shoulder prospective cohort [^111khfmq]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

- **Population demographics**: A total of 2,233 patients with RCTs were identified during the enrollment period (January 17, 2007, to September 23, 2010). Of these, 1,280 were excluded for the following reasons: acute traumatic tears (38%), previous surgery (11%), bilateral disease (8%), neck disorders (6%), frozen shoulder (2%), dislocation (3%), rheumatoid disease (1%), and/or fracture (1%). Of the remaining 953 patients eligible to enroll in the study, 452 (47%) elected to do so. These 452 patients were followed as a prospective cohort, with rolling entry into the study. Of this group, 20 patients withdrew from the study soon after enrollment and did not contribute longitudinal follow-up, leaving a sample of 432 patients.

Of the 432 patients available for analysis, 37 (9%) died before the end of the 10-year follow-up period and 40 others (9%) were lost to follow-up; thus, a total of 355 patients (82%) were included for the final analyses. Of these, 115 (27%) were known to have undergone surgery at some point during the 10-year follow-up period. Operative details were available for 105 of these patients.

Demographics of the cohort are detailed in previous reports. The mean age of the study population was 62.6 years (range, 31 to 90 years), with 51% men and 49% women. The dominant arm was affected in 68% of patients, and the right arm was affected in 70%. The population was predominantly White (86%), Black (8%), or Asian (3%). Many patients had comorbidities, with hypertension, back pain, and osteoarthritis being the most common. Most patients (90%) were nonsmokers.

### Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears in older adults: A retrospective case-series study [^1176tPUs]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

During the past decade, surgeons have shown increasing enthusiasm for the arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears (RCTs). This enthusiasm has been driven by several factors, including advancements in surgical techniques, suturing materials, and perioperative patient care. Older individuals now maintain more active lifestyles than in the past, necessitating management plans that promote increased activity. Additionally, the introduction of reverse shoulder arthroplasty as a salvage procedure for unsuccessful repairs may have encouraged surgeons to pursue arthroscopic repair, even in more complicated RCTs.

Comparison of outcomes after arthroscopic repair of RCTs between young and older patients has been extensively discussed in the literature. Hsieh et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, examining 1,244 papers. From these, they included five non-randomized controlled trials of fair quality, comprising 671 participants (197 older patients and 474 younger patients). They found no significant differences between older and younger patients concerning improvements in Constant score, retear rate, or other outcomes such as pain level improvement, muscle power, and shoulder range of motion.

Conversely, Meng et al. explored the feasibility of repairing RCTs in patients over 75 years. They conducted a systematic review involving 249 shoulders operated arthroscopically, revealing significant improvements in clinical and functional scores (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Constant scores), postoperative pain, and patient satisfaction. Similar findings were reported by Fos…

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON Shoulder prospective cohort [^111kq92U]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). Low credibility.

Low patient expectations regarding the efficacy of physical therapy were the most powerful predictor of early surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 16.86; 95% confidence interval, 4.94 to 57.59). Other less impactful predictors included patient education, the amount of rotator cuff tear retraction, smoking, and activity level. Among patients who underwent surgery between 6 months and 10 years, patient expectations were less important, whereas Workers' Compensation status (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.44 to 8.58) and activity level (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.81) were more important.

- **Predictors of early surgery**: This graph reflects the characteristics of patients who underwent surgery within 6 months of enrollment. The strength of each predictor is reflected by its position on the x-axis. Predictors to the right of the vertical red line were significant (p < 0.05). Significant predictors of early surgery include smoking, Workers' Compensation status, the amount of tear retraction (see Figure 4), activity level, and patient expectations. The strongest predictor in this group, by far, was the patient's expectations regarding the effectiveness of physical therapy.

- **Predictors of later surgery (6 months to 10 years)**: This graph reflects the characteristics of patients who underwent surgery after 6 months of enrollment. The strength of each predictor is reflected by its position on the x-axis. Predictors to the right of the vertical red line were significant (p < 0.05). Significant predictors of later surgery include…

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: Systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^1117PRwF]. Anaesthesia (2019). High credibility.

Why was this guideline developed?

Rotator cuff repair surgery is associated with significant postoperative pain, and effective pain control can improve early postoperative rehabilitation. The aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with an evidence-based approach to pain management after rotator cuff repair, which should improve postoperative pain relief.

### Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears in older adults: A retrospective case-series study [^11627oza]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

There is ongoing debate about the optimal treatment plan for older individuals with rotator cuff tears (RCTs). Parameters such as tendon substance quality, retear risk, and functional demands and gains have been discussed as treatment outcomes.

In a recently published systematic review, Hsieh et al. found no significant differences between older and younger patients after arthroscopic repair of RCTs for functional improvement, retear rate, pain level improvement, muscle power, and shoulder range of motion. Similarly, Nolte et al. and Altintas et al. observed that healthy older patients without significant comorbidities who wish to return to an active lifestyle could benefit equally from arthroscopic repair as their younger counterparts. Chronological age did not seem to be an independent risk factor for failure; however, comorbidities associated with age might be. Therefore, these authors considered patient selection a crucial component dictating successful outcomes.

Nevertheless, there is a study that identified older age, as an independent factor, contributing to an increased risk of healing failure after early arthroscopic repair in patients with trauma-related full-thickness rotator cuff tears. In clinical practice, older patients who do not respond well to non-surgical management are still considered good candidates for operative treatment, even in the absence of adequate evidence. Surgeons often choose to operate on these patients due to the long-term consequences of untreated symptomatic RCTs, which tend to increase in size and may lead to shoulder rotator cuff tear arthropathy.

### Minimum 10-year outcomes after arthroscopic repair of partial-thickness supraspinatus rotator cuff tears [^113a4sFw]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The prevalence of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears (PTRCTs) has been reported to be 13% to 40% within the adult population, accounting for 70% of all rotator cuff tears. Approximately 29% of PTRCTs will progress to full-thickness tears if left untreated. The long-term clinical course after arthroscopic repair of PTRCTs is not well known.

- **Purpose**: To investigate minimum 10-year patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) of the supraspinatus tendon and to report reoperation and complication rates.

- **Study design**: Case series; level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: Patients were included who underwent arthroscopic RCR of a PTRCT performed by a single surgeon between October 2005 and October 2011. Arthroscopic RCR was performed with a transtendon repair of partial, articular-sided supraspinatus tendon avulsions, bursal-sided repair, or conversion into a full-thickness tear and repair. PRO data were collected preoperatively and at a minimum 10 years postoperatively. PRO measures included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, the shortened version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (QuickDASH), the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary, and patient satisfaction. Subanalyses were performed to determine if tear location or age was associated with outcomes. Retears, revision surgery, and surgical complications were recorded.

- **Results**: In total, 33 patients (21 men, 12 women) at a mean age of 50 years (range, 23–68) met criteria for inclusion.

### Management of failed rotator cuff repair in young patients [^1135H6u7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Management of failed rotator cuff repair can be particularly challenging in young patients. Various nonmodifiable and modifiable patient factors, including age, tendon quality, rotator cuff tear characteristics, acute or chronic rotator cuff tear, bone quality, tobacco use, and medications, impact rotator cuff repair healing.

Surgical variables such as the technique, timing, tension on the repair, biomechanical construct, fixation, and postoperative rehabilitation strategy also influence healing outcomes. Although variable outcomes have been reported in patients undergoing revision rotator cuff repair, a systematic surgical approach may increase the likelihood of a successful outcome.

Numerous cellular and mechanical biologic augments, including platelet-rich plasma, platelet-rich fibrin matrix, mesenchymal stem cells, and acellular dermal matrix grafts, have been utilized in rotator cuff repair. However, conflicting or inconclusive outcomes have been observed in patients undergoing revision rotator cuff repair with these augments.

A variety of tendon transfer options are available for managing massive irreparable rotator cuff tears, including latissimus dorsi, teres major, lower trapezius, pectoralis minor, pectoralis major, combined pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, and combined latissimus dorsi and teres major. Ultimately, optimizing surgical techniques and using appropriate biologic or tendon transfer techniques, when indicated, is the best method for managing failed rotator cuff repairs.

### Editorial commentary: Repair is efficacious for acute rotator cuff tears in patients over 65 despite advanced age, and early repair is better [^112iZYYB]. Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

Although indications for rotator cuff repair are still controversial, common practice favors a more aggressive approach with surgery as a first-line treatment in patients with acute rotator cuff tears. Both functional outcomes and healing improve with earlier repair, and a healed tendon can limit the progression of permanent degenerative changes, including tear progression, fatty infiltration, and progression to cuff tear arthropathy. But what about elderly patients? For those who are physically and medically fit for surgery, there may still be a benefit to earlier surgical repair. For those not physically or medically fit for surgery, or those who decline, a short trial of conservative care followed by repair for those who fail conservative treatment remains efficacious.

### Fifteen-year results of a comparative analysis of tendon repair versus physiotherapy for small-to-medium-sized rotator cuff tears: A concise follow-up of previous reports [^112ZKZe5]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). Low credibility.

- **Surgical procedures and postoperative management**: Tendon repair was performed using a mini-open or open approach, with the patient in the beach-chair position. Following diagnostic arthroscopy, the tear was exposed through a deltoid-splitting approach. An acromioplasty was performed as described by Neer. The rotator cuff was mobilized until coverage of the footprint was achieved. The footprint was prepared to bleeding bone, and a tendon-to-bone repair was performed with transosseous sutures using a Mason-Allen technique. Tenodesis of the long head of the biceps to the intertubercular sulcus was performed when the tendon was found to be degenerated or partially torn. A detailed description of the surgical method was previously reported. Postoperatively, the arm was immobilized in a sling for 5 to 6 weeks, and passive range-of-motion exercises were started immediately. Active range-of-motion exercises were initiated 6 weeks after surgery and were supplemented by strengthening exercises after 12 weeks.

- **Physiotherapy**: The physiotherapy group received outpatient treatment at our hospital from four physiotherapists experienced in shoulder rehabilitation. A previously reported rehabilitation program, which was individually adapted, was followed. During the first 12 weeks, treatment sessions of 40 minutes were given twice weekly, with decreasing frequency during the following 6 to 12 weeks. No supplementary treatment measures, such as anti-inflammatory or analgesic medication, were given.

- **Secondary surgery**: Patients with insufficient progress after at least 15 physiotherapy sessions were considered for secondary surgery.

### Full-thickness rotator cuff tears: What is the rate of tear progression? A systematic review [^114YmC9A]. Arthroscopy (2019). High credibility.

To systematically review the literature and determine the rate of radiographic tear progression of nonoperatively treated full-thickness rotator cuff tears, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically reviewed. English-language studies of Level I through IV evidence examining chronic, full-thickness rotator cuff tears in adults were included, while partial-thickness tears were excluded. Rotator cuff tears were analyzed according to the presence or absence of symptoms. The primary outcome was radiographic tear progression, defined as an increase in tear size of 5 mm or greater on magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound.

Eight studies were included for statistical analysis, and 411 tears were analyzed for progression. No difference in the rate of tear progression was detected between the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups (40.6% at 46.8 months and 34.1% at 37.8 months, respectively; p = 0.65). Calculation of the number needed to treat showed that for an 8% retear rate at 2-year follow-up, approximately 7 patients with rotator cuff tears would have to undergo operative repair to prevent 1 tear from progressing radiographically.

This study showed that with the data available, asymptomatic and symptomatic rotator cuff tears carry similar rates of tear progression over time. Most of these tears will not progress significantly over short- to intermediate-term follow-up.

### Arthroscopic repair of medium to large full-thickness rotator cuff tears: Outcome at 2- to 6-year follow-up [^115hW5zB]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Medium-term follow-up of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was evaluated in 48 consecutive arthroscopic repairs of medium to large rotator cuff tears. The mean rotator cuff tear size was 2.4 cm (range, 2–4 cm), the mean age at surgery was 57.6 years (range, 38–80 years), and the mean follow-up was 39 months (range, 24–66 months). The mean University of California at Los Angeles End-Result Scores were 17.2 preoperatively and 33.7 postoperatively (P < 0.001). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons mean scores were 42.2 and 94.9, respectively. There were no complications requiring reoperation. The results showed 35 excellent, 11 good, 2 fair, and no poor outcomes; however, 1 patient presented clinical evidence of a failed repair. Satisfaction was reported by 44 of 45 patients (47/48 repairs) with their results.

### The natural history of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in randomized controlled trials: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116myXMQ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are the most common tendon injury in the adult population, resulting in substantial morbidity. The optimum management for these patients is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the overall treatment response to all interventions in full-thickness rotator cuff tears among patients enrolled in randomized clinical trials.

This systematic review and meta-analysis utilized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified through a systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINHAL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Participants were aged 18 years or older with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Constant shoulder score from baseline to 52 weeks. A meta-analysis to assess treatment response was calculated via the standardized mean change in scores.

A total of 57 RCTs were included in the study. The pooled standardized mean change compared with baseline was 1.42 (95% CI, 0.80–2.04) at 3 months, 2.73 (95% CI, 1.06–4.40) at 6 months, and 3.18 (95% CI, 1.64–4.71) at 12 months. Graphic plots of treatment response demonstrated a sustained improvement in outcomes in nonoperative trial arms and all operative subgroup arms.

The conclusion drawn from this study is that patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears show a consistent pattern of improvement in the Constant score with both nonoperative and operative care. The natural history of patients with rotator cuff tears included in RCTs is to improve over time, whether treated operatively or nonoperatively.

### Position statement: Management of rotator cuff tears in adults [^1169yhmy]. Canadian Journal of Surgery. Journal Canadien de Chirurgie (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for rotator cuff disorders, specifically in the context of rotator cuff repair, technical considerations are important. The CSES 2023 guidelines recommend considering partial arthroscopic cuff repair, latissimus dorsi transfer, lower trapezius transfer, or superior capsular reconstruction in patients with massive tears of the rotator cuff.
