## Question

can metformin be used in esrd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether metformin can be used in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how ESRD is defined and what eGFR threshold that corresponds to. Then, I should verify the most authoritative guideline positions and FDA labeling. Next, I will examine the evidence base, including observational data and any trials that ventured into advanced CKD. After that, I need to check for any exceptions, such as dialysis-specific considerations or low-dose strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline safer alternatives for glycemic control in ESRD.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on the wrong threshold. ESRD is generally equated with CKD stage 5, which corresponds to eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m², or the need for chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, and this is the context in which metformin's renal clearance becomes most problematic [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance. KDIGO 2022 recommends initiating metformin in T2DM with CKD only when eGFR is at least 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and explicitly advises stopping metformin when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with no safety data supporting use below that level, which directly excludes ESRD from approved use [^cfde05b6] [^d7699c4a]. The FDA labeling aligns with this, stating metformin is contraindicated when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and this contraindication is reflected across multiple metformin-containing products and combinations, including dapagliflozin/metformin and saxagliptin/metformin, reinforcing that ESRD is off-label and contraindicated territory [^390608ba] [^922c9018] [^18cb3d4e] [^919c03d3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking the evidence base. I need to check whether any high-quality data contradict this. The JAMA systematic review concluded that while metformin appears safe down to eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m², there are no randomized trials supporting safety below 30, and observational signals suggest possible harm in advanced CKD, which supports the conservative stance in ESRD [^5f128656]. A large Taiwanese cohort in patients with stage 5 CKD showed increased all-cause mortality with metformin use, and although confounded, it strengthens the precautionary principle in ESRD [^405d8f5f]. Conversely, a recent target-trial emulation suggested that continuing metformin after incident stage 4 CKD might be associated with better survival, but that study did not isolate ESRD and is vulnerable to residual confounding, so I should be cautious about extrapolating it to eGFR less than 15 or dialysis patients [^40fe1670].

> I should double-check whether any exceptions or low-dose strategies are endorsed. Some authors have proposed very low-dose metformin (for example, 500 mg once daily) in carefully selected patients with eGFR 15–30 mL/min/1.73 m², but this remains off-label, not supported by prospective safety trials, and is not endorsed by KDIGO or FDA, so it cannot be recommended as standard care in ESRD [^f1045941]. Mechanistically, metformin is renally cleared and accumulates as GFR declines, and while lactate levels may remain modest in stable moderate CKD, the risk calculus shifts unfavorably in ESRD where clearance is minimal and intercurrent illness is common [^5f128656] [^097574bb].

> Let me consider the risk–benefit balance in ESRD specifically. The potential benefit of glycemic control must be weighed against the lack of proven safety and the plausible risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis in the setting of minimal renal clearance, frequent infections, and hemodynamic instability; given the absence of supportive randomized data and the existence of a mortality signal in stage 5 CKD, the balance favors avoidance in ESRD [^405d8f5f] [^5f128656]. I should confirm that this aligns with broader diabetes-in-CKD principles: in advanced CKD, glycemic targets are generally relaxed to mitigate hypoglycemia, and agents with low hypoglycemia risk are prioritized, which further reduces the urgency to expose patients to metformin in ESRD [^notfound].

> Next, I should review safer, guideline-concordant alternatives for ESRD. Insulin remains the mainstay because dosing can be adjusted to dialysis schedules and nutritional intake, and hypoglycemia risk can be mitigated with close monitoring; GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven cardiovascular benefit can be considered in selected patients, and SGLT2 inhibitors are generally not used for glycemic control in ESRD due to limited efficacy, though some agents have outcome trials extending into lower eGFR ranges for cardiorenal protection rather than glucose lowering [^fe32f368] [^944f3594]. Hold on, I should verify the SGLT2 point: dapagliflozin has evidence down to eGFR around 20–25 in CKD outcome trials, but that is distinct from using it for glycemic control in ESRD, so I need to be clear that SGLT2 use in ESRD is not for HbA1c lowering and is not a substitute for metformin in this context [^f26c57a9] [^944f3594].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Metformin should not be used in ESRD because eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², there is no supportive safety evidence in this population, and both KDIGO and FDA classify it as contraindicated or not recommended; if a patient with T2DM progresses to ESRD while on metformin, it should be discontinued and alternative therapy instituted, with insulin as the principal option and GLP-1 RAs considered selectively for cardiovascular benefit and low hypoglycemia risk [^cfde05b6] [^390608ba] [^fe32f368].

---

Metformin is **contraindicated in ESRD** (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis) due to the risk of lactic acidosis from drug accumulation [^390608ba] [^922c9018]. Current guidelines and FDA labeling advise stopping metformin when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and explicitly prohibit use in ESRD [^e83ab58b] [^cfde05b6] [^390608ba]. Although a few observational studies suggest possible benefit with very low doses, there is **insufficient evidence** to support routine use in ESRD, and metformin should be avoided in this population [^405d8f5f] [^40fe1670] [^f1045941].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and risk of lactic acidosis

Metformin is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys; as renal function declines, plasma levels rise and the risk of lactic acidosis increases [^5f128656]. In ESRD, **accumulation is significant**, and even low doses can reach unsafe levels [^097574bb]. Lactic acidosis is rare but potentially fatal, with mortality up to 50% in some series [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **FDA guidance**: Metformin is contraindicated in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², including those with ESRD or on dialysis [^390608ba] [^922c9018].
- **KDIGO 2022**: Recommends metformin only if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; no recommendation for ESRD due to lack of safety data [^cfde05b6] [^d7699c4a].
- **AACE 2022**: Contraindicates use if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^7d1f0b31].

---

## Observational evidence

Observational studies suggest potential benefits with low-dose metformin in advanced CKD, but **evidence is limited and conflicting**:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Taiwan cohort (2015) | Stage 5 CKD (eGFR < 15) | Increased mortality with metformin; dose-dependent risk [^405d8f5f] |
| Scottish emulation (2025) | Stage 4 CKD (eGFR < 30) | Lower mortality with continued metformin; residual confounding possible [^40fe1670] |
| Small PK study (2018) | CKD stages 3–4 | Low-dose regimens kept metformin within "safe" levels; no lactic acidosis; small study [^c8cf9f59] |

---

## Current clinical practice

In practice, metformin is **generally discontinued** when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and alternative therapies (insulin, GLP-1 RAs, or SGLT2 inhibitors where appropriate) are used [^d9dca727] [^fe32f368]. Very low-dose metformin (e.g. 500 mg every other day) has been explored in select cases, but this remains off-label and unsupported by robust evidence [^f1045941].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Metformin is **contraindicated in ESRD** because of the risk of lactic acidosis from accumulation; it should be stopped when eGFR drops below 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Although observational data suggest potential benefit with very low doses, there is insufficient evidence to support routine use in ESRD. Clinicians should use alternative therapies and reserve metformin only for exceptional cases with close monitoring and shared decision-making.

### Could metformin be used in patients with diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease? [^25b305f9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an important cause of end stage renal failure worldwide. As renal impairment progresses, managing hyperglycaemia can prove increasingly challenging, as many medications are contra-indicated in moderate to severe renal impairment. Whilst evidence for tight glycaemic control reducing progression to renal failure in patients with established renal disease is limited, poor glycaemic control is not desirable, and is likely to lead to progressive complications. Metformin is a first-line therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes, as it appears to be effective in reducing diabetes related end points and mortality in overweight patients. Cessation of metformin in patients with progressive renal disease may not only lead to deterioration in glucose control, but also to loss of protection from cardiovascular disease in a cohort of patients at particularly high risk. We advocate the need for further study to determine the role of metformin in patients with severe renal disease (chronic kidney disease stage 4–5), as well as patients on dialysis, or pre-/peri-renal transplantation. We explore possible roles of metformin in these circumstances, and suggest potential key areas for further study.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^d7b3cf2b]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Table 1
Proposed recommendations for use of metformin based on eGFR

Without question, such a treatment program could not be implemented without meticulous clinical follow-up, clear communication with patients regarding risks and benefits of therapy, and adherence to frequent monitoring. The plan, therefore, should be modified in patients with suboptimal adherence to medical instructions or regular follow-up. It is clear that vigilance would be required so that cases of lactic acidosis do not emerge because of inappropriate use of metformin in patients with more advanced and/or unstable CKD.

Given the frequency with which clinicians must decide whether to continue or initiate metformin in mild-to-moderate CKD, these recommendations would have a profound impact on clinical practice. Such proposals, being consistent with the sentiments of several well-respected national guideline committees, should be reviewed by professional medical organizations in the U.S. such as the American Diabetes Association. If a consensus emerges, perhaps the Food and Drug Administration might reconsider the current metformin-prescribing guidelines, which, like those of other nonbranded compounds, tend to remain static despite emerging evidence and changes in clinical care.

In the future, more research in this important area is needed, including prospective, randomized trials of metformin at varying degrees of renal impairment and/or closer examination of registries of CKD patients receiving metformin.

Background

Metformin has been used in the management of diabetes for decades. It is an effective, low-cost intervention with a well-established safety profile. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin targets a number of pathways that lead to chronic kidney damage, and long-term use may, therefore, slow the rate of kidney function decline and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of metformin therapy on kidney function decline in patients with CKD with or without diabetes mellitus and assess the safety and dose tolerability in this population.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2023 with assistance from an Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported kidney-related outcomes with a minimum duration of 12 months delivery of the metformin intervention and whose eligibility criteria included adult participants with either i) a diagnosis of CKD of any aetiology and/or ii) those with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Comparisons included placebo, no intervention, non-pharmacological interventions, other antidiabetic medications or any other active control. Studies that included patients on any modality of kidney replacement therapy were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out data extraction using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

This review included 11 studies reporting on 8449 randomised participants. Studies were conducted in patient populations with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) (four studies) or diabetes mellitus (seven studies). Six studies compared metformin with no active control, four studies compared metformin with active controls (rosiglitazone, glyburide, pioglitazone, or glipizide), and one study included treatment arms that randomised to either metformin, diet and lifestyle modifications, or other antidiabetic therapies. The risk of bias in included studies varied; two studies were abstract-only publications and were judged to have a high risk of bias in most domains. Other included publications were judged to have a low risk of bias in most domains. Across comparisons, GRADE evaluations for most outcomes were judged as low or very low certainty, except for those relating to side effects, tolerance, and withdrawals, which were judged as moderate certainty. The evidence suggests that compared to placebo, metformin may result in i) a slightly smaller decline in kidney function (3 studies, 505 participants: MD 1.92 mL/min, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.51; I² = 0%; low certainty), ii) very uncertain effects on the incidence of kidney failure (1 study, 753 participants: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.17 to 8.49), iii) little or no effect on death (3 studies, 865 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), iv) little or no effect on the incidence of serious adverse events (3 studies, 576 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), and v) likely higher incidence of intolerance leading to study withdrawal than placebo (4 studies, 646 participants: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.27; I² = 0%; moderate certainty). The certainty of the evidence for proteinuria was very uncertain. Compared to other active controls (rosiglitazone, glyburide, pioglitazone, or glipizide), metformin i) demonstrated very uncertain effects on kidney function decline, ii) may result in little or no difference in death (3 studies, 5608 participants: RR 0.95 95% CI 0.63 to 1.43; I² = 0%; low certainty), iii) probably results in little or no difference in intolerance leading to study withdrawal (3 studies, 5593 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.08; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), iv) probably results in little or no difference in the incidence of serious adverse events (2 studies, 5545 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.71; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), and v) may increase the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (2 studies, 3836 participants: MD 14.61, 95% CI 8.17 to 21.05; I² = 0%; low certainty). No studies reported the incidence of kidney failure.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlights the lack of RCTs reporting on the effects of metformin on kidney function, particularly in patients with CKD. Future research in this field requires adequately powered RCTs comparing metformin to placebo or standard care in those with CKD. Seven ongoing studies were identified in this review, and future updates, including their findings, may further inform the results of this review.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, metformin, ERBP 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate metformin in a dose adapted to renal function as a first-line agent when lifestyle measures alone are insufficient to get HbA1c in the desired range.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^9d517385]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A common clinical conundrum faces all U.S. practitioners treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Today's U.S. Food and Drug Administration prescribing guidelines for metformin contraindicate its use in men and women with serum creatinine concentrations ≥ 1.5 and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL (≥ 132 and ≥ 123 µmol/L), respectively. In a patient tolerating and controlled with this medication, should it automatically be discontinued as the creatinine rises beyond these cut points over time? Stopping metformin often results in poorly controlled glycemia and/or the need for other agents with their own adverse-effect profiles. Moreover, is the now widespread use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in lieu of serum creatinine levels creating even more confusion, especially in those with abnormalities in one but not the other indirect measure of renal function? Indeed, more than a decade and a half after metformin became available in the U.S. debate continues over the best approach in these settings. How many patients are unable to receive this medication on the basis of guidelines which, although well intentioned, are somewhat arbitrary and outdated based on modern assessments of renal status?

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^e08e8313]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 2 — Management of hyperglycemia and general diabetes care in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — research recommendations emphasize determining effects of glycemic control on early and late GFR loss and health outcomes of CKD, including evaluating different levels of glycemic control to optimize safety and clinical outcomes such as survival, hospitalization, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in advanced CKD and/or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). They also propose performing validation studies of HbA1c, glycated albumin, and other long-term glycemic markers in patients with diabetes and various stages of CKD, and assessing metformin safety in CKD stages 4 and 5.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^21e1ef4d]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Despite these appropriate concerns, most of the available data would suggest that, on average, eGFR declines slowly in diabetes, although it can be accelerated to some degree in the presence of albuminuria. If eGFR is calculated annually (and more frequently in those at high risk for deterioration in renal function), it is unlikely that patients will experience changes in their eGFR levels large enough to rapidly alter the safety of metformin therapy.

### The long-term effects of metformin on patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease [^6632d190]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Metformin is the first pharmacological option for treating type 2 diabetes. However, the use of this drug is not recommended in individuals with impaired kidney function because of the perceived risk of lactic acidosis. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 10,426 patients with type 2 DKD from two tertiary hospitals. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) progression. The secondary outcome was metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Taking into account the possibility that patients with less severe disease were prescribed metformin, propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted.

Results

All-cause mortality and incident ESRD were lower in the metformin group according to the multivariate Cox analysis. Because the two groups had significantly different baseline characteristics, PSM was performed. After matching, metformin usage was still associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.65; 95% CI 0.57–0.73; P < 0.001) and ESRD progression (aHR 0.67; 95% CI 0.58–0.77; P < 0.001). Only one event of metformin-associated lactic acidosis was recorded. In both the original and PSM groups, metformin usage did not increase the risk of lactic acidosis events from all causes (aHR 0.92; 95% CI 0.668–1.276; P = 0.629).

Conclusions

In the present retrospective study, metformin usage in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially those with CKD 3B, decreased the risk of all-cause mortality and incident ESRD. Additionally, metformin did not increase the risk of lactic acidosis. However, considering the remaining biases even after PSM, further randomized controlled trials are needed to change real-world practice.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^eaa8fbfc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Limited data specifically address metformin's long-term safety in patients with mild-to-moderate renal failure. These studies found no increased risks in various degrees of renal insufficiency but were limited by small size and significant methodological shortcomings. Recently, an analysis of the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health Registry suggests that the proposed cardiovascular benefits of metformin may extend to patients with established atherosclerosis and moderate CKD. In this large, observational study of > 19,000 subjects with a history of atherothrombotic disease, 1,572 patients were using metformin with eGFR 30–60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. After adjustment for baseline factors and propensity score, metformin use was associated with a significant reduction in 2-year mortality in the overall population (hazard ratio 0.76 [95% CI 0.65–0.89]), including in those with moderate CKD (0.64 [0.48–0.86]). However, lack of information with respect to the duration of metformin use and HbA 1c, as well as the observational nature of the study, require further confirmation of the mortality benefit in similar patient cohorts in prospective trials.

Although these data are reassuring, we must note that there are no randomized clinical trials that specifically evaluated the safety of metformin use and potential cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Although metformin is eliminated renally, and accumulation may conceivably lead to lactic acidosis, there currently is limited systematic evidence to substantiate continued reliance on the creatinine-based contraindications in use in the U.S. Indeed, in the modern era of eGFR, this measure of glomerular filtration appears to give a more reliable estimate of renal dysfunction. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is exceedingly rare based on the available literature, and even though the use of metformin has not been comprehensively assessed in individuals with CKD, there is extensive evidence that this agent often is used without adverse effects in those with mildly to moderately reduced renal function. In the context of rising concerns regarding other glucose-lowering therapies, safety restrictions over the use of metformin in this population may result in the drug being stopped prematurely and unnecessarily in some patients. This may lead to significant deterioration in glycemic control and/or the need for other glucose-lowering medications, which present their own safety concerns. An evidence-based approach to prescribing metformin in this group appears warranted, taking into account the current pervasive use of eGFR in clinical care.

We therefore suggest that the current guidelines for metformin use in the U.S. be updated. These recommendations should include eGFR thresholds that are generally consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines in the U.K. and those endorsed by the Canadian Diabetes Association and the Australian Diabetes Society (Table 1). Metformin may be continued (or initiated) with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, but renal function should be monitored closely (every 3–6 months). The dose of metformin should be reviewed and reduced (e.g. by 50% or to half-maximal dose) in those with eGFR < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, and renal function should be monitored closely (every 3 months). Metformin should not be initiated in patients at this stage, however. The drug should be stopped once eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Additional caution is required in patients with anticipated significant fluctuations in renal status or those at risk for abrupt deterioration in kidney function, based on previous history, other comorbidities, albuminuria, and medication regimen (e.g. potent diuretics or nephrotoxic agents).

### Antidiabetic therapy in end-stage renal disease [^525f4923]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

There has been substantial growth in the variety of available antidiabetic agents during the last decade and a half. The role of these newer agents in patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population, and their relative benefits and risks in this population compared to patients without ESRD are not yet clear. This stems from the altered state of glucose homeostasis in ESRD, which places patients at high risk for hypoglycemia and, in certain situations, hyperglycemia. In addition, there is a dearth of evidence to support a benefit of tight glycemic control on either micro- or macrovascular outcomes in ESRD patients; furthermore, the metrics by which glycemic control is conventionally measured are less valid in ESRD. In this review, we will discuss noninsulin and insulin-based therapies as well as unique challenges, contraindications, advantages, and disadvantages to their use in ESRD. We will also review issues pertinent to both hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.

### Metformin use and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^d7cec300]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Metformin could have benefits on cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression but is often withheld from individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) because of a concern that it may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.

Materials and Methods

All-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, cardiovascular events (death, hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke or myocardial ischemia), end stage renal disease (ESRD) and the kidney disease composite (ESRD or death) were compared in metformin users and non-users with diabetes and CKD enrolled in the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp (darbepoeitin-alfa) Therapy (TREAT) (NCT00093015). Outcomes were compared after propensity matching of users and non-users and in multivariable proportional hazards models.

Results

There were 591 individuals who used metformin at baseline and 3447 non-users. Among propensity-matched users, the crude incidence rate for mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and the combined endpoint was lower in metformin users than in non-users, but ESRD was marginally higher (4.0% vs 3.6%). Metformin use was independently associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.36–0.69), cardiovascular death (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32–0.74), the cardiovascular composite (HR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.51–0.88) and the kidney disease composite (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61–0.98). Associations with ESRD (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.65–1.55) were not significant. Results were qualitatively similar in adjusted analyses of the full population. Two cases of lactic acidosis were observed.

Conclusions

Metformin may be safer for use in CKD than previously considered and may lower the risk of death and cardiovascular events in individuals with stage 3 CKD.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes — metformin use and monitoring thresholds are specified using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): medication dosing may require modification with eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance recommends using eGFR instead of serum creatinine. The FDA states that metformin is contraindicated with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, eGFR should be monitored while taking metformin, benefits and risks should be reassessed when eGFR falls to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, metformin should not be initiated if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and it should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or before iodinated contrast imaging when eGFR is 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic kidney disease: what to expect from new oral hypoglycemic agents [^72f197ea]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people have chronic kidney disease (CKD), whose most common causes include hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes. About 40% of patients with diabetes develop CKD and intensive blood glucose control through pharmacological intervention can delay CKD progression. Standard therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus include metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. While these drugs have an important role in the management of type 2 diabetes, only the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone can be used across the spectrum of CKD (stages 2–5) and without dose adjustment. Newer therapies, particularly dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, are increasingly being used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes; however, a major consideration is whether these newer therapies can also be used safely and effectively across the spectrum of renal impairment.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^9a9209e2]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES

The prescribing information for metformin in the current label is explicit with respect to renal contraindications, based on serum creatinine cut points. It proscribes use at or above the 1.4 and 1.5 mg/dL levels in women and men, respectively. The recently updated Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation are perfectly consistent with the label. Yet, certain U.S. practice guidelines substantially differ in their recommendations for metformin use related to renal status. The annually updated clinical practice guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association, for example, do not actually discuss renal thresholds but refer the reader to a separate consensus statement for prescribing details. This statement, authored by members of the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes, reports that metformin seems safe unless eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2.

Clinical guidelines outside of the U.S. incorporate the eGFR for determination of metformin safety. In the U.K. for example, prescribing guidelines consider both creatinine and eGFR for assessing treatment eligibility. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends reviewing the clinical circumstances when serum creatinine exceeds 130 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or eGFR falls below 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence further specifies that metformin be stopped if serum creatinine exceeds 150 µmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) (a higher threshold than in the U.S.) or eGFR is below 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. In contrast, the Canadian Diabetes Association practice guidelines are now based solely on eGFR, recommending caution with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and contraindicating its use with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. The Australian Diabetes Society practice guidelines similarly recommend against metformin with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and caution with eGFR 30–45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Thus, although there is clear recognition that renal failure may be a risk factor for adverse events with metformin use, there is significant divergence in opinion across the globe regarding the optimal definition of safety.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — glycemic management and cardiovascular risk: Emerging data indicate that intensive glycemic control reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and death, with benefits primarily in long-term intensive glycemia management; in type 2 diabetes, insulin‑sensitizing agents may be beneficial for reducing CVD event rates, although prospective controlled trials should confirm these observations. Observational signals include that pioglitazone may reduce all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke in type 2 diabetes, and metformin use was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction and death in people with type 2 diabetes; however, caution is advised with use of metformin in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although studies regarding intensive glycemic control and CVD in people with diabetes and CKD are nonexistent, patients with diabetes and CKD should strive to achieve glucose control as close to normal as possible without excessive episodes of hypoglycemia.

serious and potentially deadly condition called lactic acidosis, in which too much lactic acid builds up in the blood. We have concluded from the review of studies published in the medical literature that metformin can be used safely in patients with mild impairment in kidney function and in some patients with moderate impairment in kidney function. 3–6 We are requiring changes to the metformin labeling to reflect this new information and provide specific recommendations on the drug's use in patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment. addition to blood creatinine concentration, the glomerular filtration rate takes into account additional parameters that are important, such as the patient's age, gender, race and/or weight.

### Safety and effectiveness of metformin in patients with reduced renal function: a systematic review [^e4a99523]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine clinical and safety outcomes associated with metformin use in patients with impaired renal function.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase databases from inception to August 2020, supplementing our search with a review of investigator files and reference lists of included studies. Any study reporting original data on metformin and patient-centred outcomes in patients with impaired renal function, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than60mL/min/1.73m 2, was included. Post hoc meta-analysis was performed for the outcomes of mortality, cardiovascular events and acidosis.

Results

Nine small prospective studies enrolling patients with significantly impaired renal function identified only one case of clinically apparent lactic acidosis. Among 13 larger retrospective studies, seven examined the risk of mortality across patient subgroups; meta-analysis showed reductions in overall mortality at an eGFR of 45mL/min/1.73m 2 or higher but not at an eGFR of less than 45 mL/min/1.73m 2. Eight retrospective studies evaluated acidosis as an outcome; meta-analysis showed no increase in risk of acidosis except at an eGFR of less than 30mL/min/1.73m 2, in which group the HR was 1.97 (95% CI 1.03–3.77).

Conclusions

The literature shows metformin to be associated with reduced mortality and no increased risk of acidosis at an eGFR of 45mL/min/1.73m 2 or higher. Metformin appears to be associated with fewer benefits and possible increases in the risk of acidosis at an eGFR of less than 30mL/min/1.73m 2. Consistent with US Food and Drug Administration guidelines, metformin should not be used at an eGFR less than 30mL/min/1.73m 2, and further research on its risk-benefit profile at eGFR values approaching 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 is warranted.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^580823bf]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

This increased efficacy at higher baseline HbA1c values is also interesting in terms of the open-label arm of this study. Patients who were otherwise eligible but with screening HbA1c > 10.0% were not randomized but instead were all assigned open-label empagliflozin 25 mg. At baseline, mean HbA1c in this group was 11.5%, and by week 24 it had fallen to 7.6%. This mean level is still above the recommended target for most patients, yet 28% of this group reached a goal of HbA1c < 7.0%. Although an open-label study such as this must be interpreted with caution, it suggests that empagliflozin may provide useful glycemic improvements across a range of baseline HbA1c values.

Further phase 3 placebo-controlled trials have shown significant reductions in HbA1c when empagliflozin was used as add-on to metformin, pioglitazone with or without metformin, and sulfonylureas plus metformin. Reductions were of a similar amount to those seen with monotherapy and to those expected for other SGLT2 inhibitors. Empagliflozin has also been studied in twice-daily combinations with metformin (immediate-release) in treatment-naïve patients and fixed-dose combinations with linagliptin in treatment-naïve patients or patients already on stable metformin. Two studies recruited patients on insulin (either basal insulin or multiple daily injections) and both showed significant reductions even in these typically refractory patients. This demonstrates one of the key features of the mechanism of action — that empagliflozin can be used across the diabetes spectrum since it does not depend on endogenous insulin. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that many patients with advanced T2DM, and thus likely to be on insulin, will also have some degree of renal impairment, and this can impact the HbA1c reduction. Because of its mechanism of action, empagliflozin relies on adequate renal function to be effective and is contraindicated in people with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, or dialysis. However, empagliflozin has been studied in patients with renal impairment over the range of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15–90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 in a 52-week study with the primary endpoint being change in HbA1c after 24 weeks. In patients with eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 [stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD)], empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg were both associated with significant reductions in HbA1c versus placebo (−0.52% for empagliflozin 10 mg and −0.68% for empagliflozin 25 mg; both P < 0.0001). Patients with eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (stage 3 CKD) were only randomized to placebo or the higher dose of empagliflozin (25 mg), and again empagliflozin gave a significant reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo, although this appeared more modest than in patients with mild renal impairment (mean −0.42%; P < 0.0001). The study included a relatively small number of patients (n = 74) with stage 4 CKD (≥ 15 to < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and in this group empagliflozin was not associated with significant reductions in HbA1c; in fact, the mean change was a small increase of 0.04%, although the investigators noted reductions in BP and body weight. Overall, this suggests that empagliflozin may be useful in patients with T2DM and mild or moderate renal impairment, especially since there are relatively few options in this group.

Health care professionals should follow the latest recommendations when prescribing metformin-containing medicines to patients with impaired kidney function. Patients should talk to their health care professionals if they have any questions or concerns about taking metformin. The current drug labeling strongly recommends against metformin use in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally because use of metformin in these patients can increase the risk of developing a serious and potentially deadly condition called lactic acidosis, in which too much lactic acid builds up in the blood.

### Chronic kidney disease: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment [^b1234fc5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 15% of the U.S. population, and many people are unaware of their diagnosis. Screening may be considered for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, age 60 years and older, family history of kidney disease, previous acute kidney injury, or preeclampsia. Diagnosis and staging of CKD are based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), excessive urinary albumin excretion, or evidence of kidney parenchymal damage lasting more than three months. eGFR should be determined using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation without the race variable. Risk calculators are available to estimate the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. When possible, serum cystatin C should be measured to confirm eGFR in patients with CKD. Blood pressure should be maintained at less than 140/90 mm Hg, with a systolic blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg or less for patients tolerant of therapy, using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and metformin should be considered in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who have not reached their glycemic goal. Intravenous iodinated contrast media temporarily reduces eGFR and should be avoided in patients with advanced CKD. Interdisciplinary management of patients with CKD is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and patients at high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease should be referred to a nephrologist.

### Metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease: a systematic review [^5f128656]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Metformin is widely viewed as the best initial pharmacological option to lower glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the drug is contraindicated in many individuals with impaired kidney function because of concerns of lactic acidosis.

Objective

To assess the risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use in individuals with impaired kidney function.

Evidence Acquisition

In July 2014, we searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to metformin, kidney disease, and lactic acidosis in humans between 1950 and June 2014. We excluded reviews, letters, editorials, case reports, small case series, and manuscripts that did not directly pertain to the topic area or that met other exclusion criteria. Of an original 818 articles, 65 were included in this review, including pharmacokinetic/metabolic studies, large case series, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and a clinical trial.

Results

Although metformin is renally cleared, drug levels generally remain within the therapeutic range and lactate concentrations are not substantially increased when used in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rates, 30–60 mL/min per 1.73 m2). The overall incidence of lactic acidosis in metformin users varies across studies from approximately 3 per 100,000 person-years to 10 per 100,000 person-years and is generally indistinguishable from the background rate in the overall population with diabetes. Data suggesting an increased risk of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients with chronic kidney disease are limited, and no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to test the safety of metformin in patients with significantly impaired kidney function. Population-based studies demonstrate that metformin may be prescribed counter to prevailing guidelines suggesting a renal risk in up to 1 in 4 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus — use which, in most reports, has not been associated with increased rates of lactic acidosis. Observational studies suggest a potential benefit from metformin on macrovascular outcomes, even in patients with prevalent renal contraindications for its use.

Conclusions and Relevance

Available evidence supports cautious expansion of metformin use in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, as defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate, with appropriate dosage reductions and careful follow-up of kidney function.

### Metformin use and mortality in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: national, retrospective, observational, cohort study [^405d8f5f]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin is recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, use of this drug has been contraindicated in individuals with impaired kidney function because of the perceived risk of lactic acidosis. Evidence now supports cautious use of metformin in people with mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease. However, studies examining the use of metformin in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are lacking. We aimed to assess the safety of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced (approximately stage 5) chronic kidney disease.

Methods

We did a retrospective, observational, cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were enrolled prospectively in Taiwan's national health insurance research database between Jan 1, 2000, and June 30, 2009, and had follow-up data until Dec 31, 2009. We included individuals with a serum creatinine concentration greater than 530 μmol/L, which is approximately equivalent to stage 5 chronic kidney disease. From a consecutive sample of 12350 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, 1005 used metformin and 11345 were non-users. We matched users and non-users of metformin by propensity score in a 1:3 ratio. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality.

Findings

813 metformin users were matched by propensity score to 2439 non-users. The two groups of patients did not differ significantly by 30 baseline clinical and socioeconomic variables. Median follow-up in the matched cohort was 2·1 years (range 0·3–9·8). All-cause mortality was reported in 434 (53%) of 813 metformin users and in 1012 (41%) of 2439 non-users. After multivariate adjustment, metformin use was an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1·35, 95% CI 1·20–1·51; p < 0·0001). The increased mortality risk was dose-dependent and was consistent across all subgroup analyses. However, metformin use compared with no use was associated with a higher but non-significant risk of metabolic acidosis (1·6 vs 1·3 events per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio 1·30, 95% CI 0·88–1·93; p = 0·19).

Interpretation

Use of metformin in people with type 2 diabetes and a serum creatinine concentration greater than 530 μmol/L is associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with non-users. Metformin use should not be encouraged in this patient group.

### Metformin and other antidiabetic agents in renal failure patients [^94de4a0e]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

This review mainly focuses on metformin, and considers oral antidiabetic therapy in kidney transplant patients and the potential benefits and risks of antidiabetic agents other than metformin in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In view of the debate concerning lactic acidosis associated with metformin, this review tries to solve a paradox: metformin should be prescribed more widely because of its beneficial effects, but also less widely because of the increasing prevalence of contraindications to metformin, such as reduced renal function. Lactic acidosis appears either as part of a number of clinical syndromes (i.e., unrelated to metformin), induced by metformin (involving an analysis of the drug's pharmacokinetics and mechanisms of action), or associated with metformin (a more complex situation, as lactic acidosis in a metformin-treated patient is not necessarily accompanied by metformin accumulation, nor does metformin accumulation necessarily lead to lactic acidosis). A critical analysis of guidelines and literature data on metformin therapy in patients with CKD is presented. Following the present focus on metformin, new paradoxical issues can be drawn up, in particular: (i) metformin is rarely the sole cause of lactic acidosis; (ii) lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin therapy is erroneously still considered a single medical entity, as several different scenarios can be defined, with contrasting prognoses. The prognosis for severe lactic acidosis seems even better in metformin-treated patients than in non-metformin users.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^6ed878e2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are the leading causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and significantly contribute to ongoing morbidity. For the past two decades, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended metformin as the first-line therapy for T2D, owing to its efficacy, affordability, weight neutrality, and benefits in cardiovascular outcomes as well as its potential role in slowing kidney disease progression. However, the latest 2022 consensus on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, joint issued by ADA and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), also advocates for the inclusion of sodium-glucose -cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in all diabetes patients as part of the comprehensive approach to managing glucose levels and reducing cardiovascular and renovascular risk. Specifically, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended for all T2D patients with diabetic kidney disease and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) above 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2, to mitigate CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline HbA1c, or metformin use. These recommendations are particularly crucial for patients with multiple atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, established ASCVD, or diabetic kidney disease.

Substantial evidence indicates that inadequate glycemic control within the initial years following T2D diagnosis is strongly correlated with a higher risk of future microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as increased mortality. This "glycemic legacy" effect, consistently observed in both randomized controlled trials and real-world observational studies, underscores the critical importance of selecting first-line medications or combination therapies for T2D that not only optimize glycemic control but also provide significant cardiovascular and renal protective benefits.

In recent years, accumulating data has reinforced the benefits of metformin in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes, even in patients with progressive CKD and eGFR levels below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Nevertheless the 2022 joint ADA and KDIGO guidelines, while recognizing metformin's superior efficacy in glycemia control, highlight a reduced efficacy in cardiovascular and renal protection when compared with SGLT2 inhibitors. Whether metformin offers additional renal protection and survival benefits when combined with SGLT2 inhibitors remains uncertain.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the real-world impact of a combined metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors regimen, compared to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors alone, on renal progression outcomes and all-cause mortality in T2D patients.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: moving towards a new paradigm? [^205e46ce]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Recent publications 7, 8 have advocated broadening the use of metformin in patients with more advanced CKD, including patients on dialysis and/or awaiting renal transplant. Treatment options for these patients are limited, and metformin has generally not been widely used for the reasons stated earlier. Although these publications acknowledge the need for controlled clinical trial data, which is currently lacking, they propose that patients with advanced renal disease could be treated with lower doses of metformin to improve glycaemic control without excessive plasma accumulation. Dose reduction in renally impaired patients is a common strategy for renally cleared drugs that act systemically, and while such a strategy would probably result in acceptable exposure in the context of safety, the relationship between metformin plasma exposure and efficacy is not that simple. There is increasing evidence that a substantial contribution to the glycaemic effect of metformin is mediated through the intestine rather than primarily through systemic exposure. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Given that the bioavailability of metformin increases with decreasing dose, 14 it is unlikely that the low doses of metformin required to maintain acceptable plasma concentrations would deliver sufficient metformin to the intestine to leverage the gut‐based mechanisms of action. 15

In summary, classification of LA in metformin‐treated patients should acknowledge the complexity of the contributing factors and weigh the potential roles of both metformin accumulation and underlying hypoxic diseases/conditions based on all the information available. This is particularly important in patients at inherently higher risk of MALA, such as the elderly and those with advanced CKD.

### Review of SGLT2i for the treatment of renal complications: experience in patients with and without T2D [^284ab693]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, have updated their guidelines to recommend SGLT2i as first-line therapy for the prevention and management of CKD (eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2) in patients with T2D and albuminuric kidney disease. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend the use of metformin in combination with SGLT2i (with GFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) as first-line antihyperglycemic therapy for patients with T2D and CKD. In patients on treatment that have a drop in GFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the SGLT2i can be continued until initiation of kidney replacement therapy. Finally, a Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association advocated the use of SGLT2i in patients with earlier stages of CKD and postponement of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in more advanced CKD because there is more experience with these agents in patients with severe CKD.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^4dff1988]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease.

Kidney disease is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes, and moderate to severe renal functional impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min) occurs in approximately 20–30% of patients. The individual with progressive renal dysfunction is at increased risk for hypoglycemia, which is multifactorial. Insulin and, to some degree, the incretin hormones are eliminated more slowly, as are antihyperglycemic drugs with renal excretion. Thus, dose reduction may be necessary, contraindications need to be observed, and consequences (hypoglycemia, fluid retention, etc.) require careful evaluation.

Current U.S. prescribing guidelines warn against the use of metformin in patients with a serum creatinine ≥ 133 mmol/L (≥ 1.5 mg/dL) in men or 124 mmol/L (≥ 1.4 mg/dL) in women. Metformin is eliminated renally, and cases of lactic acidosis have been described in patients with renal failure. There is an ongoing debate, however, as to whether these thresholds are too restrictive and that those with mild–moderate renal impairment would gain more benefit than harm from using metformin. In the U.K. the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines are less proscriptive and more evidence-based than those in the U.S. generally allowing use down to a GFR of 30 mL/min, with dose reduction advised at 45 mL/min. Given the current widespread reporting of estimated GFR, these guidelines appear very reasonable.

Clinical utility — adding SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin considerations: Evidence supports KDIGO practice points that recommend the addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor to existing antihyperglycemic agents unless there is concern for hypoglycemia, in which case it is recommended to reduce the dose or discontinue antihyperglycemic medications other than metformin; the rationale for maintaining metformin is that the vast majority of evidence for SGLT2 inhibitor cardiorenal efficacy in type 2 diabetes is based on trials adding SGLT2 inhibitor to metformin unless the patient is intolerant, and the KDOQI work group agrees with this sentiment while noting there may be room for exceptions.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^097574bb]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

These reports have relied on information derived from single doses of metformin, which may not reflect chronic-treatment pharmacokinetics. In contrast, few reports have assessed the impact of renal insufficiency on metformin clearance during long-term use. Indeed, one such study concluded that metformin can be efficiently cleared in mild-to-moderate CKD. In this investigation, 24 older patients (aged 70–88 years) were administered metformin 850 mg/day or 1,700 mg/day based on CrCl of 30–60 mL/min (n = 11) or > 60 mL/min (n = 13), respectively. After 2 months, metformin remained in the therapeutic range and lactate within the reference limits in all participants. In addition, the measured levels of metformin and lactate were not statistically different between those with and without renal impairment.

Another recent study evaluated metformin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and varying renal function. GFR was estimated based on cystatin C levels. The median dose of metformin was 1,500 mg/day. The median serum level of metformin was 4.5 µmol/L (~0.6 µg/mL) (range 0.1–20.7) in patients with eGFR > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 107), 7.7 µmol/L (~1.0 µg/mL) (0.1–15.2) with eGFR 30–60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 21), and 8.9 µmol/L (~1.1 µg/mL) (6.0–18.6) with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 9). Notably, there were wide variations in these levels within each group, with few patients having serum levels > 20 µmol/L (> ~2.6 µg/mL). However, the "unsafe" metformin concentration is not really known. At usual clinical doses and schedules, steady-state plasma concentrations are generally < 1 µg/mL (< 7.8 µmol/L). Maximum plasma levels during controlled clinical trials do not generally exceed 5 µg/mL (38.8 µmol/L), but these have not typically enrolled CKD patients. Moreover, whether measurement of metformin levels actually can aid in the prediction of lactic acidosis risk remains unclear. Therefore, although these studies provide some information on the relationship between renal function and metformin concentrations, they do not clarify the issue of toxicity and lactic acidosis risk.

Metformin in the 21st century

By the end of the 20th century, metformin's ability to safely lower glucose levels in patients with diabetes had been well-documented on a global scale. In 2002, metformin became the most commonly prescribed oral anti-hyperglycemic medication. In 2005, the International Diabetes Foundation published guidelines recommending metformin as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Nearly 50 years after the rediscovery of metformin, the World Health Organization added metformin to its list of essential medications in 2011. Numerous clinical trials in the last decade have thoroughly assessed concerns regarding the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis in patients with comorbidities such as renal and hepatic dysfunction or congestive heart failure. Results from such trials continue to support metformin as a safe and effective medication for the vast majority of patients. In fact, the restriction for using metformin in patients with impaired kidney function has recently been relaxed.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^a17335cb]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CURRENT USE OF METFORMIN IN CKD

Given the current contraindications in the U.S. some might consider it a challenge to conduct a new clinical trial to evaluate the use of metformin in individuals with various degrees of impaired renal function, taking into account new criteria for assessing glomerular filtration. Yet, evidence suggests that metformin is often already used in practice outside of the current labeling contraindications, prescribed in full knowledge of the relevant cutoffs. For example, in a review of restrictions to metformin therapy conducted in Scotland, 24.5% of metformin users had filled a prescription despite active contraindications (3.4% had the specific local exclusion of a serum creatinine ≥ 1.7 mg/dL recorded twice on different days within 4 weeks). A single case of lactic acidosis during 4,600 patient-years of follow-up occurred in a patient with an extensive acute myocardial infarction who developed acute renal failure and died the same day. Given the clinical scenario, the authors intimated that acidosis had occurred because of hemodynamic compromise related to the infarct and not to metformin accumulation. In a U.S. study performed in the primary care practice setting, 4.5% of patients treated with metformin had creatinine levels > 1.4 and 1.5 mg/dL in women and men, respectively. Two other studies of sicker patients admitted to hospitals in Germany and the U.S. confirmed high frequency of metformin use despite various contraindications (73 and 27%, respectively).

Practice Point 2 — metformin-treated patients with chronic kidney disease — estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) monitoring and dose adjustment are specified as follows: "Monitor eGFR in patients treated with metformin. Increase the frequency of monitoring when eGFR is < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m^2." If "eGFR < 30," "Stop metformin; do not initiate metformin." For dose initiation at eGFR ≥ 60 or eGFR 45–59, immediate release may start with "Initial 500 mg or 850 mg once daily" and be "Titrate upwards by 500 mg/d or 850 mg/d every 7 days until maximum dose"; for gastrointestinal intolerance, extended release uses "Initial 500 mg daily" and "Titrate upwards by 500 mg/d every 7 days until maximum dose." For eGFR 30–44, "Initiate at half the dose and titrate upwards to half of maximum recommended dose." Vitamin B12 monitoring is "Annually if on metformin for more than 4 years or at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency." Kidney function monitoring intervals are "At least annually" or "At least every 3–6 months" depending on eGFR category. For subsequent dose adjustment, at eGFR ≥ 60 "Continue same dose"; at eGFR 45–59 "Continue same dose. Consider dose reduction in certain conditions (see text)"; and at eGFR 30–44 "Half the dose." The figure notes rationale for the practice point, including "Limited evidence to support the guidance" and "No systematic review was conducted."

### Risk of acute kidney injury and survival in patients treated with metformin: an observational cohort study [^6f9ec890]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is a biguanide which has been used as first line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom since the 1960s. In addition to its effectiveness as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, there is increasing evidence of its beneficial cardiovascular effects. There is, however, considerable debate regarding its use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 2. Guidelines pertaining to metformin prescribing and renal impairment vary. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously stated that metformin was contraindicated in males with a serum creatinine above 132.6 μmol/l and females above 123.8 μmol/l or abnormal creatinine clearance. However, following a recent review of the literature, these recommendations were revised to indicate that metformin can now be used safely in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 45–60 ml/min/1.73 2) and in some with moderate renal impairment (eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 2). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK allows prescribing of metformin in patients with an eGFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 2 but recommends that the dose is reduced in patients with an eGFR of less than 45 ml/min/1.73 2 (or serum creatinine of greater than 132.6 μmol/l) and metformin discontinued if eGFR is less than 30 or serum creatinine greater than 150.3 μmol/l. Current contraindications therefore exclude its use in a large proportion of patients with CKD. Following the FDA's announcement, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have also now announced that metformin-containing medicines can be used in patients with moderately reduced renal function (eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73 2).

The advent of a universally agreed serum creatinine based definition for AKI allows identification of even mild (Stage 1) AKI without relying on hospital coding systems allowing assessment of renal safety in patients with CKD.

The present study therefore aimed to examine whether current metformin use was associated with an increased rate of AKI as a proxy for lactic acidosis compared to non-use and to establish whether metformin exposure affected survival in patients with AKI.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^8a4182fd]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

When one considers the imperfect reflection of actual renal function by serum creatinine, metformin is likely used even more frequently in patients with impaired GFR than that suggested by the above studies. In the aforementioned U.S. primary practice setting, where 4.5% of patients were given metformin despite creatinine-based contraindications, 17.7% of women and 13.4% of men receiving metformin actually had an abnormally low eGFR (≤ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2). Likewise, in another single U.S. center cross-sectional study, 15.3% of patients with type 2 diabetes and eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 were receiving metformin. Such frequent "inappropriate" use of metformin in patients is further suggested by data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2006). Among individuals with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and diabetes, 32.2% were treated with metformin and had a normal creatinine level (< 1.5 mg/dL), whereas 13.4% were treated with metformin despite a frankly elevated creatinine level (> 1.5 mg/dL). The use of metformin in mild-to-moderate CKD clearly is not at all uncommon.

Treatments for CKD in People Living with T2DM

Findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that improved renal outcomes can be achieved through obesity management, intensive glycemic control using glucose-lowering medications, and anti-hypertension drugs. A caveat of using these medications is that many have reduced renal clearance due to declining kidney function or are contraindicated and often require careful dose adjustments. Furthermore, several of these therapies have only a modest glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced glomerular filtration. For these reasons, limited treatment options exist for this patient population.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and KDIGO provide clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in CKD. These guidelines recommend a comprehensive strategy be followed to reduce risks of CKD in people living with T2DM and are summarized in Fig. 2. In the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2021, the ADA recommend that for people with indications of high risk or established CKD either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered as a treatment option, independently of metformin use. Guidelines provided by KDIGO similarly recommend SGLT2i for people with an eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the vascular and renal benefit, despite its modest effect on glucose control. The current KDIGO guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i for people in more advanced stages of CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), as the efficacy for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is blunted. This is indicated in the label information for empagliflozin and canagliflozin, with both of these SGLT2i not recommended for individuals with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For dapagliflozin, recently updated prescribing information indicates that initiation of treatment with this SGLT2i is not recommended in individuals with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In people with T2DM and CKD, who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i, or are unable to use those medications due to contraindications, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are recommended. The use of GLP-1 RAs in this population is not only due to the limited use of SLGT2i in more severe stages but also because the glycemic lowering efficacy of SLGT2i is reduced in individuals with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in those with severe renal impairment. These anti-hyperglycemic therapies have shown promise in directly improving renal outcomes and reducing CKD progression independently of glycemic control. The use of GLP-1 RAs is also associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia, which is a limiting factor for many other diabetes medications in people with renal impairment.

### Comparative effects of glucose-lowering medications on kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes: the GRADE randomized clinical trial [^90ea3e96]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of kidney disease in the US. It is not known whether glucose-lowering medications differentially affect kidney function.

Objective

To evaluate kidney outcomes in the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) trial comparing 4 classes of glucose-lowering medications added to metformin for glycemic management in individuals with T2D.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial was conducted at 36 sites across the US. Participants included adults with T2D for less than 10 years, a hemoglobin A1c level between 6.8% and 8.5%, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who were receiving metformin treatment. A total of 5047 participants were enrolled between July 8, 2013, and August 11, 2017, and followed up for a mean of 5.0 years (range, 0–7.6 years). Data were analyzed from February 21, 2022, to March 27, 2023.

Interventions

Addition of insulin glargine, glimepiride, liraglutide, or sitagliptin to metformin, with the medication combination continued until the HbA1c was greater than 7.5%; thereafter, insulin was added to maintain glycemic control.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Chronic eGFR slope (change in eGFR between year 1 and trial end) and a composite kidney disease progression outcome (albuminuria, dialysis, transplant, or death due to kidney disease). Secondary outcomes included incident eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 40% decrease in eGFR to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, doubling of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) to 30 mg/g or greater, and progression of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stage. Analyses were intention-to-treat.

Results

Of the 5047 participants, 3210 (63.6%) were men. Baseline characteristics were mean (SD) age 57.2 (10.0) years; HbA1c 7.5% (0.5%); diabetes duration, 4.2 (2.7) years; body mass index, 34.3 (6.8); blood pressure 128.3/77.3 (14.7/9.9) mm Hg; eGFR 94.9 (16.8) mL/min/1.73 m2; and median UACR, 6.4 (IQR 3.1–16.9) mg/g; 2933 (58.1%) were treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors. Mean chronic eGFR slope was -2.03 (95% CI, -2.20 to -1.86) mL/min/1.73 m2 per year for patients receiving sitagliptin; glimepiride, -1.92 (95% CI, -2.08 to -1.75) mL/min/1.73 m2 per year; liraglutide, -2.08 (95% CI, -2.26 to -1.90) mL/min/1.73 m2 per year; and insulin glargine, -2.02 (95% CI, -2.19 to -1.84) mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (P = 0.61). Mean composite kidney disease progression occurred in 135 (10.6%) patients receiving sitagliptin; glimepiride, 155 (12.4%); liraglutide, 152 (12.0%); and insulin glargine, 150 (11.9%) (P = 0.56). Most of the composite outcome was attributable to albuminuria progression (98.4%). There were no significant differences by treatment assignment in secondary outcomes. There were no adverse kidney events attributable to medication assignment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, among people with T2D and predominantly free of kidney disease at baseline, no significant differences in kidney outcomes were observed during 5 years of follow-up when a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, sulfonylurea, glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor agonist, or basal insulin was added to metformin for glycemic control.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^e888201e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that combination therapy with metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D was associated with significantly improved survival rates and kidney disease outcomes, compared to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors alone. We investigated the associations between metformin use and both kidney disease progression and mortality within a large cohort of 45,545 T2D patients over an extended follow-up period. After comprehensive propensity-score matching that included multiple covariates, we retained two well-matched groups of 6774 patients each. Compared to the regimen excluding metformin, the combined therapy of SGLT2 inhibitors plus metformin was associated with a significantly reduced risk of composite kidney disease outcome as well as all-cause mortality. The renal and survival benefits of metformin use remained robust after adjusting for established clinical and demographic risk factors. Furthermore, the therapy was associated with lower rates of adverse events, including hospitalizations, severe AKI episodes, and metabolic acidosis.

CKD is highly prevalent among patients with T2D, affecting up to 61% of U.S. diabetic patients aged 65 years and older. Since its approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (UAS-FDA) in 1994, metformin has been the recommended first-line therapy for T2D. Metformin is a biguanide diabetic drug that reduce hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption while enhancing insulin sensitivity, making it a preferred treatment for T2D owing to its efficacy, affordability, and favorable safety profile. Research indicates that beyond glycemic control, metformin is associated with improved cardiovascular, and survival outcomes in patients with T2D. The FDA initially recommended against the use of metformin in patients with serum creatinine levels above 1.5 mg/dL due to concerns regarding drug accumulation and potential risk of lactic acidosis. Nevertheless, recent data suggests a low risk of lactic acidosis in patients with moderate CKD (eGFR 30–60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) and indicates potential reno-protective benefits of metformin, leading to more flexible guideline recommendations. The 2022 consensus on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, from the ADA and KDIGO recommends metformin for all T2D patients with an eGFR above 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, with a dose adjustments suggested for eGFR below 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Initiation of Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end-stage renal disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

Dapagliflozin

Dapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated in 4304 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the DAPA-CKD trial. Dapagliflozin 10 mg was also evaluated in 1926 adult patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2in the DAPA-HF trial. The safety profile of dapagliflozin across eGFR subgroups was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.4 and 14.5)].

Dapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated in two glycemic control trials that included adult patients with moderate renal impairment (an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and an eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients with diabetes and renal impairment using dapagliflozin 10 mg are more likely to experience hypotension and may be at higher risk for acute kidney injury secondary to volume depletion. In the trial of adult patients with an eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 13 patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced bone fractures compared to none receiving placebo. Use of dapagliflozin 10 mg for glycemic control in patients without established CV disease or CV risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Metformin HCl

Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets are contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Metformin

Metformin is eliminated by the kidneys and has historically been considered unsuitable for use in patients with advanced CKD because of concerns about development of lactic acidosis attributed to metformin accumulation. 31, 32 These concerns were largely based on case reports, and observational studies have not shown the predicted increase in the risk of metformin‐associated lactic acidosis. 33 Consequently, changes to recommendations for metformin use occurred in 2016 when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relaxed its restrictions for metformin use in CKD following a review of the safety of this agent in patients with impairment of kidney function. 34 For patients with CKD, the guidance states that starting metformin in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–45 mL/min/1.73m 2 is not recommended. For patients taking metformin whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73m 2, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be evaluated, and metformin should be discontinued in patients whose eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. 34

Recent evidence suggests that low‐dose metformin (500 mg once‐daily) may be used in patients with an eGFR of 15–30 mL/min/1.73m 2, provided the dosage is adjusted on an individual patient basis and that the drug is stopped during acute illness. 35, 36 However, the FDA has not approved metformin use in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. 37

### Comparative effectiveness of incident oral antidiabetic drugs on kidney function [^5c59cef9]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a major cause of chronic kidney disease, and oral antidiabetic drugs are the mainstay of therapy for most patients with Type 2 diabetes. Here we evaluated their role on renal outcomes by using a national Veterans Administration database to assemble a retrospective cohort of 93,577 diabetic patients who filled an incident oral antidiabetic drug prescription for metformin, sulfonylurea, or rosiglitazone, and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60ml/min or better. The primary composite outcome was a persistent decline in eGFR from baseline of 25% or more (eGFR event) or a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The secondary outcome was an eGFR event, ESRD, or death. Sensitivity analyses included using a more stringent definition of the eGFR event requiring an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in addition to the 25% or more decline; controlling for baseline proteinuria thereby restricting data to 15,065 patients; and not requiring persistent treatment with the initial oral antidiabetic drug. Compared to patients using metformin, sulfonylurea users had an increased risk for both the primary and the secondary outcome, each with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.20. Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings. The risk associated with rosiglitazone was similar to metformin for both outcomes. Thus, compared to metformin, oral antidiabetic drug treatment with sulfonylureas increased the risk of a decline in eGFR, ESRD, or death.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^4387cff3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

PROGRESSION OF CKD IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES

Renal function is dynamic, and renal dysfunction in diabetes is typically progressive. Even in the absence of an acute event, glomerular function slowly declines with aging as nephron mass is lost. The renal thresholds for the acceptability of metformin therapy should therefore ideally account for the tempo of CKD progression. The assessment of renal function in clinical practice occurs periodically, and the degree of renal dysfunction may change appreciably between these assessments. Therefore, it is important to know how quickly GFR declines in the typical spectrum of nephropathy among diabetic patients, particularly when considering metformin therapy.

Few studies have, however, systematically evaluated the rate of progression of renal dysfunction in the general diabetic patient population by directly measuring GFR over time. Some data suggest that eGFR tends to underestimate the rate of GFR decline by as much as 28% when compared with direct measurement. Nevertheless, most of the available data are based on estimations. A recent British population-based cohort study of 3,431 diabetic patients examined renal decline as measured by changes in eGFR (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease). The analysis of data collected over 7 years demonstrated that the rate of progression was lowest among individuals who were normoalbuminuric (0.3% or ~0.2 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 decline in eGFR per year), intermediate in those with microalbuminuria (1.5% or ~1.2 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year), and highest in those with macroalbuminuria (5.7% or 4.5 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year). In a large Dutch study, eGFR fell by 0.5 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year in the general population but to a greater extent in those with hypertension, diabetes, and macroalbuminuria (1.9 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year). Based on these and other results, average annual progression of renal dysfunction in diabetes appears to be in the range of −1 to −4 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 of filtration capacity, dependent in part on other risk factors and the use of renoprotective therapies. The decline is slow, but, importantly, the majority of patients in these studies had normal kidney function at the outset. There is less information available on diabetic patients with CKD. It should also be noted that diabetes places an individual at increased risk for other causes of renal disease. Thus, all diabetic patients, especially those with CKD, may be at risk for more rapid decline in their renal function or acute kidney injury.

### Efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic renal insufficiency [^d66d625c]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, is a medication for patients with T2DM that improves glycemic control through enhancement of the incretin axis. A randomized, double-blind study in patients with T2DM and normal to mildly impaired renal function who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy showed that the addition of sitagliptin provided similar A1C-lowering efficacy over 52 weeks compared with the addition of the sulfonylurea glipizide; however, patients on glipizide reported > 10 times as many hypoglycemia events as did patients on sitagliptin, and body weight decreased with sitagliptin and increased with glipizide, resulting in a significant between-group difference.

Sitagliptin is cleared primarily by the kidney, with ∼80% of an oral dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Based on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and its renal clearance, in order to achieve a plasma concentration of sitagliptin similar to that achieved with a 100-mg daily dose in patients with normal to mildly impaired renal function, patients with moderate renal insufficiency should receive one-half of the usual clinical dose (50 mg every day), and patients with severe renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease should receive one-quarter of the usual clinical dose (25 mg every day). In a placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial, sitagliptin, at the appropriate doses for patients with T2DM and chronic renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease, provided clinically relevant reductions in A1C and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and was generally well-tolerated, with a rate of hypoglycemia similar to that of placebo and a neutral effect on body weight. The current study compared the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin with that of glipizide, a sulfonylurea agent recommended by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines for use in this patient population, in patients with T2DM and moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 to < 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) renal insufficiency who had inadequate glycemic control.

### Limitations of metformin use in patients with kidney disease: are they warranted? [^9695f205]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To show that metformin, one of the most widely used agents, is contraindicated in patients with diabetes having chronic kidney disease (CKD) (i.e. serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl) secondary to fear of lactic acidosis. The overall incidence of lactic acidosis is estimated at an upper limit of eight cases per 100 000 patient-years. We evaluated metformin use in two cohorts, one from the University of Chicago Diabetes Center and the other from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2006.

Methods

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the re-expressed Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation and compared to serum creatinine. We hypothesized that metformin is used in patients with undetected advanced CKD (i.e. serum creatinine is ≥ 1.5 mg/dl). A chi-squared test was used to compare per cent differences of metformin use across demographic variables and eGFR in the NHANES cohort.

Results

At the University of Chicago Diabetes Center, 36 of 234 (15.3%) patients with an eGFR of < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) were receiving metformin. Data from NHANES, age > 18 years and eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) showed that Blacks with advanced nephropathy were three times more likely to receive metformin.

Conclusions

We conclude that metformin utilization occurs with a higher frequency than predicted by serum creatinine in people with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Given the very low incidence of lactic acidosis, the recommendation should be changed to reflect eGFR cut-off values rather than serum creatinine.

### Should restrictions Be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? No, we should never again compromise safety! [^19686943]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin is and has been considered as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause a lactic acidosis that is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin. However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, many of them with serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there clearly remains controversy in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal restrictions of metformin. To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we provide a Point-Counterpoint. In the point narrative below, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy provide their argument that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, just considering the sheer numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or in those who are at high risk of AKI irrespective of underlying eGFR. In the following counterpoint narrative, Drs. Bakris and Molitch argue that the data from a very large analysis demonstrate clearly that serum creatinine should be supplanted with eGFR as the criteria for metformin use and that the incidence of lactic acidosis is only elevated in those with a reduced eGFR who become dehydrated for various reasons or in those exposed to some toxin resulting in AKI. Otherwise the data clearly support the use of metformin under normal circumstances down to eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)-William T. CefaluEditor in Chief, Diabetes Care.

### Unleash metformin: reconsideration of the contraindication in patients with renal impairment [^f3add9dc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the expanded use of metformin in renal impairment.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE database via PubMed, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health were searched in August 2013 and included studies from 1950 onward.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The search included comparative trials, observational cohort studies, and meta-analyses using the terms diabetes mellitus, metformin, renal insufficiency, and acidosis, lactic.

Data Synthesis

One randomized controlled trial, 1 meta-analysis, 1 case-control, and 3 prospective-cohort studies, representing about 150 000 patients, revealed that metformin is safe in patients with stable mild-moderate renal impairment. The incidence of lactic acidosis is low and similar to sulfonylureas. In addition, reduced risks of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, or any acidosis/serious infection were seen with metformin use in mild-to-moderate renal impairment.

Conclusions

Data over the past decade refute the historical contraindication in patients with renal impairment and suggest that the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is low in stable mild-to-moderate renal impairment and similar to the risk with other type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) medications with no renal impairment restrictions. Because of its unique impact on microvascular and macrovascular complications, it is advantageous to utilize metformin as the cornerstone in DM2 treatment for as long as possible, including in those patients with mild to moderate stages of renal impairment with no additional contraindications. A dosage reduction is recommended if estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and discontinuation if eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

### Metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stages 3A, 3B, or 4 [^c8cf9f59]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was conducted to define a safe, effective dose regimen for metformin in moderate and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stages 3A/3B and 4, respectively), after the lifting of restrictions on metformin use in patients with diabetes with moderate-to-severe CKD in the absence of prospective safety and efficacy studies.

Research Design and Methods

Three complementary studies were performed: 1) a dose-finding study in CKD stages 1–5, in which blood metformin concentrations were evaluated during a 1-week period after each dose increase; 2) a 4-month metformin treatment study for validating the optimal metformin dose as a function of the CKD stage (3A, 3B, and 4), with blood metformin, lactate, and HbA 1c concentrations monitored monthly; and 3) an assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters after the administration of a single dose of metformin in steady-state CKD stages 3A, 3B, and 4.

Results

First, in the dose-finding study, the appropriate daily dosing schedules were 1,500 mg (0.5 g in the morning [qam] +1 g in the evening [qpm]) in CKD stage 3A, 1,000 mg (0.5 g qam + 0.5 g qpm) in CKD stage 3B, and 500 mg (qam) in CKD stage 4. Second, after 4 months on these regimens, patients displayed stable metformin concentrations that never exceeded the generally accepted safe upper limit of 5.0 mg/L. Hyperlactatemia (> 5 mmol/L) was absent (except in a patient with myocardial infarction), and HbA 1c levels did not change. Third, there were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters among the CKD stage groups.

Conclusions

Provided that the dose is adjusted for renal function, metformin treatment appears to be safe and still pharmacologically efficacious in moderate-to-severe CKD.

Exposure

Stopping versus continuing metformin within 6 months following incident stage 4 CKD.

Outcome

Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

Analytical Approach

Target trial emulation with clone-censor-weight design and marginal structural models fit for sensitivity analyses.

Results

In a population of 371,742 Scottish residents with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes before April 30, 2019, 4,278 were identified as prevalent metformin users with incident CKD stage 4. Within 6 months of developing CKD stage IV, 1,713 (40.1%) individuals discontinued metformin. Compared with continuing metformin, stopping metformin was associated with a lower 3-year survival (63.7% [95% CI, 60.9–66.6] vs 70.5% [95% CI, 68.0–73.0]; HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.10–1.44]), and the incidence of MACE was similar between both strategies (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.88–1.26]). Marginal structural models confirmed the higher risk of all-cause mortality and similar risk of MACE in patients who stopped versus continued metformin (all-cause mortality: HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.08–1.67]; MACE: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.81–1.33]).

Limitations

Residual confounding.

Conclusions

The continued use of metformin may be appropriate when eGFR falls below 30mL/min/1.73m 2. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Plain-Language Summary

Current guidance recommends against the use of metformin in people with advanced kidney impairment despite a lack of evidence. It is therefore currently unclear how the decision to stop versus continue metformin in patients who reach stage 4 CKD impacts their risk of mortality and cardiovascular events. This study showed that stopping metformin after reaching stage 4 CKD was associated with reduced survival that did not appear to be mediated by an increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These findings may support the continued use of metformin in patients with advanced kidney impairment, but further research is needed to confirm these observations.

3 METFORMIN IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

3.1 Kidney disease markedly increases CV risk in patients with type 2 diabetes

A recent study in 687 732 patients with type 2 diabetes showed that 18% had a first adverse cardiorenal event during 4 years of follow‐up. 28 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) accounted for 36% of these events, and was the earliest and most common CV complication of diabetes in this population. Moreover, the appearance of CKD was associated with a 1.8‐fold increase in the risk of all‐cause or CV death. Other data from the nationally representative US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) confirm the severe adverse impact of a diagnosis of CKD on clinical outcomes in people with diabetes. 29 In this cohort, the age‐standardized mortality rate was only 4.1% higher for people with type 2 diabetes without CKD than for controls without either condition. However, the difference from the control group in age‐standardized mortality increased by 17.8% where albuminuria was present, by 23.9% where glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was abnormal, and by 47.0% where subjects had both albuminuria and abnormal GFR. Thus, the excess mortality associated with diabetes was mostly accounted for by people with CKD.

3.2 Renal safety of metformin

Intensive glycaemic control per se is widely considered to reduce the risk of end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, largely on the basis of a 65% reduction in this outcome in patients randomized to intensive versus standard blood glucose control policies in the ADVANCE trial (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.83, P = 0.01). 30 However, it should be noted that the confidence intervals are wide, as even in this large trial with 11 140 patients randomized, there were only 27 events over 5 years of follow‐up. 30

Metformin was contraindicated in people with CKD (estimated GFR [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2) for many years, however, with the intention of mitigating a perceived association between the use of metformin and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin increases serum lactate levels modestly with serum lactate concentrations usually remaining well within the normal range. 31 However, as metformin is excreted unchanged via the kidney, 32 a cautious approach to labelling of metformin has been adopted in the setting of CKD by international regulators in order to reduce the potential for accumulation and the possibility of developing lactic acidosis.

### Antidiabetic medication use in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^ba90e097]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To quantify patterns of conventional and newer antidiabetic medication use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We used data from a large claims and integrated dataset that includes employed and commercially insured patients in the US to select patients who had T2DM and CKD with information on laboratory values and prescriptions for antidiabetic medications from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2015. We stratified the analyses by sociodemographic variables.

Results

In a cohort of 38,577 patients with T2DM and CKD, we found wide variation in the treatment of T2DM by CKD stage as well as by several sociodemographic factors. Although metformin was the most commonly prescribed medication, only about half of patients in the cohort and fewer than two-thirds of patients with early stage CKD were prescribed metformin. Approximately 10.6% of patients with CKD stage 4 and 2.1% of the patients with CKD stage 5 were prescribed metformin. Sulfonylureas with active metabolites that accumulate with impaired kidney function were prescribed in more than one-third of patients with CKD stages 3b, 4, and 5. Only 3.4% and 12.3% of patients were prescribed GLP-1 and DPP-4 respectively.

Conclusions

Prescriptions for metformin were lower than expected among patients with mild to moderate CKD. Prescriptions for newer antidiabetic medications with known safety and efficacy across the spectrum of CKD remained low. Prescriptions for agents contraindicated in advanced CKD continued to be written in a sizeable fraction of patients.

### Saxagliptin and metformin [^919c03d3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Saxagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets

Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Assess renal function more frequently in the elderly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Saxagliptin

In the seven, double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of saxagliptin, a total of 4751 (42.0%) of the 11301 patients randomized to saxagliptin were 65 years and over, and 1210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.

Metformin HCl

Controlled clinical trials of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

8.6	Renal Impairment

Saxagliptin

In a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial, saxagliptin 2.5 mg was administered to 85 patients with moderate (n = 48) or severe (n = 18) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n = 19) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo. The overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 20% among patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four saxagliptin-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick glucose ≤ 50 mg/dL).

Metformin HCl

Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Metformin therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease [^6ad5b69b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin therapy is limited in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the potential risk of lactic acidosis. This open-label observational study investigated metformin and lactate concentrations in patients with CKD (n = 22; creatinine clearances 15–40 ml/min) and in two dialysed patients. Patients were prescribed a range of metformin doses (250–2000 mg daily) and metformin concentrations were compared with data from healthy subjects (scaled to 1500 mg twice daily). A subset of patients (n = 7) was controlled on low doses of metformin (250 or 500 mg daily). No correlation between metformin and lactate concentrations was observed. Three patients had high lactate concentrations (> 2.7 mmol/l) and two had high metformin concentrations (3–5 mg/l), but none had any symptoms of lactic acidosis. Reducing metformin dosage and monitoring metformin concentrations will allow the safe use of metformin in CKD, provided that renal function is stable.
