## Question

Inflammatory bowel disease can lead to vitamin d deficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can lead to vitamin D deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in IBD compared with controls. Then, I should verify the mechanistic pathways by which IBD could cause deficiency. Next, I will examine disease-specific contributors, especially Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis. After that, I should review modulating factors such as season, ethnicity, and medications. Then, I will consider the bidirectional relationship and whether inflammation itself alters vitamin D metabolism. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence and outline clinical implications for screening and supplementation, making sure I double-check guideline-aligned targets and dosing strategies [^113jwu3i] [^116rS93n].

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology. Multiple cohorts and meta-analyses consistently show higher odds of vitamin D deficiency in IBD than in non-IBD controls, with pooled estimates around a 64% increased risk and substantially higher prevalence in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, often ranging from roughly one-third to near-universal deficiency depending on the cohort and definition used [^1122bytu] [^113jwu3i] [^114Gs5pf]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric data too; indeed, pediatric series report deficiency rates commonly exceeding 50–60%, reinforcing that this is not solely an adult phenomenon [^111kLMW8] [^114RQzbK].

> Now, I need to check the mechanistic plausibility that IBD causes deficiency. IBD can impair fat absorption, and because vitamin D is fat-soluble, active mucosal inflammation and bile acid disturbances can reduce its bioavailability; additionally, inflammatory cytokines may upregulate catabolism via CYP24A1, and chronic diarrhea can increase enteric losses, all of which plausibly lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in active disease [^112x5NNj] [^113VzX4V] [^1139C7Kv]. Wait, let me verify the catabolism point; prospective metabolite profiling in Crohn's disease shows that 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is lower in active disease and recovers with remission, suggesting inflammation alters vitamin D turnover rather than simply lowering 25(OH)D directly, which fits a homeostatic model during inflammatory stress [^1142rSLw] [^112CJKk2].

> I will now examine disease-specific contributors. Crohn's disease, particularly with ileal involvement or prior resections, carries a higher risk of deficiency due to impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and bile acid loss; in contrast, ulcerative colitis typically has less malabsorption but still shows high prevalence, likely reflecting systemic inflammation and reduced intake or sun exposure rather than primary malabsorption [^113jwu3i] [^112x5NNj]. Hold on, I should verify whether UC still shows strong associations; yes, meta-analytic data show UC patients have more than double the odds of deficiency versus controls, indicating that malabsorption is not the sole driver across phenotypes [^1122bytu].

> Next, I should review modulating factors. Non-white ethnicity, higher BMI, female sex, pregnancy, smoking, winter season, and corticosteroid use are all associated with lower vitamin D status in IBD cohorts, and these factors can compound the disease-related mechanisms to deepen deficiency severity and persistence [^115d9iMq] [^113jwu3i] [^114Gs5pf]. Wait, I need to ensure I'm not overstating causality here; these are associations that can reflect both disease activity and lifestyle, so I should treat them as risk amplifiers rather than sole causes in any individual patient [^113jwu3i].

> But wait, what if the relationship is bidirectional? I should double-check whether low vitamin D might also track with worse outcomes. Observational and longitudinal data link lower 25(OH)D to higher disease activity, more relapses, greater healthcare utilization, and worse quality of life, and some studies suggest that normalizing vitamin D is associated with reduced surgery risk, although confounding by disease severity remains a concern and causality cannot be inferred from these designs [^1126NUgm] [^115ru3BH] [^112kSAzu]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied causation; I should correct that and emphasize that these are associations pending high-quality randomized trials for hard outcomes [^115py2W3].

> Let me consider the clinical implications carefully. Guidelines converge on routine screening and correction of vitamin D deficiency in IBD, with the AGA recommending annual monitoring for vitamin D and iron in all patients and ESPEN advising monitoring in active disease or when deficiency is suspected, particularly in those on corticosteroids or with extensive small-bowel disease [^115ictwW] [^1157dBB6]. I should confirm dosing pragmatics; practical approaches suggest repleting to at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), with some experts targeting 75–125 nmol/L, using daily cholecalciferol with reassessment in 3–4 months and escalation or bolus strategies if targets are not met, while avoiding sustained supraphysiologic levels that increase adverse event risk [^115WKeC9] [^112vSHyH] [^113cP2er]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance; pediatric sources support 800–1000 IU/day maintenance and higher repletion doses when deficient, with periodic monitoring to sustain sufficiency [^114QiG6S] [^116p8s5j].

> I should also review supplementation effects on disease outcomes, but I need to be cautious. Meta-analyses of randomized trials suggest that vitamin D supplementation reduces clinical relapse risk in IBD overall, with a signal that benefits may be stronger in Crohn's disease and in patients in remission, although certainty is low and heterogeneity is high; some pediatric RCTs also show improvements in activity scores and inflammatory markers, but larger, rigorously designed trials are needed before recommending vitamin D as disease-modifying therapy [^115py2W3] [^111MR1vX] [^1117ycmP]. Let me reconsider the practical takeaway; even if anti-inflammatory effects are modest or uncertain, correcting deficiency is justified for bone health and may be reasonable as a low-risk adjunct while we await definitive outcome data [^113jwu3i] [^115py2W3].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, IBD can lead to vitamin D deficiency through multiple mechanisms including fat malabsorption, enteric losses, inflammatory catabolism, reduced intake or sun exposure, and disease-specific factors such as ileal Crohn's disease or prior resections; the prevalence is substantially higher than in non-IBD populations, and the relationship is bidirectional, with lower levels correlating with worse disease activity, though causality remains incompletely proven [^112x5NNj] [^1122bytu] [^1142rSLw] [^1126NUgm]. Clinically, I need to ensure annual screening and timely repletion to guideline-supported targets, individualize dosing to absorption and adherence realities, and reassess response to guide maintenance, recognizing that this is standard-of-care for bone health and may confer additional immunomodulatory benefits even as definitive disease-modifying evidence matures [^116rS93n] [^115ictwW] [^113cP2er].

Yes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause **vitamin D deficiency** through multiple mechanisms, including **malabsorption** from inflamed or resected bowel [^113VzX4V], **reduced intake** from dietary restrictions [^117QGkdN], and **increased catabolism** from inflammation [^1142rSLw]. The prevalence of deficiency is high in IBD, especially in Crohn's disease [^116M9s5w], and is linked to **greater disease activity** [^1126NUgm], more relapses, and lower quality of life [^112kSAzu] [^112to3WK]. Routine screening and correction of vitamin D deficiency are recommended in IBD care [^113jwu3i] [^116rS93n].

## Mechanisms of vitamin D deficiency in IBD

Several mechanisms contribute to **vitamin D deficiency** in IBD:

- **Malabsorption**: Inflammation and damage to the small intestine, particularly the ileum, impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D [^113VzX4V].

- **Reduced intake**: Dietary restrictions and poor appetite in IBD patients can lead to insufficient vitamin D intake [^111KX7Zy].

- **Increased catabolism**: Inflammatory cytokines upregulate CYP24A1, increasing vitamin D degradation and reducing its bioavailability [^notfound].

- **Reduced sun exposure**: Chronic illness and hospitalization can limit sunlight exposure, decreasing cutaneous vitamin D synthesis [^112ECsLd].

## Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in IBD

Vitamin D deficiency is **highly prevalent** in IBD:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Prevalence of vitamin d deficiency** |
|-|-|-|
| Meta-analysis (2015) | IBD patients vs. controls | 64% higher odds of deficiency (OR 1.64) [^1122bytu] |
| British Society of Gastroenterology (2019) | Crohn's disease patients | 66% deficiency (< 50 nmol/L) [^113jwu3i] |
| British Society of Gastroenterology (2019) | Ulcerative colitis patients | 69% deficiency (< 50 nmol/L) [^113jwu3i] |
| Pediatric study (2011) | Pediatric IBD patients | 34.6% deficiency (< 15 ng/mL) [^112vN855] |

## Clinical consequences of vitamin D deficiency in IBD

Vitamin D deficiency in IBD is associated with **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Increased disease activity**: Lower vitamin D levels correlate with higher disease activity indices and inflammatory biomarkers [^1126NUgm] [^113oV9Dy].

- **Higher relapse risk**: Deficiency is associated with increased risk of clinical relapses and hospitalizations [^116M9s5w] [^115ru3BH].

- **Bone health**: Deficiency contributes to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased fracture risk due to chronic inflammation and corticosteroid use [^1126R62Y].

- **Quality of life**: Lower vitamin D levels are linked to reduced quality of life and fatigue [^112to3WK] [^1139bpaL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Given the high prevalence and clinical impact, **routine screening and supplementation** are recommended:

- **Routine screening**: Annual measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in IBD patients [^111Ahpoz].

- **Supplementation**: Correct deficiency with oral vitamin D supplementation, typically 800–2000 IU daily, adjusted to individual needs and response [^113cP2er] [^116p1oAq].

- **Monitoring**: Reassess vitamin D levels after 3–6 months of supplementation to ensure adequacy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

IBD can cause **vitamin D deficiency** through malabsorption, reduced intake, and increased catabolism. This deficiency is common and associated with greater disease activity, more relapses, and lower quality of life. Routine screening and supplementation are recommended to maintain adequate vitamin D status and potentially improve disease outcomes [^116p8G6z].

### Can vitamin D induce remission in patients with inflammatory bowel disease? [^1159TraS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been reported to be very high. In adults with ulcerative colitis (UC) it has been estimated to be around 45–50%, and in the case of Crohn's disease (CD) it ranges from 35–100%. This systematic review aimed to address the effects of VD in inducing remission in patients with CD and UC.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched, and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Nine studies with active disease subjects were evaluated; 5 of them investigated patients with UC, 2 studied patients with CD, while 2 studies included patients with both diseases.

Results

The studies show that oral daily doses from 1000 IU can raise VD levels above 20 ng/mL in patients with active CD or UC. Doses close to 50,000 IU per week are sufficient to raise VD levels above 40 ng/mL. Moreover, daily doses from 2000 IU can be related to improvements in the clinical scores of the disease and improvement in patients' quality of life.

Conclusion

It is challenging to define the best doses of VD as a therapeutic adjunct to induce remission in IBD patients, as there are biases in the inclusion of studies, since the route of administration of the VD can vary, as well as the doses and the time of use.

### Managing vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease [^117QGkdN]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is generally cumbersome for patients and is a massive health-economic burden. In recent years, the immunomodulating effects of vitamin D have gained a huge interest in its possible pathogenic influence on the pathophysiology of IBD. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent among patients with IBD. Several clinical studies have pointed to a critical role for vitamin D in ameliorating disease outcomes. Although causation versus correlation unfortunately remains an overwhelming issue in the illusive chicken versus egg debate regarding vitamin D and IBD, here we summarise the latest knowledge of the immunological effects of vitamin D in IBD and recommend from available evidence that physicians regularly monitor serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with IBD. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for optimising vitamin D status in patients with IBD in clinical practice. Awaiting well-powered controlled clinical trials, we consider vitamin D supplementation to be an affordable and widely accessible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate IBD clinical outcomes.

### Editorial: vitamin D and IBD: can we get over the "Causation" hump? [^1126NUgm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and may even precede the disease onset contributing to an increased risk. Using comprehensive data from a large, referral IBD cohort, Kabbani et al. establish that low vitamin D levels are associated with greater disease activity, increased risk of surgery and hospitalizations, and lower health-related quality of life in patients with IBD. This expands the evidence base supporting such an association. However, there is a need for this field to evolve to interventional studies with vitamin D supplementation to confirm that vitamin D has a true therapeutic role for treating disease activity in IBD.

### Vitamin D for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^115py2W3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D possesses immunomodulatory properties and has been implicated in the pathogenesis and severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Animal studies and emerging epidemiological evidence have demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency and worse disease activity. However, the role of vitamin D for the treatment of IBD is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for IBD.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was Jun 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of all ages with active or inactive IBD comparing any dose of vitamin D with another dose of vitamin D, another intervention, placebo, or no intervention. We defined doses as: vitamin D (all doses), any-treatment-dose vitamin D (greater than 400 IU/day), high-treatment-dose vitamin D (greater than 1000 IU/day), low-treatment-dose vitamin D (400 IU/day to 1000 IU/day), and supplemental-dose vitamin D (less than 400 IU/day).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. clinical response for people with active disease, 2. clinical relapse for people in remission, 3. quality of life, and 4. withdrawals due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 5. disease activity at end of study, 6. normalisation of vitamin D levels at end of study, and 7. total serious adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 22 RCTs with 1874 participants. Study duration ranged from four to 52 weeks. Ten studies enroled people with Crohn's disease (CD), five enroled people with ulcerative colitis (UC), and seven enroled people with CD and people with UC. Seventeen studies included adults, three included children, and two included both. Four studies enroled people with active disease, six enroled people in remission, and 12 enroled both. We assessed each study for risk of bias across seven individual domains. Five studies were at low risk of bias across all seven domains. Ten studies were at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain but with no areas of high risk of bias. Seven studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and assessors. Vitamin D (all doses) versus placebo or no treatment Thirteen studies compared vitamin D against placebo or no treatment. We could not draw any conclusions on clinical response for UC as the certainty of the evidence was very low (risk ratio (RR) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 10.57; 1 study, 60 participants). There were no data on CD. There may be fewer clinical relapses for IBD when using vitamin D compared to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96; 3 studies, 310 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low. We could not draw any conclusions on quality of life for IBD (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.13, 95% CI -3.10 to 2.83 (the SMD value indicates a negligent decrease in quality of life, and the corresponding CIs indicate that the effect can range from a large decrease to a large increase in quality of life); 2 studies, 243 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.27; 12 studies, 1251 participants; note 11 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 12). The certainty of the evidence was very low. High-treatment-dose vitamin D versus low-treatment-dose vitamin D Five studies compared high treatment vitamin D doses against low treatment vitamin D doses. There were no data on clinical response. There may be no difference in clinical relapse for CD (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01; 1 study, 34 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low. We could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD as the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.08; 3 studies, 104 participants; note 2 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 3). The data on quality of life and disease activity could not be meta-analysed, were of very low certainty, and no conclusions could be drawn. Any-treatment-dose vitamin D versus supplemental-dose vitamin D Four studies compared treatment doses of vitamin D against supplemental doses. There were no data on clinical response and relapse. There were no data on quality of life that could be meta-analysed. We could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD as the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.17; 4 studies, 233 participants; note 3 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 4).

Authors' Conclusions

There may be fewer clinical relapses when comparing vitamin D with placebo, but we cannot draw any conclusions on differences in clinical response, quality of life, or withdrawals, due to very low-certainty evidence. When comparing high and low doses of vitamin D, there were no data for clinical response, but there may be no difference in relapse for CD. We cannot draw conclusions on the other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence. Finally, comparing vitamin D (all doses) to supplemental-dose vitamin D, there were no data on clinical relapse or response, and we could not draw conclusions on other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence or missing data. It is difficult to make any clear recommendations for future research on the basis of the findings of this review. Future studies must be clear on the baseline populations, the purpose of vitamin D treatment, and, therefore, study an appropriate dosing strategy. Stakeholders in the field may wish to reach consensus on such issues prior to new studies.

Conclusions and recommendations

It is still unclear whether vitamin D deficiency is a causative factor for IBD. However, vitamin D deficiency seems to be prevalent in IBD and to be inversely linked to disease activity, more frequent relapses, higher postoperative recurrence, poorer quality of life and in general an abnormal response to biologicals as compared with patients with normal or high s-25(OH)D levels. Nevertheless, further research is needed to define the optimal therapeutic level of 25(OH)D in IBD (ie, should other thresholds be recommended for extraskeletal benefits) or if other paraclinical tests should be introduced like vitamin D binding protein and free and bioavailable vitamin D and to clarify how vitamin D modifies levels of inflammation and its exact effect on disease severity. It should additionally be assessed if differences exist in vitamin D metabolism and absorption in IBD. Furthermore, interventions should focus on vitamin D levels during asymptomatic periods, when possible, to avoid confounding and investigating its potential synergy with current and future therapies in IBD.

Cumulatively, the available data support that vitamin D appears to be an intimate player in the pathogenesis of IBD at both the cellular and phenotypic level and its potential role as a therapeutic agent in improving the disease state in these patients, even though available knowledge is based on indirect evidence. Thus, it is uncertain if causation will ever be equivocally established, as no industrial sponsors might be interested to fund appropriately sized RCTs of vitamin D supplementation in an intervention cohort with an unpatented drug.

As mentioned, it seems reasonable to offer patients with IBD measurements of s-25(OH)D levels at least once a year (preferable during winter). We have provided for the reader a flow chart for vitamin D supplementation with a relatively affordable and accessible medication and subsequent follow-ups. Such efforts may increase the probability of bringing the IBC into clinical remission, and to conventional therapeutic strategies and in this way lead to better patient outcomes as well as reduced healthcare expenses.

### Can vitamin D induce remission in patients with inflammatory bowel disease? [^112z69BX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

We recommend that VD levels be monitored in IBD patients and that supplements are provided for those deficient in this component. Supplementation should raise levels above 20 ng/mL, which can be achieved with daily doses above 1000 mg/dL. Longer-term administration should be monitored to maintain normal levels of VD and remission of the patients. Another important finding of this review is that the studies show that patients with relapse of the disease never present VD levels above 40 ng/mL. This finding leads us to consider whether patients with IBD should be supplemented with higher doses so their serum levels are not less than 40 ng/mL.

This is the first systematic review that includes only studies performed on relapsed patients to the best of our knowledge. Although our study proposed to use only trials with patients in the same stage of the disease (active disease), we could not eliminate all biases since the doses used and the duration of use of VD was very different. Therefore, we believe it is challenging to define the best doses of this vitamin as a therapeutic adjunct to induce remission in UC and CD patients. Oral daily doses from 1000 IU/12 weeks can raise VD levels above 20 ng/mL in UC or CD patients with active disease, and doses close to 50,000 IU per week are sufficient to raise VD levels above 40 ng/mL. Moreover, doses from 2000 IU per day can be related to improvements in the clinical scores of the disease and improvement in patients' QoL.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Vitamin D is a modulator of adaptive and innate immune responses
Vitamin D reduces bacterial translocation to extra-intestinal tissues
Vitamin D is associated with the downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukins -6 and -12, thereby offering benefit to patients with inflammatory bowel disease

What the new findings are:

The effects of vitamin D on the remission of inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are still somewhat obscure
The use of vitamin D in flared patients can interfere with remission
The dosages of vitamin D can influence the outcomes

The prevalence of VD deficiency in adults with UC has been estimated at 45–50% and 35–100% in CD. This deficiency may be attributed to decreased sunlight exposure, low VD intake, altered enterohepatic circulation, and augmented loss due to enteropathy. In addition, low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin have been reported as a biomarker for disease activity and as a predictive factor for poor clinical outcomes.

It has not been established whether VD deficiency leads to IBD or vice versa. As shown by Zullow et al in their study of 255 subjects with IBD, most of them had low VD levels, UC was associated with a lower risk of VD insufficiency, and in CD patients VD sufficiency was associated with reduced disease activity and improved QoL.

Although VD has become popular and is considered to aid in the treatment of patients with IBD, few clinical trials have investigated the use of this vitamin in patients with active UC and CD. More than 20 studies evaluated the use of VD in patients with IBD, but only 9 included patients with active disease. Therefore, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that consider patients at different stages of the disease may be at risk of significant bias. Since many studies have shown that VD profoundly influences the inflammatory pathways and may help prevent or remission of IBD, this systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of this vitamin in UC and CD patients in relapse.

### Association between inflammatory bowel disease and vitamin D deficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122bytu]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D plays a role in several immune-mediated diseases, but its association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between IBD and vitamin D deficiency.

Methods

We searched electronic databases from inception to December 2014 for observational studies reporting the presence of vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] level of ≤ 20 ng/mL) in IBD patients and having a control group without IBD. Odds ratios (ORs) were combined using a random-effects model. Meta-regression was performed using latitude as a moderator. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Results

Out of 816 citations, 14 eligible studies were identified, comprising 1891 participants (938 IBD cases and 953 controls). Meta-analysis showed that patients with IBD had 64% higher odds of vitamin D deficiency when compared with controls (OR = 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.30–2.08; I = 7%; P < 0.0001). Patients with ulcerative colitis had more than double the odds of vitamin D deficiency when compared with normal controls (OR = 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–4.41; I = 41%; P = 0.01). Latitude did not influence the association between IBD and vitamin D deficiency (P = 0.34). Generalizability of our results might be limited as we summarized unadjusted ORs, because of nonavailability of adjusted ORs in individual studies.

Conclusions

IBD is significantly associated with having higher odds of vitamin D deficiency. Well-designed randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies are needed to further explain the role of vitamin D in IBD pathogenesis and its therapy.

### Vitamin D therapy in adults with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115JSJh5]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Emerging literature suggests that optimization of vitamin D levels may be associated with improvements in disease activity and quality of life. We conducted a meta-analysis exploring the effect of vitamin D on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25[OH]D) levels, clinical improvement, and biomarkers.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and sources for grey literature were searched from inception until September 2019. The primary outcome was s-25(OH)D mean differences. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2 test and the I2 statistic. Review Manager software v. 5.3 was used.

Results

Twelve randomized controlled trials (n = 611) and 4 observational studies (n = 359) were included in the meta-analysis. On average, in the randomized controlled trials, vitamin D supplementation increased s-25(OH)D levels by 15.50 ng/mL (95% confidence interval, 11.08–19.92, P ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 90%) and in observational studies they increased by 18.39 ng/mL (95% CI, 8.91–27.88, P = 0.0001, I2 = 82%). Subgroup analyses between vitamin D and placebo groups revealed that vitamin D increased s-25(OH)D by 14.85 ng/mL (95% CI, 9.96–19.73, P ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 90%) and when high doses of vitamin D were compared with low doses, high doses increased s-25(OH)D by 18.27 ng/mL (95% CI, 5.44–31.10, P = 0.005, I2 = 90%). The Harvey Bradshaw Index improved by -1.47 points (95% CI, -2.47 to -0.47, P = 0.004, I2 = 0%) and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased by -1.58 mg/L (95% CI, -2.95 to -0.21, P = 0.02, I2 = 0%).

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation in patients with IBD and vitamin D deficiency is effective at correcting vitamin D levels and is associated with improvement in clinical and biochemical disease activity scores.

### Vitamin D in inflammatory bowel disease: more than just a supplement [^115d9iMq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to explore the protective role of vitamin D on the gastrointestinal tract, summarize the epidemiology of vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and highlight recent studies examining the impact of low vitamin D and vitamin D supplementation on IBD clinical outcomes.

Recent Findings

Vitamin D protects the gut barrier by regulating tight junction proteins and inhibiting intestinal apoptosis. Vitamin D enhances innate immunity by inducing antimicrobial peptides and regulates adaptive immunity by promoting anti-inflammatory T cells and cytokines. Vitamin D may also alter the gut microbiota. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in IBD is 30–40%. Predictors of vitamin D deficiency in IBD include non-white ethnicity, IBD-related surgery, BMI more than 30, female sex, and pregnancy. Low vitamin D is associated with increased disease activity, inflammation, and clinical relapse. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on IBD clinical outcomes is inconclusive.

Summary

Vitamin D plays a protective role on gut health. Vitamin D deficiency in IBD is prevalent and associated with poor outcomes. The benefits of vitamin D supplementation in IBD is unclear. Measuring novel vitamin D metabolites and vitamin D absorption in IBD patients may help guide future studies.

### Linking vitamin D deficiency to inflammatory bowel disease [^114nGU5F]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with industrialization, and its incidence has increased markedly over time. The prospect of reversing these trends motivates the search for the agent(s) involved. Modernity entails several physical and behavioral modifications that compromise both the photosynthesis of cholecalciferol in the skin and of its bioavailability. Although deficiency in this "vitamin" has therefore emerged as a leading candidate, and despite the publication of a randomized control trial that showed a trend toward statistically significant benefit in Crohn's disease, its causal agency has yet to be demonstrated by an adequately powered study. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the case being made by epidemiologists, geneticists, clinicians, and basic researchers, and consolidate their findings into a model that provides mechanistic plausibility to the claim. Specifically, converging data sets suggest that local activation of vitamin D coordinates the activity of the innate and adaptive arms of immunity, and of the intestinal epithelium, in a manner that promotes barrier integrity, facilitates the clearance of translocated flora, and diverts CD4 T cell development away from inflammatory phenotypes. Because smoking is an important risk-altering exposure, we also discuss its newly established melanizing effect and other emerging evidence linking tobacco use to immune function through vitamin D pathways.

Practical approach to vitamin D supplementation for patients with IBD in clinical setting

When choosing the right strategy for vitamin D supplementation in IBD, several factors must be considered, including disease activity, degree of deficit, malabsorption, obesity, compliance and sun-exposure habits.

Vitamin D levels are intimately linked with IBD disease activity. and their association is likely a dynamic process. Vitamin D levels are disproportionately low among IBD patients with active inflammation. Low vitamin D levels may increase the risk of future IBD clinical relapse, while treating IBD flares results in increased vitamin D levels. As such, it is important to first consider the disease activity of an IBD patient prior to formulating a plan to optimise vitamin D levels. Given that IBD patients with disease flares are at high risk of developing malabsorption and vitamin D deficiency, we propose that a higher initial bolus dose be administered, and malabsorption should be tested among IBD patients with active disease (figure 2).

Despite no 'gold standard' for adequate s-25(OH)D levels in IBD exist, most data suggest that a s-25(OH)D level > 75 nmol/L is beneficial compared with IBD patients with s-25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L in terms of level of inflammatory markers and clinical scores.

### Mucosal vitamin D signaling in inflammatory bowel disease [^115tYia4]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological studies have identified vitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency to be highly prevalent among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and low serum levels correlate with a higher disease activity and a more complicated disease course. The link to IBD pathogenesis has been subject of investigations, primarily due to the distinct immunological functions of vitamin D signaling, including anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions. Vitamin D is a pleiotropic hormone that executes its actions on cells through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). A leaky gut, i.e. an insufficient intestinal epithelial barrier, is thought to be central for the pathogenesis of IBD, and emerging data support the concept that vitamin D/VDR signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) has an important role in controlling barrier integrity. Here we review the latest evidence on how vitamin D promotes the interplay between IECs, the gut microbiome, and immune cells and thereby regulate the intestinal immune response. On the cellular level, vitamin D signaling regulates tight junctional complexes, apoptosis, and autophagy, leading to increased epithelial barrier integrity, and promotes expression of antimicrobial peptides as part of its immunomodulating functions. Further, intestinal VDR expression is inversely correlated with the severity of inflammation in patients with IBD, which might compromise the positive effects of vitamin D signaling in patients with flaring disease. Efforts to reveal the role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of IBD will pave the road for the invention of more rational treatment strategies of this debilitating disease in the future.

5.3.3 Vitamin D

Statement 103. We suggest that vitamin D levels should be measured and deficiency corrected in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 86.7%).

In a multicultural UK IBD cohort, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L) was 66% in Crohn's disease and 69% in UC, and severe vitamin D deficiency was 27% in Crohn's disease and 36% in UC. Median vitamin D levels were lower in black and Asian ethnic groups relative to white subjects, and IBD-related surgery was associated with vitamin D deficiency in the Crohn's disease group (OR 2.9). A recent Norwegian study reported the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-OH-D concentrations < 50 nmol/L) to be 53% in Crohn's disease and 44% in UC. Vitamin D levels in IBD patients are lower than in the general population. Latitude did not influence the association between IBD and vitamin D.

In Crohn's disease patients, vitamin D concentrations were inversely associated with disease activity measured by the Harvey Bradshaw index, and in UC vitamin D deficiency was associated with elevated calprotectin > 100 mg/kg. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with low bone mineral density. Vitamin D is important in some immune-mediated diseases although its role in IBD inflammation is not fully elucidated. Retrospective studies have shown an association between higher levels of vitamin D and remission rates, and durability of response to anti-TNF therapy. It is unclear whether this association is due to confounding by increased disease activity associated with lower vitamin D (although controlled for in these studies).

Limited data exist on the impact of vitamin D supplementation on clinical disease course in IBD. A small double-blind randomised controlled trial of 108 patients with Crohn's disease treated with 1200 IU daily of oral vitamin D3 or placebo for 1 year just failed to reach significance with 13% in the intervention group versus 29% in the placebo group experiencing a clinical relapse (p = 0.06). Small uncontrolled studies show that high-dose vitamin D improves clinical indices in Crohn's disease. Vitamin D status should be routinely measured in IBD and deficiency should be corrected using oral supplementation, with evidence that this reduces risk of bone disease; but as yet the impact of vitamin D on inflammation in IBD and its impact on disease course, and the optimal vitamin D level as a goal of treatment is poorly understood.

### Managing vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease [^116M9s5w]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; ie, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are at risk of developing extraintestinal manifestations like osteopenia and osteoporosis due to several factors, including vitamin D deficiency. However, apart from classical effects on bone mineralisation, vitamin D also has distinct immunological functions influencing cell proliferation and differentiation, immunomodulation and the gut microbiome and, recently, its deficiency has been implicated in the development of anaemia of chronic disease. In vitro studies have identified a number of mechanisms by which the biological active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, may reduce inflammation. For example, treatment with 1,25(OH) 2 D suppresses the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway, thereby reducing downstream expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and by acting as a ligand-activated transcription factor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) directly regulates cytokine gene expression.

These observations have facilitated a huge interest in the possible pathogenic influence of vitamin D on the clinical course of IBD, especially as a growing body of evidence has suggested that high concentrations of circulating proinflammatory biomarkers, for example, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and C reactive protein (CRP) are linked with vitamin D deficiencyand that anti-inflammatory cytokine levels are downregulated during summer in association with increased serum (s)-25(OH)D levels. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency is more frequent in IBD as compared with the general population, especially in Crohn's disease.

Consistent with this knowledge, several clinical studies have been performed linking vitamin D levels with meaningful clinical outcomes in IBD. Independent of other variables, lower vitamin D levels associates with a greater risk of clinical relapse. Vitamin D insufficiency may increase the risk of flaring IBD, as it is a negative modulator of proinflammatory cascades, causing intestinal epithelial barrier defects, an escalated immune response and intestinal destruction.

The aim of the present paper is to summarise current evidence as well as propose a practical guideline based on recent clinical studies on how to manage vitamin D deficiency in patients with IBD in the clinical setting.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^113VzX4V]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D and inflammatory bowel disease.

Another indication where vitamin D supplementation may be of therapeutic benefit is in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in particular Crohn disease (CD). Although CD is often considered an autoimmune condition, it is likely driven by defects in intestinal innate immunity. The genetics of CD are compelling, as they reveal the importance of variations in innate immune signaling pathways, notably those controlling autophagy, in the etiology of the disease. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent in patients with CD owing to the combination of chronic inflammation, intestinal malabsorption of vitamin D, and lifestyle. Although vitamin D deficiency has long been associated with CD, recent evidence provides a strong mechanistic basis for a role of deficiency in the pathogenesis of CD. For example, the gene encoding the pattern recognition receptor NOD2 (also known as IBD1) is a direct target of 1,25(OH) 2 D signaling. GWASs revealed that NOD2 gene mutations disrupting its pattern recognition domain contribute strongly to CD development.

Vitamin D plays an important role in bone homeostasis. We aimed to report the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and risk factors associated with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration in children with IBD. Risk factors for deficiency of this vitamin are similar to those in healthy children, with the addition of higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Both patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are at risk for hypovitaminosis D.

### The real-world impact of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory bowel disease clinical outcomes [^111Vbfwq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Vitamin D deficiency is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and linked to adverse outcomes, yet the therapeutic role of vitamin D supplementation remains uncertain. We evaluated the real-world impact of vitamin D supplementation on corticosteroid use, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations in patients with IBD.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with IBD patients seen in the national Veterans Health Administration system from 2000 to 2023. All patients who had a vitamin D lab assay without a vitamin D prescription in the preceding three months were included. We used the quasi-experimental design with difference-in-differences analysis to compare vitamin D-treated and untreated groups before and after the 25-hydroxyvitamin D assay. Sensitivity analyses used regression discontinuity design (RDD) and inverse probability weighting (IPW) regression to confirm results from the primary analysis.

Results

Among 5,021 IBD patients (median age 63; 89% male; 58% ulcerative colitis, 39% Crohn's disease, 3% indeterminate colitis), the median 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 23 ng/mL, and 41% received vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with reduction in IBD-related ED visits by 2.17% (34.4% RRR, p = 0.007), hospitalizations by 2.64% (53.18% relative risk reduction (RRR), p = 0.003), and corticosteroid prescriptions by 1.29% (25.13% RRR, p = 0.066). Similar results were seen in the inverse probability weighted regression and RDD analyses.

Conclusion

Vitamin D supplementation was associated with reduced IBD-related ED visits, hospitalizations, and corticosteroid use, supporting its potential as a low-cost adjunct in IBD management. Prospective studies are needed to optimize dosing strategies and define target serum levels for improved long-term outcomes.

### Managing vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease [^111SzpRY]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

A recent prospective study evaluated subjective and objective markers of intestinal inflammation as well as the faecal microbiota, following vitamin D replacement in patients with active and inactive ulcerative colitis and in non-IBD controls. Vitamin D deficiency was defined by 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L. Twenty-five individuals participated (eight with active disease, nine with quiescent disease as well as eight non-IBD controls). The study showed for the first time that replacement with 40 000 IU vitamin D 3 once weekly for 8 weeks in patients with active ulcerative colitis improved objective markers of inflammation, including faecal calprotectin, platelet counts, albumin as well as disease activity scores. However, the overall microbiota diversity was unchanged, suggesting that vitamin D reduces intestinal inflammation independently of faecal bacterial composition.

Although the available studies have confounders or limitations (eg, variation in cut-off levels of s-25(OH)D values used to define 'deficiency'; differences in study populations and designs, including inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as activity scores applied; treatment doses; and outcomes) and as direct comparisons between studies are complicated by the lack of a standardisation between various assays used to measure 25(OH)D levels, they seem to support the concept of vitamin D having anti-inflammatory effects in IBD.

### Report on the vitamin D status of adult and pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease and its significance for bone health and disease [^1139C7Kv]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a hormone responsible for calcium homeostasis and essential for bone mineralization throughout the lifespan. Recent studies revealed a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among healthy adults and children, especially in the northern hemisphere, and a link between this condition and suboptimal bone health. Moreover, maintenance of what are today considered optimal vitamin D stores has not been achieved throughout the year with currently recommended daily intake for vitamin D. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is even higher among adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a situation that may be caused by malabsorption and gastrointestinal losses through an inflamed intestine, among other factors. In children with IBD, existing reports of vitamin D status are scarce. The relationship between vitamin D status and bone health, although well-established in healthy adults and children, has been controversial among adults and children with IBD, and the reasons for this have not been investigated to date. Studies in animal models of colitis and in vitro human studies support a role of vitamin D in the regulation of the immune system of the gut and the potential of vitamin D and its derivatives as therapeutic adjuncts in the treatment of IBD. This role of vitamin D has not been investigated with translational studies to date. Currently, there are no guidelines for monitoring vitamin D status, treating hypovitaminosis D, and maintaining optimal vitamin D stores in patients with IBD. These tasks may prove particularly difficult because of malabsorption and gastrointestinal losses that are associated with IBD.

### Vitamin D and Crohn's disease in the adult patient: a review [^1137rrKn]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized as a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Current consensus surrounding the cause of the disease suggests a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, the intestinal microbiome and environmental factors, leading to the aberrant Th1 and Th17 immune cell mediated response. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CD patients, and long-standing deficiency has been associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Accumulating evidence now suggests that in addition to maintaining skeletal integrity, vitamin D also plays an integral role in regulating the general immune response, a function employed via its genomic actions on the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR is expressed in all immune cells and both directly and indirectly targeted by the bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Impaired regulation or deficiency of the vitamin has been linked to the promotion of self-reactive T cell development, loss of immune tolerance to self-structures, and experimental colitis in animal models, whereas the subsequent administration of the vitamin in these models resulted in the improvement of immune-mediated symptoms. In addition, low vitamin D has been associated with disease activity in CD patients, and supplementation appears to be beneficial in improving clinical scores and reducing inflammation. Therefore, the primary aims of this article were to review the molecular evidence supporting the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D and its supplementation in the CD patient, based on existing literature. The physiological processes, accepted serum concentration values, and its well-recognized role in bone health were also summarized.

### Efficacy and safety of high-dose cholecalciferol in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving infliximab [^115HRjKd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of high-dose, interval cholecalciferol administration in patients with IBD receiving infliximab.

Methods

This prospective, longitudinal, open-label study enrolled pediatric and young adult patients with IBD and vitamin D deficiency. Subjects received 50,000 IU every 4 to 5weeks (n = 11) or 100,000 IU every 6 to 8weeks (n = 32) of oral cholecalciferol for 1 year. Dosing was directly observed and administered in conjunction with infliximab infusions. The primary endpoint was vitamin D sufficiency, defined as a 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OHD) level ≥ 30ng/mL.

Results

Forty-three participants constituted the primary analysis population. 25-OHD levels reached steady-state after the third dose, and mean increases in 25-OHD levels were 8 vs. 4.5ng/mL in the 100,000 IU vs. 50,000 IU treatment groups, respectively. Only 43.8% of patients receiving 100,000 IU and 18.2% of patients receiving 50,000 IU achieved sufficiency. There was no difference in the 25-OHD level responsiveness in patients with Crohn disease versus those with ulcerative colitis (P = 0.72). There was no correlation between 25-OHD levels and clinical disease activity in patients with Crohn disease (P = 0.85) or ulcerative colitis (P = 0.24).

Conclusions

Supplementation with cholecalciferol was well-tolerated and direct observation is a promising paradigm for ensuring compliance with therapy. Patients with IBD, however, appear to require high doses of cholecalciferol, with less than half of patients (37% overall) achieving vitamin D sufficiency. Additional studies are necessary to determine the optimal treatment regimens.

### Managing vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease [^113iV52K]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, only a few RCTs have examined the effects of vitamin D supplementation on outcome of IBD. In a small trial of Crohn's disease in remission, 94 patients were randomised to either 1200 IU of vitamin D3 daily or similar placebo. The trial concluded that supplementation for 12 months modestly increased s-25(OH)D levels and non-significantly (p = 0.06) reduced the proportion of patients with clinical relapse from 29% to 13%.

Supplementing all patients with the same amount of vitamin D might, however, result in patients with a low basal level not reaching the therapeutic threshold. Nevertheless, this was not relevant in an intervention study on 18 patients with Crohn's diseasewho applied a design focusing on achieving 25(OH)D levels of 100 nmol/L, instead of receiving a fixed daily dose of vitamin D. After 6 months, the authors reported a highly significant reduction in disease activity scores. Unfortunately, this study had certain shortcomings, including a very small study cohort and the lack of a control group.

An RCT including 90 patients with quiescent ulcerative colitiscompared effects of a single intramuscular injection of a very high vitamin D dose (300 000 IU) with an intramuscular injection of 1 mL saline (placebo). Systemic inflammation, measured as level of serum CRP, was assessed 3 months after intervention showing a decrease in the group receiving vitamin D3.

To address some of the problems with under-dosing of vitamin D in different trials, a recent prospective pilot study of 10 patients with active IBD and a s-25(OH)D level < 75 nmol/L used oral doses of 5000–10 000 U/day. Dose adjustments were performed 4 weekly, aiming at a target level of 100–126 nmol/L. Peroral doses used in the protocol were 5000–10 000 U/day. Over the 12 weeks of the study, the mean increase was 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL), with most patients needing at least one 4-week period of 10 000 U/day. Target or near-target was achieved in all participants over 12 weeks, and though a signal for hypercalciuria was noted in one patient, the regimen was well tolerated, and symptom-based activity scores improved.

### Association between vitamin C, D, and K intake and inflammatory bowel disease risk: findings from 2009 to 2010 NHANES [^114U7opT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract affecting 4.9 million people worldwide. The past few decades have seen a rising global burden of IBD, characterized by sharp increases in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in both developed and developing countries. China and the United States (US) have the largest number of prevalent cases, mortality, and DALYs of IBD in the world, with substantial healthcare and societal burdens. Identifying modifiable causes and risk factors of IBD is crucial in guiding further prevention and intervention programs to reduce the disease burden.

Research highlights that diet, lifestyle, environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, and gut microbiota significantly influence IBD development. In recent years, dietary trace elements, such as vitamins C, D, and K, have garnered increasing research interest due to the commonly observed nutritional deficiency in IBD patients. These vitamins are considered to be beneficial to health due to their antioxidant, immune-regulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects, and their deficiency may be related to various inflammatory diseases, including IBD. For instance, vitamin D is a well-established immune modulator involved in immune cell differentiation, T-cell antigen receptor signaling, gut microbiota modulation, gene transcription, and barrier integrity. Both animal models and epidemiological studies have consistently shown a significant association between low vitamin D levels and increased IBD. These findings suggest that vitamin D may be a contributing factor to IBD development, and vitamin D supplementation may be a cost-effective approach for IBD treatment.

### Vitamin D metabolites are lower with active Crohn's disease and spontaneously recover with development of remission [^117UGA3n]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The association between active IBD and vitamin D deficiency has led investigators to study vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for IBD in a series of small studies that have yielded mixed results. – In the largest study, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 94 CD patients in remission were randomized to receive either 1200 IU vitamin D 3, or placebo, once daily for 1 year. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of clinical relapses from 29% to 13% (p = 0.06). A further study in UC supplementing participants with 40,000 IU vitamin D 3 for 8 weeks, using an inactive UC and non-IBD control groups, found a reduction in faecal calprotectin and simple clinical colitis score, but not the partial Mayo score. However, a pilot randomized open-label study treated 124 UC and CD patients with either 150,000 IU vitamin D 3 daily, elemental calcium or no treatment and showed no improvement in disease activity scores with vitamin D supplementation.

Our group has recently shown in a mouse model, that circulating 25(OH)D 3 and the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 acutely drop after inducing colitis with dextran sodium sulphate, associated with an increase in gene expression of the CYP24A1. Further, in a large Australian cohort of patients with CD in steroid-free remission, a low 25(OH)D level did not predict subsequent relapse which would otherwise be expected if vitamin D deficiency predisposed to intestinal inflammation.

We hypothesized that the circulating serum 25(OH)D 3 concentrations will be lower in patients with active CD as a result of active catabolism of 25(OH)D 3 to downstream metabolites, such as 24,25(OH) 2 D 3. Further, we hypothesized that these changes will reverse with resolution of inflammation.

The aim of this study was to characterise the effect of intestinal inflammation on the metabolism of vitamin D, by examining a range of vitamin D metabolites in the setting of active and inactive CD.

### Vitamin D and microbiome: molecular interaction in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis [^117Mb8VE]. The American Journal of Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Studies of systemic autoimmune diseases point to characteristic microbial patterns in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Autoimmune diseases, and IBD in particular, show a predisposition to vitamin D deficiency, leading to alterations in the microbiome and disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. This review examines the role of the gut microbiome in IBD and discusses how vitamin D-vitamin D receptor (VDR)-associated molecular signaling pathways contribute to the development and progression of IBD through their effects on gut barrier function, the microbial community, and immune system function. The present data demonstrate that vitamin D promotes the proper function of the innate immune system by acting as an immunomodulator, exerting anti-inflammatory effects, and critically contributing to the maintenance of gut barrier integrity and modulation of the gut microbiota, mechanisms that may influence the IBD development and progression. VDR regulates the biological effects of vitamin D and is related to environmental, genetic, immunologic, and microbial aspects of IBD. Vitamin D influences the distribution of the fecal microbiota, with high vitamin D levels associated with increased levels of beneficial bacterial species and lower levels of pathogenic bacteria. Understanding the cellular functions of vitamin D-VDR signaling in intestinal epithelial cells may pave the way for the development of new treatment strategies for the therapeutic armamentarium of IBD in the near future.

### Factors affecting vitamin D deficiency in active inflammatory bowel diseases [^113oV9Dy]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and may be associated with disease activity.

Aim

This study evaluated vitamin D (VitD) status in an Italian cohort of IBD patients, not taking VitD supplementation. We investigated risk factors for VitD deficiency and its correlation with disease activity.

Methods

VitD levels were measured in 300 consecutive outpatients (42% with Crohn's Disease (CD) and 58% with ulcerative colitis (UC), 56% male) from a tertiary referral center. Data from the IBD cohort were compared with those of 234 healthy controls, matched by sex, age, and the month in which VitD levels were measured.

Results

The mean VitD level in IBD patients was significantly lower than in controls (18.9 ng/ml vs. 25 ng/ml, p < 0.001) when accounting for gender, age, and season. VitD deficiency was present in 62% of IBD patients. Risk factors for deficiency were: age < 40 and ≥ 60 years, winter, previous surgery, C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 0.5 mg/dl, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≥ 20 mm/h. In multivariate analysis, VitD levels were negatively influenced by disease location and CRP in UC.

Conclusions

Although VitD deficiency was more prevalent than expected in healthy controls living in a Mediterranean country not at high risk of hypovitaminosis D, it was more common and severe in IBD patients. This study also found an association between VitD status and disease activity.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: association with disease activity and quality of life [^112to3WK]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of vitamin D deficiency in an IBD cohort. It was hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased disease activity and lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study. Harvey-Bradshaw index and ulcerative colitis disease activity index were used to assess disease activity. Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores were used to assess HRQOL. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency and its association with disease activity and HRQOL.

Results

The study included 504 IBD patients (403 Crohn's disease [CD] and 101 ulcerative colitis [UC]) who had a mean disease duration of 15.5 years in CD patients and 10.9 years in UC patients; 49.8% were vitamin D deficient, with 10.9% having severe deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with older age (P = .004) and older age at diagnosis (P = .03). Vitamin D deficiency was associated with lower HRQOL (regression coefficient -2.21, 95% confidence interval, -4.10 to -0.33) in CD but not UC (regression coefficient 0.41, 95% CI, -2.91 to 3.73). Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with increased disease activity in CD (regression coefficient 1.07, 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.71).

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD and is independently associated with lower HRQOL and greater disease activity in CD. There is a need for prospective studies to assess this correlation and examine the impact of vitamin D supplementation on disease course.

Response to biologicals

Only few studies have explored the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and the probability of remission while on a certain medication. However, among 37 patients with Crohn's disease, a rapid increase of s-25(OH)D was observed in responders to TNF inhibitors, and recently, similar observations were noticed in ulcerative colitis as well. Moreover, a single-centre cohort study of 101 patients with IBD revealed that pretreatment levels of 25(OH)D influenced durability of TNF inhibitors. This trial supported the relevance of both correcting and maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in IBD ≥ 75 nmol/L to reduce the risk of flares and to optimise response to targeted medical regimens. Finally, a retrospective study on 384 patients with IBD treated with biologics concluded that IBD patients with normal s-25(OH)D levels at the initiation of treatment with a TNF inhibitor had a 2.6-fold increased chance of reaching remission within 3 months as compared with those patients with low vitamin D concentrations. Nevertheless, a Canadian prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) in 28 patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease scheduled for infliximab stratified patients into those having low (ie, < 75 nmol/L) or normal s-25(OH)D levels. The patients got their induction therapy with infliximab, and at week 14, vitamin D-deficient patients were supplemented with intramuscular cholecalciferol and reassessed at week 22. Unexpectedly, this study showed that those with low vitamin D levels had a higher rate of clinical remission than those with normal levels both at week 14 and week 22 (80% vs 23% (p = 0.007) and 79% vs 17% (p = 0.005), respectively). There is no obvious explanation for this outcome, emphasising that there is still unclarified mechanistically issues about vitamin D in IBD.

### Vitamin D metabolites are lower with active Crohn's disease and spontaneously recover with development of remission [^1142rSLw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background:

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with active Crohn's disease (CD). However, it remains unclear if lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is the cause, or consequence, of intestinal inflammation. Existing literature has focused on circulating 25(OH)D rather than the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D, or its breakdown product, 24,25(OH) 2 D. We aimed to characterise vitamin D metabolism in a cohort of patients with active and inactive CD.

Methods:

Fifty-four patients with CD and not on corticosteroids or vitamin D supplements, were enrolled in a 6-month prospective cohort study. Sera were collected on enrolment and at 6 months and tested for 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, 24,25(OH) 2 D using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy as well as vitamin-D-binding protein.

Results:

There were no differences in 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH) 2 D levels between participants with active versus inactive disease. Levels of 24,25(OH) 2 D were significantly lower in those with active compared with inactive disease (mean 3.9 versus 6.0 µmol/l; p = 0.007) and therefore the ratio of 25(OH)D:24,25(OH) 2 D was higher (mean 17.3 versus 11.1; p = 0.001). In those patients with active disease who achieved remission, there was a mean increase in 25(OH)D of 32.3 nmol/l (i.e. to a level in the sufficient range) and 24,25(OH) 2 D of 2.1 µmol/l. These increases were not seen in patients with persistently active or inactive disease.

Conclusion:

Levels of 24,25(OH) 2 D, but not 25(OH)D, were lower in patients with active CD, and spontaneously increased with resolution of underlying inflammation. The utility of 24,25(OH) 2 D as a biomarker of disease activity and vitamin D status in CD warrants further exploration.

Clinical investigations of the impact of vitamin D on natural history of IBD

Several studies on vitamin D supplementation have supported a beneficial effect of vitamin D in IBD. In the Nurses' Health Study cohort of 72 719 individuals, women with the predicted highest vitamin D levels had a significantly lower risk of incident Crohn's disease. Moreover, a cross-sectional study reported an inverse association between s-25(OH)D and disease activity in 182 patients with Crohn's disease, as patients with quiescent disease had a significant higher median s-25(OH)D levels than those with active disease. Furthermore, a case–control study in patients with IBD investigated colonic biopsies using immunohistochemistry showing a decreased VDR expression in areas with a high histological evidence of inflammation.

To address the causation question, a prospective study of 70 patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission followed for 1 year reported that a s-25(OH)D level below 87.5 nmol/L was associated with an increased risk of flaring disease. Similarly, a prospective 5-year longitudinal study involving 965 patients with IBD found an association between vitamin D and health-related outcome. Low (ie, < 75 nmol/L) 25(OH)D levels were monitored in 30% of patients at study entryand during the follow-up, and these patients required significantly more medications (glucocorticoids, biologicals and narcotics), CT scans, hospitalisations and surgery, than did those with 25(OH)D levels of ≥ 75 nmol/L. 13 To further control for the effect of disease severity on 25(OH)D levels, a subgroup analysis of patients in clinical remission at study entry was performed. In this group, more patients with low versus normal 25(OH)D levels required either glucocorticoids (51% and 37%, respectively) or IBD-related surgery (34% and 22%, respectively). Moreover, among patients with low vitamin D levels who received vitamin D supplementation, a progressively reduced healthcare utilisation was observed during the 5-year follow-up, whereas those with low 25(OH)D levels without any such supplementation oppositely increased their healthcare utilisation. This extensive study with a comprehensive IBD cohort associated low s-25(OH)D to a multiplicity of outcomes and has added substantial information to the increasing amount of evidence between 25(OH)D levels and outcomes in IBD. Finally, another comprehensive prospective study of 3217 patients with IBD also revealed that low 25(OH)D (ie, < 50 nmol/L) was associated with a higher risk of IBD-related surgery and hospitalisations and that patients with Crohn's disease who normalised their 25(OH)D level at the same time reduced the risk of IBD-related surgery.

Mechanisms behind action of vitamin D

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid hormone with endocrine and autocrine functions. The primary endocrine function of vitamin D is the maintenance of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. The autocrine function of vitamin D depends on genetic transcription unique to the cell type expressing the vitamin D receptor (VDR). One such autocrine effect is the modulation of inflammatory pathways, which plays a role in several diseases, including IBD.

Serum levels of 25(OH)D are used to define vitamin D deficiency and are considered as the best indicator of body stores of vitamin D. The threshold for levels of 'deficiency' are largely based on physiological levels required to avoid elevated levels of parathyroid hormone and to maintain bone health, and even these remain a contentious issue in the scientific literature. Some expert recommendations, including a statement from The Endocrine Society, consider s-25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/L (ie, 20 ng/mL) as deficiency and levels in the range of 50–75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL) as insufficiency. However, the US Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) defines deficiency as a s-25(OH)D level below 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) and insufficiency as 25(OH)D levels in the range of 30–50 nmol/L (12–20 ng/mL). This cut-off is, however, based on population-based studies in the United States focused on bone health, and it has been suggested that immunomodulatory and other non-skeletal effects benefit from even higher concentrations (ie, 75 nmol/L).

### Vitamin D supplementation: guidelines and evidence for subclinical deficiency [^116p1oAq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recommendations from the 2011 US Institute of Medicine report (on vitamin D) and the new guideline from the US Endocrine Society with emphasis on treating and preventing vitamin D deficiency, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease and prior gastric bypass.

Recent Findings

The US Institute of Medicine Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D is 400IU per day for children younger than 1 year of age, 600IU per day for children at least 1 year of age and adults up to 70 years, and 800IU per day for older adults. The US Institute of Medicine concluded that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] of 20ng/ml or more will cover the requirements of 97.5% of the population. The US Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline suggested that 400–1000IU per day may be needed for children aged less than 1 year, 600–1000IU per day for children aged 1 year or more, and 1500–2000IU per day for adults aged 19 years or more to maintain 25(OH)D above the optimal level of 30ng/ml. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease even in a quiescent state and those with gastric bypass malabsorb vitamin D and need more vitamin D to sustain their vitamin D status.

Summary

Difference in the recommendations from the US Institute of Medicine and the US Endocrine Society's Practice Guideline reflects different goals and views on current evidence. Significant gaps remain in the literature, and studies of vitamin D treatment assessing changes in outcomes at different 25(OH)D levels are needed.

### Mechanisms of disease: vitamin D and inflammatory bowel disease [^11317Dzu]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Until recently, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3))-the active form of vitamin D-was thought to function primarily as a regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism. More diverse functionality was indicated by the discovery of the vitamin D receptor in tissues that are not involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Detection of the vitamin D receptor in monocytes and activated T cells has sparked interest in the immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D. Here, we review the role of vitamin D in regulation of the immune system, and evidence for its involvement in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Vitamins and minerals in inflammatory bowel disease [^114VLjJA]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Indiscriminate use of multivitamin/mineral supplements in the general population may be misguided, but patients with chronic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) should be monitored and compensated for nutritional deficiencies. Mechanistic links between vitamin/mineral deficiencies and IBD pathology has been found for some micronutrients and normalizing their levels is clinically beneficial. Others, like vitamin A, although instinctively desirable, produced disappointing results. Restoring normal levels of the selected micronutrients requires elevated doses to compensate for defects in absorptive or signaling mechanisms. This article describes some aspects of vitamin and mineral deficiencies in IBD, and summarizes pros and cons of supplementation.

### Serum vitamin D levels and long-term risk of elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease: a large-scale prospective cohort study [^113ZCdxJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is considered as a potential immunomodulator in inflammatory bowel disease development; however, emerging evidence remains inconsistent. We aimed to investigate the prospective association between serum vitamin D level and long-term risk of elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease in a large-scale cohort.

Methods

Participants without inflammatory bowel disease at enrollment from the UK Biobank were included. Baseline blood samples were collected and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels were measured. Participants were classified as having vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L), insufficiency (50–75 nmol/L) or sufficiency (≥ 75 nmol/L) based on predefined cutoffs. Primary outcome was incident elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of related associations were determined using multivariable Cox regression.

Results

Among 357,656 participants (mean age, 57.9 ± 6.9 years), 196,499 (54.9%) and 121,035 (33.8%) had vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, respectively. During a median 13.3 years follow-up, 1622 elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease cases were identified. Compared with vitamin D sufficiency, no associations with vitamin D deficiency (HR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78–1.07) or insufficiency (HR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73–1.01) were observed for elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease. Similarly, no associations with per 10 nmol/L increase of serum 25(OH)D were detected for elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease (HR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.03), ulcerative colitis (HR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.03), or Crohn disease (HR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97–1.05). Compared with the lowest quartile, no associations with higher quartiles of serum 25(OH)D were observed for inflammatory bowel disease (HR Q4VSQ1 = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89–1.19), ulcerative colitis (HR Q4VSQ1 = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90–1.26), or Crohn disease (HR Q4VSQ1 = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73–1.20). Further sensitivity and subgroup analyses demonstrated similar results.

Conclusions

Serum vitamin D level or deficiency status is not associated with the development of elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn disease.

### Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on disease course in inflammatory bowel disease patients: systematic review with meta-analysis [^111MR1vX]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The vitamin D role in bone metabolism is well known; however, recent evidence suggests the impact of vitamin D in immune modulation and its implications in immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Method

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis by a specific protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42022311184; March 2022, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID = 311184). Randomized clinical trials involving IBD patients treated with vitamin D supplementation, compared with placebo, that evaluated the risk of clinical relapse and disease activity were included. Literature search was performed using Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL through January 2022.

Results

Out of 1448 articles, 12 (11 full-texts and 1 abstract) were included. Seven randomized clinical trials reported data on the clinical relapse as dichotomous outcome, while 7 studies reported data on disease activity expressed as continuous variables. The pooled risk ratio of clinical relapse was 0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.89; I2 = 25%) among 458 IBD patients. However, this seems to be solid only in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In fact, only 2 studies, involving 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, were included in the analysis. CD patients in clinical remission had a strong significant risk reduction in clinical relapse (risk ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.82; I2 = 0%), suggesting that it could be a specific subgroup with maximum clinical benefit of vitamin D supplementation.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis shows that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of clinical relapse in IBD patients, especially in CD patients in clinical remission. In a subgroup analysis, it was not significant (due to small number of studies and low number of patients), and well-powered studies are needed, in particular for ulcerative colitis patients.

### Vitamin D metabolites are lower with active Crohn's disease and spontaneously recover with development of remission [^112ECsLd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Active Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are associated with vitamin D deficiency in many – but not all studies. Vitamin D deficiency is defined by a 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration in serum, or plasma, cut-off of < 50 nmol/l. There are a number of factors that could account for the association between vitamin D deficiency and active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as corticosteroid use, reduced sunlight exposure and reduced vitamin D oral intake or absorption.

Vitamin D is acquired from diet, or through dermal synthesis, predominantly in the form of vitamin D 3. Vitamin D 2 is produced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of ergosterols in plants but contributes modestly to the total circulating vitamin D, except in populations with vitamin-D 2 -supplemented food. Vitamins D 2 and D 3 undergo comparable metabolism, so when vitamin D 3 metabolism is referred to, it also applies to vitamin D 2 metabolites. Vitamin D 3 undergoes 25-hydroxylation in the liver by the cytochrome p450 enzyme, CYP2R1, to produce 25(OH)D 3, which has little biological activity. The majority (85–90%) of 25(OH)D 3 circulates tightly bound to the vitamin-D-binding protein (VDBP). The remaining non-VDBP-bound fraction (bioavailable 25(OH)D 3) is bound to albumin with less than 1% of 25(OH)D 3 unbound or free. It has been proposed that the free, or bioavailable, 25(OH)D 3 may be more physiologically relevant than total 25(OH)D 3, although this has not been formally evaluated. Circulating 25(OH)D 3 is further hydroxylated in the kidney and extra-renal tissues by the 1α-hydroxylase CYP27B1 to produce the metabolically active 1,25(OH) 2 D 3. 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 exerts its actions principally through binding to a nuclear vitamin D receptor. Changing concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and 25(OH)D 3 modulate the expression of the CYP24A1 which is responsible for the production of 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (24,25(OH) 2 D 3), 1α,25(OH) 2 D 3–26,23S-lactone and calcitroic acid (1α-hydroxy-23-carboxy-24,25,26,27-tetranorvitamin D 3). While 24-hydroxylase CYP24A1 is most abundant in the proximal and distal tubules of the kidney, it has also been detected in essentially all vitamin D target tissues including the colon.

### Vitamin D and gastrointestinal diseases: inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer [^111jmYTn]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Over the past 5 years, there has been a rapid resurgence of interest in vitamin D outside of its traditional role in metabolic bone disease. Some nontraditional roles ascribed to vitamin D include anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects. These effects have led to possible implications in the pathophysiology of immune-mediated diseases including multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, vitamin D insufficiency has been linked to higher rates of cancers including colon, prostate and breast cancers. Given these diverse associations of vitamin D and disease states, this review describes recent advances with regard to vitamin D and gastrointestinal diseases, in particular IBD and colorectal cancer.

Table 2
Description of the main biases of the clinical trials that investigated the effects of vitamin D on inflammatory bowel diseases

Although we only included studies with active disease patients, there was a wide variation in the doses administered (daily oral doses of 1000–50,000 IU, 150,000/3 months, or a single injectable dose of 300,000 IU). The treatment duration ranged from 1 day for 300,000 IU, to 8 days for 60,000 IU, and 8 weeks to 1 year for the other doses.

All studies showed significant improvement in serum VD levels after supplementation (Table 1). The studies of Emani et al and Sharif et al, who used a single injectable dose of 300,000 IU, reported a mean level of 40.8 ± 5.2 ng/mL. Ahamed et al achieved similar values (40.83 ng/mL) with a daily dose of 60,000 IU/8 days. Even higher values of 46.14 ± 12.7 and 45 ± 19 ng/mL were obtained by Baffuto et al and Yang et al, respectively (although half of the patients included in this last study, who received 5000 IU, did not reach values greater than 40 ng/mL). The lowest initial (10.58 ± 3.82 in CD and 10.68 ± 4.11 in UC) and final (23.04 ± 9.66 for CD and 28.09 ± 11.6 for UC) VD values were seen in the study of Tan et al. Karimi et al observed the lowest percentage increases in serum VD levels: the group that received 2000 IU presented 21.83 ± 9.69 at baseline, and 28.99 ± 8.69 after 12 weeks, while the group that received 1000 IU presented 24.37 ± 8.14 initally and 28.75 ± 11.90 ng/mL after 12 weeks. In the study of Bafutto et al, the authors compared supplementation with 2000 (G1), 10,000 (G2), and 50,000 IU (G3)/week and concluded that the highest dose is the best for VD replacement (G1 19.5 ± 5.1 at baseline and 26 ± 6.7 at the end of the study, P = 0.07; G2: 19.1 ± 4.1/26 ± 5.8, P = 0.04; and G3: 19.5 ± 6.4/46.4 ± 12.7, P < 0.001). This study, and the trial performed by Ahamed et al that used 60,000 IU daily for 8 days, showed a higher percentage of augmenting serum levels of VD.

### Manipulating bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease patients [^112t3kKn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

IBD is frequently complicated with bone loss. Inflammatory processes, malnutrition, Vitamin D deficiency and drugs can play a role in the enhanced bone loss, and general risk factors like age, postmenopausal state, body mass index have to be taken into consideration, as well.

The actual guidelines regarding IBD-associated bone loss are nearly 10 years old. New results with the old drugshave been published, and some new therapeutic modalities have been marketed in the last decade. However, most of them are approved exclusively to treat postmenopausal bone loss. We aimed to review the recent literature on the novel therapeutic possibilities regarding IBD-related bone loss.

First, we have to perceive that diagnostic recommendations are not clear regarding IBD-associated bone loss. As most patients are under the age of peak bone mass at diagnosis, it is reasonable to use the age- and gender-matched Z-score for the diagnosis, instead of the WHO-advised T-score. Most of the authors still use the T-score, because all of the recommendations are based on the WHO definitions.

Moreover, the fracture, as an endpoint of the bone loss has a different relationship to the BMD in IBD compared to the general osteoporotic population. Bone fractures occur without clinical signs more frequently in IBD compared to other populations, and fractures occur in patients with normal BMD more frequently. We need a much more accurate risk assessment system to predict fractures for proper therapy in this young population with a life-long chronic inflammatory disease.

What we can do without causing any harm is to prevent bone loss. Steroid sparing, Ca and Vitamin D supplementation, appropriate sun exposure and mild exercise could be advised to the patients. However, there is no evidence regarding the obvious benefits of these modalities.

As Ca and Vitamin D increase the serum Ca level, the higher tendency for formation of kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis should be taken into consideration. The doses of the optimal supplementation are not clear, moreover there is some discussion regarding the normal serum level of Vitamin D, and the method of Vitamin D measurement also. Supplementation which keeps the Vitamin D and Ca levels in the normal range, without marked elevation of urinary Ca excretion seems to be an acceptable strategy. Recent guidelines recommend administering Ca and Vitamin D parallel to corticosteroid induction therapy.

### Vitamin D deficiency in a European inflammatory bowel disease inception cohort: an epi-IBD study [^114Gs5pf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Serum vitamin D level is commonly low in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there is a growing body of evidence that links low vitamin D level to certain aspects of IBD such as disease activity and quality of life, data on its prevalence and how it varies across disease phenotype, smoking status and treatment groups are still missing.

Materials and Methods

Patients diagnosed with IBD between 2010 and 2011 were recruited. Demographic data and serum vitamin D levels were collected. Variance of vitamin D level was then assessed across different treatment groups, disease phenotype, disease activity and quality of life scores.

Results

A total of 238 (55.9% male) patients were included. Overall, 79% of the patients had either insufficient or deficient levels of vitamin D at diagnosis. Patients needing corticosteroid treatment at 1 year had significantly lower vitamin D levels at diagnosis (median 36.0nmol/l) (P = 0.035). Harvey-Bradshaw Index (P = 0.0001) and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index scores (P = 0.0001) were significantly lower in patients with higher vitamin D level. Serum vitamin D level correlated significantly with SIBQ score (P = 0.0001) and with multiple components of SF12. Smokers at diagnosis had the lowest vitamin D levels (vitamin D: 34nmol/l; P = 0.053).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the high prevalence of low vitamin D levels in treatment-naive European IBD populations. Furthermore, it demonstrates the presence of low vitamin D levels in patients with IBD who smoke.

### Skeletal health of children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease [^112Fe4VW]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D status in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — threshold and prevalence is outlined with a sufficiency target and reported rates of deficiency. Many investigators consider serum 25OHD above 32 ng/mL optimal in adults, and the authors state, "We recommend that the level of 32 ng/mL be considered as the minimum level of sufficiency for children and adolescents with IBD". Using a deficiency cutoff of 15 ng/mL, suboptimal vitamin D status is reported in 16% to 34% of children with IBD.

### Managing vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease [^111Ahpoz]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

As a rule of thumb, s-25(OH)D levels will increase by approximately 1 nmol/L per 1 µg (40 IU) of daily vitamin D3 supplementation. The effect is relatively more pronounced in vitamin D insufficient as compared with vitamin D-replete individuals, whereas the response decreases with increased body weight. Moreover, comparing the two most common vitamin D forms, ergo- (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), cholecalciferol seems more potent than ergocalciferol when supplemented as a large oral bolus.

Accordingly, the daily dose of vitamin D supplementation (in µg) needed to obtain a s-25(OH)D level in the target range (eg, 100 nmol/L) can be estimated as 100 minus measured s-25(OH)D level. Serum 25(OH)D levels should be remeasured after 3–4 months. If not in the target range and a lack of compliance cannot be excluded, it may be considered to recommend intake of vitamin D supplements on a weekly basis in a dose equal to the calculated daily dose. If still not in target range, a vitamin D absorption test may be performed by providing the patient a large oral dose (eg, 100 000–300 000 IU) of vitamin D. In response to such a high dose, a considerable increase in s-25(OH)D level is to be expected within 2–4 weeks. In order to assure compliance, the bolus dose should be provided under the supervision of a healthcare professional. If a response is achieved following a large oral bolus, the most likely explanation for lack of an effect of daily/weekly dosing is low compliance or relative malabsorption. If so, daily/weekly dose of vitamin D may be increased (doubled/tripled) to determine whether this may result in a s-25(OH)D level within the target range. If a substantial increase in s-25(OH)D levels is not achieved in response to a large bolus, severe malabsorption should, however, be considered. Intramuscular vitamin D injections may accordingly be needed, but this should be considered as a last option. Increased sun exposure or use for sunbeds may be considered as an alternative option. Patients should be fully informed that each episode of sun(-bed) exposure should only be for such a short time, due to a potential increased risk of skin malignancies. Time of year should be considered, as the dose of vitamin D needed to maintain a replete vitamin D status may be lower during summertime. For the same reason, we recommend measuring 25(OH)D levels at least annually (preferably during wintertime) and more frequently in case of insufficiency and/or during disease exacerbation (on a 3–4-monthly basis).

### Vitamin D metabolites are lower with active Crohn's disease and spontaneously recover with development of remission [^112TN5d7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the setting of active CD and no concurrent corticosteroids, 24,25(OH) 2 D but not 25(OH)D levels were reduced. This may be related to an innate homeostatic mechanism to maintain circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)D levels in the setting of relative deficiency. Importantly, levels of 25(OH)D spontaneously rose with the treatment of underlying inflammation, suggesting that aggressive supplementation may not be necessary. The significance of 24,25(OH) 2 D as a potential marker of vitamin D status and CD activity requires further exploration.

### Association between reduced plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D and increased risk of cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [^114YVWHz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). The effects of low plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) on outcomes other than bone health are understudied in patients with IBD. We examined the association between plasma level of 25(OH)D and risk of cancers in patients with IBD.

Methods

From a multi-institutional cohort of patients with IBD, we identified those with at least 1 measurement of plasma 25(OH)D. The primary outcome was development of any cancer. We examined the association between plasma 25(OH)D and risk of specific subtypes of cancer, adjusting for potential confounders in a multivariate regression model.

Results

We analyzed data from 2809 patients with IBD and a median plasma level of 25(OH)D of 26 ng/mL. Nearly one-third had deficient levels of vitamin D (< 20 ng/mL). During a median follow-up period of 11 years, 196 patients (7%) developed cancer, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (41 cases of colorectal cancer). Patients with vitamin D deficiency had an increased risk of cancer (adjusted odds ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–2.65) compared with those with sufficient levels. Each 1-ng/mL increase in plasma 25(OH)D was associated with an 8% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–0.96). A weaker inverse association was also identified for lung cancer.

Conclusions

In a large multi-institutional IBD cohort, a low plasma level of 25(OH)D was associated with an increased risk of cancer, especially colorectal cancer.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113cP2er]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

To summarize, cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly), due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These comprise institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use of certain concomitant medications (eg, anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (eg, denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

### Micronutrient deficiencies in older patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not associated with worse adverse clinical outcome rates [^116N3WZf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for malnutrition. Micronutrient deficiency (MND), one form of malnutrition, is common in IBD, occurring in 20–85% of patients. Because of the enteric involvement and diarrhea, Crohn's disease (CD) has a greater incidence of MND than ulcerative colitis (UC). Sufficient micronutrient levels require adequate dietary intake; therefore, etiologies of deficiency overlap significantly with those of protein and calorie malnutrition.

Since micronutrients also regulate each other's homeostasis, deficiencies can occur concomitantly. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with higher levels of hepcidin, which impairs enterocyte iron absorption. Zinc acts as important cofactor in enterocyte iron absorption, as well as via modulation of the divalent metal iron transporter-1 and ferroportin. Likewise, zinc deficiency also has been associated with iron deficiency.

Advanced age is an independent risk factor for MND in IBD and non-IBD patients. With an aging IBD population, approximately one-third of patients are currently older than 60 years. However, data on MNDs in older IBD patients is sparse. Though Juneja et al characterized individual vitamin B12, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies in a geriatric IBD population, no study has evaluated other common IBD MNDs, or the interdependency of MNDs.

Older IBD patients suffer from both disease and age-related etiologies for MNDs. Several IBD-related factors have been described, including symptoms restricting dietary intake, issues tied to metabolism and gut epithelial function, and iatrogenic causes, mainly due to medications and bowel resection. The severity of MND often coincides with IBD activity and matches the duration of the disease. With aging, comorbidities such as cancers, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, diabetes and neuropsychiatric disease increase and impair nutrient stores, dietary intake and nutrient absorption, via increased catabolism, decreased oral intake, and dysphagia. Hospitalizations due to such comorbidities can lead to interruptions in nutrient intake. Oral health deteriorates with age, leading to difficulties such as dry mouth and impaired mastication that limit dietary intake. Lastly, older adults have increased rates of physical disabilities and disadvantageous social determinants of health that also potentiate poor nutrient intake.

### Factors associated with vitamin D deficiency in a multicultural inflammatory bowel disease cohort [^116fyfBY]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in a multicultural inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort and determine predictors of deficiency including ethnicity.

Design

Patients with IBD were recruited into a dedicated database over a 6-month period and evaluated retrospectively.

Setting

Department of Gastroenterology, St George's University Hospital, London, UK.

Outcomes Measured

Clinical data including demographics, ethnic group, disease phenotype by the Montreal classification, vitamin D level and season tested were recorded from clinical and electronic medical records. Vitamin D levels were classified as normal (≥ 50nmol/l) and deficient (< 50nmol/l).

Results

168 patients had a vitamin D level measured subsequent to diagnosis. There was no significant difference in the median vitamin D level between patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (39nmol/l (IQR 23–56) vs 28nmol/l (IQR 17–51), p = 0.35). Overall the median vitamin D level was significantly lower in non-Caucasians (Asian and Black) versus Caucasians (28nmol/l (IQR 17–41) vs 41nmol/l (IQR 25–63), p < 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis revealed IBD related surgery (OR 2.9) and ethnicity (OR 6.0 non-Caucasian vs Caucasian) in CD and ethnicity (OR 5.0 non-Caucasian vs Caucasian) in UC were independently associated with vitamin D deficiency.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD patients; therefore, we suggest monitoring of vitamin D levels and correction with supplements especially in non-Caucasians and those with a history of IBD related surgery.

### Vitamin and zinc status pretreatment and posttreatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^116TVX1K]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin deficiencies are common in inflammatory bowel disease. Here we present 5-year follow-up data of 61 patients. No folate or vitamin B12 deficiency was identified throughout the study. A daily multivitamin supplement was sufficient to replete 100% of vitamin A-deficient and vitamin E-deficient patients. A total of 52% of vitamin D-deficient patients corrected, but 15% who had normal vitamin D levels at diagnosis developed deficiency. A total of 63% of zinc-deficient patients normalized their zinc status, but 15% developed zinc deficiency at follow-up despite supplementation.

### Molecular basis of vitamin D action in inflammatory bowel disease [^115DwAti]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

There is growing evidence of vitamin D involvement in immune regulation and gut barrier function, suggesting that vitamin D may play a critical role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review presents advances in the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling with respect to barrier integrity and innate/adaptive immunity in the gut, as well as recent findings in uncovering the biological link between vitamin D-associated genetic variants and IBD. Experimental data have revealed a mechanistic basis for the contribution of vitamin D to the pathogenesis of IBD. The vitamin D/VDR complex is involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogenic threats by acting as an immunomodulator and alleviating inflammation in experimental IBD models and IBD patients, contributing to intestinal homeostasis. Vitamin D has been associated with the promotion of antimicrobial peptide secretion, down-regulation of dendritic cell activity, induction of tolerogenic rather than pro-inflammatory T-cell differentiation and function, and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, highlighting its potential therapeutic value for IBD. Elucidating the complex interplay between vitamin D/VDR and the pathogenesis of IBD is critical for the development of novel therapeutic interventions and for the potential use of this molecule as a prognostic and diagnostic tool in clinical practice.

### Micronutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease: from A to zinc [^112dLK4P]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has classically been associated with malnutrition and weight loss, although this has become less common with advances in treatment and greater proportions of patients attaining clinical remission. However, micronutrient deficiencies are still relatively common, particularly in CD patients with active small bowel disease and/or multiple resections. This is an updated literature review of the prevalence of major micronutrient deficiencies in IBD patients, focusing on those associated with important extraintestinal complications, including anemia (iron, folate, vitamin B12) bone disease (calcium, vitamin D, and possibly vitamin K), hypercoagulability (folate, vitamins B6, and B12), wound healing (zinc, vitamins A and C), and colorectal cancer risk (folate and possibly vitamin D and calcium).

### Vitamin and mineral status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115MshA2]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk for vitamin and mineral deficiencies because of long-term inflammation in the gut mucosa and decreased oral intake. The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence of vitamin and zinc deficiencies in patients with newly diagnosed IBD compared with a control group.

Methods

This is a retrospective chart review of all of the patients diagnosed as having IBD from 2006 to 2010, ages 1 to 18 years. Patients who had fat- and water-soluble vitamins (A, E, D 25-OH, folate, and B(12)) and zinc levels obtained at time of diagnosis were included in the study. A total of 61 patients with IBD and 61 age- and sex-matched controls were included.

Results

None of the 61 patients with IBD had folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 62% of the patients, vitamin A deficiency in 16%, vitamin E deficiency in 5%, and zinc deficiency in 40%. The control group had vitamin D and E and zinc deficiency in 75%, 8%, and 19% patients, respectively.

Conclusions

We conclude that vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are rare in children with newly diagnosed IBD in the United States and we question whether routine monitoring is warranted. Vitamin A and zinc deficiency are common in patients with newly diagnosed IBD and levels should be assessed at the time of diagnosis so that enteral repletion can commence. Vitamin D deficiency is common in all of the children in the Buffalo, NY, area, and routine screening for this deficiency is warranted.

5.3.2 Blood tests for specific nutritional deficiencies

Statement 102. We recommend that IBD patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition should have relevant screening blood tests to assess for macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies. This may include measurement of iron stores, vitamin B12, folate, vitamins A, C, D and E, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, zinc and selenium (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93.6%).

Measurement of macronutrient and micronutrient status in IBD is important for ongoing monitoring in patients who have or are at risk of malnutrition; however, interpretation of results can be challenging. Some micronutrients are influenced by disease activity so serum levels should consider C-reactive protein (CRP) when interpreting these micronutrients. A reliable clinical interpretation can be made only if the CRP is < 20 mg/L (plasma zinc), < 10 mg/L (plasma selenium, vitamin A and vitamin D) or < 5 mg/L (vitamin B6 and vitamin C). Magnesium deficiency has been reported to occur in 13–88% of patients with IBD, but serum magnesium is not an accurate measurement of magnesium status because less than 1% of magnesium stores are in the blood. The remainder is in bone, soft tissue and muscle. Magnesium deficiency in IBD is likely to be caused by increased gastrointestinal losses. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency include abdominal cramps, impaired healing, fatigue and bone pain. Magnesium supplementation can be given orally or intravenously, although oral supplementation can worsen diarrhoea. Up to a third of patients with IBD fail to meet the recommended dietary intake for calcium and calcium supplementation should be considered alongside vitamin D supplementation (see Section 5.2.8.3: Common Disease Considerations, Calcium and vitamin D supplementation). Plasma potassium levels should be monitored and supplemented as required. There are existing ECCO guidelines for monitoring and management of iron, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. General advice about iron replacement is shown in box 9.

### Vitamin D metabolites are lower with active Crohn's disease and spontaneously recover with development of remission [^114fXtco]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To date, there has been debate on whether vitamin D deficiency is causally linked to the development, activity and complications of IBD. Many of the association studies reporting this link do not adequately control for potential confounders such as corticosteroid use, vitamin D intake and sunlight exposure. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to prospectively examine the metabolism of vitamin D using the gold standard LC/MS/MS in a cohort of patients with CD not on corticosteroids with similar disease distribution and also carefully controlling for sunlight exposure and vitamin D intake to determine the independent effect of intestinal inflammation on circulating vitamin D metabolite levels.

Contrary to existing literature, we did not find reduced 25(OH)D 3 levels in patients with active CD despite an appropriate sample size to detect this difference. There are several possible explanations for this. First, the location of the study, Sydney, Australia (latitude 33° 87' S), has a much higher UV Index compared with that of many North American and European cities from where the existing literature originates. For example, the average summer UV Index in Sydney is 9–11, whereas in Denmark, where one of the earlier association studies was performed, the average summer UV Index is 5–6. Thus, the Sydney population is likely to be more resistant to developing vitamin D deficiency, even in the face of active inflammation. Second, this study excluded patients on corticosteroids at baseline which is known to reduce 25(OH)D 3 levels and has been a confounding factor in the published literature. For example, in the previously mentioned cross-sectional Danish study, 25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated with disease activity as measured by CDAI and CRP. While the authors examined the effect of smoking and BMI as potential confounders, the use of corticosteroids was not discussed.

### Symptoms and symptom clusters in patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease: results from the IBSEN III study [^1139bpaL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency was statistically significantly associated with the impaired energy cluster. Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in patients with IBD than in the general population. This deficiency is associated with malabsorption, reduced sunlight exposure, insufficient physical activity, and reduced vitamin D intake. A meta-analysis found that a low vitamin D status was a marker for lower quality of life scores and was associated with muscle weakness and increased disease activity in patients with IBD. Even though the association between vitamin D deficiency and fatigue has been studied in IBD, no certain associations have been established. Hence, our finding is of interest and warrants further exploration. As none of the other clinical or socio-demographic variables were associated with cluster membership, this warrants an individual patient approach by health-care professionals.

### Association of selected adipokines with vitamin D deficiency in children with inflammatory bowel disease [^114pivxg]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are considered to be more severe, more extensive and associated with more frequent complications in childhood. The etiopathogenesis of IBD is not well understood, but it results from an imbalance between genetic predisposition, environmental factors and alteration of the gut microbiome. It seems that visceral fat, especially mesenteric adipose tissue, is also involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, especially in patients with CD.

Vitamin D is an important regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism related to bone health, but increasing evidence suggests its immunomodulatory abilities. It plays an important role in the composition of the intestinal microflora and also regulates immune homeostasis, especially the development and function of T cells and macrophages. In addition, vitamin D is essential for maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier by protecting against infectious and inflammatory damage. Suboptimal concentrations of vitamin D negatively affect the epithelial barrier and immune functions and lead to increased dysbiosis and possible translocation of intestinal bacteria, thereby influencing the onset and progression of IBD. Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD patients, but some studies also reported a lack of decrease in vitamin D levels in these patients. There are also different results in children with IBD pointing to an association between IBD severity, activity, therapeutic control and vitamin D levels.

Adipose tissue is an endocrine and immune organ that is significantly involved in inflammatory processes. Vitamin D affects adipogenesis, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation by suppressing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein, and by modulating the secretion of adipocytokines. Adipokines are a group of mediators primarily released by adipocytes that modulate various metabolic functions in adipose tissue, liver, brain, muscle, pancreas, and the immune system. Regulatory immune function has been identified in many of them. The role of several adipokines in intestinal inflammation has recently been investigated. The significance of vitamin D deficiency on abnormal production of adipokines in patients with IBD remains unclear.

The aim of this study was to compare the production of selected adipokines, potentially involved in the pathogenesis of IBD – adiponectin, resistin, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP-4), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP), and nesfatin-1 in affected children and healthy controls according to the presence of vitamin D deficiency.

### Managing vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease [^112vSHyH]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic vitamin D intoxication (causing hypercalcaemia and renal calcifications) is very rare and has in most instances only been reported in people with s-25(OH)D levels above 4–500 nmol/L. An increased risk of adverse events, however, appears to be related to levels of s-25(OH)D levels > 200 nmol/L. Accordingly, based on our current knowledge, it seems reasonable to aim at targeting s-25(OH)D levels in the range of 75–125 nmol/L.

From a pharmacokinetic point of view, daily and weekly oral dosing as well as providing vitamin D as a large oral or intramuscular bolus dose (months apart) has been shown to be effective in maintaining s-25(OH)D at a replete level. However, although intramuscular bolus injections tend to reach the same level as an equal total oral dose, the increase in s-25(OH)D levels occur with a month of delay following injection therapy. Furthermore, providing vitamin D as a large oral or intramuscular bolus dose has been shown to increase risk of falls and fractures in RCTs. As a consequence, the US Preventive Services Task Force as well as others have recently called for caution on use of high-dose vitamin D supplementation. Providing vitamin D supplementation as a daily dose is therefore the preferred option.

Gaps in knowledge — Key unanswered questions include whether there is a relation between bone health and vitamin D status in children with IBD, what vitamin D level benefits bone health based on large clinical trials, whether exclusive enteral nutrition and enteral supplementation benefit bone health, which exercise regimen(s) would prevent compromise and improve bone health, whether changing the therapeutic approach (e.g., early introduction of biologics vs conventional therapy vs enteral nutrition or supplementation) would be beneficial and which approach would be most beneficial, and whether "bone-active" medications such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates have a role and who would benefit.

### A systematic review of micronutrient deficiencies in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease [^111kLMW8]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This systematic review critically analyzes the current research on micronutrient deficiency in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and synthesizes these data to provide evidence-based guidelines for nutritional surveillance in this population.

Methods

We searched 5 databases (Ovid Medline, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) for studies evaluating micronutrients in patients with IBD using the following inclusion criteria: 1) original research, 2) published 1996 or later; 3) published in English; 4) human subjects; and 5) containing pediatric data. Studies were reviewed and included based on the strength of research methods. Data on the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in pediatric patients with IBD and risk factors for micronutrient deficiency in these patients were extracted from included studies and compared and discussed in preparation of the proposed guidelines and manuscript.

Results

A total of 39 studies were included in the final review. The data presented in these studies show that iron deficiency and vitamin D deficiency are common in pediatric patients with IBD. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency are rare. Zinc deficiency, while not common, occurs at a higher rate in patients with Crohn's disease than in healthy controls. There was limited data on vitamins A, E, and C, and selenium, but deficiency of these micronutrients seems rare.

Conclusions

We recommend annual surveillance of iron and vitamin D in pediatric patients with IBD regardless of disease activity or phenotype. Zinc should be monitored annually in patients with Crohn's disease. There is insufficient evidence to support routine screening for other micronutrient deficiencies.

### Vitamin D status in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease [^112vN855]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Previous studies of vitamin D status in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease have revealed conflicting results. We sought to report (1) the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration ≤ 15 ng/mL) in a large population with inflammatory bowel disease, (2) factors predisposing to this problem, and (3) its relationship to bone health and serum parathyroid hormone concentration.

Patients and Methods

A total of 130 patients (8–22 years of age) with inflammatory bowel disease, 94 with Crohn disease and 36 with ulcerative colitis, had serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, intact parathyroid hormone, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) measured at Children's Hospital Boston.

Results

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 34.6%. Mean serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration was similar in patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, 52.6% lower among patients with dark skin complexion, 33.4% lower during the winter months (December 22 to March 21), and 31.5% higher among patients who were taking vitamin D supplements. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration was positively correlated with weight and BMI z score, disease duration, and serum albumin concentration and negatively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with Crohn disease and upper gastrointestinal tract involvement were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than those without it. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin concentration was not associated with lumbar spine bone mineral density z score or serum parathyroid hormone concentration.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Factors predisposing to the problem include having a dark-skin complexion, winter season, lack of vitamin D supplementation, early stage of disease, more severe disease, and upper gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with Crohn disease. The long-term significance of hypovitaminosis D for this population is unknown at present and merits additional study.

### Vitamin D metabolites are lower with active Crohn's disease and spontaneously recover with development of remission [^114FG9C3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

When assessing the metabolism of vitamin D, levels of 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 were significantly lower in participants with active disease. This was contrary to our original hypothesis which proposed that active inflammation would lead to catabolism of 25(OH)D 3, resulting in increased concentrations of 24,25(OH) 2 D 3. One explanation could be that in the setting of active inflammation there is relative 25(OH)D 3 deficiency which leads to reduced catabolism to maintain levels of circulating 25(OH)D 3, and the metabolically active 1,25(OH) 2 D 3, which were not different between the groups in our study. When disease activity improved, levels of 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 returned to levels that were similar to those seen in patients who remained with inactive disease throughout the study period. In one other study, 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 metabolites were measured using a radioimmunoassay in well-nourished and undernourished adult CD patients (n = 40) compared with UC (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 9). In that study, 25(OH)D 3 but not 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 or 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 levels were lower in those with active CD. The disparate results from that study compared with the current study could have been due to methodological differences. For example, in this previous study, there was a large variability in the 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 measurements likely indicating the limitations of the radioimmunoassay used. In addition, disease activity was defined using a simple clinical index without supporting inflammatory markers. Symptoms of CD correlate poorly with objective markers of inflammation and therefore in our study, we included an objective marker of inflammation as part of the active disease criteria with 89% of participants having had a recent ileocolonoscopy showing active disease and others had elevation of faecal calprotectin. These factors may explain the differing results found in our study.

### The role of vitamin D in treated and refractory ulcerative colitis patients: a case-control study [^113juN7c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis is a form of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) marked by ongoing inflammation of the mucosal layer, which ranges from the rectum to the upper parts of the colon. Common symptoms of this disease include diarrhea, bloody stools, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. In some cases, extraintestinal manifestations may also be present. The diagnosis of this disease is primarily based on endoscopy, which usually reveals evidence of ongoing colonic inflammation. Biopsy specimens confirm symptoms of chronic colitis. The disease has two peak ages of onset: between 15 and 30 years old, and between 60 and 80 years old. The male-to-female ratio for this disease is 1:1.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid that can be synthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light, or it can be obtained through dietary sources. Absorption of vitamin D depends on the ability of the intestine to absorb fat. Certain types of digestive diseases can cause malabsorption of fat and as a result fat-soluble vitamins. The classical functions of vitamin D are maintaining normal blood levels of calcium and phosphorous via intestinal absorption or renal reabsorption and, thus, bone health. Vitamin D is essential for the effective operation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Additionally, It has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The availability of vitamin D is critical for the integrity of intestinal epithelium, improving barrier function, regulating mucosal immunity, and T-cell growth and function. These functions of vitamin D are beneficial for suppressing unwanted immune reactions to prevent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with various health issues, including infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes, depressive disorders, osteoporosis, autoimmune conditions, and inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

### The impact of vitamin D on response to anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy in children with inflammatory bowel disease [^114PHUyM]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D has an immunomodulatory effect on the innate and adaptive immune systems. Associations between vitamin D deficiency and development or progression of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are reported, but a cause-and-effect relationship between pretreatment 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and response to anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF) therapy is not established.

Methods

This retrospective study evaluated pediatric IBD patients who had 25(OH)D levels drawn within 3 months of initiating infliximab and/or adalimumab treatment. Demographic features, Paris classification, baseline 25(OH)D levels, disease activity, and laboratory results before and after 3 months of anti-TNF therapy were collected. The interaction between vitamin D insufficiency at induction and lack of response to anti-TNF therapy at 3 months was determined.

Results

Of the 383 patients, 76 met inclusion criteria. Sixty-five patients (85.5%) had Crohn disease (CD) and 11 (14.5%) had ulcerative colitis. Seven patients had 25(OH)D levels obtained during both infliximab and adalimumab induction; hence 83 subjects were evaluated (infliximab: 70 patients, adalimumab: 13 patients). 25(OH)D < 30ng/mL was found in 55 of 83 (66.3%) subjects. There were no differences in gender, IBD type, disease activity scores between vitamin D-sufficient and vitamin D-insufficient groups. In CD, proximal gastrointestinal tract inflammation was associated with vitamin D insufficiency (P = 0.019), but other Paris classification parameters and laboratory results were similar in 2 groups. Early termination of anti-TNF therapy was significantly higher in patients who had vitamin D insufficiency (14.5% vs 0%, P = 0.034).

Conclusions

Vitamin D insufficiency before anti-TNF treatment may result in poor response to induction therapy.

### Growth, puberty, and bone health in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease [^114RQzbK]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, vitamin D deficiency was documented in 81.7% (94/115) of patients. Vitamin D deficiency is present in 57–62% of pediatric IBD patients. Frequency of vitamin D deficiency can be different according to the different cut off level of 25(OH)D 3 (< 12 ng/mL). Disease severity can affect vitamin D intake or absorption and bile salt absorption, leading to excessive losses of dietary vitamin D. In addition, it has been suggested that vitamin D deficiency might be a contributing factor in the development of IBD, as vitamin D plays a role in affecting anti-inflammatory adaptive immune function of the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, it is essential to check serum vitamin D levels and supplement vitamin D in patients with IBD.

In the present study, vitamin D levels positively correlated with lumbar spine BMD. There have been some conflicting reports as to whether vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for low BMD. In a recent study of Asian children, female sex, older age, and low hemoglobin levels further increase risk of low BMD Z-scores rather than vitamin D status in patients with IBD. As for BMD in our study, delayed puberty was more commonly found in patients with osteoporosis, suggesting that timely pubertal development is critical for bone mass accrual. Disease-related chronic inflammation and glucocorticoid treatment are also implicated in impaired bone metabolism. Regarding the recovery of decreased BMD, a recent study showed promising result where bone formation markers such as bone alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin were increased after treatment using an anti-TNF agent. However, improvement in bone turnover markers has not led to an increase in BMD Z-score. The risk of fracture in pediatric IBD was not higher than age-, sex-, and gender-matched controls in a previous study. In contrast to pediatric patients, adults with IBD are at increased risk of hip fracture, suggesting that regular BMD examination is needed in IBD patients.

This study is limited by its reliance on anthropometric data, laboratory findings, and DXA information from medical records, and some records were not available.

Screening and monitoring of vitamin D status — children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should target sufficiency and periodic reassessment. "We recommend that the level of 32 ng/mL be considered as the minimum level of sufficiency for children and adolescents with IBD". The authors also state, "We recommend that consideration be given to monitoring vitamin D levels at least yearly, at the end of winter/beginning of spring, especially in populations with dark skin complexion (eg, Hispanics, African Americans)". They add, "It would be reasonable to obtain a 25OHD level in children with IBD and active disease, low albumin level (< 3 g/dL), and evidence of nutritional compromise". Evidence rating is provided as "Rate: Poor — C".

### Randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation to prevent seasonal influenza and upper respiratory infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111KX7Zy]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, vitamin D has been shown to have multifaceted effects on bone metabolism and has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and malignant tumors. Vitamin D deficiency is considered to reduce the adaptive and innate immune response and increase the risk of infection on the basis of in vitro and animal examinations. Various cohort studies have also indicated that serum vitamin D deficiency increases the prevalence of infectious diseases. Previously, we demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza by 40%. Moreover, it has been shown that vitamin D supplementation prevented 20% of acute respiratory infections in a meta-analysis of 25 randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

A meta-analysis indicated that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) had a 64% higher chance of vitamin D deficiency than non-IBD controls. Vitamin D deficiency in IBD is considered to be caused by an absorption disorder due to bowel inflammation or small intestine resection, inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate intake of vitamin D, or adverse effects from therapeutic drugs.

The risk of pneumonia in patients with IBD has been reported to be higher than that in patients without IBD. Patients with IBD, especially those taking medications such as corticosteroids and narcotics, are at increased risk of pneumonia. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organization has indicated that influenza infection may be more severe in patients with IBD who take immunomodulators than among those not taking them. The influenza vaccine is not considered to be as effective for patients with IBD as it is in the general population.

In patients with IBD, there have been no previous reports of the prevention of influenza and upper respiratory infection using vitamin D supplementation. We therefore conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in patients with IBD to elucidate whether preventative intake of vitamin D supplements during the winter and early spring could reduce subsequent influenza and upper respiratory infections. The intention was to clarify whether these respiratory infections are caused by immunosuppressive treatment alone or if they are preventable by vitamin D supplementation.

Skeletal health in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease — evidence summary and guideline scope indicates that "suboptimal bone health" is present "when compared with their healthy peers", is "evident from diagnosis", and its "clinical consequences and long-term outcome… are still unknown"; mechanisms "has mainly included reduced bone formation, but also reduced bone resorption", with contributing factors "inflammation, delayed growth and puberty, lean mass deficits, and use of glucocorticoids". The authors note "evidence is sparse" and state that this guideline "provide[s] recommendations on screening and monitoring", including "monitoring of parameters of growth, pubertal development, and reasons for concern; evaluation of vitamin D status and vitamin D and calcium intake; exercise; and nutritional support", and that they "report on the current evidence of the effect of biologics… as well as the role of bone active medications such as bisphosphonates", while "summariz[ing] the existing numerous gaps in knowledge".

Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — vitamin D and calcium monitoring and intake: Serum 25-OH D levels to prevent rickets are noted as (≥ 12.5 ng/mL), and based on adult parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppression the "optimal serum 25-OH D is ≥ 30 ng/mL; however, there is no serum 25-OH D level in children that has been associated with maximal suppression of PTH". Vitamin D status (serum 25-OH D) "should be checked at least once yearly in the spring, when levels are lowest, and supplements should be prescribed accordingly". Clinicians "should also routinely perform a dietary assessment", emphasizing vitamin D–containing foods, and because of dietary variability "some patients may require vitamin D supplementation in addition to a multivitamin to achieve and maintain adequate serum vitamin D levels". Adequate calcium intake "is also critical", there "is no evidence that recommending routine avoidance of dairy products will decrease mucosal inflammation or clinical outcome in patients with IBD", and "some preparations combine calcium with vitamin D".

### Relationship between vitamin D levels and pediatric celiac disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BLrRV]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that exerts its biological effects by binding to Vitamin D receptors, which are distributed in various tissues and cells throughout the human body, and subsequently participates in numerous biological processes, including immunity, metabolism, and inflammation. Vitamin D, as an immune modulator, is known to regulate immune response and maybe implicated in disease pathogenesis or susceptibility of CD. Components of the immune system, such as B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, are influenced by the regulatory effects of Vitamin D and expressed Vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is involved in the biological activity of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3, and these cells also have the capability of locally synthesizing active 1,25(OH) 2 D 3. Increasing evidence also suggests that Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk and worsens the outcome of extraskeletal diseases such as cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease.

GFD remains the only effective treatment for CD. Strict adherence to a GFD over a year has been shown to lead to partial healing of the duodenal mucosa along with the resolution of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations as well as complications such as malabsorption and osteoporosis while having similar results in mucosal structural recovery, reduction in intestinal mucosal inflammation, antibody concentrations, and symptom improvement. Cross-contamination of GFD foods has emerged as a threat to chronic low-dose gluten exposure in CD patients, daily gluten intake below a specific threshold should be determined. Several studies established a safe threshold of daily gluten intake, 100 mg gliadin/day (= about 200 mg of gluten or 2–5 g wheat flour) displayed minimal morphometric changes in the jejunal histology. Gluten-free foods are less available and cost more, while in CD with GFD, symptoms can relieved and quality of life can be significantly improved. Beyond patients with CD, GFD is also recognized in the treatment of gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis, cognitive impairment, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, dermatitis herpetiformis, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Adverse events of GFD may worsen the gut microbiota while having nutritional deficiencies in iron, calcium, and fiber, also include the negative social and psychological impacts that many GFD adherents experience.

Treatment of hypovitaminosis D — in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) uses cumulative dosing tied to baseline 25OHD and includes a practical weekly option with calcium co-administration. The authors state, "Our recommendation is that it is reasonable to use cumulative doses of at least 400,000 IU if 25OHD level is < 20 ng/mL. For levels > 20 ng/mL but lower than 32 ng/mL a cumulative dose of at least 250,000 IU would be reasonable". Evidence rating: "Rate: Poor — C". For adherence, "Therefore, we recommend weekly dosing with 50,000 IU, if possible". They further advise, "We recommend that adequate calcium intake is ensured simultaneously with vitamin D repletion regimes above (Table 2)".

### Assessment of bone and mineral metabolism in inflammatory bowel disease: case series and review [^115a1b4d]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of low bone mass, fractures, and vitamin D deficiency and the levels of biochemical markers of mineral metabolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Methods

Our retrospective study consisted of 30 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 18 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed to determine bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip. Serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, urinary N-telopeptide cross-linked collagen type I, and 24-hour urinary calcium levels were evaluated.

Results

On the basis of Z-score definitions of low bone mass in the IBD group as a whole, 13 patients (27%) had low bone mass at the lumbar spine. Similarly, at the femoral neck, 13 patients (27%) had low bone mass. There was a higher prevalence of low bone mass in the UC group than in the CD group, consistent with a high prevalence of fractures in that group. Of all patients with IBD, 65% had a history of fractures, of which 23% were atraumatic. Deficiency of 25-OHD was high, with a prevalence of 55% in patients with UC and 83% in patients with CD. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, defined as a parathyroid hormone level > 55 pg/mL in conjunction with a low or normal serum calcium and a low 25-OHD level, was present in 50% of patients with CD and only 7% of patients with UC.

Conclusion

Metabolic bone disease and fractures are common in IBD. The mean bone mineral density of the spine or femoral neck did not differ significantly between patients with CD and those with UC. Patients with UC had a higher prevalence of low bone mass, as defined by a Z-score of less than -2, than did patients with CD, consistent with a high prevalence of fractures in the UC group. In contrast, hyperparathyroidism attributable to vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent in patients with CD than in those with UC. This finding suggests a different etiologic mechanism of low bone mass in patients with CD.

### Vitamin D in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^1117ycmP]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions.

Goals

The authors investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hypovitaminosis D on disease activity, quality of life (QOL), inflammatory markers, and cytokines.

Study

This randomized double-blinded controlled clinical trial included 120 children with IBD and hypovitaminosis D; 22 of them were excluded later. Patients were randomized to receive either oral vitamin D3 in a dose of 2000IU/day or placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the IBD activity score. The secondary outcomes were to assess the QOL, inflammatory markers, cytokines, the safety of vitamin D, and to correlate serum vitamin D level with various clinical and laboratory variables.

Results

Vitamin D supplementation significantly decreased the IBD activity score in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group. Moreover, QOL significantly improved after vitamin D supplementation. Inflammatory markers, for example, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin and interleukin-2 IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha significantly decreased in the vitamin D group. However, IL-10 significantly increased after vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D was significantly inversely correlated with the activity score, QOL score, levels of all inflammatory markers, the frequency of hospitalization, and emergency department visits.

Conclusion

Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial effect in children with IBD.

### Micronutrient deficiencies in older patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not associated with worse adverse clinical outcome rates [^111ivUod]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a retrospective examination of age-related outcomes in IBD patients with MNDs, vitamin and mineral deficiencies were common. Furthermore, advanced age was not associated with adverse clinical events. Younger adults with vitamin D or iron deficiency, or multiple MNDs, experienced higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes. However, vitamin D (61.5%), iron (46.4%) and zinc (40.5%) deficiencies were still common in older IBD patients. Importantly, our data further clarify the poorly defined epidemiology of MNDs in older IBD patients.

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased disease activity, probably due to its regulation of the innate and adaptive immune system and the promotion of antibacterial proteins. Our findings support vitamin D's association with greater disease activity, manifested by the higher rates of intestinal complications and IBD-related surgeries in vitamin D deficient patients. Moreover, iron deficiency has been associated with increased disease activity due to mechanisms of blood loss and inflammatory sequestration. In addition to simple blood loss, iron deficiency's association with all our study's adverse clinical outcomes probably reflects the pervasive mechanisms by which inflammation mediates iron metabolism in IBD.

### Vitamin D status, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and the immune system [^114K4fC5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is an important immune system regulator. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], has been shown to inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Paradoxically, other immune system-mediated diseases (experimental asthma) and immunity to infectious organisms were unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. There are similar paradoxical effects of vitamin D deficiency on various immune system functions. Vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) deficiency resulted in accelerated IBD. Experimental asthma was unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment and was less severe among VDR-deficient mice. Vitamin D is a selective regulator of the immune system, and the outcome of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, vitamin D deficiency, or VDR deficiency depends on the nature of the immune response (eg, infectious disease, asthma, or autoimmune disease). An additional factor that determines the effect of vitamin D status on immune function is dietary calcium. Dietary calcium has independent effects on IBD severity. Vitamin D-deficient mice on low-calcium diets developed the most severe IBD, and 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment of mice on low-calcium diets improved IBD symptoms. However, the best results for IBD were observed when the calcium concentration was high and 1,25(OH)2D3 was administered. Both the type of immune response and the calcium status of the host determine the effects of vitamin D status and 1,25(OH)2D3 on immunity.

### Normalization of plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D is associated with reduced risk of surgery in Crohn's disease [^115ru3BH]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D may have an immunologic role in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Retrospective studies suggested a weak association between vitamin D status and disease activity but have significant limitations.

Methods

Using a multi-institution inflammatory bowel disease cohort, we identified all patients with CD and UC who had at least one measured plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D). Plasma 25(OH)D was considered sufficient at levels ≥ 30 ng/mL. Logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders were used to identify impact of measured plasma 25(OH)D on subsequent risk of inflammatory bowel disease-related surgery or hospitalization. In a subset of patients where multiple measures of 25(OH)D were available, we examined impact of normalization of vitamin D status on study outcomes.

Results

Our study included 3217 patients (55% CD; mean age, 49 yr). The median lowest plasma 25(OH)D was 26 ng/mL (interquartile range, 17–35 ng/mL). In CD, on multivariable analysis, plasma 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL was associated with an increased risk of surgery (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–2.51) and inflammatory bowel disease-related hospitalization (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.59–2.68) compared with those with 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL. Similar estimates were also seen for UC. Furthermore, patients with CD who had initial levels < 30 ng/mL but subsequently normalized their 25(OH)D had a reduced likelihood of surgery (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.98) compared with those who remained deficient.

Conclusion

Low plasma 25(OH)D is associated with increased risk of surgery and hospitalizations in both CD and UC, and normalization of 25(OH)D status is associated with a reduction in the risk of CD-related surgery.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^1126R62Y]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Osteoporosis definition and risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease — diagnostic threshold and categories are outlined. Osteoporosis is "defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture". Diagnostic criteria state "a bone mineral density of 2.5 standard deviations or more below the mean peak bone mass (average of young, healthy adults) as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA); the term 'established osteoporosis' includes the presence of a fragility fracture". Although low bone mineral density is asymptomatic, it "predisposes individuals to personal and economic burdens". Bone mass patterns note that "the bone mass of an individual adult older than 30 years reflects the bone mass accumulated during growth minus the bone mass lost because the adult peak was attained". Risk factors "can be separated into 2 groups: (i) those that are measurable and (ii) those that are both measurable and modifiable". Measurable factors include "BMD, serological markers, and urinary markers of bone formation and resorption, age, and genotype", while modifiable factors include "glucocorticoid therapy, treatment with drugs that could affect bone metabolism, sex hormone and vitamin D".

### Prediagnostic serum vitamin D levels and the risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in European populations: a nested case-control study [^113iTF5o]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A low vitamin D status has been put forward as a potential risk factor for the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study investigated the association between prediagnostic circulating vitamin D concentrations and dietary intakes of vitamin D, and the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Methods

Among 359,728 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, individuals who developed CD or UC after enrollment were identified. Each case was matched with2 controls by center, gender, age, date of recruitment, and follow-up time. At cohort entry, blood samples were collected and dietary vitamin D intakes were obtained from validated food frequency questionnaires. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Conditional logistic regression was performed to determine the odds of CD and UC.

Results

Seventy-two participants developed CD and 169 participants developed UC after a median follow-up of 4.7 and 4.1 years, respectively. Compared with the lowest quartile, no associations with the 3 higher quartiles of vitamin D concentrations were observed for CD (p trend = 0.34) or UC (p trend = 0.66). Similarly, no associations were detected when serum vitamin D levels were analyzed as a continuous variable. Dietary vitamin D intakes were not associated with CD (p trend = 0.39) or UC (p trend = 0.83).

Conclusions

Vitamin D status was not associated with the development of CD or UC. This does not suggest a major role for vitamin D deficiency in the etiology of IBD, although larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Treatment of vitamin D insufficiency in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease: a randomized clinical trial comparing three regimens [^111xwELb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Vitamin D insufficiency [serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration less than 20 ng/ml] is prevalent among children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and its treatment has not been studied.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of three vitamin D repletion regimens.

Design and Setting

We conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial from November 2007 to June 2010 at the Clinical and Translational Study Unit of Children's Hospital Boston. The study was not blinded to participants and investigators.

Patients

Eligibility criteria included diagnosis of IBD, age 5–21, and serum 25OHD concentration below 20 ng/ml. Seventy-one patients enrolled, 61 completed the trial, and two withdrew due to adverse events.

Intervention

Patients received orally for 6 wk: vitamin D(2), 2,000 IU daily (arm A, control); vitamin D(3), 2,000 IU daily (arm B); vitamin D(2), 50,000 IU weekly (arm C); and an age-appropriate calcium supplement.

Main Outcome Measure

We measured the change in serum 25OHD concentration (Δ25OHD) (ng/ml). Secondary outcomes included change in serum intact PTH concentration (ΔPTH) (pg/ml) and the adverse event occurrence rate.

Results

After 6 wk, Δ25OHD ± se was: 9.3 ± 1.8 (arm A); 16.4 ± 2.0 (arm B); 25.4 ± 2.5 (arm C); P (A vs. C) = 0.0004; P (A vs. B) = 0.03. ΔPTH ± SE was -5.6 ± 5.5 (arm A); -0.1 ± 4.2 (arm B); -4.4 ± 3.9 (arm C); P = 0.57. No participant experienced hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia, and the prevalence of hypercalciuria did not differ among arms at follow-up.

Conclusions

Oral doses of 2,000 IU vitamin D(3) daily and 50,000 IU vitamin D(2) weekly for 6 wk are superior to 2,000 IU vitamin D(2) daily for 6 wk in raising serum 25OHD concentration and are well-tolerated among children and adolescents with IBD. The change in serum PTH concentration did not differ among arms.

### The relevance of vitamin D and antinuclear antibodies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease under anti-TNF treatment: a prospective study [^113YxgpD]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The importance of vitamin D in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been analyzed in former studies, namely concerning the severity of the disease and the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) medications. In several inflammatory conditions, biologics have been associated with an autoimmune response with formation of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). In addition, an inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and ANA has been documented. We aimed to evaluate the clinical importance of the link between vitamin D, ANA, and anti-TNF in patients with IBD.

Methods

Prospective study including patients with IBD with indication to start anti-TNF, between 2009 and 2014. Deficiency and extreme deficiency of vitamin D were defined as levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 20 and 4 ng/mL, respectively. ANA titers were considered positive if higher or equal to 1/100.

Results

Among 68 patients (56 with Crohn's Disease, 12 with ulcerative colitis), vitamin D deficiency was detected in 93%. Pretreatment positivity for ANA was related to higher failure rates of anti-TNF treatment (P = 0.008). Pretreatment positivity for ANA and extreme vitamin D deficiency were significant risk factors for adverse events associated with anti-TNF therapy. A significant link was found between extreme deficiency of vitamin D and the presence of ANA.

Conclusions

Our study highlights the association between vitamin D deficiency and pretreatment positivity for ANA with the risk for anti-TNF failure and adverse events, and the inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and ANA. Due to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in IBD and the immune-mediated nature of the disease, these elements should be evaluated before starting biologics.

### The role of dietary supplements in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review [^111WMLk5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic immune disorders of unclear aetiology. Dietary deficiencies may be a potential pathogenic factor in their development. Patients often take food supplements without knowledge of any evidence base. We have therefore assessed the evidence for food supplementation in the management of IBD. A PubMed search was performed for the terms Inflammatory bowel disease; nutritional deficiencies; dietary supplements; curcumin; green tea; vitamin D/other vitamins; folic acid; iron; zinc; probiotics; andrographis paniculata; and boswellia serrate. PubMed was used to search for all relevant articles published between January 1975 and September 2015. Curcumin supplementation has been reported to be effective in reducing the symptoms and the inflammatory indices in IBD patients. Similar results have been observed for green tea; however, pertinent studies are limited. Vitamin D supplementation may help to increase bone mineral density in IBD patients and to reduce disease activity. IBD patients with ileal resections higher than 20cm may develop vitamin B12 deficiency that requires parenteral supplementation. There is no current evidence to support fat-soluble vitamin supplementation in IBD patients. Zinc and iron should be supplemented in selected cases. Probiotics (VSL#3) may reduce disease activity in IBD patients with pouchitis. Complementary and alternative medicines are used by IBD patients and some studies have shown promising results. In summary, attention to dietary factors such as curcumin, green tea and vitamins, including vitamins D and B12, appears to be beneficial and, if necessary, supplementation may be appropriate.

### Vitamin D supplementation as non-toxic immunomodulation in… [^116HpaZY]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Study Overview IBD is caused by an abnormal immune response to the gut bacteria in people who are genetically predisposed. There has been a huge increase in the number of people diagnosed with IBD since World War II, likely due to changes in our environment. It is possible that the abundance of vitamin D in the body may be one of those environmental factors that the investigators can control to make patients with IBD better. Vitamin D acts on cells of the immune system and causes many effects, including the production of a "natural antibiotic" called cathelicidin. The investigators know that when people are supplemented with vitamin D, levels of cathelicidin produced by these immune cells increase. By supplementing children with Crohn's disease with vitamin D, the investigators may be able to alter their immune system "naturally, " making their disease better.

A consensus of vitamin D experts believes that vitamin D levels need to reach a level of 40–70 ng/mL in the blood in order to have effects on the immune system. Raising vitamin D levels to this range is one of the goals in the current study. Vitamin D is an important nutrient controlling the health and development of our bones. Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease are deficient in levels of vitamin D in their bodies. This is probably because vitamin D is lost from inflamed intestinal tissue into the stools. But while much attention has been given to studying the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the bone status of patients with IBD, our understanding of how vitamin D deficiency might affect the immune system in these patients is relatively poor. The investigators intend to study vitamin D supplementation in children with Crohn's disease, ages 8 to 18 years.

At the time of enrollment, the investigators will gather data on disease activity using both a simple history and physical exam, as well as blood and stool tests. In addition, the investigators will measure the levels of cathelicidin produced by the immune cells in their blood. Our patients will achieve those levels of vitamin D agreed by expert opinion that are required to cause effects on the immune system, and the investigators will see an increase in the amount of cathelicidin produced by their immune cells. As an added piece of information, the investigators would like to determine if there are any improvements in disease activity in patients supplemented with vitamin D.
