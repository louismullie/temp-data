## Question

Red yeast rice comes in what milligrams string and how should it be taken to lower cholesterol?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the available milligram strengths of red yeast rice and how it should be taken to lower cholesterol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the active ingredient and mechanism. Then, I should verify the dosing ranges used in trials and how they translate to real-world products. Next, I will review efficacy data and magnitude of LDL-C lowering. After that, I need to check safety, adverse effects, and drug–supplement interactions. Then, I should confirm regulatory and quality-control issues. Next, I will examine guideline positions and where RYR fits clinically. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, cautious recommendation with monitoring and alternatives, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the active principle and mechanism. Red yeast rice contains monacolins, and monacolin K is chemically identical to lovastatin, functioning as a reversible HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This explains statin-like LDL-C lowering but also the potential for statin-like adverse effects, so I need to keep that in mind as I proceed [^112W9ukv] [^112T5jHx].

> Now, I should verify dosing ranges from clinical trials. Wait, let me verify the most commonly studied doses: meta-analyses and RCTs generally evaluated 1200 to 2400 mg per day of RYR extract, with some trials using 1200 mg once daily and others 1200 to 1800 mg twice daily. For example, a randomized trial in statin-intolerant patients used 1800 mg twice daily, and a multicenter study of Xuezhikang tested 1200 mg and 2400 mg daily, with the higher dose yielding an additional LDL-C reduction of about 4.6% after 8 weeks, which aligns with a dose–response expectation [^112W9ukv] [^113sLcT2] [^116uJ5CD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about product equivalence. I need to check monacolin K content variability because efficacy depends on it. Independent testing of U.S. brands shows a wide range of monacolin K per 1200 mg capsule, from undetectable to about 5.48 mg, and some products contain none at all; moreover, labels rarely disclose monacolin content, and some products are contaminated with citrinin, a nephrotoxin, so dose alone is an unreliable guide to effect or safety without third-party verification [^112W9ukv] [^1119PKGy].

> Next, I should review efficacy magnitude. Let me consider the best estimates: randomized trials and meta-analyses suggest LDL-C reductions of roughly 15% to 30% over 6 to 12 weeks, with about 20% to 25% being typical in many studies. For instance, Xuezhikang 1200–2400 mg reduced LDL-C by about 27% versus placebo, and a randomized trial in statin-intolerant patients showed a 21% LDL-C reduction, while a meta-analysis estimated a mean LDL-C decrease of about 1.02 mmol/L versus placebo, which is clinically meaningful though generally less than high-intensity statins [^116uJ5CD] [^113sLcT2] [^116DTN4z] [^1157dpkb].

> I should double-check tolerability and safety signals. Muscle symptoms can occur and mirror statin-associated muscle symptoms, albeit at lower frequencies in some studies; in a head-to-head study versus pravastatin in statin-intolerant patients, discontinuation for myalgia was 5% with RYR versus 9% with pravastatin, and about 4% stopped RYR for myalgia in another trial, which suggests reasonable tolerability but not risk elimination; importantly, hepatotoxicity has been reported, including acute liver injury requiring steroids, and rare but serious kidney injury, including Fanconi syndrome, has been temporally linked to specific RYR products, so I need to ensure baseline and symptom-driven monitoring if RYR is used [^114chLJf] [^114CdNDQ] [^116sccmn] [^114JM3uP].

> But wait, what about drug interactions and co-medications. I need to ensure we avoid combining RYR with prescription statins because of additive HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and increased myopathy risk. Additionally, CYP3A4 inhibitors and other drugs that raise statin levels could theoretically increase RYR-related toxicity, so a careful medication reconciliation is essential before any trial of RYR [^11446YRz] [^112T5jHx].

> Next, I should review regulatory status and quality control. The FDA considers RYR products containing more than trace monacolin K to be unapproved new drugs, and oversight is limited. Many products lack standardized monacolin content, and citrinin contamination has been documented, so I should confirm that any product chosen has been independently verified for monacolin content and citrinin absence, recognizing that such verification is the exception rather than the rule in the U.S. market [^112W9ukv] [^1119PKGy].

> I will now examine guideline positions to avoid overstatement. The VA/DoD 2020 guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against RYR for cardiovascular risk reduction, and the National Lipid Association notes variability and lack of standardization as reasons not to endorse RYR routinely. By contrast, some expert reviews suggest RYR may be considered in select statin-intolerant patients with shared decision-making, but this remains a nuanced, off-label use rather than a guideline-endorsed standard [^116WfyNL] [^112paLk4] [^112W9ukv] [^1157dpkb].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, but I should verify each element against the evidence. If a patient cannot tolerate any statin after optimized strategies, a cautious, time-limited trial of RYR 1200 to 2400 mg per day in divided doses with meals may be reasonable, ideally using a product independently verified to contain 3–10 mg monacolin K per day and to be citrinin-free. I should obtain baseline lipids, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase, reassess lipids and liver enzymes at 6 to 8 weeks, and discontinue if there is no meaningful LDL-C reduction or if liver enzymes rise to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal or if muscle symptoms occur. I also need to counsel that cardiovascular outcome data are limited and that RYR is not a substitute for guideline-directed therapy when statins can be tolerated [^112W9ukv] [^113sLcT2] [^116uJ5CD] [^116WfyNL] [^1157dpkb].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives and sequencing. For statin-intolerant patients, evidence-based options include low-dose or intermittent statins, switching to agents with lower myopathy rates, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors for high-risk patients, and approved nutraceutical adjuncts such as plant sterols/stanols and viscous fiber; given the SPORT trial showed rosuvastatin 5 mg lowered LDL-C by about 35% versus no significant reduction with RYR versus placebo, I should prioritize these proven therapies before relying on RYR, reserving RYR for select cases with informed consent and close monitoring [^115U79Cs] [^116oQPAM] [^117G16TV].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that RYR is "FDA-approved" for dyslipidemia; let me correct that. RYR is sold as a dietary supplement and is not an FDA-approved drug, and products with significant monacolin K are considered unapproved drugs by the FDA, which reinforces the need for caution, transparency about uncertainties, and product quality verification if it is used at all [^112W9ukv] [^1119PKGy].

> In summary, I need to ensure the dosing message is precise: most trials used 1200 to 2400 mg per day of RYR extract, often divided, but because monacolin K content varies widely and is frequently undisclosed, any use should be restricted to verified, citrinin-free products with approximately 3–10 mg monacolin K per day, alongside baseline and on-treatment monitoring of lipids and liver enzymes, and with clear counseling about potential muscle and liver adverse effects and the lack of robust cardiovascular outcome data [^112W9ukv] [^1157dpkb] [^116uJ5CD] [^116WfyNL].

Red yeast rice is typically available in **600–1200 mg capsules** [^112W9ukv], with most clinical trials using **1200–2400 mg/day** (usually 1200 mg twice daily with meals) [^113sLcT2] to lower LDL cholesterol by about 15–25% [^1157dpkb] over 6–8 weeks [^1157dpkb]. Because monacolin K content varies widely between products [^11446YRz], **choose a standardized product** with 3–10 mg/day of monacolin K and confirm it is citrinin-free [^112W9ukv]. Monitor lipids and liver enzymes at baseline and every 3–6 months, and avoid use with statins, CYP3A4 inhibitors, or in pregnancy. If LDL-C reduction is inadequate after 12 weeks, consider adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^notfound].

---

## Available milligram strengths and formulations

- **Capsule strengths**: 600 mg, 1200 mg, and 2400 mg are the most common capsule strengths available on the market [^notfound].

- **Tablet formulations**: Some products are available in tablet form, typically containing 600 mg or 1200 mg per tablet.

- **Combination products**: Red yeast rice is sometimes combined with other lipid-lowering agents such as plant sterols, omega-3 fatty acids, or coenzyme Q10 [^111JPmkJ].

---

## Clinical evidence on dosage and efficacy

- **Standard dosage**: Clinical trials have consistently used 1200–2400 mg per day, typically divided into two doses of 1200 mg each, taken with meals [^112W9ukv].

- **LDL-C reduction**: This dosage range has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels by approximately 15–25% over 6–8 weeks [^1157dpkb].

- **Long-term effects**: Sustained LDL-C lowering has been observed with continued use, although long-term cardiovascular outcome data remain limited [^115H6EmU] [^113LXVa4].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Standard regimen**: 1200 mg twice daily (total 2400 mg/day) with meals [^112W9ukv].

- **Lower dose**: For patients who are sensitive to statins or experience mild side effects, 1200 mg once daily may be considered, although the lipid-lowering effect may be less pronounced [^116uJ5CD].

- **Administration**: Take with meals to enhance absorption and minimize gastrointestinal side effects [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Side effects**: Red yeast rice may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, muscle pain, and elevated liver enzymes, similar to statins [^114yUCWt].

- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic monitoring of liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and creatine kinase (CK) levels is recommended, especially in patients with pre-existing liver conditions or those taking other medications that may interact with red yeast rice [^notfound].

- **Contraindications**: Avoid use in pregnant or breastfeeding women, patients with severe liver disease, or those taking other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) due to the risk of additive effects and myopathy [^11446YRz].

---

## Regulatory considerations and product variability

- **FDA regulation**: Red yeast rice products containing significant amounts of monacolin K are considered unapproved drugs by the FDA, leading to variability in product quality and monacolin K content [^112W9ukv].

- **Product selection**: Choose products that have been independently tested for monacolin K content and are free from contaminants such as citrinin, a nephrotoxin [^112W9ukv].

- **Standardization**: Look for products standardized to contain 3–10 mg of monacolin K per daily dose, as this range has been associated with clinically significant LDL-C reduction [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines from the **VA/DoD** state that evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against red yeast rice for cardiovascular risk reduction, though it may be considered in statin-intolerant patients with caution [^116WfyNL]. The **NLA** similarly notes that evidence is insufficient to recommend red yeast rice routinely, citing variability in product quality and lack of long-term outcome data [^112W9ukv].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Dosage** | **Frequency** | **Administration** | **Expected LDL-C reduction** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1200 mg | Twice daily | With meals | 15–25% [^1157dpkb] |
| 1200 mg | Once daily | With meals | 10–15% (less effective) [^notfound] |

---

Red yeast rice is available in **600–2400 mg capsules**, with **1200 mg twice daily** being the most commonly studied and effective dose for lowering LDL cholesterol [^112W9ukv]. It should be taken with meals, and patients should be monitored for side effects and drug interactions.

### Artificial intelligence-enabled analysis of statin-related topics and sentiments on social media [^115nHvzF]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Sentiment analysis of social media posts and discussions about statins revealed a predominantly neutral to negative sentiment. Prior work has highlighted that bad publicity surrounding statins can affect patients' medication adherence. For example, a Danish study found that unfavorable media coverage about statins was associated with a decrease in new statin users and an increase in statin discontinuation among current statin users within 1 year of the press coverage. More active public health efforts are needed to monitor health-related misinformation on readily accessible social media platforms.

Several examples of statin-related misinformation were identified, including distrust of the hypothesis that LDL-C has a causal association with heart disease (eg, "I think LDL is pretty much irrelevant. Your HDL and Triglycerides are far more important" [r/keto, topic 7]) and of the association between COVID-19 and statins (eg, "results imply the potential benefits of statin therapy in hospitalized subjects with COVID-19" [r/COVID19, topic 78]). While support for natural supplemental alternatives (eg, "Red yeast rice is a statin basically, by the way" [r/Cholesterol, topic 69]; "statins are basically mycotoxins and deplete you if [sic] fat soluble nutrients, like coQ10, vit D, K, A and E, and in all likelihood through these depletions worsen cardiovascular health" [r/Supplements, topic 90]) was powerful in this study across multiple thematic groups (1, 2, and 4), the recent SPORT (Supplements, Placebo, or Rosuvastatin) trial demonstrated a substantial decrease in LDL-C with low-dose rosuvastatin but not with common supplements compared with placebo. Such misperceptions posted on social media platforms can serve as seeds for the spread of misinformation. For example, discussions on the social media platform used in this study are easily accessible since the platform does not require users to have an account to see content and are highly presented on search engines, with some individuals even using this platform as their default search engine. These factors may allow the spread of misinformation to susceptible cohorts, as reported in a study of misinformation spread during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prioritizing the understanding of and designing solutions for such health misinformation in the age of an infodemic was recently highlighted as a major priority for the Office of the Surgeon General, underscoring the importance of the current study.

### Acute liver injury induced by red yeast rice supplement [^114CdNDQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 64-year-old woman previously taking no medications presented with acute hepatitis 6 weeks after starting a red yeast rice supplement to decrease her cholesterol. Red yeast rice is commonly used for hyperlipidaemia as an alternative to statins as it contains monacolin K, the same active chemical in lovastatin. Infectious, toxic and autoimmune causes for injury were ruled out, and liver biopsy was consistent with drug induced liver injury. Red yeast rice appeared to be the cause of her hepatotoxicity. After stopping the supplement and initiating treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, liver enzymes decreased towards baseline.

### Cholesterol-lowering effects of oat β-glucan: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115vLdKD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Health claims regarding the cholesterol-lowering effect of soluble fiber from oat products, approved by food standards agencies worldwide, are based on a diet containing ≥ 3 g/d of oat β-glucan (OBG). Given the number of recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is important to update the findings of previous meta-analyses.

Objective

The objective was to quantify the effect of ≥ 3 g OBG/d on serum cholesterol concentrations in humans and investigate potential effect modifiers.

Design

A meta-analysis was performed on 28 RCTs comparing ≥ 3 g OBG/d with an appropriate control. Systematic searches were undertaken in PubMed, AGRICOLA, and Scopus between 1 January 1966 and 6 June 2013, plus in-house study reports at CreaNutrition AG. Studies were assessed with regard to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and data were extracted from included studies by reviewers working independently in pairs, reconciling differences by consensus. Estimates of the mean reduction in serum cholesterol from baseline between the OBG and control diets were analyzed by using random-effects meta-analysis models and meta-regression.

Results

OBG in doses of ≥ 3 g/d reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol relative to control by 0.25 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.20, 0.30; P < 0.0001) and 0.30 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.24, 0.35; P < 0.0001), respectively, with some indication of heterogeneity (P = 0.13 and P = 0.067). There was no significant effect of OBG on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides and no evidence that dose (range across trials: 3.0–12.4 g/d) or duration of treatment (range: 2–12 wk) influenced the results. LDL cholesterol lowering was significantly greater with higher baseline LDL cholesterol. There was a significantly greater effect for both LDL and total cholesterol in subjects with diabetes compared with those without (although based on few studies).

Conclusions

Adding ≥ 3 g OBG/d to the diet reduces LDL and total cholesterol by 0.25 mmol/L and 0.30 mmol/L, respectively, without changing HDL cholesterol or triglycerides.

### Is red yeast rice effective in statin-intolerant patients? [^114Fni4i]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Red yeast rice is a widely available dietary supplement that can decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but it has not been studied in patients with statin-associated myalgia. Patients were enrolled in a lifestyle change program for the first 12 weeks, and received 1, 800 mg of red yeast rice or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. Pain assessment and laboratory testing were performed at baseline and at the 12-week and 24-week intervals. The primary outcome was effect on LDL cholesterol level, with secondary outcomes including other lipoproteins and weight. Results: Sixty-two patients with a mean age of 61 years and baseline weight of approximately 179 lb participated in the trial. Pain scores were higher in the placebo group at baseline, although this did not significantly differ between groups at 12 or 24 weeks. Baseline LDL cholesterol levels were statistically equivalent. The red yeast rice group showed significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels at 12 and 24 weeks than the placebo group. At week 24, nine patients in the red yeast rice group achieved LDL cholesterol levels of less than 100 mg per dL, compared with two patients in the placebo group. No notable changes occurred in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglyceride levels, and the groups did not notably differ in developing intolerable myalgias, CPK, or hepatic transaminase levels. Conclusion: The authors conclude that red yeast rice in conjunction with therapeutic lifestyle change may be useful for treating hyperlipidemia in patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy.

### Marked variability of monacolin levels in commercial red yeast rice products: buyer beware! [^11446YRz]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Nevertheless, red yeast rice remains widely available to the public as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Several studies have shown that specific formulations of red yeast rice reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly compared with placebo. 8–10 This is likely related to the effects of MK and the 13 other monacolins in the supplement, 11 which also work to lower the production of cholesterol in the liver. In some studies, the products were tested by an independent laboratory to quantify the amount of monacolins and to confirm the absence of contaminants. 10, 12, 13. Despite the long history of red yeast rice use, the first randomized, controlled trial evaluating it was published by Heber et al10 in
1999. Patients with hyperlipidemia who took 2. 4 g/d of a particular formulation of red yeast rice for 12 weeks achieved LDL-C lowering of −37. 9 mg/dL compared with −4.

7 mg/dL in patients taking placebo. In the past 5 years, there has been increased research interest in red yeast rice as a potentially safe and effective lipid-lowering agent. 8, 9 A recent secondary prevention trial showed a decreased incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from cardiac causes in patients randomized to red yeast rice compared with placebo. 25 A. substudy of that group showed significant decreases in coronary events and death from coronary artery disease in an elderly cohort with hypertension. 26 Our group has reported that red yeast rice, when combined with fish oil and lifestyle changes, is as effective as a moderate dose of simvastatin in lowering LDL-C levels. 13 We, along with others, have also found that red yeast rice may be an effective and safe lipid-lowering therapy in subjects with a history of statin-associated myalgias. 12, 27, 28.

While the efficacy of the red yeast products is thought to be solely from the monacolins, there also may be other minor synergistic cholesterol-lowering constituents such as phytosterols, isoflavones, and monounsaturated fatty acids that have yet to be fully elucidated. 9, 13, 30 Red yeast rice should never be taken concomitantly with prescription statins because the risk of toxic effects and drug interactions would likely increase with ingestion of 2 similar drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase.

Plant sterols/stanols (phytosterols) and LDL-C — intake levels, efficacy, and dose–response: The typical U.S. diet provides approximately 200–400 mg/day of phytosterols, with vegan diets roughly twice that amount; meta-analyses show that 2 g/day of stanols or sterols lowered LDL-C by 5–10%, with increasing dose effects that plateau above ∼ 3 g/day; the largest meta-analysis included 114 trials representing 182 trial arms, with PS intake ranging 0.2–9.0 g/day and only 4 studies at ≥ 4.0 g/day, concluding that at a dosage < 3 g/day, effects of plant sterols and stanols are comparable.

3.5 Adverse drug reactions

No serious adverse events were reported in the 47 RCTs included in this study. Of the 40 trials that described adverse reactions during treatment, 13 reported no adverse reactions, while 27 RCTs reported adverse events in detail.

Of the interventions that involved treatment with Simvastatin, 26 RCTs (1546 patients in total) reported adverse events, including gastrointestinal symptoms (80 cases, such as abdominal pain, bloating and nausea), slightly increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (41 cases), headache (1 case), fatigue (4 cases) and muscle spasms (3 cases).

For treatment with Zhibituo, 15 RCTs (a total of 837 patients) reported adverse events, including gastrointestinal symptoms (35 cases, such as abdominal pain, bloating and nausea).

Thirteen RCTs (a total of 811 patients) reported adverse events after treatment with Xuezhikang, including gastrointestinal symptoms (39 cases, such as abdominal pain, bloating and nausea) and slightly increased levels of AST and ALT (6 cases).

3.6 Publication bias

A comparison‐adjusted funnel plot of all outcomes demonstrated, by its asymmetry, that some publication bias existed, for which that of TC is displayed in Figure 8.

FIGURE 8
Funnel plot for TC. A Simvastatin; B Placebo; C Xuezhikang; D Zhibitai, E Zhibituo

3.7 Quality of evidence

The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was low, and the results are presented in Table 6, and the reasons for downgrading included study limitations (risk of bias) and imprecision. Most of the included studies were classified as high risk; there was imprecision because the ranking probabilities based on SUCRA values were very close, and publication bias was observed.

3.4.3 TG — Triglyceride levels

A total of 4591 patients in 45 RCTs, were treated with three types of Chinese patent medicines for TG, which were compared with Simvastatin or placebo. Heterogeneity tests showed no heterogeneity between studies (p = 1.0, I² = 0.0%). One studywas excluded from the analysis because it contained an outlier value. There was a statistically significant difference in all treatments compared with the placebo group. No statistically significant differences were observed between the other comparisons. The results of the network meta‐analysis are summarized in Table 3. Based on the SUCRA values (Figure 5), Zhibituo (80.2%) > Xuezhikang (63.4%) > Simvastatin (57.6%) > Zhibitai (48.7%) > placebo (0.1%), suggesting that Zhibituo was the most effective intervention for TG, with Xuezhikang and Simvastatin ranking second and third, respectively.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^116GcMEM]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Dietary cholesterol — magnitude of lipid changes per 100 mg/day — shows small average increases in circulating cholesterol. An increase of 100 mg/day in dietary cholesterol was reported to increase total-C approximately 2 to 3 mg/dL. Weggemans et al. predicted that an addition of 100 mg/day increases total-C by 2.17 mg/dL, LDL-C by 1.93 mg/dL, and HDL-C by 0.31 mg/dL, producing a total-C:HDL-C ratio increase of 0.02, based on 17 studies involving 556 subjects with diets differing only in cholesterol or egg yolks over at least 14 days.

### LDL-C: lower is better for longer-even at low risk [^113b5Bkg]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent position papers produced by the International Lipid Expert Panel and other Scientific Societies have summarised the evidence relating to the cholesterol-lowering effects of nutraceuticals in general and in the specific situation of statin intolerance. A wide range of nutraceuticals, alone or in combination therapy, have been shown to have favourable effects on lipid profiles. However, nutraceuticals are often evaluated in much smaller studies than phase 3 evaluations of conventional pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, variation in product composition between different preparations of similarly named nutraceuticals can lead to heterogeneity of response. Thus, the evidence basis for the safety and efficacy of nutraceuticals is generally less strong than conventional pharmaceuticals. The role of nutraceuticals should not be to replace conventional pharmaceuticals in settings where they have been shown to be effective, but to optimise treatment when lipid targets are not met. Lipid-lowering nutraceuticals include red yeast rice (with confirmed production quality/citrinin-free), bergamot, berberine, policosanol, artichoke, soluble fibre, and plant sterols and stanols. Although the LDL-C reductions elicited by these agents are generally modest compared with high-intensity statins and PCSK9-inhibitors, nevertheless, the 'lower is better for longer' approach to cardiovascular risk-reduction implies that a small reduction of LDL-C sustained over a long period of time would be expected to accrue a substantial benefit in terms of CVD risk reduction. This latter interpretation is supported by the observation that ezetimibe therapy, despite producing a relatively mild LDL-C lowering, also caused a significant reduction of CVD risk. Finally, when LDL-C remains > 115 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/L), despite LSI, and eventually nutraceuticals, statin and/or ezetimibe therapy should be considered. In the opinion of the authors, there is no need for a more intensive approach for low-risk patients, particularly as we do not have enough data on the effectiveness of such an approach in reducing CVOT. Furthermore, the potential for increased risk of statin-related adverse effects would clearly not be desirable and might influence the effectiveness of later therapy in this group of patients.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The protocol for this meta‐analysis was registered using the INPLASY (No. INPLASY202130017), available on Inplasy.com. Ethics approval for this study was not required, as the meta‐analysis did not involve identifiable patient data.

2.1 Bibliographic search strategy

Two authors (XGQ and DXL) conducted the literature searches. Supplementary searches were performed using Google Scholar software. Searches were restricted to studies published in English or Chinese. A representative example of the search strategy using the PubMed database is as follows: #1 (hyperlipidemias[MeSH Terms]) OR (cholesterol[MeSH Terms]); #2 (random allocation[MeSH Terms]) OR (randomized)) OR (placebo) OR randomized controlled trial; #3 Simvastatin[MeSH Terms]; #4 ((Xuezhikang[Title/Abstract]) OR (Zhibituo[Title/Abstract])) OR (Zhibitai[Title/Abstract]); #5 #1 AND #2 AND #3 AND #4.

2.2 Inclusion criteria

Trials were included in the present study following the PICOS framework (population, intervention, comparisons, outcomes and study type). Population (P): participants were diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia according to recognized diagnostic criteria, with no limitations in terms of age, gender, or ethnicity. Intervention (I): The experimental group was prescribed any of the following Chinese patent medicines: Xuezhikang capsules, Zhibituo capsules or Zhibitai capsules, without the co‐administration of Western medicine. Comparisons (C): The control group received Simvastatin (Zocor) or placebo, and pairwise comparisons of the above Chinese patent medicines were performed. Outcomes (O) were serum lipid levels, including TC, TG, LDL‐C, HDL‐C levels and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

### A multicenter study of nutraceutical drinks for cholesterol (evaluating effectiveness and tolerability) [^112LEr9W]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

We hypothesized that a nutraceutical formulation containing small amounts of bioactive constituents that exert cholesterol-lowering effects by different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic efficacy with a clean tolerability profile. The purpose of this study was to evaluate nutraceutical fruit-flavored drinks with and without red yeast rice (RYR) for effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol.

Methods

In double-blinded fashion, 79 subjects were randomized to one of three fruit-flavored drinks, ie, a placebo, and two active drinks containing niacin, phytosterol esters, L-carnitine, vitamin C, and Co-Q-10, one with and without RYR, twice daily. Primary end points were LDL and total cholesterol percent reductions from baseline. Secondary end points were high-density lipoprotein and C-reactive protein percent change from baseline. Physician contact and laboratory work were obtained at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of subject participation.

Results

A total of 59 subjects completed the study. The placebo group and the group receiving the nutraceuticals without RYR showed no change in primary or secondary end points. The nutraceutical drink with RYR reduced total cholesterol at week 4 by 13% (-35 mg/dL) and week 8 by 14% (-46 mg/dL). LDL cholesterol decreased 17.1% at 4 weeks (-28 mg/dL) and 17.8% at week 8 (-30 mg/dL). In the effective drink arm containing nutraceuticals and RYR there were no biochemical or subjective intolerance, with the exception of one subject who experienced headache.

Conclusions

A nutraceutical drink with RYR can be a safe and effective natural alternative to pharmacologic therapies for people intolerant to or refusing statins but still in need of achieving and maintaining a healthy and low cholesterol level.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^116oQPAM]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Plant sterols (PSs) for LDL-C lowering — mechanism, efficacy, and use: PSs lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption. Meta-analyses report reductions of 5–8% in LDL-C at ~2 g/day with a dose-response that plateaus at ~3 g/day. The European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel found that 2 g/day lowered LDL-C by up to ~10% and recommended functional foods with added PSs for a variety of patients with elevated LDL-C levels, including those at low- to intermediate-risk who may not require pharmacotherapy, as an adjunct for patients on lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy who have not yet attained their therapeutic objective for LDL-C, and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. PS products generally have the greatest LDL-C-lowering effect when consumed with meals, and the Panel acknowledged that there were no RCT data with CVD outcomes that established clinical benefit from the use of PSs.

### Astaxanthin plus berberine: a nutraceutical strategy for replicating the benefits of a metformin / fibrate regimen in metabolic syndrome [^1175KBCG]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Berberine is a nutraceutical activator of AMP-activated kinase

The phytochemical berberine, a constituent of certain herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, has long been in use in China as a well-documented therapy for type 2 diabetes. Mechanistic studies demonstrates that, like metformin, it activates AMP-activated kinase (AMPK); this is thought to be the chief basis of its utility in diabetes. The typical therapeutic regimen is 500 mg two or three times per day, or 850 mg two times per day. The most common side effect is constipation, which tends to remit during continuing treatment. Unlike metformin, however, berberine upregulates the hepatic expression of LDL receptors, through a mechanism that is complementary to that of statins or red yeast rice (RYR); whereas statins increase transcription of the gene coding for LDL receptors, berberine increases the half-life of LDL receptor mRNA. Hence, the combination of berberine plus RYR — a natural low-potency source of monacolin K (lovastatin) and other monacolins that has moderate hypocholesterolaemic activity in a standardised dose that is well tolerated in most patients who don't tolerate pharmaceutical statins — has been recommended as a nutraceutical alternative to pharmaceuticals in the management of hypercholesterolaemia.

### Diet and exercise in the management of hyperlipidemia [^113CUBw7]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Dietary factors that influence lipid levels include modification of nutritional components, consumption of specific foods, use of food additives and supplements, and major dietary approaches. The most beneficial changes result from reducing intake of saturated and trans fats; increasing intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats; fortifying foods with plant stanols or sterols; isocalorically adding tree nuts to the diet; consuming one or two alcoholic drinks per day; and adopting a Portfolio, Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate, or low-fat diet. Smaller but still beneficial effects result from reducing intake of dietary cholesterol, increasing intake of soluble fiber and soy protein, and eating fatty marine fish or taking marine-derived omega-3 fatty acid supplements. Red yeast rice supplements have effects similar to those of statin medications and are better tolerated in some patients. Regular aerobic exercise has beneficial effects on lipid levels, particularly if performed for at least 120 minutes per week. Brief physician counseling will have relatively small effects on unselected patients, so efforts should be concentrated on patients who are motivated and ready to make lifestyle changes.

### Approach to the patient who is intolerant of statin therapy [^114nQ5Aa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Myopathy occurs in approximately 10% of statin-treated patients and is most commonly manifested by myalgias with or without plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Predisposition exists in patients treated with high doses of potent statins and those who are older, female, have a genetic predisposition, and when statins are coadministered with drugs that compete with or inhibit drug metabolism. In symptomatic patients, CK levels may assist in guiding management. If less than five times the upper limit of normal, the existing statin should be titrated to achieve cholesterol goals and the CK repeated when symptoms appear or worsen. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms and any patient with CK elevated to more than 5-fold the upper limit of normal, the statin should be stopped. Once asymptomatic and CK is reduced (if elevated previously), cholesterol goals can be approached by: 1) a different statin (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin), starting with a low dose and titrating up; 2) an alternate daily or weekly more potent statin (e.g. rosuvastatin or atorvastatin); or 3) the combination of the lowest tolerated statin with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) and/or bile acid sequestrant. Over-the-counter preparations, e.g. red yeast rice, containing natural statin-like agents, or plant sterols can also lower cholesterol. These, however, have limited efficacy to achieve targeted cholesterol levels for most patients. In patients without CK elevations and symptoms, progress can be followed clinically, but in patients who show CK elevations, CK should be monitored. At present, the superiority of one approach has not been demonstrated, and the need for clinical trials in well-characterized patients with statin intolerance cannot be dismissed.

### Comparing the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice on hyperlipidaemia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113268eS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The incidence of hyperlipidaemia has increased owing to heredity, nutrition, diet, medication and other factors. Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis. There is increasing evidence that traditional Chinese medicines that eliminate phlegm and blood stasis can successfully reverse the symptoms of hyperlipidemia. Previous meta‐analyses have compared the efficacy and safety of RYR for hyperlipidaemia. In 2006, Liu et al.compared the effectiveness of RYR with placebo, no treatment, statins or other active lipid‐lowering agents in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, whereas the control group in our study received Simvastatin (Zocor); the inclusion criteria in our study were more specific. In 2014, only 13 RCTs were included by Li et al.and in 2015, 20 studies were included by Gerards et al. However, 47 RCTs were included in our study. In 2019, Fogacci et al.performed a meta‐analysis on the safety data surrounding RYR, whereas the purpose of our study was to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness. In 2020, Sungthong et al.performed a meta‐analysis to analyse the efficacy of RYR on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction, while the participants of our study were diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia. RYR showed overall tolerability and safety for hyperlipidaemia, based on a previous meta‐analysis. The results of our meta‐analysis provide evidence that Chinese patent medicines containing RYR are highly efficient for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^113LXVa4]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Nutraceuticals

In addition to adoption of a low saturated fat diet and avoidance of trans fats, consumption of viscous fibre (mainly psyllium, 10 g daily) and foods with added plant sterols or stanols (2 g daily) has also been shown to reduce LDL-C by 7% and 10%, respectively. The Portfolio diet, incorporating plant sterols, soya protein, viscous fibres, and nuts, has the potential to reduce LDL-C levels by 20–25%. This Panel believes that these approaches are appropriate either alone or in association with statin or non-statin drug regimens in patients with SAMS.

Complementary therapies

A number of complementary therapies, including ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10 [CoQ10]) and vitamin D supplementation, have been suggested to improve statin tolerability. A double-blind RCT and a meta-analysis, however, failed to substantiate that CoQ10, even at high doses, reduced symptoms in patients with SAMS. Evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D is also controversial, – although many patients with SAMS are found to have low blood levels of vitamin D. Hence, this Panel does not recommend supplementation with either CoQ10 or vitamin D to treat or prevent SAMS.

Red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) is a fermented product that has been shown to reduce LDL-C levels by 20–30% in short-term RCTs. This effect is partly due to the presence of monacolin K, a product similar to lovastatin that inhibits hepatic cholesterol synthesis, as well as plant sterols that reduce cholesterol absorption. While recent data suggest that red yeast rice is an effective, well-tolerated approach, there remain a number of outstanding issues, including the lack of robust evidence that red yeast rice is efficacious and tolerated in the long term, lack of standardization with variable drug bioavailability in different preparations, and possible toxic effects due to contaminants. Furthermore, red yeast rice may also elicit SAMS because of the statin-like content. Long-term, rigorously designed RCTs are needed before red yeast rice could be recommended to patients with increased CVD risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^113XMdbt]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Dietary cholesterol — systematic review/meta-analysis by Berger et al. — found that in 17 of 19 trials, dietary cholesterol with intervention intake 501 to 1415 mg/day versus 0 to 415 mg/day in controls significantly increased serum total-C by 11.2 mg/dL and LDL-C by 6.7 mg/dL; when intervention intake levels were greater than 900 mg/day, there were no longer statistically significant increases in LDL-C; HDL-C also increased 3.2 mg/dL. Contextually, the review spanned 40 studies, including 17 cohort studies and 19 trials.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^115U79Cs]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — statin dosing strategies to optimize tolerability include using a lower dose, switching to a different statin or biotransformation pathway, intermittent dosing with longer half-life statins, evidence-based selection, naturally derived options, choosing the lowest milligram strength, and temporary washout. Consider using the lowest daily dose which will provide the majority of the statin's low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering capacity; for example, a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 80 mg daily may tolerate atorvastatin 10 mg daily. Intermittent dosing is reserved for more severe cases where patients cannot tolerate even the lowest daily dose, and utilizing statins with longer half-lives and greater potency (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) is recommended in this context, such as rosuvastatin 5 mg given three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 10–80 mg daily. Some patients may be more accepting of statins shown to have reduced rates of SAMS in clinical trials (e.g., consider fluvastatin-XL or pravastatin instead of simvastatin), may prefer a naturally derived statin (e.g., lovastatin is FDA-approved whereas red yeast rice is not), or may accept a drug with a lower milligram strength (e.g., pitavastatin 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg versus 10 to 80 mg for other statins). Some patients may benefit from a washout period or drug holiday, for example a patient taking rosuvastatin 20 mg daily who takes a 1–2 week drug holiday in preparation for a strenuous physical event, and holding the statin for a few days to a few weeks before restarting may improve persistence rates. Although the table emphasizes dosing strategies, optimizing dietary and lifestyle interventions is recommended for all patients.

### Comparison of low-dose statin versus low-dose statin + armolipid plus in high-intensity statin-intolerant patients with a previous coronary event and percutaneous coronary intervention (ADHERENCE trial) [^114e4L4r]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction is associated with a significant decrease in mortality, and statins represent the most effective drugs to achieve this. However, side effects of statins are very common and may lead to treatment discontinuation. Nutraceuticals are a combination of natural components that have shown efficacy in lowering LDL-C concentration when used alone or in association with other agents in patients who are intolerant to high-dose statins. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose statin (LDS) therapy versus combined therapy of LDS plus a nutraceutical combination containing red yeast rice, policosanol, berberine, folic acid, coenzyme Q10 and astaxanthin (Armolipid Plus) in high-risk patients. We performed a randomized (1:1), prospective, parallel group, single-blind trial in which participants had coronary artery disease (n = 100), had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention in the preceding 12 months, were high-dose statin intolerant, and did not achieve ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C with LDS treatment alone. After 3 months, patients in the LDS+Armolipid Plus (n = 50) group presented with a significantly greater reduction of LDL-C and total cholesterol (p < 0.0001), and 70% of patients in this group achieved the therapeutic target (LDL-C < 70mg/dl), whereas patients in the LDS group did not. Six patients (3 from each group) dropped out due to myalgia. In conclusion, in patients with coronary artery disease and high-dose statin intolerance, the combination of LDS and nutraceuticals represents a valuable therapeutic option.

### Peripheral neuropathy induced by red yeast rice in a patient with a known small bowel gastrointestinal tumour [^115QXqay]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a well-recognised side effect of the cholesterol-lowering statins. Red yeast rice (RYR) is a traditional Chinese herb, widely available over-the-counter that has also been found to reduce cholesterol. Little data is available regarding its side effect profile. We report a case of a 60-year-old male receiving therapeutic imatinib for metastatic gastrointestinal tumour (GIST), who developed peripheral neuropathy while also taking RYR. The symptoms completely settled following withdrawal of the RYR and he has subsequently continued to take imatinib for over 2 years with no adverse effects. Further research into the safety profile of RYR is needed. The importance of questioning patients about over the counter medications and herbal remedies cannot be overemphasised.

### Usefulness of nutraceuticals (armolipid plus) versus ezetimibe and combination in statin-intolerant patients with dyslipidemia with coronary heart disease [^114ZdU6q]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are extensively used to treat dyslipidemia, but, because of their low tolerability profile, they are discontinued in a significant proportion of patients. Ezetimibe and nutraceuticals have been introduced as alternative therapies and have proved to be effective and well tolerated. A single-blind, single-center, randomized, prospective, and parallel group trial comparing a combination of nutraceuticals (red yeast rice, policosanol, berberine, folic acid, coenzyme Q10 and astaxanthin), called Armolipid Plus, and ezetimibe for 3 months in terms of efficacy and tolerability. Patients who did not achieve their therapeutic target (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 100 mg/dl) could add the alternative treatment on top of randomized treatment for another 12 months: 100 patients who are dyslipidemic with ischemic heart disease treated with percutaneous coronary intervention were enrolled (ezetimibe n = 50, nutraceutical n = 50). Efficacy (lipid profile) and tolerability (adverse events, transaminases, and creatine kinase) were assessed after 3 and 12 months. After 3 months, 14 patients in the nutraceutical group achieved their therapeutic target, whereas none of the patients in the ezetimibe group did. At 1-year follow-up, 58 patients (72.5%) of the combined therapy group (n = 86) and 14 (100%) of the nutraceutical group reached the therapeutic goal. No patients experienced important undesirable effects. In conclusion, nutraceuticals alone or in combination with ezetimibe are well tolerated and improve the lipid profile in statin-intolerant patients with coronary heart disease. Further studies are needed to assess long-term effects of nutraceuticals on mortality.

### Functional foods and dietary supplements for the management of dyslipidaemia [^111qcJD7]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidaemia is characterized by increased blood levels of total or LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, or decreased HDL cholesterol levels, and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Dyslipidaemia has a high worldwide prevalence, and many patients are turning to alternatives to pharmacotherapy to manage their lipid levels. Lifestyle modification should be emphasized in all patients to reduce cardiovascular risk and can be initiated before pharmacotherapy in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Many functional foods and natural health products have been investigated for potential lipid-lowering properties. Those with good evidence for a biochemical effect on plasma lipid levels include soy protein, green tea, plant sterols, probiotic yogurt, marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids and red yeast rice. Other products such as seaweed, berberine, hawthorn and garlic might confer some limited benefit in certain patient groups. Although none of these products can reduce lipid levels to the same extent as statins, most are safe to use in addition to other lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. Natural health products marketed at individuals with dyslipidaemia, such as policosanol, guggulsterone and resveratrol, have minimal definitive evidence of a biochemical benefit. Additional research is required in this field, which should include large, high-quality randomized controlled trials with long follow-up periods to investigate associations with cardiovascular end points.

Dietary adjuncts for lowering atherogenic cholesterol — plant sterols/stanols and viscous fibers: If a diet based on a cardioprotective dietary pattern plus activity and weight loss is insufficient to attain goals, clinicians may consider the use of dietary adjuncts; the NLA Expert Panel consensus view is that there was sufficient evidence to recommend consideration of supplemental plant sterols/stanols (∼2 g/day) and viscous fibers (5–10 g/day) to enhance reductions in atherogenic cholesterol, noting that greater viscous fiber intake (10 to 25 g/day) will generally result in greater lowering but is challenging to achieve, and that ASCVD event trials are not available for these interventions.

### Tolerability of red yeast rice (2, 400 mg twice daily) versus pravastatin (20 mg twice daily) in patients with previous statin intolerance [^114chLJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Currently, no consensus has been reached regarding the management of hyperlipidemia in patients who develop statin-associated myalgia (SAM). Many statin-intolerant patients use alternative lipid-lowering therapies, including red yeast rice. The present trial evaluated the tolerability of red yeast rice versus pravastatin in patients unable to tolerate other statins because of myalgia. The study was conducted in a community-based setting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 43 adults with dyslipidemia and a history of statin discontinuation because of myalgia were randomly assigned to red yeast rice 2,400 mg twice daily or pravastatin 20 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. All subjects were concomitantly enrolled in a 12-week therapeutic lifestyle change program. The primary outcomes included the incidence of treatment discontinuation because of myalgia and a daily pain severity score. The secondary outcomes were muscle strength and plasma lipids. The incidence of withdrawal from medication owing to myalgia was 5% (1 of 21) in the red yeast rice group and 9% (2 of 22) in the pravastatin group (p = 0.99). The mean pain severity did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. No difference was found in muscle strength between the 2 groups at week 4 (p = 0.61), week 8 (p = 0.81), or week 12 (p = 0.82). The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level decreased 30% in the red yeast rice group and 27% in the pravastatin group. In conclusion, red yeast rice was tolerated as well as pravastatin and achieved a comparable reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a population previously intolerant to statins.

### Comparing the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice on hyperlipidaemia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117V2Ma8]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia.

Methods

Relevant literature published until 13 August 2021, was retrieved from six electronic databases. Randomized clinical trials of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice in patients with hyperlipidaemia were included in the review. Network meta-analysis was performed using Stata 13.1 software. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve probability values were used to rank the treatments.

Results

This study included 47 trials involving 4824 subjects. In terms of reduced total cholesterol levels, Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 84.5%) had the highest probability of being the most effective formulation, with Simvastatin (66.4%) and Zhibitai (65.4%) ranked second and third, respectively. Xuezhikang also had the highest probability of reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to the greatest extent (SUCRA: 82.6%) with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 74.9%) and Zhibituo (SUCRA: 52.8%) being the second and third choices, respectively. For reduced triglyceride levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 80.2%) exhibited the highest probability of being the most effective, with Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 63.4%) and Simvastatin (SUCRA: 57.6%) in second and third places, respectively. Finally, in terms of improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 90.1%) had the highest probability of being the most effective, with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 82.1%) and Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 51.1%) ranked second and third, respectively.

Conclusions

Xuezhikang was found to have the highest probability of being the most effective formulation for reducing total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while Zhibituo had the highest probability of being the most effective for controlling triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The studies included in the review exhibited certain limitations and, therefore, more rigorously designed studies should be performed.

2.4 Outcome measures

The main outcomes were serum lipid levels, including TC, TG, LDL‐C and HDL‐C levels. The secondary outcomes included ADRs.

2.5 Data extraction

Two reviewers (XGQ and DXL) independently selected the studies. Titles and abstracts were screened to identify potential articles, and then, the full texts of the screened articles were read to determine suitable studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies in selection were resolved through team discussion. The selection procedures were based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart.

2.6 Assessment of quality

Two researchers (XGQ and DXL) independently assessed the risk of bias in the studies included in this review using the risk of bias tool from the Cochrane Handbook. Any disagreements were resolved using an arbiter. The following items were evaluated: selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (blinding of assessors), attrition bias and other types of bias. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. According to the GRADE approach, evidence quality is classified into four levels: high, moderate, low and very low. RCTs provide high‐quality evidence; however, the evidence can be downgraded from high to low quality owing to five factors: study limitation (risk of bias), indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision and publication bias.

### Red yeast rice for hypercholesterolemia: JACC focus seminar [^1157dpkb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The extracts of red yeast rice (RYR) are currently the most effective cholesterol-lowering nutraceuticals. This activity is mainly due to monacolin K, a weak reversible inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, whose daily consumption causes a reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol plasma levels up to 15% to 25% within 6 to 8 weeks. The decrease in LDL-cholesterol is accompanied by a proportional decrease in total and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Some trials suggest that RYR use is associated with improvement in endothelial function and arterial stiffness, whereas a long-term study supports its role in the prevention of cardiovascular events. Despite the statin-like mechanism of action, the risk related to 3 to 10 mg monacolin K taken per day is minimal (mild myalgia in previously severely statin-intolerant subjects). RYR could represent a therapeutic tool to support lifestyle improvement in managing mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia in low-risk patients, including those who cannot be treated with statins or other LDL-cholesterol-lowering therapies.

### Natural compounds as anti-atherogenic agents: clinical evidence for improved cardiovascular outcomes [^112NCrri]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerosis, a chronic progressive inflammatory condition characterized by the formation of lipid-laden lesions in arterial walls, is associated with substantial morbidity (including ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction) and mortality. Risk factors for atherosclerosis are well understood and can be ameliorated by evidence-based and guideline-directed pharmaceutical agents (e.g. the reduction of circulating concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by statins). Additionally, many natural products (usually food derivatives) and 'nutraceuticals' (pharmaceutical formulations prepared from components of foods) have been shown to have favourable effects on risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This literature review summarises the evidence for anti-atherogenic natural compounds. The article focuses on agents which are discussed in international guidelines and are supported by extensive high-quality randomized-controlled trial (RCT) data. We focus on micronutrients (compounds present in food in small quantities) and nutraceuticals, in particular, phytosterols, polyunsaturated ω-3 fatty acids and red-yeast rice. We conclude that the 'nutraceutical approach' (identify the active ingredients in natural products; produce high-quality products according to Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines; evaluate them in long-term outcomes trials) is the mechanism by which the domains of natural product research and evidence-based medicine can move closer together.

Abstract

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia.

Methods

Relevant literature published until 13 August 2021, was retrieved from six electronic databases. Randomized clinical trials of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice in patients with hyperlipidaemia were included in the review. Network meta‐analysis was performed using Stata 13.1 software. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve probability values were used to rank the treatments.

Results

This study included 47 trials involving 4824 subjects. In terms of reduced total cholesterol levels, Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 84.5%) had the highest probability of being the most effective formulation, with Simvastatin (66.4%) and Zhibitai (65.4%) ranked second and third, respectively. Xuezhikang also had the highest probability of reducing low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to the greatest extent (SUCRA: 82.6%) with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 74.9%) and Zhibituo (SUCRA: 52.8%) being the second and third choices, respectively. For reduced triglyceride levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 80.2%) exhibited the highest probability of being the most effective, with Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 63.4%) and Simvastatin (SUCRA: 57.6%) in second and third places, respectively. Finally, in terms of improving high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 90.1%) had the highest probability of being the most effective, with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 82.1%) and Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 51.1%) ranked second and third, respectively.

Conclusions

Xuezhikang was found to have the highest probability of being the most effective formulation for reducing total cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while Zhibituo had the highest probability of being the most effective for controlling triglyceride and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The studies included in the review exhibited certain limitations and, therefore, more rigorously designed studies should be performed.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab as add-on therapy in high-cardiovascular-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with atorvastatin (20 or 40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 or 20 mg): design and rationale of the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies [^114J6qCQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

So as not to interfere with the study drug or serum lipids, the following concomitant LLTs were prohibited from the initial screening visit until the end of the study visit: statins other than atorvastatin and rosuvastatin (provided as blinded medications), ezetimibe (other than that provided as blinded medication), fibrates other than fenofibrate, and red yeast rice products. Lipid‐lowering therapies that were allowed as background therapy throughout the study included fish oils with omega‐3 fatty acids, fenofibrate, bile acid‐binding sequestrants, and niacin. Doses of these medications were stable for ≥ 4 weeks before screening (≥ 6 weeks for fenofibrate) and were to remain stable for the duration of the study.

Throughout the studies, patients were asked to follow a stable, National Cholesterol Education Program–Adult Treatment Panel III Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (NCEP‐ATP III TLC) diet or equivalent diet from screening to the end‐of‐study visit. At the end of the 24‐week treatment period, patients entered an 8‐week follow‐up period.

### Usefulness of low-dose statin plus ezetimibe and / or nutraceuticals in patients with coronary artery disease intolerant to high-dose statin treatment [^115FLU7P]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

High-dose statin (HDS) therapy is recommended to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); however, some patients are unable to tolerate the associated side effects. Nutraceuticals have shown efficacy in lowering LDL-C. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the combination of low-dose statin (LDS) plus ezetimibe (EZE) or LDS plus nutraceutical (Armolipid Plus [ALP] containing red yeast rice, policosanol, and berberine) can lead to a higher proportion of high-risk patients achieving target LDL-C. A secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of triple combination LDS + EZE + ALP in resistant patients (LDL-C > 70 mg/dl). A randomized, prospective, parallel-group, single-blind study was conducted in patients with coronary artery disease (n = 100) who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention in the preceding 12 months, were HDS-intolerant, and were not at LDL-C target (< 70 mg/dl) with LDS alone. Patients received either LDS + EZE or LDS + ALP. Of the 100 patients, 33 patients (66%) treated with LDS + EZE and 31 patients (62%) treated with LDS + ALP achieved target LDL-C after 3 months, which was maintained at 6 months. Patients who did not achieve the therapeutic goal received a triple combination of LDS + EZE + ALP for a further 3 months. At 6 months, 28 of 36 patients (78%) achieved LDL-C target. Overall, 92% of patients enrolled in this study were at target LDL-C at 6 months. No patients in any group experienced major side effects. In conclusion, in HDS-intolerant coronary artery disease patients, the combination of LDS plus EZE and/or ALP represents a valuable therapeutic option allowing most patients to reach target LDL-C within 3 to 6 months.

### Cardiovascular risk management in people with type 1 diabetes: performance using three guidelines [^116QhNhF]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of our study are (1) the use of real-world data from type 1 diabetes outpatient clinics; (2) the use of three guidelines to assess recommendation and performance (3) the relatively large study size.

Limitations include the cross-sectional design and the dependence on what the healthcare providers reported in the medical records. Cardiovascular risk management is a longitudinal process. As a result, a cross-sectional assessment of these data therefore may lead to underestimation or overestimation of treatment. For example, the group recommended no LLM in the Dutch guideline in the age group 60–70 years appear to use the most LLM. Individuals who have been treated for years with adequate LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure management have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and will also have a low Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation. These individuals may suggest that there is overtreatment, when in fact their low risk is a result of adequate CVRM. Furthermore, achievement of targets may be underestimated due to individuals who have not yet reached optimum dosages, who eventually may reach the suggested targets. Others with well-maintained LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure may also be measured less often. Missing lipid and blood pressure measurements may contribute to an overall overestimation of the degree of undertreatment.

The categorisation of individuals for different recommendations was conducted with data available from the data extraction, and therefore is limited by the information available in the medical records. Moreover, we could not identify why certain individuals were not using LLM and AHM. Some individuals may be intolerant to statins, and others may have refrained from pharmacological strategies and sought out over-the-counter products like red yeast rice as alternatives to prescription of LLM. In young women who wish to conceive LLM are contraindicated, and this is a legitimate reason not to start LLM. However, no differences were found when comparing LLM prescription by sex.

Finally, it is important to note that some individuals under the age of 25 years in this study were treated by pediatric endocrinologists who may be using the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes guidelines.

### Provider recommendations for patient-reported muscle symptoms on statin therapy: insights from the understanding statin use in America and gaps in patient education survey [^113gDg9w]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Statin-associated muscle symptoms are reported by 10% to 29% of patients in clinical practice and are a major determinant of statin nonadherence, discontinuation, and switching. Little is known about what advice patients receive from their providers when dealing with these symptoms.

Objective

The objective of the study was to assess patient's reports of provider advice when experiencing new or worsened muscle symptoms while taking a statin.

Methods

Data were analyzed from the Understanding Statin Use in America and Gaps in Education survey, a self-administered internet-based survey of 10,138 adults with a reported history of high cholesterol and statin use.

Results

Of the respondents, 60% of former statin users (n = 1220) reported ever experiencing new or worsened muscle pain on a statin, in contrast to 25% of current users (n = 8918; P < .001). Former statin users reported stopping more statins because of muscle symptoms (mean ± standard deviation, 2.2 ± 1.7) compared with current users (mean 1.6 ± 1.5, P < .0001). For those with muscle-related symptoms while on a statin, participants reported that providers most often suggested switching to another statin (33.8%), stopping the statin (15.9%), continuing the statin with further monitoring of muscle symptoms (12.2%), reducing the statin dose (9.8%), or getting a blood test for signs of muscle damage (9.2%). A lower percentage were advised to add either vitamin D (7.0%) or coenzyme Q10 (5.8%), or to switch to nonstatin therapy (6.1%) or red yeast rice (2.6%).

Conclusions

This study highlights patient experience with statin-associated muscle symptoms and the strategies recommended by providers in managing these symptoms. More research is needed to develop patient-centric and evidence-based approaches to managing statin-associated muscle symptoms, which is especially important in light of recent data showing increased cardiovascular risk among those who discontinue statin therapy.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111utkMJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Soy protein and lipids — meta-analyses and trial synthesis: A 1995 review reported that consumption of 47 g soy protein/day reduced serum total cholesterol (total-C) by 9.3%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 12.9%, and triglycerides (TG) by 10.5%, while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 2.4%, which supported the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) health claim stating that "25 g of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease". More recent assessments include an AHA Soy Science Advisory Panel meta-analysis showing a mean LDL-C reduction of 3% with soy protein interventions from 22 randomized trials and concluding no effect on HDL-C, TG, lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], or blood pressure. Jenkins and colleagues estimated an intrinsic effect of soy from studies using 20–133 g/day soy protein, and an extrinsic displacement effect modeled by substituting 13 to 58 g/day soy protein for animal protein; their results suggested that approximately 30 g/day may reduce serum LDL-C by approximately 4% to 5% intrinsically with an additional 4% to 5% from displacement, for a combined estimated LDL-C reduction of 7.9% to 10.3%. A 2011 meta-analysis reported soy protein intake ranging from 15 to 50 g/day (mean ~30 g/day) and was associated with an LDL-C reduction of 5.5% in parallel studies and 4.2% in crossover studies; in parallel studies HDL-C values were 3.2% higher and fasting TG levels were 10.7% lower with soy versus control, and the duration necessary to produce maximal LDL-C effects was 8 weeks.

### United States cholesterol guidelines 2001: expanded scope of intensive low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapy [^111QSu1w]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The new clinical guidelines of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) were released in May 2001. These guidelines were published as the NCEP's Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III report. They are derived from an extensive review of the emerging literature so as to provide an evidence-based report. Thanks to recent clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy, it is possible to expand the scope of clinical management for both dietary and drug therapies. This expansion derives from a conclusive demonstration of efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of therapies. This article will review briefly the major features of ATP III.

### Red yeast rice preparations: are they suitable substitutions for statins? [^1134FotB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Red yeast rice, a commercially available food supplement known to reduce serum cholesterol, has been repeatedly advocated as alternative therapy for hypercholesterolemic patients that refuse statins, cannot tolerate statin therapy's side effects, or request a "naturopathic" medicine. Red yeast rice contains a fungus (Monascus purpureus), which was utilized in the original production of lovastatin (MEVACOR, Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ), the first marketed pharmaceutical statin, and is chemically identical to such product. Their identical properties account for the similarity in therapeutic and side effects of red yeast rice and lovastatin. The red yeast rice ingredient that blocks cholesterol production is monacolin K. Because red yeast rice preparations have large variability in monacolin K content, predicting or understanding dose-related efficacy and side-effect risks of red yeast rice is practically impossible. The lipid-regulating potency of red yeast rice in commercial preparations was found to be extensively different according to the number or concentration of monacolin K they possess. Furthermore, more than one type of monacolin was found in different preparations (or batches) of red yeast rice. Other ingredients found in red yeast rice are also known to be potentially toxic. The US Food and Drug Administration issued warnings to consumers in 2007 and in 2013 against taking red yeast rice products due to the lack of assurance about its efficacy, safety, and lack of standardized preparation methods. This article discusses my clinical trial results with red yeast rice, reviews the literature on its therapeutic and side effects, and discusses why red yeast rice is not an acceptable substitution for statins.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol XL) [^111W432n]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering
diet before receiving Lescol®(fluvastatin sodium) or
Lescol®XL (fluvastatin sodium) and should continue on
this diet during treatment with Lescol or Lescol XL. (See NCEP Treatment
Guidelines for details on dietary therapy.)

For patients requiring LDL-C reduction to a goal of ≥ 25%, the
recommended starting dose is 40 mg as one capsule in the evening, 80 mg as one
Lescol XL tablet administered as a single dose at any time of the day or 80 mg
in divided doses of the 40 mg capsule given twice daily. For patients requiring
LDL-C reduction to a goal of < 25% a starting dose of 20 mg may be used. The
recommended dosing range is 20–80 mg/day. Lescol or Lescol XL may be taken
without regard to meals, since there are no apparent differences in the
lipid-lowering effects of fluvastatin sodium administered with the evening meal
or 4 hours after the evening meal. Do not break, crush or chew Lescol XL
tablets or open Lescol capsules prior to administration.

Since the maximal reductions in LDL-C of a given dose are seen within 4
weeks, periodic lipid determinations should be performed and dosage adjustment
made according to the patient's response to therapy and established treatment
guidelines. The therapeutic effect of Lescol or Lescol XL is maintained with
prolonged administration.

### Traditional Chinese lipid-lowering agent red yeast rice results in significant LDL reduction but safety is uncertain-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116DTN4z]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To verify the safety and effectiveness of traditional Chinese red yeast rice-extract (RYR) for reduction of LDL cholesterol.

Methods

Systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Medline and EMBASE were searched until November 2014. We selected randomized studies in which RYR with a known content of the active substance monacolin K was tested against placebo or an active control group. Outcome measures were the effect of RYR on LDL cholesterol and incidence of adverse reactions with emphasis on liver and kidney injury and muscle symptoms.

Results

Twenty studies were analyzed. Quality of safety assessment was low in the majority of studies. RYR lowered LDL cholesterol with 1.02 mmol/L [-1.20; -0.83] compared to placebo. Effect of RYR on LDL was not different from statin therapy (0.03 mmol/L [-0.36; 0.41]). The incidence of liver and kidney injury was 0–5% and the risk was not different between treatment and control groups (risk difference -0.01 [-0.01; 0.0] and 0.0 [-0.01; 0.02]).

Conclusions

RYR exerts a clinically and statistically significant reduction of 1.02 mmol/L LDL cholesterol. Only when the mild profile of adverse reactions can be affirmed in studies with adequate methodology for safety assessment, RYR might be a safe and effective treatment option for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction in statin intolerant patients.

Grading of the Evidence

The overall quality (certainty) of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 which grades evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low quality. RCTs are graded as high‐quality evidence by default. Scores can then be downgraded on the basis of the following prespecified criteria: risk of bias (weight of studies shows important risk of bias), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity of I² > 50%, P < 0.10), indirectness (presence of factors that limit the generalizability of the results), imprecision (95% confidence interval [CI] for risk estimates are wide or overlap a minimally important difference of 0.1 mmol/L for LDL‐C and non‐HDL‐C and 0.04 g/L for Apo‐B), and publication bias (evidence of small‐study effects).

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — Key questions 6–11 enumerate pharmacotherapy topics, statin-associated symptom management, and nutrition strategies relevant to dyslipidemia care. Pharmacotherapy items include high dose/intensity statins or ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, bile acid sequestrant, niacin, fibrate, or fish oils added to statins, and consideration of LDL < 70 or < 100 and non-HDL < 100 or 130 mg/dL, with intensified treatment and lower LDL or non-HDL goals. Statin management options listed include use of the Statin-Associated Muscle Symptom Clinical Index tool with measurement of CK levels and assessment for myalgia and risk factors, alternative day statin therapy, switching to a different statin, lowering the dose, combination therapy after dose reduction or a change in drug, and optimizing vitamin D status using supplements. Additional key questions cover stopping statin use, lipid interventions (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic), dietary supplements (Omega-3, red yeast rice, soluble fiber, garlic, ginger, plant sterols, green tea, niacin), and different dietary therapies (Mediterranean, vegetarian, vegan, low-fat, or DASH diet) with a registered dietitian providing individualized counseling; the page also notes low HDL or high TGs (150–499 mg/dL).

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^112Te7Bv]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Dietary adjuncts — viscous dietary fibers are highlighted for LDL-C lowering when lifestyle changes are insufficient; healthcare professionals may consider recommending dietary adjuncts, and the most clear and consistent evidence exists for viscous dietary fibers and PSs. A meta-analysis of 66 RCTs found statistically significant LDL-C reductions for beta-glucan, psyllium, pectin, and guar gum with no significant TG or HDL-C changes, and the pooled effect was a reduction of 1.1 mg/dL in LDL-C per gram/day. These findings were confirmed in a larger meta-analysis (165 RCTs). Accordingly, 5–10 g/day of viscous fiber would be expected to lower mean LDL-C by 5.5 to 11.0 mg/dL, or 4.6% to 9.2% with a pre-use LDL-C of 120 mg/dL; because psyllium seed husk may affect absorption of some medications, it is best taken 2 hours before or 2 hours after medications.

Support for a prescription statin clinical trial for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer has been lacking, although recent data have provoked interest in such a study. The authors have initiated a pilot trial of red yeast rice (RYR) extract and prostate cancer. RYR significantly reduces low-density lipoprotein and is an option for statin-intolerant patients. RYR appears to be an adequate proxy for some statins as long as quality control is monitored. The REALITY (REduction in Active surveillance Lipid Indices Through Yeast of red rice) trial will be conducted in Toronto, Canada.

### Lovastatin [^112T5jHx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving lovastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with lovastatin (see NCEP Treatment Guidelines for details on dietary therapy). Lovastatin should be given with meals.

Adult Patients

The usual recommended starting dose is 20 mg once a day given with the evening meal. The recommended dosing range is 10 to 80 mg/day in single or two divided doses; the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg/day. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy (see NCEP Guidelines and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Patients requiring reductions in LDL-C of 20% or more to achieve their goal (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE) should be started on 20 mg/day of lovastatin. A starting dose of 10 mg may be considered for patients requiring smaller reductions. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.

Cholesterol levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of lovastatin if cholesterol levels fall significantly below the targeted range.

Dosage in Patients taking Danazol, Diltiazem, Dronedarone, or Verapamil

In patients taking danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil concomitantly with lovastatin, therapy should begin with 10 mg of lovastatin and should not exceed 20 mg / day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis, PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Other Drug Interactions).

Dosage in Patients taking Amiodarone

In patients taking amiodarone concomitantly with lovastatin, the dose should not exceed 40 mg/day (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Other drug interactions).

Adolescent Patients (10 to 17 years of age) with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia

The recommended dosing range is 10 to 40 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 40 mg/day. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy (see NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines ††, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Patients requiring reductions in LDL-C of 20% or more to achieve their goal should be started on 20 mg/day of lovastatin. A starting dose of 10 mg may be considered for patients requiring smaller reductions. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.

Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy

Lovastatin is effective alone or when used concomitantly with bile-acid sequestrants (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

### Comparing the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice on hyperlipidaemia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113nZtXB]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2.7 Statistical analysis

A statistical software (Stata 13.1; Stata Corporation) was used for the present study. The results were reported as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity assessment was performed using chi‐squared (χ²) tests; if I² was ≤ 50%, the heterogeneity was considered to be low, and network meta‐analysis could be performed; if I² > 50%, heterogeneity was deemed to be high, and the study could be conducted when the source of heterogeneity could be found. For indirect comparisons, the treatment effects of all regimens were estimated using a two‐stage network meta‐analysis as follows: Initially, an inconsistency test was performed using a node‐splitting model, and fitting consistency or inconsistency models were constructed and presented using the network command; if inconsistency was not statistically significant (p > .05), a consistency model was used; otherwise, an inconsistency model was employed. Pairwise comparisons were conducted using the 'interval plot' command. Ranking probabilities for each intervention were then estimated using the 'network rank' command. Surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve values were calculated to rank the efficacy of each intervention. Larger SUCRA values indicate a more effective intervention. Publication bias was evaluated using comparison‐adjusted funnel plots.

3.4.4 LDL‐C — Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels

In a total of 4724 patients in 46 RCTs, three types of Chinese patent medicines were analysed for changes in LDL‐C levels compared to Simvastatin or placebo. Chi‐squared tests showed no heterogeneity between studies (p = 1.0, I² = 0.0%). There was a statistically significant difference in all treatments compared with the placebo group. No statistically significant differences were observed between the other comparisons. The results of the network meta‐analysis are summarized in Table 4. The ranking probabilities based on SUCRA values (Figure 6) were Xuezhikang (82.6%) > Simvastatin (74.9%) > Zhibituo (52.8%) > Zhibitai (39.5%) > placebo (0.2%), indicating that Xuezhikang was the most effective intervention for LDL‐C, followed by Simvastatin and Zhibituo, respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab 150 mg every 4 Weeks in patients with hypercholesterolemia not on statin therapy: the ODYSSEY CHOICE II study [^113nHXp6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Patients

The study enrolled adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) with hypercholesterolemia receiving fenofibrate or ezetimibe or diet alone. Only patients not receiving a statin were eligible for the study, which corresponded to patients who (1) had SAMS (which was defined as statin intolerance in the protocol) with moderate, high, or very high cardiovascular risk or (2) were not receiving a statin but who did not fulfill the SAMS definition: only patients at moderate cardiovascular risk were included in this stratum. SAMS, as well as moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk, were defined as previously described. 21

SAMS, defined as statin intolerance in the study protocol, was defined as the inability to tolerate at least 2 statins, consistent with other studies in the ODYSSEY clinical trial program 21: 1 statin at the lowest daily starting dose (defined as rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg, or pitavastatin 2 mg), and another statin at any dose, due to SAMS, other than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, weakness, or cramping, that began or increased during statin therapy and stopped when statin therapy was discontinued.

The aim was for two‐thirds of randomized patients to be receiving fenofibrate/ezetimibe, and for ≥ 50% of patients to fulfill the SAMS definition. Patients were instructed to maintain a stable diet (National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet or equivalent) throughout the entire study duration, including the screening period. 22 Use of fibrates (other than fenofibrate), niacin, bile acid‐binding sequestrants, or red yeast rice products was not allowed during the study. A list of exclusion criteria is given in Table S1.

Hypercholesterolemia was defined based on cardiovascular risk: LDL‐C ≥ 70 mg/dL if very high cardiovascular risk, or LDL‐C ≥ 100 mg/dL if high or moderate risk. In addition, for those patients not fulfilling the SAMS definition, or who were being treated with diet alone, LDL‐C also had to be ≥ 100 and < 160 mg/dL.

### Β-glucan from barley and its lipid-lowering capacity: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^116kcFxD]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

To more precisely quantify the effect of barley β-glucan on blood lipid concentrations in humans and to examine the factors that could affect its efficacy.

Subjects/Methods

Eleven eligible randomized clinical trials published from 1989 to 2008 were identified from nine databases. Weighted mean effect sizes were calculated for net differences in lipid profile using a random effect model (RevMan 4.2).

Results

Overall, barley and β-glucan isolated from barley lowered total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations by 0.30 mmol/l (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.39 to -0.21, P < 0.00001) and 0.27 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.34 to -0.20, P < 0.00001), respectively, compared with control. The pattern of cholesterol-lowering action of barley in this analysis could not be viewed as a dose-dependent response. There were no significant subgroup differences by type of intervention and food matrix.

Conclusions

Increased consumption of barely products should be considered as a dietary approach to reduce LDL cholesterol concentrations.

### Three cases of red yeast rice-containing supplement-induced acute kidney injury and Fanconi syndrome [^116sccmn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Japan has recently faced a public health crisis owing to "Beni Koji Choleste Help", a product marketed as a dietary supplement. It is made from red yeast rice and has cholesterol-lowering effects. Following the identification of the first case of acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by the product, 76 possibly related deaths and 492 hospitalizations have been reported in Japan. We herein demonstrate 3 cases of AKI with renal tubular acidosis and Fanconi syndrome following consumption of the product for 2 weeks to 7 months. Kidney biopsy revealed diffuse tubular injury, tubular cell flattening, loss of brush border, sparse debris, and cast formation containing periodic acid-Schiff- and silver stain-positive fluffy material in the tubular lumens with interstitial cell infiltration, together with mild fibrosis. Electron microscopy revealed fluffy materials in the tubular lumen surrounded by necrotic tubular cell debris and intracellular contents. Discontinuation of the supplement and treatment with prednisolone improved kidney function and Fanconi syndrome. Longitudinal monitoring and surveys are required to detect and prevent the progression to chronic kidney disease in people who have consumed "Beni Koji Choleste Help".

### Niacin (niaspan) [^115jF4AH]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

NIASPAN should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with NIASPAN must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in below. Table 1

Maintenance Dose

The daily dosage of NIASPAN should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1000 mg tablet) to 2000 mg (two 1000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower NIASPAN doses than men [see Clinical Studies] (14.2)

Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable.

If lipid response to NIASPAN alone is insufficient or if higher doses of NIASPAN are not well tolerated, some patients may benefit from combination therapy with a bile acid binding resin or statin, below and [see Drug Interactions (7.3) Concomitant Therapy Clinical Studies](14.3 14.4)

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^112W9ukv]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Red yeast rice (RYR) for LDL-C — composition variability, safety, and recommendation stance: RYR, produced by fermenting Monascus purpureus on rice, contains monacolins; monacolin K is structurally identical to lovastatin and inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Although meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials report LDL-C reductions with doses generally between 1200 to 2400 mg/day of RYR extract, responses vary with monacolin content. In 2017, 28 U.S. brands were analyzed: two had no detectable monacolin K and the other 26 ranged from 0.09 mg to 5.48 mg per 1200 mg of RYR. Products with any amount of monacolin K above trace amounts are considered unapproved new drugs by the U.S. FDA; labels typically do not disclose monacolin K amounts, and contaminants such as citrinin have been found. Because of these issues, the authors did not feel there was sufficient evidence to make a recommendation for dietary supplements other than PSs and viscous fibers for LDL-C lowering.

### Cholestyramine (Prevalite) [^1137jZmx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended starting adult dose for Prevalite®(cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP) powder is one packet or one level scoopful (5.5 grams of Prevalite®[cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP] powder contain 4 grams of anhydrous cholestyramine resin) once or twice a day. The recommended maintenance dose for Prevalite®(cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP) powder is 2 to 4 packets or scoopfuls daily (8 to 16 grams anhydrous cholestyramine resin) divided into two doses. It is recommended that increases in dose be gradual with periodic assessment of lipid/lipoprotein levels at intervals of not less than 4 weeks. The maximum recommended daily dose is six packets or scoopfuls of Prevalite®(cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP) powder (24 grams of anhydrous cholestyramine resin). The suggested time of administration is at mealtime but may be modified to avoid interference with absorption of other medications. Although the recommended dosing schedule is twice daily, Prevalite®(cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP) powder may be administered in 1 to 6 doses per day.

Prevalite (cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP) powder should not be taken in its dry form. Always mix the dry powder with water or other fluids before ingesting. See Preparation Instructions.

Concomitant Therapy

Preliminary evidence suggests that the lipid-lowering effects of cholestyramine on total and LDL-cholesterol are enhanced when combined with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, e.g., pravastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin and fluvastatin. Additive effects on LDL-cholesterol are also seen with combined nicotinic acid/cholestyramine therapy. See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions for recommendations on administering concomitant therapy.

Preparation

The color of Prevalite®(cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP) powder may vary somewhat from batch to batch but this variation does not affect the performance of the product. Place the contents of one single-dose packet or one level scoopful of Prevalite®(cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP) powder in a glass or cup. Add at least 2 to 3 ounces of water or the beverage of your choice. Stir to a uniform consistency.

Prevalite®(cholestyramine for oral suspension, USP) powder may also be mixed with highly fluid soups or pulpy fruits with a high moisture content such as applesauce or crushed pineapple.

### Estimated exposure to 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanicals in US adults [^111ZfRAN]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

US Population Estimates of Exposure to Botanicals of Interest

Extrapolating from the NHANES data, we observed approximately 4.7% (95% CI, 4.0%-5.7%), or an estimated 15 584 599 (95% CI, 13 047 571–18 648 801), of US adults used at least 1 of the 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanical products within the past 30 days. The most common products used were turmeric or curcumin, estimated at 11 400 151 (95% CI, 906 813–14 332 559) adults, and green tea, estimated at 3 327 790 (95% CI, 2 306 389–4 777 520) adults. An estimated 1 252 040 (95% CI, 757 813–2 075 750) adults used ashwagandha, 1 219 091 (95% CI, 724 865–32 075 750) adults used black cohosh, 889 607 (95% CI, 494 226–1 581 524) adults used Garcinia cambogia, and 626 020 (95% CI, 362 433–1 120 246) adults used red yeast rice.

The prevalence of using the 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanical products was compared with the prevalence of the use of known hepatotoxic prescription medications (LiverTox class A or B) that are used for similar indications. Approximately 14 793 837 (95% CI, 13 014 623–16 671 897) US adults used prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are typically used for indications similar to those for turmeric (ie, pain or arthritis). Simvastatin, a hypolipidemic drug used to treat and prevent cardiovascular disease similar to the use for red yeast rice, was consumed by 14 036 024 (95% CI, 11 202 460–17 594 452) individuals. The prevalence of sertraline use was 7 676 980 (95% CI, 6 523 786–8 994 917) individuals. The comparison of the botanical products of interest with commonly prescribed prescription medications is shown in Figure 2 (based on the 2020 US Census estimated total resident population 18 years of age or older of 329 484 123, July 1, 2020).

3.4.5 HDL‐C — High‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels

A total of 4473 patients in 43 RCTs, were used to analyse three Chinese patent medicines for changes in HDL‐C levels compared to Simvastatin or placebo. Heterogeneity tests showed no heterogeneity between studies (p = .24, I² = 0.0%). One studywas excluded from the analysis because it identified an outlier value. The results suggested that in five comparisons (Zhibituo vs. Zhibitai; Zhibituo vs. placebo; Simvastatin vs. Zhibitai; Xuezhikang vs. placebo; Simvastatin vs. p‐placebo), the differences were statistically significant (MD = 0.16, 95% CI [0.02, 0.30]; MD = 0.16, 95% CI [0.07, 0.25]; MD = −0.15, 95% CI [−0.28, −0.02]; MD = 0.11, 95% CI [0.03, 0.18]; MD = 0.1, 95% CI [0.06, 0.23], respectively). No statistically significant differences were observed between the other comparisons. The results of the network meta‐analysis are summarized in Table 5. The ranking probabilities based on SUCRA values (Figure 7) were as follows: Zhibituo (90.1%) > Simvastatin (82.1%) > Xuezhikang (51.1%) > Zhibitai (14.0%) > placebo (12.7%), indicating that Zhibituo was the most effective intervention for HDL‐C, followed by Simvastatin and Xuezhikang.

### Comparing the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice on hyperlipidaemia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115aVwdf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hyperlipidaemia is a common, global metabolic syndrome associated with lipid abnormalities, including increased levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and decreased levels of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C). Serum lipid levels in the Chinese population have gradually increased, and the prevalence of dyslipidaemia among Chinese adults has reached 40.4%. Hyperlipidaemia is a major contributory factor to various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, measures to effectively and treat dyslipidaemia are crucial for preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

Statins are currently the drug of choice for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. However, the side effects caused by their use often limit their application. Previous studies have suggested that extracts of red yeast rice (RYR) reduce blood lipid levels. There are many varieties of oral Chinese patent medicines containing RYR for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, such as Xuezhikang, Zhibituo and Zhibitai capsules, which are widely used in China for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia.

However, the efficacy of these Chinese patent medicines has not been directly compared for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia; therefore, it is not possible to select an optimal formulation for patients with hyperlipidaemia. Consequently, we conducted a network meta‐analysis to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines for treating hyperlipidaemia and identify which of them was consistently ranked as the most effective.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^111sySEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

### Red yeast rice for dyslipidemia in statin-intolerant patients: a randomized trial [^113sLcT2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Red yeast rice is an herbal supplement that decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of red yeast rice and therapeutic lifestyle change to treat dyslipidemia in patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy.

Design

Randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Community-based cardiology practice.

Patients

62 patients with dyslipidemia and history of discontinuation of statin therapy due to myalgias.

Intervention

Patients were assigned by random allocation software to receive red yeast rice, 1800 mg (31 patients), or placebo (31 patients) twice daily for 24 weeks. All patients were concomitantly enrolled in a 12-week therapeutic lifestyle change program.

Measurements

Primary outcome was LDL cholesterol level, measured at baseline, week 12, and week 24. Secondary outcomes included total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, liver enzyme, and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels; weight; and Brief Pain Inventory score.

Results

In the red yeast rice group, LDL cholesterol decreased by 1.11 mmol/L (43 mg/dL) from baseline at week 12 and by 0.90 mmol/L (35 mg/dL) at week 24. In the placebo group, LDL cholesterol decreased by 0.28 mmol/L (11 mg/dL) at week 12 and by 0.39 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) at week 24. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was significantly lower in the red yeast rice group than in the placebo group at both weeks 12 (P < 0.001) and 24 (P = 0.011). Significant treatment effects were also observed for total cholesterol level at weeks 12 (P < 0.001) and 24 (P = 0.016). Levels of HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, liver enzyme, or CPK; weight loss; and pain severity scores did not significantly differ between groups at either week 12 or week 24.

Limitation

The study was small, was single-site, was of short duration, and focused on laboratory measures.

Conclusion

Red yeast rice and therapeutic lifestyle change decrease LDL cholesterol level without increasing CPK or pain levels and may be a treatment option for dyslipidemic patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy.

### Review of red yeast rice content and current food and drug administration oversight [^1119PKGy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Red yeast rice (RYR) is a commonly used dietary supplement for the management of dyslipidemia. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a consumer warning to avoid RYR products because they may contain unauthorized drug (lovastatin) and also implemented Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requiring that proper controls be in place by dietary supplement companies to ensure products are manufactured and processed in a consistent manner and produce high-quality products that are not adulterated with impurities or contaminants and are accurately labeled.

Objective

To assess the FDA oversight of companies manufacturing RYR products and review the labeled content of available RYR products.

Methods

The FDA was audited through the Freedom of Information Act, we requested answers to a series of questions concerning their oversight of companies manufacturing RYR products. The labeled content of each RYR product listed in the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database (NMCD) was tabulated and summarized. Statin-related product warnings and if product certification and verification by an independent laboratory had been performed were documented.

Results

The FDA had no information on the number of RYR manufacturers and their compliance with CGMP regulations. A total of 101 products containing RYR were reviewed. No product could be confirmed as passing any independent laboratory verification testing. Nearly one-half (42.6%) of the RYR product labels contained statin-related warnings (ie, potential for muscle pain or weakness, etc).

Conclusion

Currently, the FDA is not regulating manufacturers of RYR products and as a result, many of these products may contain monacolin K and toxins such as citrinin.

### Effect of xuezhikang, an extract from red yeast Chinese rice, on coronary events in a Chinese population with previous myocardial infarction [^112ofsKy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Results of well-controlled prospective clinical trials showed the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies in the reduction of cardiovascular (CV) events in western populations, but they were not reported with a Chinese population. This multicenter study was conducted to determine the effects of Xuezhikang (XZK), a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, on lipoprotein and CV end points in Chinese patients who experienced a previous myocardial infarction. Nearly 5,000 of these patients with average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at baseline were randomly assigned either to placebo or to XZK daily for an average of 4.5 years. The primary end point was a major coronary event that included nonfatal myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease. Frequencies of the primary end point were 10.4% in the placebo group and 5.7% in the XZK-treated group, with absolute and relative decreases of 4.7% and 45%, respectively. Treatment with XZK also significantly decreased CV and total mortality by 30% and 33%, the need for coronary revascularization by 1/3, and lowered total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, but raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In conclusion, long-term therapy with XZK significantly decreased the recurrence of coronary events and the occurrence of new CV events and deaths, improved lipoprotein regulation, and was safe and well tolerated.

### Managing hyperlipidaemia in patients with COVID-19 and during its pandemic: an expert panel position statement from HEART UK [^115eicjm]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Medium credibility.

The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and its severity highly variable. The fatality rate is unpredictable but is amplified by several factors including advancing age, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. A large proportion of patients with these conditions are treated with lipid lowering medication and questions regarding the safety of continuing lipid-lowering medication in patients infected with COVID-19 have arisen. Some have suggested they may exacerbate their condition. It is important to consider known interactions with lipid-lowering agents and with specific therapies for COVID-19. This statement aims to collate current evidence surrounding the safety of lipid-lowering medications in patients who have COVID-19. We offer a consensus view based on current knowledge and we rated the strength and level of evidence for these recommendations. Pubmed, Google scholar and Web of Science were searched extensively for articles using search terms: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus, Lipids, Statin, Fibrates, Ezetimibe, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, nicotinic acid, bile acid sequestrants, nutraceuticals, red yeast rice, Omega-3-Fatty acids, Lomitapide, hypercholesterolaemia, dyslipidaemia and Volanesorsen. There is no evidence currently that lipid lowering therapy is unsafe in patients with COVID-19 infection. Lipid-lowering therapy should not be interrupted because of the pandemic or in patients at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In patients with confirmed COVID-19, care should be taken to avoid drug interactions, between lipid-lowering medications and drugs that may be used to treat COVID-19, especially in patients with abnormalities in liver function tests.

### Acute hepatitis Caused by a natural lipid-lowering product: when "alternative" medicine is no "alternative" at all [^1124xgWf]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

The general public's growing mistrust of the pharmaceutical industry and its perception of the lack of adverse effects of "natural" therapy have lead to the increasing use of "alternative drugs" for hypercholesterolemia.

Methods

A sixty-three year old woman presented with severe hypertransaminasemia that had developed progressively over a few weeks. For six months she had been taking Equisterol, an over-the-counter lipid-lowering product containing guggulsterol and red yeast rice extract. The product had been prescribed for hypercholesterolemia because the patient had developed hepatotoxicity while on lovastatin.

Results

Liver biopsy revealed severe lobular necroinflammatory changes with an eosinophilic infiltrate. The episode was regarded as an adverse drug reaction after exclusion of other possible causes of acute liver disease and the prompt normalization of liver function tests after Equisterol had been discontinued. Red yeast rice extract's cholesterol-lowering properties are largely due to fungal metabolites known as monacolins, one of which — monacolin K — is identical to lovastatin.

Conclusions

The choice of an alternative medicine approach in this case subjected the patient to "re-challenge" with the official medicine agent that had previously caused mild hepatotoxicity. Physicians should keep in mind that "alternative" medicine is not always the safest alternative and sometimes it is not even "alternative".

### Is the guideline process replicable and, if not, what does this mean? [^113mpgug]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Increasingly, guidelines determine how medical care will be provided. However there has been limited study of the determinants of the reliability of the guideline process. Guidelines translate evidence into recommendations. If only the evidence determines the recommendations, given the same evidence, different panels of experts should make the same recommendations. That is, the process should be replicable, an essential characteristic of a valid scientific process. The multiple recent cholesterol guidelines, which have considered the same evidence, offer an opportunity to examine guidelines from this perspective. Considerable discordance among the guideline recommendations is evident pointing to an important role for the participants, in addition to the evidence, in the development of guideline recommendations. Guideline recommendations, therefore, appear to be based on both evidence and expert opinion.

### Dual modulation of lipid and glucose metabolism by a nutraceutical combination in patients at cardiometabolic risk: results from a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^1151rGw2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

International guidelines for the treatment of dyslipidemia recommend the use of nutraceuticals (NUTs) for patients with hypercholesterolemia who are at low or moderate cardiovascular risk. This recommendation is supported by randomized trials demonstrating that certain NUT combinations can improve lipid profiles and, consequently, cardiovascular outcomes. Among the available NUTs, the most effective in reducing plasma cholesterol concentrations appears to be Monacolin K (MK), the principal active compound in red yeast rice (RYR). RYR is produced by fermenting white rice with Monascus purpureus and functions by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis.

A recent Mendelian randomization study published in Hypertension supports a dual role of HMGCR inhibition, consistent with findings from several observational reports: inhibiting HMGCR has a protective action on both lipid metabolism and blood pressure (BP), but a detrimental effect on fasting plasma glucose. Specifically, genetically proxied HMGCR inhibition is negatively associated with systolic and diastolic BP, yet positively associated with fasting glucose levels.

Despite the known lipid-lowering efficacy of MK, its effects on the relationships between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting glucose, and BP have not been previously investigated. Furthermore, given that a relatively low proportion of patients reach LDL-C target levels with MK alone, NUT combinations incorporating multiple active ingredients have been proposed to engage complementary mechanisms for lipid modulation. In this context, Morus alba extract — an agent with α-glucosidase inhibitory and antioxidant activity — has been shown to enhance the cholesterol-lowering effects of NUT combinations. Alpha-glucosidase inhibition reduces postprandial plasma glucose and partially compensates for impaired insulin secretion by interfering with the digestion and absorption of monosaccharides. Therefore, Morus alba may further influence the relationship between LDL-C levels, fasting glucose, and BP when used in combination with MK.

A single-blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled primary prevention trial (Lopiweb) tested the efficacy of a NUT combination containing MK plus Morus alba versus MK alone in 359 adult participants. The primary endpoint demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of individuals reaching the LDL-C target of < 130 mg/dL in the group receiving the combination treatment compared with MK alone (72% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001). Leveraging the comprehensive dataset from this trial, the present post-hoc analysis aims to specifically examine the associations between LDL-C-lowering therapy, BP, and fasting plasma glucose.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of red yeast rice in a population intolerant to statins [^1114J27m]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Chinese red yeast rice is a dietary supplement containing monacolins, unsaturated fatty acids, and phytosterols capable of lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Few studies have reported on its use in clinical practice or in statin-intolerant patients. We reviewed approximately 1,400 clinical charts and identified 25 patients treated with red yeast rice for ≥ 4 weeks. The patients were included if they had pre- and post-treatment lipid levels without simultaneous changes in other lipid-lowering medications. These patients had experienced myalgias (68%), gastrointestinal intolerance (16%), and/or elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (8%) with previous use of other lipid-lowering agents. The total cholesterol decreased 15% (-37 ± 26 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol decreased 21% (-35 ± 25 mg/dl, p < 0.001) during 74 ± 39 days of treatment. Most (92%) patients tolerated the treatment, and many (56%) achieved their LDL cholesterol goal. In patients unable to tolerate daily statin use, the total cholesterol level decreased 13% (-33 ± 10 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol decreased 19% (-31 ± 4 mg/dl, p < 0.001). In conclusion, red yeast rice modestly decreased total and LDL cholesterol, was well-tolerated, and was an acceptable alternative in patients intolerant of other lipid-lowering medications.

### The effect of a plant-based diet on plasma lipids in hypercholesterolemic adults: a randomized trial [^113Ryv4p]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A variety of food combinations can be used to meet national U.S. guidelines for obtaining 30% of energy or less from total fat and 10% of energy or less from saturated fat.

Objective

To contrast plasma lipid responses to 2 low-fat diet patterns.

Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Setting

4-week outpatient feeding study with weight held constant.

Participants

120 adults 30 to 65 years of age with prestudy low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations of 3.3 to 4.8 mmol/L (130 to 190 mg/dL), body mass index less than 31 kg/m2, estimated dietary saturated fat at least 10% of calories, and otherwise general good health.

Measurements

Plasma lipid levels.

Intervention

Two diets, the Low-Fat diet and the Low-Fat Plus diet, designed to be identical in total fat, saturated fat, protein, carbohydrate, and cholesterol content, consistent with former American Heart Association Step I guidelines. The Low-Fat diet was relatively typical of a low-fat U.S. diet. The Low-Fat Plus diet incorporated considerably more vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, consistent with the 2000 American Heart Association revised guidelines.

Results

Four-week changes in the Low-Fat and Low-Fat Plus groups were -0.24 mmol/L (-9.2 mg/dL) versus -0.46 mmol/L (-17.6 mg/dL) for total cholesterol (P = 0.01) and -0.18 mmol/L (-7.0 mg/dL) versus -0.36 mmol/L (-13.8 mg/dL) for LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02); between-group differences were -0.22 mmol/L (-9 mg/dL) (95% CI, -0.05 to -0.39 mmol/L [-2 to -15 mg/dL]) and -0.18 mmol/L (-7 mg/dL) (CI, -0.04 to -0.32 mmol/L [-2 to -12 mg/dL]) for total and LDL cholesterol, respectively. The 2 diet groups did not differ significantly in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

Limitations

4-week duration.

Conclusions

Previous national dietary guidelines primarily emphasized avoiding saturated fat and cholesterol; as a result, the guidelines probably underestimated the potential LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of diet. In this study, emphasis on including nutrient-dense plant-based foods, consistent with recently revised national guidelines, increased the total and LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of a low-fat diet.

### Comparing the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice on hyperlipidaemia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1145XiDH]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

To reduce the levels of TC and LDL‐C, Xuezhikang displayed the highest probability of being the most effective option. To reduce TG levels, Zhibituo exhibited the highest probability of being the most effective, and Zhibituo may have the highest probability of ameliorating levels of HDL‐C, whereas there was no significant difference between Zhibituo and Xuezhikang. Owing to the limitations of this study, the validity of our results requires confirmation using large‐sample, high‐quality, multicentre, prospective RCTs.

### Complementary and alternative therapies for the management of dyslipidemia [^113KGTfw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on select alternative therapies for the management of dyslipidemia.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE and PubMed (1965-March 2006) were conducted using the key terms omega-3-fatty acids, policosanol, plant stanols and sterols, flaxseed, red yeast rice, guggulipid, garlic, fiber, almonds, and cholesterol and/or lipids.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Meta-analyses, published in English and involving adults, that incorporated randomized, controlled trials on alternative therapies for dyslipidemia were reviewed. Additionally, trials published subsequent to the meta-analyses were reviewed. Articles deemed relevant were included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Of the aforementioned alternative therapies, randomized controlled trials were found for omega-3-fatty acids, policosanol, plant stanols and sterols, flaxseed, red yeast rice, guggulipid, garlic, fiber, almonds, and soy. Studies for each of these agents report varying degrees of lipid reduction. Based on published data, effective therapeutic options for lipid-lowering include intake of fiber, intake of plant stanols/sterols, replacement of animal protein with soy protein, and substitution of foods high in saturated fat with those with monounsaturated fatty acids (eg, dry roasted almonds). Adding omega-3-fatty acids is effective for reducing triglycerides in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Well-designed studies with long-term outcome data are necessary to further define the role for guggul, red yeast rice, policosanol, garlic, and flaxseed in the management of dyslipidemia.

Conclusions

Alternative therapeutic approaches with complementary therapies are becoming increasingly popular among patients. It is important for healthcare providers to be familiar with the safety and efficacy of these agents to facilitate optimal outcomes for patients with dyslipidemia.

3.4.2 TC — Total cholesterol levels

For a total of 4803 patients in 47 RCTs, changes in TC levels after administration of three types of Chinese patent medicines were compared with changes due to Simvastatin or placebo. Chi‐squared tests showed no heterogeneity between studies (p = 1.0, I² = 0.0%). There was a statistically significant difference in all treatments compared with the placebo group. No statistically significant differences were observed between the other comparisons. The results of the network meta‐analysis are summarized in Table 2. The intervention ranking probabilities based on SUCRA were as follows: Xuezhikang (84.5%) > Simvastatin (66.4%) > Zhibitai (65.4%) > Zhibituo (33.7%) > placebo (0.0%) (Figure 4), suggesting that Xuezhikang was the most effective intervention for TC, with Simvastatin and Zhibitai ranking second and third, respectively.

### Effects of xuezhikang in patients with dyslipidemia: a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^116uJ5CD]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Xuezhikang (XZK) is an extract of fermented red yeast rice that has lipid-lowering properties.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of XZK on lipids in subjects with dyslipidemia but no coronary heart disease.

Methods

A total of 116 adults with baseline non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels of approximately 208 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of approximately 175 mg/dL were randomized to either placebo or XZK 1200 or 2400 mg daily and treated for 12 weeks.

Results

A majority of the patients were white (53.4%) or Asian (37.1%). Daily XZK 1200 mg and 2400 mg for 4 to 12 weeks resulted in statistically significant (P < .001) and clinically meaningful decreases in non-HDL-C (∼24% reduction) and LDL-C (∼27% reduction) compared with placebo. XZK treatment at either dose enabled approximately 50% of subjects to reduce their LDL-C levels by ≥ 30%. Doubling the XZK daily dose from 1200 to 2400 mg at treatment week 8 caused an additional 4.6% reduction in LDL-C. Significant benefits were also observed across secondary efficacy variables, including total cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides, HDL-C, the TC/HDL-C ratio, and the Apo B/Apo A-I ratio, at treatment week 8 or 12. XZK was safe and well tolerated. Safety and tolerability profiles were similar across treatment groups. Most adverse events were gastrointestinal. No subject experienced myopathy or markedly elevated liver transaminases or creatine kinase.

Conclusion

Xuezhikang significantly reduced non-HDL-C and LDL-C, and was well tolerated. Further, longer-term studies in more diverse patient populations are needed to corroborate these findings.

### Comparative effects of low-dose rosuvastatin, placebo, and dietary supplements on lipids and inflammatory Biomarkers [^117G16TV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Supplements are commonly used by individuals with indications for lipid-lowering therapy, but evidence of their effectiveness to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is lacking, particularly when compared with statins.

Objectives

The trial objective was to compare the efficacy of a low-dose statin with placebo and 6 common supplements in impacting lipid and inflammatory biomarkers.

Methods

This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial among adults with no history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), an LDL-C of 70 to 189 mg/dL, and an increased 10-year risk of ASCVD. Participants were randomized to rosuvastatin 5 mg daily, placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice. The primary endpoint was the percent change in LDL-C from baseline for rosuvastatin 5 mg daily compared with placebo and each supplement after 28 days. The primary endpoint was evaluated in a hierarchical fashion with rosuvastatin first compared with placebo, then each supplement in a prespecified order using analysis of covariance.

Results

A total of 190 participants completed the study. The percent LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin was greater than all supplements and placebo (P < 0.001). The difference in LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin compared with placebo was -35.2% (95% CI: -41.3% to -29.1%; P < 0.001). None of the dietary supplements demonstrated a significant decrease in LDL-C compared with placebo. Adverse event rates were similar across study groups.

Conclusions

Among individuals with increased 10-year risk for ASCVD, rosuvastatin 5 mg daily lowered LDL-C significantly more than placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, and red yeast rice. (Supplements, Placebo, or Rosuvastatin Study [SPORT]; NCT04846231).

### Paradoxical hypercholesterolemia in an otherwise healthy adult man [^1139w8GM]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypercholesterolemia is characterized by serum cholesterol levels greater than 5 mmol per L. However, the distribution of cholesterol among lipoprotein classes has a significant bearing on diagnosis: high-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol suggests familial hypercholesterolemia, whereas high-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is associated with hyperalphalipoproteinemia. On routine screening, a 23-year-old man presented with a total cholesterol level of 7.6 mmol per L but was subsequently found to have an HDL cholesterol level of 5.6 mmol per L. The clinical picture was confounded by his use of red yeast rice extract, a popular health supplement with hypolipidemic effects. In this case individual, the use of red yeast rice extract caused a hyperlipidemic state, ostensibly through downregulation of cholesteryl ester transfer protein. This case emphasizes the extended role of laboratory medicine in complex cases of hyperlipidemia.

### Nutraceutical approach to moderate cardiometabolic risk: results of a randomized, double-blind and crossover study with armolipid plus [^111JPmkJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Primary cardiovascular prevention may be achieved by lifestyle/nutrition improvements and specific drugs, although a relevant role is now emerging for specific functional foods and nutraceuticals.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a nutraceutical multitarget approach in subjects with moderate cardiovascular risk and to compare it with pravastatin treatment.

Subjects

Thirty patients with moderate dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome (according to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults) were included in an 8-week randomized, double-blind crossover study and took either placebo or a nutraceutical combination that contained red yeast rice extract, berberine, policosanol, astaxanthin, coenzyme Q10, and folic acid (Armolipid Plus). Subsequently, they were subjected to another 8-week treatment with pravastatin 10 mg/d. This dosage was selected on the basis of its expected -20% efficacy in reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol.

Results

Treatment with Armolipid Plus led to a significant reduction of total cholesterol (-12.8%) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-21.1%), similar to pravastatin (-16% and -22.6%, respectively), and an increase of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (4.8%). Armolipid Plus improved the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, whereas adiponectin levels were unchanged.

Conclusions

These results indicate that this nutraceutical approach shows a lipid-lowering activity comparable to pravastatin treatment. Hence, it may be a safe and useful option, especially in conditions of moderate cardiovascular risk, in which a pharmacologic intervention may not be appropriate.

### Impact of nutraceuticals on markers of systemic inflammation: potential relevance to cardiovascular diseases – A position paper from the international lipid expert panel (ILEP) [^1176FACg]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Inflammation is a marker of arterial disease stemming from cholesterol-dependent to -independent molecular mechanisms. In recent years, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been underpinned by pharmacological approaches targeting systemic inflammation that have led to a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although the use of nutraceuticals to prevent CVD has largely focused on lipid-lowering (e.g., red-yeast rice and omega-3 fatty acids), there is growing interest and need, especially now in the time of coronavirus pandemic, in the use of nutraceuticals to reduce inflammatory markers, and potentially the inflammatory CVD burden, however, there is still not enough evidence to confirm this. Indeed, diet is an important lifestyle determinant of health and can influence both systemic and vascular inflammation, to varying extents, according to the individual nutraceutical constituents. Thus, the aim of this Position Paper is to provide the first attempt at recommendations on the use of nutraceuticals with effective anti-inflammatory properties.

Other medications, supplements, and nutraceuticals — primary and secondary prevention: we recommend against using niacin (i.e., supplements or prescriptions) and we suggest against adding fibrates to statins (both categorized Reviewed, New-replaced). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against using bempedoic acid with or without statins for either primary or secondary prevention. For isocapent ethyl, for primary prevention there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against use in patients on statin therapy with persistently elevated fasting triglycerides, whereas for secondary prevention we suggest offering isocapent ethyl in patients on statin therapy with persistently elevated fasting triglycerides > 150 mg/dL to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We suggest against the use of omega-3 fatty acids as a dietary supplement to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of fiber, garlic, ginger, green tea, and red yeast rice supplements to reduce cardiovascular risks.

### Phytosterols, red yeast rice, and lifestyle changes instead of statins: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^115H6EmU]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients who refuse or cannot tolerate statin drugs choose alternative therapies for lipid lowering.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine the lipid-lowering effects of phytosterol tablets and lifestyle change (LC) on top of red yeast rice (RYR) therapy in patients with a history of statin refusal or statin-associated myalgias.

Design

A total of 187 participants (mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 154 mg/dL) took RYR 1800 mg twice daily and were randomized to phytosterol tablets 900 mg twice daily or placebo. Participants were also randomized to a 12-week LC program or usual care (UC). Primary end point was change in LDL-C at 12, 24, and 52 weeks. Secondary end points were effect on other lipoproteins, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, weight, and development of myalgia.

Results

Phytosterols did not significantly improve LDL-C at weeks 12 (P = 0.54), 24 (P = 0.67), or 52 (P = 0.76) compared with placebo. Compared with the UC group, the LC group had greater reductions in LDL-C at weeks 12 (-51 vs -42 mg/dL, P = 0.006) and 24 (-48 vs -40 mg/dL, P = 0.034) and was 2.3 times more likely to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (P = 0.004). The LC group lost more weight for 1 year (-2.3 vs -0.3 kg, P < .001). All participants took RYR and had significant decreases in LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol for 1 year when compared with baseline (P < .001). Four participants stopped supplements because of myalgia.

Conclusions

The addition of phytosterol tablets to RYR did not result in further lowering of LDL-C levels. Participants in an LC program lost significantly more weight and were more likely to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL compared with UC.

### The role of nutraceuticals in statin Intolerant patients [^114NZdV2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Statins are the most common drugs administered for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, due to statin-associated muscle symptoms, adherence to statin therapy is challenging in clinical practice. Certain nutraceuticals, such as red yeast rice, bergamot, berberine, artichoke, soluble fiber, and plant sterols and stanols alone or in combination with each other, as well as with ezetimibe, might be considered as an alternative or add-on therapy to statins, although there is still insufficient evidence available with respect to long-term safety and effectiveness on cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment. These nutraceuticals could exert significant lipid-lowering activity and might present multiple non-lipid-lowering actions, including improvement of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The aim of this expert opinion paper is to provide the first attempt at recommendation on the management of statin intolerance through the use of nutraceuticals with particular attention on those with effective low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the effect of barley β-glucan on LDL-C, non-HDL-C and apoB for cardiovascular disease risk reduction [^112LeMXX]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

There has been recent interest in barley as a therapeutic food owing to its high content of beta-glucan (β-glucan), a viscous soluble fiber recognized for its cholesterol-lowering properties. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the cholesterol-lowering potential of barley β-glucan on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane CENTRAL were searched. We included RCTs of ⩾3-week duration assessing the effect of diets enriched with barley β-glucan compared with controlled diets on LDL-C, non-HDL-C or apoB. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. Data were pooled using the generic inverse-variance method with random effects models and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q-statistic and quantified by the I² statistic.

Results

Fourteen trials (N = 615) were included in the final analysis. A median dose of 6.5 and 6.9g/day of barley β-glucan for a median duration of 4 weeks significantly reduced LDL-C (MD = -0.25mmol/l (95% CI: -0.30, -0.20)) and non-HDL-C (MD = -0.31mmol/l (95% CI: -0.39, -0.23)), respectively, with no significant changes to apoB levels, compared with control diets. There was evidence of considerable unexplained heterogeneity in the analysis of non-HDL-C (I² = 98%).

Conclusions

Pooled analyses show that barley β-glucan has a lowering effect on LDL-C and non-HDL-C. Inclusion of barley-containing foods may be a strategy for achieving targets in CVD risk reduction.

### Artificial intelligence-enabled analysis of statin-related topics and sentiments on social media [^1142ZoXr]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

In this qualitative study, an AI method was developed to classify statin-related content on a social media platform into topics of discussion. These 100 topics were then organized into 6 thematic groups: ketogenic diets, diabetes, supplements, and statins; statin adverse effects; statin hesitancy; clinical trial appraisals; pharmaceutical industry bias and statins; and red yeast rice and statins. Such an AI approach can be used to analyze large, contemporary social media data and generate insights into public perceptions about statins. This information may help guide strategies for addressing barriers to statin use and adherence.

### Comparing the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice on hyperlipidaemia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113oiXhQ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

However, the present study has several limitations: (1) all studies included in the review were from China, which might be a potential source of publication bias. (2) Publication bias was also observed. (3) The quality of the studies included in the review was not considered high, with five studies, reporting the specific methods of random sequence generation, three randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials, and four randomized, placebo‐controlled trials. In addition, the quality of evidence for the outcomes was low. (4) The number of trials that compared some of the medicines was relatively small, causing the comparative results to not be incredibly persuasive, and those cases should be considered with caution. Thus, additional, well‐designed, double‐blinded, multicentre RCTs are required to establish the efficacy of Chinese patent medicines for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia.

### Comparing the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice on hyperlipidaemia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112gzQ51]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The present network meta‐analysis is the first study to assess and rank the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines that eliminate phlegm and remove blood stasis in treating hyperlipidaemia. By adopting rigorous inclusion criteria, 47 RCTs with 4824 participants were included in the analyses. The results indicated that different Chinese patent medicines have different benefits for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. In terms of reducing the levels of TC, Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 84.5%) displayed the highest probability of being the most effective option, followed by Simvastatin (SUCRA: 66.4%) and Zhibitai (SUCRA: 65.4%). For reducing TG levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 80.2%) exhibited the highest probability of being the most effective, with Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 63.4%) and Simvastatin (SUCRA: 48.7%) in second and third places, respectively. In terms of reducing LDL‐C levels, Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 82.6%) had the highest probability of being the most effective, followed by Simvastatin (SUCRA: 74.9%) and Zhibituo (SUCRA: 52.8%). Finally, in terms of improving HDL‐C levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 90.1%) had the highest probability of being the most effective, with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 82.1%) and Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 51.1%) ranked second and third, respectively. Furthermore, no additional severe toxicity was identified in any experimental group compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference between Zhibituo and Xuezhikang.

Flow chart of selection of studies

3.2 Baseline characteristics of included studies

A total of 47 RCTs involving 4824 participants diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia satisfied the study selection criteria and were included in the study. From these 47 RCTs, the effects on hyperlipidaemia resulting from the use of three Chinese patent medicines containing RYR were summarized. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1. The included studies showed that all baseline values were comparable.

3.3 Risk of bias in included studies

The risk‐of‐bias graphs for the 47 studies are shown in Figure 2. All studies included randomization, five, described the generation of a random sequence using a random number table, three, were randomized, double‐blind, controlled trials, and four, were randomized, placebo‐controlled trials. Other studies have not described a specific method for random sequence generation. None of the unblinded studies stated the details of allocation concealment. For the blinding of participants and personnel, a high risk was identified in the unblinded studies. Because the outcomes were tested in the lab, the risk of blinding on the outcome assessment was low. All studies reported complete outcome data and were free of selective reporting. The unblinded studies were unclear in terms of other biases.

### Patient perceptions and use of non-statin lipid lowering therapy among patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: insights from the PALM registry [^111Xge19]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

4.1 Limitations

We acknowledge several limitations associated with our study. First, core laboratory lipid levels were only obtained at the time of study enrollment reflecting lipid treatment received at that time, thus changes in lipids with addition of LLT cannot be described. Second, we were unable to capture motivations behind the lipid‐lowering treatment decisions; some of the patients not treated or under‐treated with a statin based on guideline recommendations may have been decisions made after risk discussions between the clinician and patient. Data for additional non‐statin lipid lower therapies, including bile acids and red yeast rice were collected but there were an insufficient number of patients on these medications to further evaluate in this analysis. For patients using fish oil as a lipid lowering therapy, additional details surrounding this medication – including over the counter versus prescription therapy – were not available. Finally, PCSK‐9 inhibitors were not yet clinically available for use during the enrollment period for the PALM Registry, therefore our description of non‐statin LLTs did not include this class of therapy.

### Comparing the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice on hyperlipidaemia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112D6kBi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The RYR has been widely used in China for many years. Previous studies have shown that it can reverse the symptoms of hyperlipidaemia, the mechanism of action of which is similar to that of statins. Statins are the key lipid‐lowering medications and are the current recommended initial therapy for blood lipid disorders. The mechanism is that its efficacy component, monacolin K, acts like the synthetic drug Lovastatin but without the severe side effects of statins. In addition, experimental studies have indicated that the main chemical component of RYR, responsible for its lipid‐reducing properties, is ergosterol. Clinical studies have suggested that other compounds in RYR may also decrease serum lipid levels. Our network meta‐analysis yielded results similar to those of previous studies.

Both Xuezhikang and Zhibituo are made from RYR, which can alleviate drug properties, enhance or change drug effects, reduce toxicity and expand the range of clinical applications of fermented medicines. However, there are different active ingredients in Xuezhikang and Zhibituo. Xuezhikang is made by high‐tech biotechnology, containing Lovastatin, a statin homolog, a variety of essential amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, sterols and small amounts of flavonoids. The main bioactive components of Zhibituo are Lovastatin and Lovastatin acid. The content of Lovastatin in Zhibituo and Xuezhikang was shown to be 2.7 and 11.1 g/kg, respectively. Xuezhikang provides hypotriglyceridemic performance superior to Simvastatin in terms of reduction in levels, and the underlying mechanism has been attributed to more significant apoA5 upregulation via the PPARα signalling pathway. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a crucial regulator of plasma cholesterol homeostasis. A previous study demonstrated that Xuezhikang increases PCSK9 levels through the SREBP‐2 pathway, and isoflavones and phytosterols in Xuezhikang play a role in lowering cholesterol levels through a mechanism different from that of Lovastatin, which elevates the excretion of lipids and bile acids in faeces. In summary, Xuezhikang and Zhibituo contain natural statins, which are safer than synthetic statins and can lower blood lipids.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114Zf6Bj]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Plant sterols/stanols (PS) efficacy and triglyceride effects — use characteristics: Across formats and at intake levels ≤ 2 g/day, responses to plant sterols versus stanols and fat-based versus non-fat-based or dairy versus nondairy foods did not differ, and consuming PS multiple times per day may yield greater efficacy than a single intake, with single doses most effective when taken during or shortly after a meal that triggers bile flow. Absolute low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions are larger with higher baseline LDL-C, though percentage reductions are similar across a wide baseline range. Beyond LDL-C, PS reduce triglyceride (TG) concentrations: in a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials, PS 1.6 to 2.5 g/day produced about a 6% TG reduction; subsequent reports show variable TG lowering from 0.8 to 28%, with greater responses in elevated TG (≥ 150 mg/dL) of 11–28% versus 0.8–7% in those with normal TG levels.

### A nationwide questionnaire study evaluated kidney injury associated with beni-koji tablets in Japan [^114JM3uP]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Red yeast rice, traditionally used in Asian cuisine and increasingly marketed as a dietary supplement for cholesterol management, has recently been linked to kidney dysfunction in Japan. In late 2023 to early 2024, multiple cases involving specific Beni-koji (red yeast rice) tablets from three different Beni-koji preparations, prompted a safety reevaluation. Although citrinin, a known nephrotoxin of red yeast rice, was not produced by the implicated strains, new safety concerns emerged. Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical, laboratory, and pathological features of affected patients with a two-phase nationwide survey of Japanese nephrologists. The initial survey captured clinical presentations, while the follow-up survey tracked changes in kidney function and gathered pathological data. Statistical analyses included trend assessments across estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories and mixed-effects models for eGFR trajectories. Of 192 patients, 94.1% presented with low eGFR (under 60 ml/min/1.73 m²). Laboratory findings revealed characteristics of Fanconi syndrome, including hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, glycosuria, and metabolic acidosis. Creatine kinase levels were not elevated suggesting no rhabdomyolysis related kidney injury. Kidney biopsies showed predominant tubulointerstitial changes, with 50% exhibiting tubulointerstitial nephritis and 32% showing tubular necrosis. Glomerular changes were less prominent. Following product discontinuation and treatment, Fanconi syndrome-related parameters improved significantly. However, 87% of patients still had eGFR under 60 ml/min/1.73 m² at the last observation. Our findings underscore the need for long-term follow-up of affected individuals and highlight the importance of rigorous safety evaluations for dietary supplements. Further research is necessary to establish definitive causal relationships and long-term outcomes.
