## Question

What are the implications of a low ceruloplasmin level?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the implications of a low ceruloplasmin level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance and thresholds that change pre-test probability for Wilson disease versus other causes. Then, I should verify how context modifies interpretation, including age, acute-phase effects, and pregnancy. Next, I will prioritize the differential diagnosis, outline the initial and advanced workup, and then interpret results using validated criteria such as the Leipzig score. After that, I need to check methodological pitfalls in testing, determine management implications for Wilson disease, aceruloplasminemia, and secondary causes, and finally summarize an algorithm that ties risk, testing, and follow-up together with family screening recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of a low ceruloplasmin result and set thresholds that matter. Ceruloplasmin is the main copper-carrying protein with ferroxidase activity; a very low level, particularly less than 5 mg/dL, strongly suggests Wilson disease, although modestly subnormal values are less specific and ceruloplasmin alone should never be used to make or exclude the diagnosis, especially because ceruloplasmin is an acute phase reactant that may rise with inflammation and estrogen exposure, potentially masking deficiency, while truly low levels in the setting of inflammation are especially worrisome for Wilson disease or severe copper transport defects. A low serum ceruloplasmin level is always pathological and never a normal physiological variant, I initially conclude, because in adults outside of pregnancy it typically reflects impaired synthesis, copper incorporation defects, or losses from protein-losing states, but I need to keep validating this claim against age and physiologic states as I proceed [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the clinical context to refine pre-test probability before chasing confirmatory testing. I need to check patient age bands and symptom clusters: Wilson disease classically presents from childhood through midlife with hepatic, neuropsychiatric, or ophthalmologic signs such as Kayser-Fleischer rings, while Menkes disease presents in infancy with seizures, hypotonia, and characteristic hair changes, and aceruloplasminemia often manifests in adulthood with diabetes, retinal degeneration, and neurodegeneration related to iron overload; family history in autosomal recessive Wilson disease and aceruloplasminemia, and X-linked Menkes disease, should also recalibrate risk before interpreting a single low ceruloplasmin value [^1168QCcX] [^1136Hycr]. Hold on, I should also verify inflammation and estrogen exposure because ceruloplasmin is a positive acute-phase reactant that physiologically increases in pregnancy or with systemic inflammation, which can complicate interpretation in both directions if unaccounted for [^112AAyXU] [^1179Kyh4].

> I will now examine and prioritize the differential diagnosis given a low ceruloplasmin. Wilson disease remains the must-not-miss cause, particularly with extremely low values or compatible clinical features, but I should also consider aceruloplasminemia with absent ferroxidase activity and systemic iron loading, Menkes disease in infants with low copper and ceruloplasmin, and secondary hypoceruloplasminemia from malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, severe liver disease, and hypothyroidism; critically, I should not exclude Wilson disease just because ceruloplasmin is normal since up to a minority of patients can have normal levels, and urinary copper and other markers remain essential [^113ZpQ3Y] [^115uJcPN]. I should double-check urinary copper thresholds as they shift with symptom status: in Wilson disease, basal 24-hour urinary copper is typically greater than 100 μg in symptomatic patients, but in asymptomatic or pediatric patients values greater than 40 μg may be informative and warrant further investigation and context-based scoring [^113AudPD] [^115VjUga].

> Let me first confirm the essential initial workup when Wilson disease is suspected. I need to obtain a 24-hour urinary copper excretion, a serum ceruloplasmin with consideration of concurrent CRP and estrogen status, and serum copper to allow estimation of non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper while recognizing the limitations of calculated "free" copper; I also should check liver tests, perform a slit-lamp exam for Kayser-Fleischer rings, and look for Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia if acute liver injury is present [^115VjUga] [^113ZpQ3Y]. Hold on, I should verify modern markers as well: exchangeable copper and relative exchangeable copper may add diagnostic and monitoring value where available, but timing and access can limit their utility in acute settings, and NCC calculation can yield negative values depending on assay methodology, so I must interpret these cautiously and not allow them to delay necessary treatment in high-probability cases [^1116REez] [^113tLamh] [^112Q5yyQ].

> If suspicion remains high or results are equivocal, I should review advanced testing. ATP7B genetic testing can secure the diagnosis in ambiguous cases and is imperative for family screening, while quantitative hepatic copper on biopsy above 250 μg/g dry weight supports Wilson disease and can be decisive when biochemistry conflicts, provided adequate sample handling and absence of chelation confounding; for non-Wilson iron–copper interface disorders, brain MRI patterns and iron indices can hint at aceruloplasminemia, which often shows marked basal ganglia hypointensities and hyperferritinemia with low transferrin saturation despite profound tissue iron loading [^112BwSAq] [^114WpeTG] [^1136Hycr]. Wait, let me verify approach in relatives and minimally symptomatic patients, because genetic testing often outperforms biochemical scoring in family screening where classic thresholds may underperform [^115QC5Rn] [^115Husvu].

> I need to ensure that interpretation is anchored in validated diagnostic frameworks. The Leipzig score integrates ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, Kayser-Fleischer rings, hepatic copper, and genetics, with scores of at least four supporting Wilson disease, and I should remember that low ceruloplasmin contributes points but is insufficient alone, particularly when inflammation, age, or assay type complicate values [^114WpeTG] [^113ZpQ3Y]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if the score is borderline; liver copper quantification or comprehensive ATP7B sequencing can tip the balance in such cases, especially in pediatric or asymptomatic contexts where urinary copper may be lower [^112BwSAq] [^113AudPD].

> Next, I should review methodological factors that can mislead interpretation. I need to check which assay was used for ceruloplasmin, because enzymatic oxidase activity assays can be more specific in Wilson disease than immunologic mass assays, and discordance between activity and mass may occur in hepatic disease; contemporaneous CRP can help flag acute-phase elevations that mask deficiency, while pregnancy and exogenous estrogen increase ceruloplasmin physiologically and can obscure low values, and newborns have low baseline ceruloplasmin such that an early low result does not on its own diagnose Menkes disease [^112V74X8] [^112AAyXU] [^1168QCcX]. Hmm, wait a minute, earlier I asserted that "a low serum ceruloplasmin level is always pathological", but I should correct that blanket statement: neonatal levels are physiologically low, and isolated low readings without clinical context can reflect assay or physiologic confounders, so I must contextualize before labeling results as pathologic, especially in the first weeks of life or in settings of altered protein synthesis or distribution that are transient [^1168QCcX] [^115uJcPN].

> Determining management implications now depends on which diagnosis is confirmed. If Wilson disease is established, I should initiate copper chelation with agents such as trientine or penicillamine, consider zinc as an adjunct or alternative depending on phenotype and tolerance, and implement longitudinal monitoring of urinary copper and a validated index of bioavailable copper while acknowledging limitations of calculated NCC and the evolving role of exchangeable copper; therapeutic targets often include maintaining non-ceruloplasmin copper at less than 20 μg/dL and monitoring urine copper for trends under chelation or zinc, with adjustments for adherence and intercurrent inflammation [^111h67F8] [^115zQeMc] [^1116REez] [^1112hxWt]. Let me reconsider one more nuance: I should not rely on liver copper content to titrate therapy because total hepatic copper does not distinguish toxic labile copper from other pools and changes slowly with treatment [^115zQeMc].

> If aceruloplasminemia is confirmed, I should confirm iron phenotype and initiate iron chelation as first-line therapy, monitor for and treat complications like diabetes and neurodegeneration, and recognize that absent ferroxidase activity underlies iron misdistribution causing parenchymal overload in the brain and liver; MRI hypointensities in basal ganglia and sometimes cortex with high ferritin and low transferrin saturation can track disease, and case-based evidence supports chelation to reduce hepatic iron with variable effects neurologically [^1136Hycr] [^115bLbMk] [^113BtYGA]. I should double-check family counseling and genetic testing because autosomal recessive inheritance exposes siblings to risk and earlier detection may delay complications with timely iron removal [^113BtYGA].

> When secondary causes of hypoceruloplasminemia are likely, I need to ensure I correct the underlying disorder, such as malnutrition or malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, nephrotic syndrome, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, or advanced liver disease, and then reassess ceruloplasmin and copper indices once the systemic condition improves; in critically ill or post-bariatric patients, I should also consider copper deficiency monitoring and replacement while interpreting ceruloplasmin cautiously in the context of inflammation [^115uJcPN] [^112AAyXU] [^116wHnTj]. But wait, what if inflammation is simultaneously elevating ceruloplasmin while total copper appears high; I should pair interpretation with CRP and clinical context to avoid misclassification of copper status while still excluding Wilson disease where appropriate by urine copper and other criteria [^112AAyXU] [^113AudPD].

> I will now examine broader systemic implications that flow from low ceruloplasmin states. Because ceruloplasmin's ferroxidase activity is central to iron trafficking, deficiency or inactivity can drive tissue iron accumulation and oxidative stress, linking copper–iron dyshomeostasis to neurodegeneration, and observational work suggests associations of low ceruloplasmin or altered non-ceruloplasmin copper with Parkinson and Alzheimer phenotypes, although these data should inform hypothesis generation rather than diagnostic decisions in an individual patient [^1113yAVo] [^114ALnSi] [^114yEu8R] [^113hvxpb]. Hold on, let's not over-interpret these associations clinically; they do not replace the need to establish specific etiologies like Wilson disease or aceruloplasminemia when ceruloplasmin is low in a diagnostic workup [^114WpeTG].

> To consolidate an action-oriented algorithm, I should proceed as follows while verifying each step against pre-test probability. If a low ceruloplasmin is detected, I first rule out or in Wilson disease with 24-hour urinary copper, slit-lamp examination, liver tests, and, where indicated, hepatic copper or ATP7B sequencing, integrating results via the Leipzig score; if Wilson disease is not supported, I next evaluate iron indices and consider CP gene analysis for aceruloplasminemia, and if both genetic disorders are excluded, I assess for secondary causes and correct them with follow-up testing, ensuring that family screening is performed for confirmed genetic diseases and that therapy is monitored by functional copper indices rather than ceruloplasmin concentration alone [^113ZpQ3Y] [^114WpeTG] [^115QC5Rn] [^115zQeMc]. I should double-check utilization patterns too, because indiscriminate ceruloplasmin ordering yields many false positives; restricting testing to the guideline-recommended at-risk populations and following through on abnormal results with appropriate second-line tests avoids missed Wilson disease and unnecessary cascades [^111SUkaP] [^115VjUga].

Low ceruloplasmin most commonly indicates **Wilson disease** (WD), a genetic copper disorder [^113ZpQ3Y] [^115MiYWB], but may also reflect **copper deficiency** (dietary, malabsorption, or post-bariatric) [^116wHnTj], Menkes disease, aceruloplasminemia, or severe liver disease [^115uJcPN]. Ceruloplasmin is a nonspecific acute-phase reactant [^1179Kyh4]. Levels can be low in protein-losing states or malnutrition [^115uJcPN]. Diagnosis of WD requires integration of ceruloplasmin with 24-hour urinary copper, hepatic copper, and ATP7B genetic testing [^114WpeTG]; **extremely low levels (< 5 mg/dL) strongly suggest WD** [^113ZpQ3Y], but normal levels do not exclude WD. Clinical context and **additional testing** are essential to distinguish among causes and guide management.

---

## Physiological role of ceruloplasmin

Ceruloplasmin is a **copper-binding glycoprotein** synthesized in the liver [^1113yAVo] that carries ~95% of plasma copper [^1179Kyh4] and provides ferroxidase activity, oxidizing Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ for transferrin loading. It also has antioxidant properties and is an **acute-phase reactant**.

---

## Clinical significance of low ceruloplasmin levels

Low ceruloplasmin is **clinically significant** and may indicate several conditions:

---

### Wilson's disease (WD)

- **Pathophysiology**: Autosomal recessive ATP7B mutations [^113ZpQ3Y] impair copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin and biliary excretion, causing copper accumulation in liver, brain, and other organs [^115MiYWB].
- **Clinical features**: Hepatic (hepatitis, cirrhosis, acute liver failure) [^113ZpQ3Y], neurological (tremor, dystonia, parkinsonism), psychiatric symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer rings [^1147L3JA].
- **Diagnostic criteria**: Low ceruloplasmin (< 20 mg/dL) [^113ZpQ3Y], elevated 24-hour urinary copper (> 100 µg/24h in symptomatic; > 40 µg/24h in asymptomatic/pediatric) [^113AudPD], increased hepatic copper (> 250 µg/g dry weight) [^112BwSAq], and ATP7B mutations.
- **Limitations**: Ceruloplasmin alone is insufficient; extremely low levels (< 5 mg/dL) strongly suggest WD [^113ZpQ3Y], but normal levels do not exclude it [^114WpeTG].

---

### Copper deficiency

Causes include malnutrition, malabsorption (celiac, IBD), bariatric surgery [^116wHnTj], prolonged parenteral nutrition without copper, and excessive zinc intake [^115uJcPN], and **clinical features** include anemia, neutropenia, neurological deficits, osteoporosis, and immune dysfunction [^112AAyXU].

---

### Menkes disease

Pathophysiology: X-linked **ATP7A** mutations cause severe copper deficiency with low ceruloplasmin, neurodegeneration, connective tissue abnormalities, and characteristic hair changes [^1121xU1x] [^1168QCcX].

---

### Aceruloplasminemia

Pathophysiology: Autosomal recessive **ceruloplasmin gene** mutations cause absent ferroxidase activity, leading to iron accumulation in the liver, brain, and pancreas, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and anemia [^113BtYGA] [^115bLbMk].

---

### Liver disease

Pathophysiology: Reduced hepatic synthesis of ceruloplasmin in severe cases such as **cirrhosis** or **acute liver failure** [^115uJcPN] [^113ZpQ3Y].

---

### Protein-losing states and malnutrition

Pathophysiology: Reduced ceruloplasmin due to protein loss or decreased synthesis, as seen in **nephrotic syndrome**, **protein-losing enteropathy**, and severe **malnutrition** [^115uJcPN].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of low ceruloplasmin

When low ceruloplasmin is detected, a **structured evaluation is recommended** [^115VjUga]:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical history and examination | Identify symptoms/signs of WD, copper deficiency, liver disease, or protein-losing states [^115MiYWB] |
| 2 | Serum copper levels | Low in copper deficiency; normal or low in WD [^116Ctfqu] |
| 3 | 24-hour urinary copper excretion | Elevated in WD; low in copper deficiency [^113AudPD] |
| 4 | Hepatic copper content (liver biopsy) | Elevated (> 250 µg/g) in WD [^112BwSAq] |
| 5 | Genetic testing (ATP7B, ATP7A, ceruloplasmin gene) | Confirm WD, Menkes, or aceruloplasminemia [^1147L3JA] |
| 6 | Additional tests (CBC, liver function tests, zinc levels) | Assess nutritional status, liver function, and zinc excess [^115QC5Rn] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Wilson's disease**: Lifelong chelation (penicillamine, trientine) [^111h67F8] or zinc therapy [^115zQeMc]; liver transplantation for advanced disease [^113ZpQ3Y].
- **Copper deficiency**: Copper supplementation and correction of underlying causes [^116wHnTj].
- **Menkes disease**: Early copper histidine supplementation; limited efficacy [^1121xU1x].
- **Aceruloplasminemia**: Iron chelation and supportive care [^113BtYGA].
- **Liver disease**: Manage underlying liver disease [^115uJcPN].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Acute-phase reactant**: Ceruloplasmin rises with inflammation, pregnancy, and estrogen therapy, potentially masking low levels [^1179Kyh4] [^116wHnTj].
- **Assay variability**: Different assays and lack of standardization can affect interpretation [^112V74X8].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret results with clinical context and additional tests [^114WpeTG].

---

Low ceruloplasmin is a nonspecific finding; very low levels most strongly suggest WD [^113ZpQ3Y] but may also reflect copper deficiency, Menkes disease, aceruloplasminemia, severe liver disease, or protein-losing states [^115uJcPN]. Diagnosis requires integration of ceruloplasmin with **urinary copper**, **hepatic copper**, and **genetics** to guide appropriate management [^114WpeTG].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend recognizing that an extremely low serum ceruloplasmin level (< 5 mg/dL) more strongly suggests a diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD) than modestly subnormal levels. However, serum ceruloplasmin by itself is insufficient for making a diagnosis of WD. Do not exclude WD based on normal serum ceruloplasmin levels.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, specifically concerning serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend recognizing that basal 24-hour urinary excretion of copper in Wilson's disease is typically greater than 100 mcg/24 hours in symptomatic patients. However, a lower reference value of greater than 40 mcg/24 hours may indicate Wilson's disease in asymptomatic or pediatric patients and therefore requires clinical correlation and further investigation.

### Ferroportin disease: pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^115pf4Z2]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic algorithm for ferroportin disease and hereditary hyperferritinemia**: The algorithm begins with evaluating subjects who present with increased serum ferritin and low or normal transferrin saturation (TS). The workup should focus on common causes of secondary hyperferritinemia and rare causes of hereditary hyperferritinemia to confirm the diagnosis of ferroportin disease. Common causes such as metabolic disorders, inflammation, and cancer should be initially considered. If these are not found, or if hyperferritinemia persists after their treatment, the next step is determined by the presence or absence of anemia.

	- In the absence of overt anemia, if liver and spleen iron content are increased at MRI, or liver biopsy shows prominent Kupffer cell iron load, ferroportin disease should be considered, and genetic testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Another common cause of hereditary hyperferritinemia with normal TS, associated with iron accumulation and anemia, is Gaucher disease. This condition is usually accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, abnormal coagulation, bone disease, and neuropathic manifestations.

	- If body iron accumulation is absent but serum ferritin (SF) levels are elevated with normal TS, autosomal dominant hyperferritinemia with cataract should be considered. This condition arises from mutations in the iron responsive element in the 5′ untranslated region of the L ferritin mRNA.

### Designing clinical trials in Wilson's disease [^1116REez]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Determination of "free" bioavailable copper concentration has been proposed as a possible surrogate marker. This copper fraction is considered biologically active and is the target of treatment to prevent the extrahepatic uptake of copper. There are several approaches to measure free copper.
- **Non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC)**: Estimated by subtracting ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total serum copper concentration. A weakness of the methodology is biologically implausible negative values in some patients [Supporting Information S.3.1]. Reports on the correlation between NCC normalization and clinical outcomes are conflicting, but in a recent phase 2 study, the NCC estimate correlated with clinical outcome during treatment with bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate.
- **Measurement of exchangeable copper (CuEXC)**: Obtained by the incubation of serum with EDTA to remove loosely bound copper and subsequent removal of ceruloplasmin-bound copper by ultrafiltration. The method does not depend on the measurement of ceruloplasmin. Correlation between CuEXC and organ damage was observed in an animal study. CuEXC was related to patient compliance, but longitudinal data in patients have not been reported.

For further discussion of the measurement of bioavailable (free) copper, see Supporting Information S.3.1. At the present stage, neither NCC nor CuEXC has been validated as a surrogate endpoint. The data do not allow a conclusion as to which is more valuable for treatment monitoring. At least one of these should be included as an exploratory endpoint.

### Wilson's disease and other neurological copper disorders [^1147L3JA]. The Lancet Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The copper metabolism disorder Wilson's disease was first defined in 1912. Wilson's disease can present with hepatic and neurological deficits, including dystonia and parkinsonism. Early-onset presentations in infancy and late-onset manifestations in adults older than 70 years of age are now well recognized. Direct genetic testing for ATP7B mutations is increasingly available to confirm the clinical diagnosis of Wilson's disease, and results from biochemical and genetic prevalence studies suggest that Wilson's disease might be much more common than previously estimated. Early diagnosis of Wilson's disease is crucial to ensure that patients can be started on adequate treatment, but uncertainty remains about the best possible choice of medication.

Furthermore, Wilson's disease needs to be differentiated from other conditions that also present clinically with hepatolenticular degeneration or share biochemical abnormalities with Wilson's disease, such as reduced serum ceruloplasmin concentrations. Disordered copper metabolism is also associated with other neurological conditions, including a subtype of axonal neuropathy due to ATP7A mutations and the late-onset neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

### Association between serum ceruloplasmin specific activity and risk of Alzheimer's disease [^114yEu8R]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses demonstrate copper involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the systemic ceruloplasmin status in relation to copper is an emerging issue. To deepen this matter, we evaluated levels of ceruloplasmin concentration, ceruloplasmin activity, ceruloplasmin specific activity (eCp/iCp), copper, non-ceruloplasmin copper iron, transferrin, the ceruloplasmin/transferrin ratio, and the APOE genotype in a sample of 84 AD patients and 58 healthy volunteers.

From the univariate logistic analyses, we found that ceruloplasmin concentration, eCp/iCp, copper, transferrin, the ceruloplasmin/transferrin ratio, and the APOE genotype were significantly associated with the probability of AD. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, we selected the best subset of biological predictors using the forward stepwise procedure. The analysis showed a decrease in the risk of having AD for eCp/iCp (p = 0.001) and an increase in this risk for non-ceruloplasmin copper (p = 0.008), age (p = 0.001), and APOE-ɛ4 allele (p < 0.001). The estimated model demonstrated good power in discriminating AD patients from healthy controls (area under curve: 88%; sensitivity: 66%; specificity: 93%). These data strengthen the observed breakdown of copper homeostasis and propose eCp/iCp as a reliable marker of ceruloplasmin status.

### Brain and the whole-body bone imaging appearances in Menkes disease: A case report and literature review [^1168QCcX]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Menkes disease (MD) is a rare, inherited, multisystemic copper metabolism disorder. Classical Menkes disease is characterized by low serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations, leading to multiple abnormalities in the whole body, especially in connective tissue and the central nervous system. However, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels are not reliable diagnostic biomarkers due to the low concentrations in healthy newborns either. The featured imaging manifestations play an important role in diagnosing Menkes disease. To our knowledge, there are few reports on the systemic imaging manifestations of Menkes disease.
- **Case presentation**: A 4-month-old male patient presented with seizures. He had cognitive, intellectual, growth, gross motor, precision movement, and language developmental lags. The patient's hemoglobin and serum ceruloplasmin levels were low. On MRI, increased intracranial vascular tortuosity, cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, white matter changes, and basal ganglia abnormalities were observed. A plain radiograph revealed wormian bones, rib flaring, metaphyseal spurring, and periosteal reactions in the long bones of the limbs. A pathogenic variant in the ATP7A gene was identified in the patient, confirming the diagnosis of Menkes disease. His symptoms did not improve despite symptomatic and supportive treatment during his hospitalization. Unfortunately, the infant died 3 months after leaving the hospital.
- **Conclusion**: A comprehensive and intuitive understanding of the disease's imaging manifestations can help clinicians to identify the disease.

### MR imaging of cerebral cortical involvement in aceruloplasminemia [^1136Hycr]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2005). Low credibility.

Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The lack of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity leads to parenchymal and reticuloendothelial iron overload, resulting in diabetes, progressive neurodegeneration with extrapyramidal disorders, ataxia, and dementia. We describe the MR imaging findings in a 40-year-old woman with hereditary aceruloplasminemia. The abnormal T2 hypointensities were more marked than those seen in any other condition, including degenerative disorders of the basal ganglia and Wilson disease, and they may be typical of aceruloplasminemia. To our knowledge, involvement of the cortex has not been described and suggests that brain iron accumulation in aceruloplasminemia is more extensive than previously believed, even in asymptomatic patients.

### Involvement of chloride channels in hepatic copper metabolism: ClC-4 promotes copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin [^115dG8VU]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The interaction of multiple pumps, chaperones, and accessory proteins regulates copper transport in hepatocytes. While intracellular chloride channels are essential for copper metabolism in yeast, their role in copper transport in hepatocytes remains unknown. This study aimed to determine whether chloride channels modulate copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin (CP).
- **Methods**: The effects of chloride concentration and chloride channel expression on the secretion of holoCp and apoCp were measured by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The expression of the ClC family chloride channels in hepatocytes was determined by Western blotting. The association of ClC-4 and the Wilson's disease protein (ATP7B) was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation.
- **Results**: Chloride substitution reduced total Cp secretion and the ratio of secreted holoCp to apoCp (P = 0.038). The specific roles of chloride channels were examined by cotransfecting ceruloplasmin and the chloride channel. Overexpression of ClC-4 doubled copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin (P = 0.011), whereas overexpression of ClC-3 had no effect. The effect of ClC-4 was most pronounced under copper-limiting conditions, increasing copper incorporation more than 4-fold (P = 0.037). ClC-4 protein was abundant in hepatocyte membranes and was localized in intracellular vesicles containing ATP7B.
- **Conclusions**: ClC-4 is an intracellular chloride channel that stimulates copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin, likely by enhancing the efficiency of the ATP7B copper pump. Therefore, it is a significant cofactor in copper metabolism within hepatocytes.

### Longitudinal analysis of serum copper and ceruloplasmin in Alzheimer's disease [^113BCXg3]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Several studies have reported that peripheral levels of copper and ceruloplasmin (CP) can differentiate patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from non-AD cases. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of serum copper, CP, and non-CP copper levels in a large cohort of AD subjects.
- **Methods**: Serum copper and CP concentrations were measured at baseline and at 18 months in participants from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted using both univariate and multivariate testing, adjusting for age, gender, total protein, and ApoE ε4 genotype status.
- **Results**: There was no significant difference in levels of serum copper or CP between the AD and healthy control groups. However, we identified a near-significant decrease in non-CP copper in the mild cognitive impairment and AD groups at baseline (p = 0.02), which was significant at 18 months (p = 0.003).
- **Conclusion**: Our results suggest that there may be decreased non-CP copper levels in mild cognitive impairment and AD, which is consistent with diminished copper-dependent biochemical activities described in AD.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^113tLamh]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). High credibility.

The calculated non‐ceruloplasmin‐bound copper (NCC) has historically been used to monitor the evolution of Wilson disease (WD), but it has never been validated for diagnosis. Several limitations have been raised against utilizing this method, particularly its dependence on the method employed for ceruloplasmin determination, which can sometimes lead to negative and hard‐to‐interpret values.

A different assay to directly determine the NCC is known as exchangeable copper (CuEXC), representing the labile portion of copper bound to albumin and other peptides but not to ceruloplasmin.
- **Relative exchangeable copper (REC)**: The ratio of CuEXC to total serum copper is known as REC. It has demonstrated its utility in diagnosing WD. In a previous study, we reported that both the sensitivity and specificity of REC for diagnosing WD were 100% when comparing cohorts of adults and children with WD with those having other hepatic diseases in a chronic and stable setting, thus not including any case of acute liver failure (ALF). The present study aims to evaluate the performance of REC in diagnosing WD in ALF.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: a potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^115Husvu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this case adds more information about the natural history of Wilson's Disease (WD) and suggests that WD is a challenge even in particular contexts such as family screening. This is particularly true in asymptomatic patients, including the pediatric age group and adults with asymptomatic increases in liver tests. In these patients, the presence of normal values in some copper metabolism tests decreases the accuracy of the Leipzig score, indicating that genetic testing becomes imperative in diagnosing WD. Genetic testing of the entire ATP7B gene should be conducted in cases of relatives of WD patients with minimal alterations in copper metabolism tests, such as ceruloplasmin, and signs such as steatosis, even in overweight patients.

### Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content, as determined using the entire core of a liver biopsy sample [^112BwSAq]. Hepatology (2015). High credibility.

The final diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) was made in 178 patients, including 105 H patients (59.0%), 25 N1 patients (14.0%), 31 N2 patients (17.4%), and 17 P patients (9.6%). Among them, 174 (97.8%) had a WD score of at least 4, whereas only 4 had a WD score of less than 4. Among these 4 patients, 3 were siblings of index cases and had mildly decreased ceruloplasmin levels and markedly increased liver copper levels. The remaining patient was evaluated because of elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and serum aspartate aminotransferase for 3 years. This patient had a ceruloplasmin level of 272 mg/L and markedly elevated liver copper content of 1,125.0 μg/g dry weight. Four patients who refused to undergo genetic testing were treated with penicillamine or zinc, and their liver function tests gradually returned to normal. They were diagnosed with WD based on a combination of WD score, family history, and positive response to chelator therapy, even though their WD scores were less than 4.

Hepatic copper levels in WD patients did not correlate with sex, the grade of hepatic inflammation, or stage of hepatic fibrosis, but negatively correlated with age at diagnosis (r = −0.304; P = 0.001). Mean hepatic copper levels were significantly higher in H patients than in other phenotypes (P = 0.001). It was also higher in patients 14 years old or younger than in older patients. All 105 H patients, including 60 patients 14 years old or younger, had hepatic copper levels over 250 μg/g dry weight. Among the 31 N2 patients, 7 (22.6%) had hepatic copper levels exceeding this threshold.

### Iron accumulation in the liver of male patients with Wilson's disease [^111byuC1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

There is accumulating evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper protein with ferroxidase activity, plays an important role in iron metabolism. The genetic disorder, aceruloplasminemia, can lead to tissue storage of iron as in hemochromatosis. Because most patients with Wilson's disease, a genetic copper toxicosis, have hypoceruloplasminemia, some could be affected by iron overload.
- **Methods**: Four male patients with Wilson's disease were enrolled in this study of pre- and post-treatment iron metabolism.
- **Results**: Pretreatment copper contents of the liver were high in all four male patients studied, confirming the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Genetic analysis supported their clinical diagnosis without a background of hemochromatosis. Pretreatment serum ceruloplasmin levels were < 20 mg/dl in all four patients. A standard penicillamine treatment for 3–8.5 years further decreased their serum ceruloplasmin levels. Post-treatment serum ferroxidase activity was low, as was the serum ceruloplasmin protein. Copper contents in the liver decreased after treatment in all subjects. In contrast, nonheme iron in the liver increased during treatment. Pretreatment liver specimens were positive for histochemical iron in two patients, and post-treatment specimens were positive in all four patients. In two patients, serum aminotransferase levels rebounded with elevation of serum ferritin concentration during the treatment period. Subsequent iron reduction by phlebotomy ameliorated their biochemical liver damage.
- **Conclusion**: Iron overload related to hypoceruloplasminemia may be cl

### Unhealthy dietary patterns are related to low ceruloplasmin in female nurses [^112L2Qe5]. BMJ Military Health (2020). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined the relationship between dietary patterns and antioxidant status. We aimed to explore the association between major dietary patterns and oxidative stress biomarkers, including serum protein carbonyl (PC), ceruloplasmin, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC).
- **Method**: In this cross-sectional study, we randomly selected 320 female nurses aged 20–45 years. General information about the participants was collected by trained interviewers. Their weight and height were measured, and dietary intakes were determined by the 147-food-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Dietary patterns were derived by principal component analysis, yielding 25 food groups. In this study, 90 subjects were randomly selected from all participants, with serum levels of PC, ceruloplasmin, and TAC measured further. To determine the association between dietary patterns' scores and oxidative stress biomarkers, multiple linear regression analysis was conducted.
- **Results**: Three dietary patterns were derived: healthy, unhealthy, and traditional. After adjusting for several confounding factors, the unhealthy dietary pattern was inversely related to the serum concentration of ceruloplasmin and PC (p < 0.05). The relationship between other dietary patterns and antioxidant biomarkers was not significant.
- **Conclusions**: According to the results of this study, unhealthy dietary patterns may have an adverse effect on serum ceruloplasmin.

### Lower serum ceruloplasmin levels correlate with younger age of onset in Parkinson's disease [^1122aEP4]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Ceruloplasmin functions as a ferroxidase in iron metabolism. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by an increase in brain iron. We postulated that lower circulating ceruloplasmin levels in PD would result in rapid brain iron accumulation and an earlier age of onset. Consecutive PD patients were separated into subgroups with younger (< 60, n = 22) and older (≥ 60, n = 29) age of onset, and compared to non-PD controls (n = 40). A one-way ANOVA comparing ceruloplasmin levels showed a very robust effect [F(2,128) = 46.4, p < 0.0001]. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that the younger-onset PD subgroup [22.0 mg/dl ± 6.5 SD] had a lower mean ceruloplasmin level compared to the older-onset PD subgroup [35.7 ± 10.4] and controls [35.6 ± 8.4], whose levels did not differ from each other. Ceruloplasmin levels showed robust correlation with age of onset in all 91 PD patients [r = 0.56, r² = 0.31, p < 0.0001] but not in the non-PD controls [r = 0.16, r² = 0.03, not significant]. Mode of onset and duration of PD showed no relationship to ceruloplasmin. Serum copper and ferritin, available in most patients, did not differ between the PD subgroups. Younger-onset PD patients have significantly lower levels of serum ceruloplasmin compared to those with older-onset PD. Ceruloplasmin may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of younger-onset PD patients and merits further study.

### EASL-ern clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^115QC5Rn]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for Wilson's disease, specifically concerning the indications for testing in family relatives, the EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion measurements. It is also suggested to assess relative exchangeable copper, if available, in siblings and first-degree relatives (parents and offspring of an index case). Clinical symptoms should be evaluated, and liver tests should be obtained.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: A potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^116vV2wa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The patient reported herein is a rare case of Wilson's Disease (WD) with minimal clinical and biochemical alterations, no symptoms, and normal enzyme values. Liver ultrasonography and histology revealed steatosis, and the patient's lipid profile was altered, confounded by his increased BMI. In this context, steatosis could not be attributed to WD because it could be due solely to an alteration of lipid metabolism or to both an alteration of lipid metabolism and WD.

Copper metabolism assessment only showed a slight ceruloplasmin decrease, while serum copper, 24-hour urine copper, and liver copper content were within the normal range. Applying the Leipzig scoring system evaluation, we obtained a score of 2 without considering mutation analysis and 6 after including genetic testing. There are a few reported cases of adult asymptomatic patients detected with familial screening following a family member was diagnosed with WD. In all cases, besides the genetic results, some alterations were also present.

In a 43-year-old asymptomatic patient of Armenian origin, compound heterozygous for p.G691R/p. I1230V, the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF) was found and copper biochemical tests were also altered. In another paper, two cases of asymptomatic twins of WD patients were reported. The first case was diagnosed at 39 years by genetic analysis revealing compound heterozygosity for p.H1069Q/c.1211_1212insA mutations. She only showed low ceruloplasmin and copper serum levels, while clinical and biochemical assessments resulted in the normal range. A 24-hour urine test, copper liver biopsy, and liver copper content were not evaluated in this case.

### Serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity is a sensitive and highly specific diagnostic marker for Wilson's disease [^112V74X8]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

A low serum ceruloplasmin concentration is considered diagnostic for Wilson's disease. We aimed to evaluate an enzymatic test for ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and to compare it with the routinely used immunological ceruloplasmin measurement.

- **Methods**: Serum ceruloplasmin was measured enzymatically with o-dianisidine dihydrochloride as substrate and immunologically. A total of 110 Wilson's disease patients, 52 healthy controls, and 51 patients with impaired liver function not due to Wilson's disease were analyzed. Assay performance was tested by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, McNemar test, and Spearman's rank correlation.

- **Results**: The greatest sum of sensitivity and specificity was seen for the enzymatic ceruloplasmin assay at a cut-off point of 55 U/L (93.6% and 100%, respectively) and for the immunologic assay at a cut-off point of 0.19 g/L (93.6% and 78.8%, respectively). For healthy controls, the differences in specificity between both assays were statistically significant (McNemar, p = 0.02). When additionally including patients with impaired liver function into the control group, the specificity declined to 84.5% for the enzymatic assay and to 68.9% for the immunologic assay. The correlation between the enzymatic and immunologic assay was high in healthy controls (r = 0.94), but weaker in Wilson's disease patients (r = 0.70) and patients with impaired liver function not due to Wilson's disease (r = 0.65).

- **Conclusions**: For the enzymatic assay, the best cut-off point for predicting Wilson's disease was estimated to be 55 U/L. Our data suggest that the…

### Seizures of unknown etiology associated with brittle hair: A diagnostic challenge [^113zaTwb]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In a given patient, the constellation of hair findings — brittle, steely, kinky hair — and the LM findings of PT and TN, along with low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, are all highly suggestive of MD. However, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels may be normal during early disease and, thus, are not completely reliable in early cases such as ours. In such cases, hair and LM findings alone are highly suggestive of disease and support early treatment initiation while waiting for confirmatory molecular genetic studies. Given that prompt treatment with copper histidine may prevent some neurologic sequelae, recognizing the hair-related clinical manifestations as indicative of MD early in the disease process is vital. It highlights the potentially significant role of dermatology in aiding rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation.

This case was unusual in that the patient experienced hair-related (scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes) clinical manifestations of MD earlier than is the norm. The combination of characteristic hair findings and the history of new-onset, intractable seizures was highly suggestive of MD, underlining the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in such cases. This is crucial to prevent delays in the treatment of what is a rare, usually fatal, disease.

### The overuse of serum ceruloplasmin measurement [^111SUkaP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Wilson disease is rare, found in 3 of 100,000 people (0.03%). Ceruloplasmin is often ordered to evaluate liver enzyme elevations. Because Wilson disease often presents before middle age, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease recommends screening patients between the ages of 3 and 55 years with liver abnormalities of uncertain cause. We evaluate guideline adherence and the clinical and economic impact of the clinical use of ceruloplasmin.
- **Methods**: We reviewed all ceruloplasmin measurements at a clinical laboratory that serves a large primary care network, specialty clinics, and a 600-bed tertiary referral center between January 1, 2003, and December 12, 2011.
- **Results**: Ceruloplasmin was measured 5,325 times in 5,023 unique patients, resulting in 8 (0.16%) new Wilson disease diagnoses. Ceruloplasmin's positive predictive value was 8.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.7–9.3) and the false-positive rate was 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 96.2–99.1). A total of 1,109 ceruloplasmin levels (20.8%) were ordered in the 1,066 patients aged more than 55 years (none with Wilson disease). A "shotgun" approach to liver disease diagnosis was found: ceruloplasmin was ordered on the same day as hepatitis B (81.0%), hepatitis C (76.0%), autoimmune hepatitis (75.1%), and hemochromatosis (73.1%). Of 424 positive ceruloplasmin results, 91% were not pursued further.
- **Conclusions**: Guideline adherence restricts ceruloplasmin use to a population with a higher pre-test probability of Wilson disease: patients with chronic liver disease aged 3 to 55 years who have been tested.

### Novel mutation in the ceruloplasmin gene causing a cognitive and movement disorder with diabetes mellitus [^111LSYVH]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

In a Chinese woman who had diabetes mellitus, undetectable ceruloplasmin, hand tremor, neck dystonia, and cognitive disturbances, genetic analyses revealed a novel homozygous mutation (848G > C or W283S) in exon 5 of the ceruloplasmin gene. Another family member with a milder phenotype was also affected by this mutation. The healthy sister was heterozygous at the same position. Aceruloplasminemia has not yet been reported in China. This case suggests that increased awareness should be paid to this disorder in the presence of the typical symptoms.

### Trientine hydrochloride [^111h67F8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal inherited metabolic defect that results in an inability to maintain a near-zero balance of copper. Excess copper accumulates because the liver lacks the mechanism to excrete free copper into the bile. Hepatocytes store excess copper, but when their capacity is exceeded, copper is released into the blood and is taken up into extrahepatic sites. This condition is treated with a low-copper diet and the use of chelating agents that bind copper to facilitate its excretion from the body.
- **Clinical summary**: Forty-one patients (18 male and 23 female) between the ages of 6 and 54, diagnosed with Wilson's disease and intolerant to d-penicillamine, were treated in two separate studies with trientine hydrochloride. The dosage varied from 450 to 2400 mg per day. The average dosage required to achieve an optimal clinical response varied between 1000 mg and 2000 mg per day. The mean duration of trientine hydrochloride therapy was 48.7 months (range 2 to 164 months). Thirty-four of the 41 patients improved, 4 had no change in clinical global response, 2 were lost to follow-up, and one showed deterioration in clinical condition. One of the patients who improved while on therapy with trientine hydrochloride experienced a recurrence of the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, which had originally appeared during therapy with penicillamine, leading to the discontinuation of trientine hydrochloride therapy. No other adverse reactions, except for iron deficiency, were noted among any of these 41 patients.

### Ferroportin disease: Pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^114p8f2c]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

The name ferroportin disease (FD) refers to a clinical entity differing from all other known forms of hereditary iron overload, including hemochromatosis (HC), synonymous with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH); it is due to either HFE or non-HFE hemochromatosis gene mutations. In humans, several genetic disorders are associated with systemic iron overload, while others are caused by iron misdistribution and are associated with the regional accumulation of iron in subcellular compartments, such as mitochondria in Friedreich ataxia, or in certain cell types and organs, such as basal ganglia in neuroferritinopathy. In strict terms, the latter disorders may not all qualify as true iron-overload states, as the total body iron content may not be increased. FD, accounting for one of the commonest forms of hereditary iron overload disorders besides HFE-hemochromatosis, is characterized by a unique pathogenic basis and clinical presentation and, unlike HC, has been reported worldwide, regardless of ethnicity.
- **Ferroportin disease (phenotype MIM number 606069, gene/Locus; MIM number 604653)**: This condition is due to pathogenic (usually missense) mutations of the ferroportin1 gene (FPN1; SLC40A1), which encodes the only iron exporter identified in mammals. Lack-of-function mutations impair the iron-export capability of FPN1, particularly in cells with a high iron turnover, such as tissue macrophages. Unlike the mutations causing FD, other rare mutations…

### Cerebellar ataxia associated with heteroallelic ceruloplasmin gene mutation [^115BNzDK]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Aceruloplasminemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that affects human iron metabolism, is caused by mutations of the ceruloplasmin gene. Heterozygous individuals with a partial ceruloplasmin deficiency may have normal iron metabolism and no clinical symptoms.
- **Methods**: The authors clinically characterized three Japanese patients from two families who had cerebellar ataxia with hypoceruloplasminemia from the fourth decade of life. Genetic analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and a pathologic study were performed.
- **Results**: All three patients presented with cerebellar dysfunction that included relatively nondisabling gait ataxia and dysarthria, as well as hyperreflexia. Brain and abdomen MRI showed cerebellar atrophy and no low-signal intensities in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and liver. Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, SCA-12, and DRPLA. The patients partially lacked serum ceruloplasmin, and the protein concentrations and ferroxidase activities ranged from 36% to 41% of the control values; moreover, they were heterozygous for a nonsense mutation of the ceruloplasmin gene (Trp858ter). Serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation were normal. At autopsy, pathologic and biochemical examinations showed marked loss of Purkinje cells, a large iron deposition in the cerebellum, and small depositions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and liver.
- **Conclusion**: Cerebellar ataxia reflects the site of iron deposition. Being heterozygous for the mutation of the ceruloplasmin gene may result in cerebellar ataxia.

### Iron metabolism and related genetic diseases: A cleared land, keeping mysteries [^1113yAVo]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Body iron has a very close relationship with the liver. Physiologically, the liver synthesizes transferrin, which is in charge of blood iron transport; ceruloplasmin, which acts through its ferroxidase activity; and hepcidin, the master regulator of systemic iron. It also stores iron inside ferritin, serving as an iron reservoir that protects the cell from free iron toxicity and ensures iron delivery to the body whenever needed. The liver is first in line for receiving iron from the gut and the spleen and is therefore highly exposed to iron overload when plasma iron is in excess, particularly due to its high affinity for plasma non-transferrin bound iron.

The liver is significantly involved when iron excess is related to hepcidin deficiency, as seen in HFE, hemojuvelin, hepcidin, and transferrin receptor 2-related haemochromatosis, or to hepcidin resistance, as present in type B ferroportin disease. However, it is less involved in the usual (type A) form of ferroportin disease, which primarily targets the macrophagic system. Hereditary aceruloplasminemia poses important pathophysiological challenges due to its distinctive organ iron distribution.

### Concordance rates of Wilson's disease phenotype among siblings [^1134NkQQ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Slightly higher concordance between hepatic ICs and their symptomatic siblings versus neurological ICs and their siblings can be partly explained by the primary principles of copper metabolism, since the liver is the first organ in which copper accumulates and is especially prone to damage caused by copper overload (Linder et al.).

Neurological presentation appears more complicated and less predictable, given that there are more complex interactions between copper and ceruloplasmin and the central nervous system. First, copper serves as a cofactor and a modulator of enzymes that are crucial for brain homeostasis, such as superoxide dismutase and dopamine hydroxylase. Copper is also centrally involved in iron transport and myelination processes. Additionally, brain-specific amyloid precursor protein and PrP are copper-binding, copper-dependent proteins that have important roles in neurodegeneration (Multhaup et al; Millhauser). Ceruloplasmin itself is involved in the transport of other metal ions and possesses very strong antioxidant properties, such as ferroxidase activity (Gutteridge). Therefore, reduced ceruloplasmin levels may reflect an increased level of oxidative stress.

In conclusion, high intrafamilial concordance rates of clinical and biochemical presentation of WD revealed among siblings shall be a premise for further research regarding the influence of epigenetic, environmental, and other genetic factors.

### Decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels characteristically aggravate nigral iron deposition in Parkinson's disease [^114ALnSi]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

In vivo and post-mortem studies have demonstrated that increased nigral iron content in patients with Parkinson's disease is a prominent pathophysiological feature. However, the mechanism and risk factors associated with nigral iron deposition in patients with Parkinson's disease have not been identified and represent a key challenge in understanding its pathogenesis and for its diagnosis.

In this study, we assessed iron levels in patients with Parkinson's disease and in age- and gender-matched control subjects by measuring phase values using magnetic resonance-based susceptibility-weighted phase imaging in a 3T magnetic resonance system. Phase values were measured from brain regions including the bilateral substantia nigra, globus pallidus, putamen, caudate, thalamus, red nucleus, and frontal white matter of 45 patients with Parkinson's disease with decreased or normal serum ceruloplasmin levels, together with age- and gender-matched control subjects.

Correlative analyses between phase values, serum ceruloplasmin levels, and disease severity showed that the nigral bilateral average phase values in patients with Parkinson's disease were significantly lower than in control subjects and correlated with disease severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr Scale. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores from the clinically most affected side were significantly correlated with the phase values of the contralateral substantia nigra. Furthermore, nigral bilateral average phase values correlated highly with the level of serum ceruloplasmin.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^112Q5yyQ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Even though relative exchangeable copper (REC) is a reliable parameter to diagnose Wilson disease (WD), its main limitations include availability, as it is only performed in specialized laboratories, and the significant delay required to obtain results, which can vary from 3 to 7 days depending on the test's availability and local logistical organization. This is extremely important when dealing with acute liver failure (ALF).

In contrast, genetic testing, such as rapid exome sequencing, is becoming increasingly accessible and faster, offering a potentially more efficient diagnostic alternative in many settings. Despite these advancements, CuEXC/REC determination is still valuable, as it represents a direct measure of biochemical alterations associated with copper metabolism, providing functional evidence that complements genetic data or serves as a diagnostic tool in resource-limited settings where genetic testing is not yet widely accessible.

Considering the REC's limitations, we suggest that the simpler scores previously discussed, which use basic and more readily accessible biochemical parameters, should still be used as the first exploratory tests to start treatment promptly when deemed necessary. The REC could be employed as a mid-term confirmatory test until it becomes more available and readily accessible.
- **Extrahepatic involvement and monitoring**:
	- The CuEXC has demonstrated that it is correlated with extrahepatic involvement; it can help assess treatment compliance and is a potential marker to monitor the disease. However, potential under- and overestimation of this method has been reported.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, especially in the context of clinical and laboratory monitoring, EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend considering the assessment of medication adherence. This is based on monitoring serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper levels, serum exchangeable copper, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion at baseline and 48 hours after the cessation of chelators.

### Galzin [^115zQeMc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be monitored primarily by assessing existing signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease and through 24-hour urine copper assessments. Neuropsychiatric evaluations, including speech assessments, as well as liver function tests, including bilirubin and aminotransferases, should be conducted as appropriate.

The urinary excretion of copper provides an accurate reflection of the body's copper status when patients are not on chelation therapy. Clinicians should be aware that urinary copper levels are typically increased with chelation therapies such as penicillamine or trientine. Adequate zinc therapy will eventually decrease urinary copper excretion to 125 μg per 24 hours or less; a significant upward trend indicates an impending loss of copper control. Non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper, also known as free copper, is calculated by subtracting ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper, with each mg of ceruloplasmin containing 3 μg of copper. In the United States study, non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper concentration was maintained below 20 μg/dL. Urine and plasma for copper determinations should be collected in copper-free containers and assayed with equipment capable of accurately measuring copper at levels as low as 0.01 μg/mL.

An additional monitoring tool, if available, is the amount of radioactivity measured in the plasma 1 or 2 hours after orally administering ⁶⁴copper. For adequately controlled patients, this amount is less than 1.2% of the administered dose. The level of hepatic copper should not be used to manage therapy as it does not differentiate between potentially toxic free copper and other copper forms.

### Hepatic iron overload associated with a decreased serum ceruloplasmin level in a novel clinical type of aceruloplasminemia [^115bLbMk]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Aceruloplasminemia is a novel hereditary iron overload disease caused by a mutation in the ceruloplasmin gene, characterized by a complete deficiency of serum ceruloplasmin and iron accumulation in the liver and brain.

- **Aims**: We studied a novel clinical type of aceruloplasminemia in which a low amount of ceruloplasmin was detected in the serum of a patient. The patient presented with asymptomatic hepatic iron overload, retinal degeneration, and diabetes mellitus. Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and basal ganglia showed T2-hypointensity signals associated with parenchymal iron accumulation due to an absence of ferroxidase activity in ceruloplasmin.
- **Methods**: A gene analysis revealed a novel G969S mutation in the ceruloplasmin gene. Biochemical analysis of the patient's serum and a biogenesis study of G969S mutant ceruloplasmin, using a mammalian cell culture system, resulted in the synthesis and secretion of only apoceruloplasmin without any ferroxidase activity.
- **Conclusions**: This novel clinical type of aceruloplasminemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained hemochromatosis, associated with a decrease in serum ceruloplasmin levels.

### Serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and their relations to metabolic factors in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a cross-sectional study [^111i3JzV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excessive intrahepatic fat accumulation, is increasing worldwide. This study aimed to investigate serum copper (Cu) and ceruloplasmin (Cer) levels and their relations to metabolic factors in NAFLD.

This cross-sectional study was conducted on 141 subjects with NAFLD, diagnosed using abdominal ultrasonography. Personal information, anthropometric measures, glucose and lipid profiles, and serum levels of liver enzymes were assessed. Fasting serum levels of Cu and Cer were determined using colorimetry and nephelometry assays, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to examine the associations of serum Cu and Cer levels with NAFLD risk.

The results, involving 85 patients with NAFLD and 56 apparently healthy participants, showed that all NAFLD cases and 53.6% of the healthy subjects were overweight or obese. More than half of the patients (58.8%) exhibited mild NAFLD. Age, weight, BMI, lipid profile, uric acid, and ferritin were significantly higher in NAFLD patients than in the healthy cases. No significant differences were found in the concentrations of Cu and Cer between the groups. Only 7.4% of the healthy subjects and 2.4% of the patients were Cu deficient (< 70 µg/dl). No association was found between the risk of NAFLD and serum Cu (OR: 0.994; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.981–1.006) or Cer levels (OR: 0.414; 95% CI: 0.001–123.604) after adjusting for the confounders.

Our findings revealed no association between Cu deficiency and NAFLD risk. Further human studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.

### Ferroportin disease: Pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^1112zFQE]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment

Venesection is the cornerstone of therapy in ferroportin disease (FD), although it may not be tolerated equally by all patients. A low transferrin saturation (TS) with anemia can be rapidly established despite elevated serum ferritin (SF). Macrophage iron overload is very resistant to iron withdrawal in this disorder, even in patients who appear to be well-treated (Figure 5C). Therefore, unlike hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), both serum ferritin and especially TS should be carefully monitored during therapy.

Therapy should not aim to reach the usual HH targets for iron depletion (TS below 20%, SF 50 ng/L, or slight anemia) but should be more conservative. There are no studies on the optimal phlebotomy schedule in FD. Practically, a monthly/bi-monthly phlebotomy session for 1–2 years, depending on the underlying mutation, allows an acceptable state of iron depletion to be reached. Maintenance therapy, usually a phlebotomy session every 4–6 months, should be continued for life. A reasonable target for therapy is an SF level of 100–200 ng/mL. In certain cases, such ferritin values may still reflect some iron loading of tissue macrophages (Figure 5C), but the associated clinical risk is negligible. Ideally, the optimal target is the lowest acceptable ferritin level for TS with hemoglobin levels not falling below the lower limit of normal.

The controversial dietary restrictions sometimes recommended for patients with HH, such as avoiding vitamin C or iron-rich or enriched foods, do not apply to FD due to the different pathogenic basis compared to HH. FD is characterized by normal or sufficient enterocyte iron absorption and normal or marginally increased iron accumulation.

### Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content, as determined using the entire core of a liver biopsy sample [^114DsRUE]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

- **Design overview, setting, and participants**: The study was conducted between June 2007 and May 2014 at the Liver Disease Research Center, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (Changsha, China). Patients referred to the Liver Disease Research Center were consecutively enrolled during the study period. The study inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients suspected of WD; (2) relatives of WD patients for whom liver biopsy was indicated; and (3) patients with various diseases for whom liver biopsy was indicated. Indications for liver biopsy were based on the guideline for liver biopsy. Patients with contraindications to percutaneous liver biopsy, such as severe coagulopathy and ascites, and those who were uncooperative or refused to perform liver biopsy with copper determination were excluded from the study. Patients who had liver samples less than 1 mg/g dry wt, received chelator therapy more than 6 months preceding liver biopsy, or were lost to follow-up before a diagnosis was made were also excluded.

Patients suspected of WD underwent a slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings, neurological examination, measurement of serum ceruloplasmin level, and determination of 24-hour urinary copper excretion before and after penicillamine challenge. Liver biopsy with copper determination was performed in most patients without contraindications, and owing to cost, gene analysis was performed in only some patients. Initial diagnosis of WD was based on the criteria described before and the diagnostic scoring system published.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis of Wilson's disease [^114WpeTG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Wilson's disease, first described by Samuel Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene. The disease develops as a consequence of copper accumulating in affected tissues. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which is often delayed due to the non-specific clinical features and the need for a combination of clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosis. This delay may in turn affect clinical outcome and has implications for other family members in terms of diagnosis. The Leipzig criteria were established to help standardize diagnosis and management. However, it should be emphasized that these criteria date from 2003, and many of these have not been formally evaluated; this review examines the evidence behind biochemical testing for Wilson's disease.
- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of three biochemical tests at specified cut-off levels for Wilson's disease. The index tests covered by this Cochrane Review are caeruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and hepatic copper content. These tests were evaluated in those with suspected Wilson's disease and appropriate controls (either healthy or those with chronic liver disease other than Wilson's). In the absence of a gold standard for diagnosing Wilson's disease, we have used the Leipzig criteria as a clinical reference standard. To investigate whether index tests should be performed in all individuals who have been recommended for testing for Wilson's disease, or whether these tests should be limited to subgroups of individuals.

### Investigating the prevalence of copper and zinc abnormalities in patients pre and post bariatric surgery-an Australian experience [^116wHnTj]. Obesity Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) guidelines recommend the routine screening of copper (Cu) through serum copper and ceruloplasmin for patients prior to RYGB and BPD procedures. However, the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (BOMSS) did not identify strong evidence to support routine screening of copper levels.

In our study, pre-operatively, low copper level was only seen in 1 (0.7%) patient, which is consistent with a study by Papamargaritis et al, showing minimal levels of copper abnormality (2%); however, the result contrasts with other findings where copper deficiency was reported to be 63.8% to as high as 74%. This may represent the different availability of micronutrients in the diets in different countries and potentially in different communities within countries.

On the other hand, elevated copper levels were more common in this study and were present in 23 (16.7%) patients. In interpreting copper levels, it is important to note that inflammation affects both serum copper and ceruloplasmin, hence, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Copper is a positive acute-phase reactant; as CRP was elevated in 52 (47.7%) cases, an elevated copper level in this cohort is expected. As observed in this study, the CRP improved following surgery, and consequently, so did the copper levels.

Reports on the prevalence of copper deficiency following surgery remain inconsistent. However, several studies have reported that copper deficiency, if untreated, can lead to serious and irreversible neurological complications. Therefore, monitoring of the copper status of bariatric patients is essential.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^117GNm7C]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Common findings that are usually associated with the diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD), such as the presence of the Kayser–Fleischer ring, low ceruloplasmin, high urinary copper excretion, or high copper liver content, can be absent, are not readily available, are not achievable, or are less specific in an acute liver failure (ALF) setting. For instance, the detection rate of the Kayser–Fleischer ring is dependent on age at presentation, with rates reaching up to 85% and, moreover, it can also be found in other hepatic diseases.

In the present study, ceruloplasmin levels of 2.6 μmol/24 h or greater than 3.8 μmol/24 h were used to achieve a sensitivity of 70% and 91.7%, respectively. The specificity of these findings was also evaluated.

### Excessive copper impairs intrahepatocyte trafficking and secretion of selenoprotein P [^111ksnQq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We next analyzed the selenium status in serum samples of Wilson's disease patients at the time of diagnosis, before the onset of therapeutic interventions. Overall, the clinical parameters of the patients were very heterogeneous; for example, a very broad range of serum copper concentrations was observed. Based on their serum CP levels, the patients were divided into two groups: those with normal (> 90 µg/L) and those with low (< 90 µg/L) serum CP concentrations (Fig. 4a). This was confirmed by measuring the functional holo-CP, as reflected by CP oxidase activity (Fig. 4b). Low CP is one of the parameters used for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which most probably indicates higher hepatic copper accumulation, as shown in the rat Wilson model (Fig. 3).

In addition, a third group, termed the "diseased" group, was established for patients with high clinical serum parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and hepatic transaminases. These parameters indicate a more severe disease state, resulting in copper leakage from destroyed hepatocytes (see Table S1 for patient characteristics). To further characterize the patients' copper status, total and free copper were analyzed. In line with the CP concentrations, total copper levels were reduced in the "low CP" group in comparison to the "normal CP" group (Fig. 4c). Free copper levels confirmed the division of patients into the "diseased" group, with higher concentrations compared to the other two groups (Fig. 4d). The SELENOP concentration was significantly decreased in the serum of patients with low serum copper.

### Diseases of iron metabolism [^115P1X27]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Diseases of iron metabolism are likely to be both more frequent than expected and exhibit a wider range of clinical severity and effects. Some present without evidence of anemia. Unexplained diseases of end organs that are affected by iron — such as the liver, heart, pancreas, kidney, adrenals, and cerebellum — should have an iron metabolism disorder considered. A review of blood indices and serum iron and ferritin markers may alert the clinician to most disorders. Further research is likely to define the scope and approach to the clinical diagnosis of diseases of iron metabolism.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: A potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^1152wJCb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) still remains a challenge since no single test has an accuracy of 100%. Molecular testing for ATP7B gene mutations can help reach the diagnosis when routine testing is equivocal. We herein report an asymptomatic WD patient diagnosed accidentally by genetic analysis. This case suggests that WD is a challenge even in particular contexts such as family screening. Genetic testing of the ATP7B gene should be recommended in the family members of WD patients with minimal alterations of specific tests such as ceruloplasmin, and presence of steatosis or increased body mass index.

### Cys-881 is essential for the trafficking and secretion of truncated mutant ceruloplasmin in aceruloplasminemia [^113haf7L]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Aceruloplasminemia is an inherited iron overload disorder caused by a mutation in the ceruloplasmin gene, characterized by iron accumulation in both the liver and brain. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of aceruloplasminemia through a functional analysis of mutant ceruloplasmin.
- **Methods**: The effects of nonsense mutations, including Y694ter, W858ter, and R882ter, were studied by expressing them in cultured cells.
- **Results**: A biogenesis study demonstrated that the Y694ter and W858ter mutants exhibited protein synthesis identical to that of the wild-type protein. However, these mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while the R882ter mutant was secreted. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses suggested that Cys-881 was necessary for the secretion of the truncated ceruloplasmin. The W858ter mutant decreased viability in the transfected cells. Furthermore, the expression and promoter activity of glucose-regulated protein 78, an ER stress sensor protein, were upregulated in the transfected cells.
- **Conclusions**: The truncated mutant containing Cys-881 was able to pass through the ER and was secreted, while the truncated mutant protein lacking Cys-881 appeared to accumulate in the ER. This accumulation led to ER stress, eventually resulting in cell death.

### A new neurological entity manifesting as involuntary movements and dysarthria with possible abnormal copper metabolism [^112iY7Rr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A few patients with an affected central nervous system (CNS) involving abnormalities in copper metabolism have been described that do not fit any known nosological entities such as Wilson's disease or Menkes' disease. Three sporadic patients (two men and one woman) were examined with involuntary movements and dysarthria associated with abnormal concentrations of serum copper, serum ceruloplasmin, and urinary copper excretion. The onset of neurological symptoms occurred at the age of 15 to 17 years. The common clinical symptoms were involuntary movements and dysarthria. The involuntary movements included dystonia in the neck, myoclonus in the shoulder, athetosis in the neck, and rapid orobuccal movements. The dysarthria consisted of unclear, slow, and stuttering speech.

Two of the three patients did not have dementia. A cousin of the female patient had been diagnosed with Wilson's disease and had died of liver cirrhosis. Laboratory findings showed a mild reduction in serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations, whereas urinary copper excretion was significantly reduced in all three patients. Two of the three patients showed a high signal intensity in the basal ganglia on T2-weighted brain MRI.

In conclusion, the unique findings of involuntary movements, dysarthria, and abnormal serum copper and urinary copper concentrations suggest that the three patients may constitute a new clinical entity that is distinct from either Wilson's or Menkes' disease.

### Aceruloplasminemia presenting with microcytic anemia in a Turkish boy due to a novel pathogenic variant [^116Fq5dU]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Aceruloplasminemia, inherited autosomal recessively in the ceruloplasmin gene, is a progressive disease characterized by iron accumulation in various organs, such as the brain, liver, pancreas, and retina. The ceruloplasmin gene encodes the ceruloplasmin protein, which has ferroxidase activity and is involved in copper and iron metabolism. Progressive neurotoxicity, retinopathy, and diabetes may develop in about 40–60% of cases. Additionally, microcytic anemia accompanied by high ferritin and low ceruloplasmin levels that develop at earlier ages can be a first manifestation. Iron chelation may be utilized in the treatment to reduce toxicity. Early diagnosis and treatment may delay the onset of symptoms.

A 14-year-old male patient was followed up with microcytic anemia since the age of eight. The anemia was accompanied by microcytosis, high ferritin, and low copper and ceruloplasmin levels. A novel homozygous c.690delG variant was detected in ceruloplasmin by whole exome sequencing. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of the patient demonstrated aceruloplasminemia. We present a boy with persistent microcytic anemia as the first manifestation at the age of eight, representing the youngest case of aceruloplasminemia in the literature. Therefore, aceruloplasminemia should be considered in the etiology of microcytic anemia when the cause cannot be found in childhood.

### Long-standing mild hypertransaminasaemia caused by congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type IIx [^1173cNSC]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2008). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old asymptomatic male came to our attention with a 21-year documented history of puzzling increases in his serum transaminase levels. Initially, a very low serum ceruloplasmin level suggested Wilson disease. Two liver biopsies showed mild portal inflammation, steatosis, and mild fibrosis. Further investigation revealed low levels of the glycoproteins AT III and clotting factor XI, leading to a diagnosis of congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type II. Further studies into the cause of this "apparently new" CDG are ongoing. Based on our data and a literature review, we suggest that subjects with asymptomatic hypertransaminasaemia be screened for CDG.

### Pilot study of mass screening for Wilson's disease in Korea [^112yVmci]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism characterized by copper accumulation in the liver and central nervous system. Treatment of WD includes oral chelating agents and dietary modifications, which are effective. However, once irreversible damage has occurred, the effectiveness of treatment diminishes, compromising the patient's quality of life. It is estimated that at least half of WD patients remain undiagnosed and succumb to untreated disease. Early detection of presymptomatic patients has been hindered by the lack of effective methods for mass screening. Recently, a sandwich ELISA method for ceruloplasmin measurement in blood spots was developed. We employed this method to analyze blood specimens collected on filter paper from 3,667 children aged 3 months to 15 years. The mean value of ceruloplasmin was 30.5 ± 9.5 mg/dL. Among these children, we identified one WD case: a 32-month-old boy with a markedly reduced ceruloplasmin concentration (2.3 mg/dL). Measurement of ceruloplasmin level in dried blood spot samples is proposed as a reliable method for population screening of WD.

### Value of serum nonceruloplasmin copper for prediction of mild cognitive impairment conversion to Alzheimer disease [^113hvxpb]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses show that nonbound ceruloplasmin (non-Cp) copper, also known as free or labile copper, in serum is higher in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and differentiates subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls. However, a longitudinal study on an MCI cohort has not yet been performed to assess the accuracy of non-Cp copper for predicting the conversion from MCI to AD during long-term follow-up.

The study included 42 MCI converters and 99 stable MCI subjects. Researchers assessed levels of copper, ceruloplasmin, non-Cp copper, iron, transferrin, ferritin, and APOE genotype. A multiple Cox regression analysis — with age, sex, baseline Mini-Mental State Examination, APOE4, iron, non-Cp copper, transferrin, ferritin, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension as covariates — was applied to predict the conversion from MCI to AD.

Among the evaluated parameters, the only significant predictor of conversion to AD was non-Cp copper (hazard ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.03–1.47, p = 0.022); for each additional micromole per liter unit (μmol/l) of non-Cp copper, the hazard increased by approximately 20%. Subjects with non-Cp copper levels > 1.6 μmol/l had a hazard conversion rate (50% of conversion in 4 years) that was about three times higher than those with values ≤ 1.6 μmol/l (< 20% in 4 years). The rate of conversion was similar between APOE4 carriers and noncarriers (p = 0.321), indicating that the non-Cp copper association was independent of APOE4.

Non-Cp copper appears to predict conversion from MCI to AD. These results encapsulate the significance of non-Cp copper levels in predicting AD conversion.

### Present situation of biomarkers for copper status [^116Ctfqu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Serum or plasma copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations are the most widely used laboratory indicators to evaluate copper status. Both indicators are decreased in moderate or severe copper deficiency. The activity of several cuproenzymes is decreased in mild copper deficiency. However, their use is limited by the nonexistence of standardized assays, high interindividual variability, and because some of these indicators are affected by other conditions. Recently, it was shown that the protein expression of the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) is increased in erythrocytes of rodents with mild copper deficiency.

However, no traditional laboratory indicators have been identified as potential early markers of copper excess. It is possible that the biomarkers studied so far are not sensitive enough to detect an increase in body copper before the appearance of functional or clinical effects, or that the homeostatic mechanisms are so strong that no significant changes in body copper occur with mild-to-moderate copper exposure. The identification of appropriate biomarkers for early detection of an increase in body copper represents a major challenge for further research. The development of new approaches, such as network biology, allows us to search and propose new candidates to be studied.

Recently, we found that CCS mRNA abundance in mononuclear blood cells significantly decreased after copper supplementation. The usefulness of this indicator to detect an increase in body copper should be assessed in clinical trials.

### Is low serum tocopherol in Wilson's disease a significant symptom [^111iDECR]? Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

Free radical mediated injury is increasingly recognized in many metabolic diseases, including Wilson's disease (WD). The use of antioxidants as an adjunctive therapy in WD may have therapeutic significance.
- **Aim**: The aim of the study was to correlate serum levels of tocopherols with serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and the clinical status of these patients.
- **Methods**: Serum levels of tocopherol were measured spectrophotometrically using the Emmerie-Engel reaction in 34 patients from a large cohort of WD being followed up at a tertiary care center.
- **Results**: The majority of patients were male (M/F = 23:11). The mean serum copper was 43.6 ± 26.2 µg/dl (range = 10–121 µg/dl), and serum ceruloplasmin was 5.6 ± 5.5 mg/dl (range = 0–30 mg/dl). The mean serum tocopherol level was 0.68 ± 0.18 mg/dl (range = 0.23–1.14 mg/dl), and compared to the control (1.07 ± 0.17 mg/dl), nearly 59% of patients had decreased levels (p < 0.001). No significant correlation was noted between low serum tocopherol levels and serum copper levels, Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores, and CHU staging. However, serum tocopherol levels were lower in patients with a relatively short duration of treatment (7.8 years vs. 12.4 years).
- **Conclusion**: Decreased levels of serum tocopherol were detected in 59% of patients compared to controls. However, low tocopherol levels did not correlate with clinical status or biochemical parameters of WD, except for a relatively shorter duration of treatment. Further studies, especially in newly diagnosed patients, need to be done to validate the role of low tocopherol levels in Wilson's disease.

### Excessive copper impairs intrahepatocyte trafficking and secretion of selenoprotein P [^114Eas1D]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Figure 4 shows that SELENOP concentrations are positively correlated with serum copper.
- **Serum ceruloplasmin concentrations**: Serum ceruloplasmin (CP) concentrations of Wilson's patients at the time of diagnosis were measured by ELISA.

- **CP oxidase activity and copper concentration**:
	- Serum CP oxidase (CPO) activity, total copper, and free copper concentrations of Wilson's patients were measured using photometric activity and TXRF with 1 mg/L gallium as the standard element for 1000 seconds or a fluorometric method. For normal CP, n = 8; low CP, n = 11; diseased, n = 4. Data are depicted as mean ± SD. Biological replicates are indicated by individual dots. Statistical analyses were based on one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-test.

- **SELENOP and selenium concentrations**: SELENOP and selenium concentrations were examined similarly.
- **EPIC-Potsdam study results**: Results from EPIC-Potsdam samples for SNP rs11708215 (coded per G allele) showed its correlation with serum SELENOP from linear regression using an additive genetic model adjusted for age at recruitment and sex. Serum SELENOP levels were natural log-transformed and standardized. Source data are provided as a source data file.

Ceruloplasmin (CP) is the main transport protein for copper from the liver to peripheral organs, indicating that low circulating CP levels suggest copper retention in the liver. The SNP rs11708215, located in the promoter region of the CP gene, is known to enhance hepatic CP expression and secretion. This results in more efficient copper export from the liver and a decrease in hepatic copper levels. Analysis of EPIC-Potsdam samples further revealed insights into the SNP rs11708215.

### Increased oxidized low density lipoprotein associated with high ceruloplasmin activity in patients with active acromegaly [^116Sy6uY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Active acromegaly is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular causes. Several studies have shown increased atherogenic risk factors and biomarkers of inflammation and atherosclerosis in association with growth hormone excess. The aim of this study was to evaluate oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) levels and some modulators of LDL oxidative modification in patients with acromegaly.
- **Design**: Open transversal study.
- **Patients**: Fifteen patients with active acromegaly and 15 controls were studied.
- **Measurements**: We evaluated the levels of oxLDL, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), ceruloplasmin, bilirubin, uric acid, and total reactive antioxidant potential. Additionally, the activities of ceruloplasmin, myeloperoxidase, superoxide dismutase, paraoxonase 1, and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed including body mass index as a covariate or as a fixed variable.
- **Results**: Patients with acromegaly showed significantly higher levels of oxLDL (120 ± 19 vs. 86 ± 20 U/l, P < 0.001) and endothelin (P < 0.05), increased ceruloplasmin activity (P < 0.01) and a trend towards higher values in TBARS concentration (P = 0.07) compared to healthy controls. OxLDL was positively associated with growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and its binding protein 3 (r = 0.63, P < 0.001; r = 0.53, P < 0.01; and r = 0.56, P < 0.01, respectively). OxLDL showed direct associations with endothelin-1 (r = 0.53, P < 0.01) and ceruloplasmin activity (r = 0.43, P < 0.05). The other parameters evaluated were similar in both groups.

### Aceruloplasminemia: new clinical, pathophysiological and therapeutic insights [^113BtYGA]. Journal of Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Aceruloplasminemia is an autosomal recessive disease of iron overload associated with mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene. We report here a new case of aceruloplasminemia in a woman who is a compound heterozygote for two new mutations. Besides this novel genotypic profile, this observation provides new insights on:

- **Iron metabolism**: Normal erythroid repartition in the absence of serum non-transferrin-bound iron, along with an increase in 59Fe plasma clearance.
- **Hepatic abnormalities**: Associated with the presence of iron-free foci.
- **Therapeutic management**: Chronic subcutaneous infusion of deferrioxamine is remarkably effective at reducing hepatic iron overload.

### Ceruloplasmin gene variants are associated with hyperferritinemia and increased liver iron in patients with NAFLD [^116uCWj2]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a multifactorial disorder resulting from genetic and environmental factors. Hyperferritinemia has been associated with increased hepatic iron stores and worse outcomes in patients with NAFLD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of variants of iron-related genes and their association with hyperferritinemia, hepatic iron stores, and liver disease severity in patients with NAFLD.

- **Methods**: From a cohort of 328 individuals with histological NAFLD, 23 patients with ferritin > 750 ng/ml and positive iron staining, and 25 controls with normal ferritin and negative iron staining, were selected. Patients with increased transferrin saturation, anemia, inflammation, β-thalassemia trait, HFE genotype at risk of iron overload, and ferroportin mutations were excluded. A panel of 32 iron genes was re-sequenced. Literature and in silico predictions were employed for prioritization of pathogenic mutations.

- **Results**: Patients with hyperferritinemia had a higher prevalence of potentially pathogenic rare variants (73.9% vs. 20%, p = 0.0002) associated with higher iron stores and more severe liver fibrosis (p < 0.05). Ceruloplasmin was the most mutated gene and its variants were independently associated with hyperferritinemia, hepatic siderosis, and more severe liver fibrosis (p < 0.05). In the overall cohort, ceruloplasmin variants were independently associated with hyperferritinemia (adjusted odds ratio 5.99; 95% CI 1.83–19.60; p = 0.0009).

- **Conclusions**: Variants in non-HFE iron genes, particularly ceruloplasmin, are associated with liver conditions in NAFLD patients.

### What do we know about micronutrients in critically ill patients? A narrative review [^112AAyXU]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Plasma concentrations in critically ill patients

Copper (Cu) deficiencies might be more frequent than previously thought among critically ill patients and represent a cause for delayed recovery. In an observational study including 100 patients transferred from the ICU to the ward, 21% had low levels of Cu despite appropriate complementation during the ICU stay. Cu levels should be measured according to the ESPEN recommendations in patients at risk, such as after bariatric surgery and in those with malabsorption, major burns, extensive Lyell syndrome, and prolonged CRRT for more than 2 weeks. Replacement solutions or dialysates typically do not contain Cu. A shorter CRRT (median, 2 days) does not cause a significant depletion.

In patients with COVID-19, elevated Cu levels have been observed, as expected in the presence of inflammation. Unfortunately, CRP and ceruloplasmin levels were not explored. Another study highlighted that patients with COVID-19 with increased serum Cu concentrations during the ICU stay had significantly lower mortality.

Cu accumulation in the liver has mainly been observed in chronic diseases such as intrahepatic cholestasis of childhood and in Wilson disease; it then manifests as liver cirrhosis and neurological signs. No deleterious effects have been observed with the Cu doses included in PN multitrace element products.

Clinical studies testing high doses

Clinical studies in ICU patients with Cu monotherapy have not been performed. Because of its role in immune function, some have postulated that Cu supplements might be beneficial during COVID-19.

### Neonatal erythroderma as a first manifestation of Menkes disease [^1121xU1x]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive lethal multisystemic disorder of copper metabolism. Progressive neurodegeneration, connective tissue disturbances, and peculiar kinky hair are the main manifestations. The low serum copper and ceruloplasmin suggest the diagnosis, which is confirmed by mutation analysis of the ATP7A gene. We report an exceptional presentation of classic Menkes disease with neonatal erythroderma. Genetic study revealed a deletion in exons 8 to 12 in the ATP7A gene. This study could allow pediatricians and pediatric dermatologists to diagnose the disorder as early as possible to establish prompt treatment with parenteral copper-histidine supplementation to improve prognosis.

### Key biomarkers in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review [^1179Kyh4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Ceruloplasmin is the major copper-carrying protein. It transports approximately 95% of the copper in the blood and exhibits ferroxidase activity, which catalyzes the oxidation of ferrous iron into ferric iron. This assists in the transportation of iron by transferrin in the bloodstream. Ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant, produced by hepatocytes when induced by cytokines released from activated monocytes and macrophages. The level of ceruloplasmin was significantly higher among T2DM patients compared to controls (1222.82 ± 306.15 IU/L vs. 868.38 ± 198.80 IU/L, p < 0.01).

Elevated ceruloplasmin levels have been reported as a marker of abnormally high oxidative stress in T2DM. Diabetic retinopathy, a common microvascular complication that can cause blindness, has been associated with high levels of ceruloplasmin in T2DM patients (p < 0.01). Increased ceruloplasmin blood levels (4.9 ± 1.3 mg/g) are also observed in other T2DM studies. IFN-γ and TNF-α are responsible for inducing ceruloplasmin synthesis by human myeloid cells.

Haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin and forms a high-affinity complex that is eliminated from circulation by the reticulocyte system, CD163-positive macrophages, and hepatocytes. The complex's removal time is approximately 20 minutes. Haptoglobin acts as a clearance protein and antioxidant, reducing the oxidative activity of heme iron. With its antioxidant properties, haptoglobin is involved in innate immune mechanisms, restricts the accessibility of iron to pathogens, and stimulates tissue repair in an inflammatory response.
