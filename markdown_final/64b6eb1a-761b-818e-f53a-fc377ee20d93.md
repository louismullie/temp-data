## Question

A 42-year-old man reports pelvic/perineal pain and urinary frequency for over 3 months. Urinalysis and urine cultures are negative, STI NAATs are negative, and he is afebrile. Digital rectal exam reveals a tender, boggy prostate. He is diagnosed with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a 42-year-old man diagnosed with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical diagnosis and mapping it to the NIH prostatitis categories. Then, I should verify the ICD-10-CM coding options and their definitions. Next, I will cross-check whether any subtypes or specifiers are required or optional. Finally, I will double-check for any coding pitfalls and confirm the most accurate, specific code to report.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis clinically. Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis corresponds to NIH Category III, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, defined by pelvic or perineal pain for at least 3 months with urinary symptoms and no evidence of bacterial infection, cancer, obstruction, or neurogenic bladder, which matches this presentation with negative urinalysis/culture and STI testing and a tender, boggy prostate on exam [^f95c76cf] [^0e3c8c2c].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10-CM category. I initially thought there might be a specific code like N41.3 for chronic non-bacterial prostatitis, but hold on, I should verify the actual ICD-10-CM structure. The correct ICD-10-CM code for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is N41.1, whereas N41.3 is not a valid code in ICD-10-CM for this entity, so I need to correct that assumption and use N41.1 [^notfound].

> I should confirm whether any subtyping is required. ICD-10-CM does not mandate further subdivision of N41.1 into inflammatory versus non-inflammatory subtypes, so I do not need to add a specifier for IIIA versus IIIB; I can simply report N41.1 for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, which aligns with standard billing practice for this diagnosis [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives. I briefly considered whether N41.9 (prostatitis, unspecified) could be used, but that would be less specific and less accurate here because the clinician has explicitly diagnosed chronic non-bacterial prostatitis, which maps to N41.1; using N41.9 would under-specify the condition and is not appropriate when a more specific code exists [^notfound].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is N41.1 [^notfound].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is **N41.1** (Chronic prostatitis). This code applies to chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) when there is no evidence of bacterial infection, as in this case with negative urinalysis, urine culture, and STI testing. Use **N41.1** for billing and documentation, and avoid N41.9 (prostatitis, unspecified) unless the etiology is truly unknown.

---

## Clinical classification of prostatitis

Prostatitis is classified by the **NIH** into four categories:

| **Category** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| I | Acute bacterial prostatitis |
| II | Chronic bacterial prostatitis |
| III | Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) |
| IV | Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis |

---

Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis corresponds to **NIH Category III (CP/CPPS)** — chronic pelvic or perineal pain with urinary symptoms, without bacterial infection or other identifiable causes [^f95c76cf].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for chronic non-bacterial prostatitis

The ICD-10-CM code for chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is **N41.1** (Chronic prostatitis). This code encompasses chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) when no bacterial infection is identified, as in this case with negative urinalysis, urine culture, and STI testing [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for using ICD-10-CM code N41.1

- **Specificity**: N41.1 specifically denotes chronic prostatitis, aligning with the clinical diagnosis of chronic non-bacterial prostatitis.
- **Exclusion of bacterial infection**: The case lacks evidence of bacterial infection, supporting the use of N41.1 rather than chronic bacterial prostatitis codes.
- **Clinical guidelines**: Major guidelines (AUA, EAU) recognize CP/CPPS as a distinct entity within chronic prostatitis, reinforcing the appropriateness of N41.1 [^f95c76cf] [^e6691154].

---

## Alternative ICD-10-CM codes and their appropriateness

- **N41.9 (Prostatitis, unspecified)**: Use only when the etiology is unknown or unspecified. It is less specific and should be avoided if chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is clearly diagnosed.
- **N41.0 (Acute prostatitis)**: Inappropriate here, as the presentation is chronic (> 3 months) and afebrile.
- **N41.2 (Abscess of prostate)**: Not applicable, as there is no evidence of prostatic abscess.

---

## Documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on thorough documentation. Ensure the following are recorded:

- **Duration of symptoms**: Document that symptoms have persisted for more than 3 months.
- **Negative microbiological tests**: Note negative urinalysis, urine culture, and STI testing.
- **Physical examination findings**: Record tender, boggy prostate on digital rectal examination.
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Document that other causes of pelvic pain and urinary symptoms have been excluded (e.g. cancer, urinary obstruction, neurogenic bladder) [^0e3c8c2c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate ICD-10-CM code for chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is **N41.1** (Chronic prostatitis). This code accurately reflects the clinical diagnosis of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) in the absence of bacterial infection. Use N41.1 for billing and documentation, and avoid N41.9 unless the etiology is unspecified.

### Prostatitis revisited: new definitions, new approaches [^17146ea6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Prostatitis syndromes represent an important health care problem resulting in considerable morbidity and expenditure of health care resources. Comparison of the traditional and consensus classification schemes demonstrates no changes in the traditional categories of acute bacterial prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Examining only the EPS, however, results in diagnosis of half of the patients with inflammatory CP/CPPS. An optimal diagnostic strategy required evaluation of the VB3 and SFA in addition to the traditional EPS examination. Such precision is necessary for research studies, but whether such precision is important clinically remains unproved. The new interest in optimal evaluation and characterization of patients with chronic prostatitis and related conditions has resulted in important research initiatives examining the etiology and optimal treatment for this large group of patients.

### Excessive antibiotic use in men with prostatitis [^68902620]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Prostatitis accounts for 2 million outpatient visits annually. The majority of prostatitis cases fit the definition of chronic pelvic pain syndrome, for which routine antibiotic use is not indicated.

Methods

Inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy datasets from the Veterans Health Administration were used to quantify the magnitude of antibiotic use attributable to chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Specifically, men with a diagnosis of infectious/acute prostatitis or a urinary tract infection were excluded, and the remaining men with a diagnosis of prostatitis were defined as having chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Results

The annual prevalence of chronic pelvic pain syndrome was 0.5%. Prescriptions for fluoroquinolone antibiotics were filled in 49% of men with a diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain syndrome compared with 5% in men without chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome were more than 7 times more likely to receive a fluoroquinolone prescription independently of age, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. Increased use of other antibiotics also was observed. High use was similar in men with either infectious/acute prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Conclusion

Despite evidence that antibiotics are not effective in the majority of men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome, they were prescribed in 69% of men with this diagnosis. Some increased use is probably due to uncontrolled confounding by comorbid conditions or inaccurate diagnostic coding. However, a 7-fold higher rate of fluoroquinolone usage suggests that strategies to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in men with prostatitis are warranted.

### Acute and chronic prostatitis [^d5a937a1]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostatitis is a common clinical syndrome classified into four categories: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic. Bacterial prostatitis (acute and chronic) is primarily diagnosed with history and microbiologic studies, although physical examination can be helpful to localize infection within the genitourinary system. Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics; the span of treatment is guided by the duration of symptoms and presence of complications. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is the most common form of prostatitis and is a diagnosis of exclusion with no standardized treatments. Asymptomatic prostatitis does not require treatment and is usually diagnosed incidentally during the workup for other urologic presentations.

### Classification (traditional and National Institutes of Health) and demographics of prostatitis [^cd6ef2a0]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

This article reviews the National Institutes of Health (NIH) classification system for prostatitis and summarizes the baseline analysis of the Chronic Prostatitis Cohort Study, a longitudinal study, which has enrolled 488 patients diagnosed with category III prostatitis. The prevalence of category IIIA in this cohort was 54% to 90%, depending on the cut points used. In all, 8% (37 of 488) had ≥ 1 localizing uropathogen. However, leukocyte and bacterial counts did not correlate with severity of symptoms as assessed by the NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index. Continued follow-up study of this cohort will likely answer important questions about the natural and treated history of this syndrome.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Prostatitis [^e9b2d46c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is a common condition that accounts for a significant number of visits to both the emergency department and the urologist. The precise pathogenic mechanism of prostatitis is not known. The most prevalent theory is that reflux of urine from the urethra into the intraprostatic ducts promotes ascending infection and leads to chemical or bacterial prostatitis. Treatment is challenging because many antimicrobial agents do not effectively diffuse into prostatic tissue and many cases of prostatitis are not found to have an infectious etiology. Prostatitis can be divided into different classifications which range from acute severe infections, to chronic indolent infections, to chronic pain syndromes. The differentiation and management of these entities can be difficult. This article seeks to clarify the different infections, and provide a rational approach to treatment and disposition of these patients.

### Common questions about chronic prostatitis [^16190e59]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic prostatitis is relatively common, with a lifetime prevalence of 1.8% to 8.2%. Risk factors include conditions that facilitate introduction of bacteria into the urethra and prostate (which also predispose the patient to urinary tract infections) and conditions that can lead to chronic neuropathic pain. Chronic prostatitis must be differentiated from other causes of chronic pelvic pain, such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and pelvic floor dysfunction; prostate and bladder cancers; benign prostatic hyperplasia; urolithiasis; and other causes of dysuria, urinary frequency, and nocturia. The National Institutes of Health divides prostatitis into four syndromes: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP), chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (CNP)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. CBP and CNP/CPPS both lead to pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. CBP presents as recurrent urinary tract infections with the same organism identified on repeated cultures; it responds to a prolonged course of an antibiotic that adequately penetrates the prostate, if the urine culture suggests sensitivity. If four to six weeks of antibiotic therapy is effective but symptoms recur, another course may be prescribed, perhaps in combination with alpha blockers or nonopioid analgesics. CNP/CPPS, accounting for more than 90% of chronic prostatitis cases, presents as prostatic pain lasting at least three months without consistent culture results. Weak evidence supports the use of alpha blockers, pain medications, and a four- to six-week course of antibiotics for the treatment of CNP/CPPS. Patients may also be referred to a psychologist experienced in managing chronic pain. Experts on this condition recommend a combination of treatments tailored to the patient's phenotypic presentation. Urology referral should be considered when appropriate treatment is ineffective. Additional treatments include pelvic floor physical therapy, phytotherapy, and pain management techniques. The UPOINT (urinary, psychosocial, organ-specific, infection, neurologic/systemic, tenderness) approach summarizes the various factors that may contribute to presentation and can guide treatment.

### Overview summary statement. diagnosis and management of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP / CPPS) [^66ae345f]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Members of the Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network (CPCRN) met in a 1-day symposium to review recent findings and to debate unanswered issues in the diagnosis and management of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). The meeting was focused on producing an overview summary statement that would, as nearly as possible, represent the consensus views of the attendees. As discussed below, the participants agreed that a history, physical examination, and urinalysis/urine culture are mandatory for the evaluation of all patients presenting with CP/CPPS, with other assessments categorized as recommended or optional, depending on the history and physical findings. Observations and suggestions regarding first- and second-line therapies are also offered, with the recognition that randomized, placebo-controlled trials to guide selection of therapies for chronic nonbacterial prostatitis are currently lacking.

### Etiology and management of chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men [^5b6d1c8b]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Prostatitis results in > 2 million physician office visits annually. Characterized by pelvic pain and voiding symptoms, chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is poorly defined. The Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network (CPCRN) has put forward a uniform set of classifications for chronic prostatitis based on pain being the primary symptom. The CPCRN has also created a valid instrument for measuring symptoms: the Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index. After nonbacterial prostatitis has been diagnosed, treatment of patients should be individualized. The condition may be caused by bladder, prostate, pelvic side wall, or seminal vesicle pathology. In addition to currently used treatments, several new therapies are being investigated after promising pilot studies. Despite the multiple approaches to management of CPPS, no hard and fast guidelines have been developed. This review provides an overview of assessment techniques and management options for men with CPPS.

### Incidence and clinical characteristics of National Institutes of Health type III prostatitis in the community [^7c769bbf]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Few population-based epidemiological studies of prostatitis have been performed. We used coded physician diagnoses and subsequent chart reviews to estimate the incidence and clinical characteristics of physician diagnosed National Institutes of Health (NIH) type III prostatitis.

Materials and Methods

Computer searches of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Portland, Oregon) database were performed on the 2-year interval May 2002 to May 2004 to identify new diagnoses of chronic prostatitis (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code 601.1) and prostatitis not otherwise specified (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code 601.9). Of the 1,223 men identified with these coded diagnoses, chart reviews were performed on a random subset of 413 (33.8%). Patients were categorized based on NIH prostatitis definitions of type I/II-evidence of pyuria and/or bacteriuria on urinalysis or culture, type III-presence of at least 1 of the pain or urinary symptoms in the NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (pain in the perineum, testicles, tip of penis, pubic or bladder area, dysuria, ejaculatory pain, incomplete emptying, urinary frequency), type IV-inflammation on prostate biopsy and Other-symptoms other than those listed.

Results

Of the 413 patients 57 were previously diagnosed with prostatitis (prevalent cases), 46 had no evidence of a prostatitis diagnosis in the medical record and 7 were treated by physicians outside of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest plan. Of the remaining 303 the distribution was 58 type I/II, 189 type III, 33 type IV and 23 Other. The incidence of physician diagnosed type III prostatitis was 3.3 per 1,000 person-years. If those with isolated urinary symptoms were excluded from analysis, the incidence decreased to 2.8 per 1,000 person-years. The mean age of those with type III prostatitis was 52.9 years (range 29 to 82). The most common presenting symptoms were dysuria, urinary frequency and perineal pain. Symptom duration at presentation was less than 3 months in 44%, 3 months or greater in 31% and unspecified in 25%. The majority (78%) of new prostatitis diagnoses was made by primary care physicians.

Conclusions

These data indicate that prostatitis is commonly diagnosed in the community setting, and that type III prostatitis accounts for the majority of these diagnoses. The duration and complexity of symptoms are less than those reported in established prostatitis research cohorts. Most prostatitis diagnoses in the community are made by nonurologists.

### Prostatitis: a review… [^0e3c8c2c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute UTI specifically infecting prostate Persistent bacterial infection of prostate from same bacterial strain, causing recurrent UTIs Pelvic pain without evidence of infection, cancer, urinary obstruction/retention, neurogenic bladder Abrupt urinary symptoms Fever/chills, malaise. UCx: bacterial growth, often gram negative DRE: prostatic tenderness/edema Identifying persistent bacteria with similar or identical sensitivities on a urine culture compared with prior urine cultures 4- or 2-glass test No definitive diagnostic test available Exclude treatable alternative conditions with pathologies with history and physical examination, UCx, and PVR. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain.

Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index measures symptom severity, with a 6-point change considered clinically meaningful. First-line oral therapy for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms is α-blockers.

Prostatitis, defined as infection, inflammation, or pain in the prostate, affects approximately 9. 3% of men in their lifetime. 1 The National Institutes of Health has defined categories of prostatitis as follows: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. 2 The first 3 categories of prostatitis are characterized by pelvic pain and urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency and weak urinary stream, but each condition is diagnosed and treated differently. Epididymo-orchitis presents with testicular enlargement, induration, and tenderness. A gentle digital rectal examination reveals prostatic edema and tenderness in 77% to 90% of men with acute bacterial prostatitis, 3, 4 which distinguishes acute prostatitis from a UTI without prostatitis.

Unlike cystitis or STIs, acute bacterial prostatitis is typically associated with fever and chills and malaise. If sepsis is present, flank pain and costovertebral tenderness suggest pyelonephritis over prostatitis. For men with acute bacterial prostatitis and urinary retention due to an inflamed, edematous prostate obstructing the urethra, a urinary catheter is indicated to relieve retention-related discomfort and drain infected urine. Chronic prostatitis is composed of chronic bacterial prostatitis and CP/CPPS. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate despite antibiotic therapy, whereas CP/CPPS is characterized by chronic pelvic pain diagnosed after causes of other symptoms are excluded, such as cancer, UTI, urinary obstruction, or neurogenic bladder. Chronic bacterial prostatitis composes 4% to 10% of chronic prostatitis diagnoses.

### Urogenital cancer… [^302f54d8]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Early genitourinary symptoms or problems in men may not be brought to the family physician's attention unless direct questions are asked to assess sexual and urinary function. Common genitourinary health issues in men include prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urogenital cancer, premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction. Screening questions directed at identifying these health problems should be included in the comprehensive health evaluation. Prostatitis Prostatitis has traditionally been divided into four clinical categories: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, non-bacterial prostatitis and prostatodynia. Only 5 to 10 percent of prostatitis cases have a bacterial etiology.

1. ACUTE BACTERIAL PROSTATITIS Acute bacterial prostatitis typically presents as an acute febrile illness accompanied by rectal, perineal or lower back pain. Patients may also have chills, myalgias, arthralgias, dysuria and irritative urinary symptoms.

An enlarged, warm, tender prostate might be noted on digital rectal examination. Escherichia coli is identified as the causative organism in 80 percent of cases. 1 Acute bacterial prostatitis can also be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Serratia, Klebsiella and Proteus species, and other enteric organisms. Depending on the severity of the infection, patients with acute bacterial prostatitis may need to be hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy can be used in patients with less severe illness. Effective agents include the fluoroquinolones, ampicillin, doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

CHRONIC BACTERIAL PROSTATITIS Chronic bacterial prostatitis is caused by the same organisms as acute bacterial prostatitis. It occurs more frequently in older men and is described as a relapsing disease with acute exacerbations. In the absence of symptoms, chronic bacterial prostatitis is sometimes discovered by the presence of bacteriuria. Typically, the condition is detected on the basis of recurring urinary tract infections, dysuria, urinary urgency and hesitancy, or suprapubic, perineal, rectal and low back pain. Fever is typically absent. In the physical examination, a normal prostate is usually found, although the gland can sometimes be boggy and tender. The ultimate diagnosis is based on the patient's symptoms and, subsequent to prostatic massage, examination of prostatic secretions for white blood cells. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is difficult to treat because of the poor penetration of antibiotics into an uninflamed prostate.

The fluoroquinolones can be effective, with cephalexin, doxycycline and carbenicillin as good alternatives. Treatment duration is debatable, but symptoms often improve after three months of therapy. Reported treatment success rates have varied from 30 to 100 percent.

1. NONBACTERIAL PROSTATITIS AND PROSTATODYNIA Nonbacterial prostatitis and prostatodynia are eight times more common than acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. 1 Nonbacterial prostatitis is described as pain and inflammation of the prostate with no apparent causative organism. Secretions elicited by prostatic massage reveal numerous white blood cells, but cultures are negative. Although organisms such as. Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Trichomonas vaginalis have been postulated as etiologies, conclusive evidence is lacking.

### Prevalence of and risk factors for prostatitis: population based assessment using physician assigned diagnoses [^dd8dabd0]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous studies to assess risk factors for prostatitis used patient self-reported data and, therefore, they were subject to recall bias. We 1) used coded physician diagnoses to calculate the prevalence of prostatitis and 2) compared these patients with matched controls to identify medical conditions that are associated with prostatitis. Subjects were male enrollees in the Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon health maintenance organization.

Materials and Methods

A computer search of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest administrative database was performed for May 1, 1998 to April 30, 2004 to identify men with a coded diagnosis of prostatitis. Prostatitis cases were each age matched with 3 controls and the medical diagnoses (using 3-digit International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes) assigned to these 2 groups were compared.

Results

A prostatitis diagnosis was present in 4.5% of the male population. There were 37 diagnoses that were significantly more common in cases than in controls (p < 0.0001). Most of them were other urological codes to describe prostatitis symptoms, unexplained physical symptoms in other organ systems and psychiatric diagnoses. The strongest observed associations were with benign prostatic hyperplasia (OR 2.7), functional digestive disorders (OR 2.6), dyspepsia (OR 2.1), anxiety disorders (OR 2.0), other soft tissue disorders (OR 2.0), esophageal reflux (OR 1.8) and mood disorders (OR 1.8).

Conclusions

Prostatitis is a commonly diagnosed condition in the community setting, affecting approximately 1/22 men. The diagnosis is associated with multiple other unexplained physical symptoms and certain psychiatric conditions. Studies to explore possible biological explanations for these associations are needed.

To describe practice patterns of primary care physicians (PCPs) for the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), we surveyed 556 PCPs in Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles (RR = 52%). Only 62% reported ever seeing a patient like the one described in the vignette. In all, 16% were 'not at all' familiar with CP/CPPS, and 48% were 'not at all' familiar with the National Institutes of Health classification scheme. PCPs reported practice patterns regarding CP/CPPS, which are not supported by evidence. Although studies suggest that CP/CPPS is common, many PCPs reported little or no familiarity, important knowledge deficits and limited experience in managing men with this syndrome.

We review the epidemiology of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and the role of infectious agents, emphasizing critical data necessary to define current research issues. The epidemiologic literature is limited, but the worldwide prevalence appears to be in the range of 2% to 10%, indicating that CP/CPPS represents an important international health problem. Recent molecular studies have documented bacterial DNA sequences in prostate tissue from CP/CPPS patients. These data suggest that colonization and/or infection occurs in the prostates of many patients with CP/CPPS. Further molecular research is needed to define the role of bacteria in the etiology of CP/CPPS.

### Understanding chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^b9adb8d9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with non-inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome, the largest group of prostatitis patients according to the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases classification, are characterized by the absence of objective findings. Nothing thus links the symptoms of this disease to the prostate or other male organs in particular. For this reason, observations on interstitial cystitis in women are of interest to understand the chronic pelvic pain syndrome. New information from studies on the inflammatory response in expressed prostatic secretion in patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome and in bladder tissue from patients with interstitial cystitis indicates that complex systems on the cytokine gene expression level may be operating in these diseases. Research findings point to a common denominator at the level of molecular biology that might explain how the symptoms of chronic pelvic pain syndrome and interstitial cystitis can be precipitated by pathogens, inflammatory reactions and even neurological mechanisms. The initial clinical trial reports of drugs that modulate the inflammatory response in interstitial cystitis are met with great interest.

### The etiology and management of acute prostatitis [^2776ed6d]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial prostatitis is a common and clinically important genitourinary disorder. Patient populations who are at especially high risk of acute prostatitis include those with diabetes, cirrhosis, and suppressed immune systems. The cause is usually an ascending infection, but bacteria can also be introduced during transrectal prostate biopsy. Clinical presentation ranges from mild lower urinary tract symptoms to full sepsis. The causative organisms are usually similar to those that cause other common genitourinary infections, and include Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. Oral or intravenous antibiotics are usually effective for curing the infection and progression to chronic bacterial prostatitis is, therefore, uncommon. Immunosuppressed patients require special consideration, as bacterial prostatitis in these patients can be caused by atypical infecting organisms and might, therefore, require additional therapies. A lack of response to standard therapy can lead to complications such as a prostatic abscess or fistula.

### Prostatitis: a review [^61c1eab4]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prostatitis is defined as infection, inflammation, or pain of the prostate gland and affects approximately 9.3% of men in their lifetime.

Observations

Acute bacterial prostatitis consists of a urinary tract infection (UTI) that includes infection of the prostate, typically associated with fever or chills and caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas, in 80% to 97% of cases. First-line therapy for acute prostatitis is broad-spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics, such as intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or oral ciprofloxacin, which has a 92% to 97% success rate when prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks for people with febrile UTI and acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain. Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) measures symptom severity (scale of 0–43), with a 6-point change considered clinically meaningful. First-line oral therapy for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms is α-blockers (eg, tamsulosin, alfuzosin; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference vs placebo = -10.8 to -4.8). Other oral therapies are associated with modest changes in NIH-CPSI score compared with placebo, including anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.5 to -1.7), pregabalin (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.4), and pollen extract (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.49).

Conclusions and Relevance

Prostatitis includes acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and CP/CPPS, each of which is diagnosed and treated differently. First-line treatments are broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute bacterial prostatitis (such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin), at least 4 weeks of fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis, and α-blockers for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome:

- **Definition**: CP/CPPS, also known as primary prostate pain syndrome, is characterized by persistent or recurrent pain in the prostate or perineal area for ≥ 3 of previous 6 months without evidence of UTI.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of this syndrome is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve dysregulation of neurotransmitters and inflammation. Abnormalities in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and/or abnormal levels of extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations have been implicated in the neuronal foundations of pain disorders. Inflammation, either with the presence of white cells in the prostatic secretions or without, may also play a role.
- **Epidemiology**: The global prevalence of CP/CPPS is estimated at 2–10%, and is reported to constitute about 14% of male urological outpatients visits.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for CP/CPPS include age, stress, and a history of prostate infections.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with CP/CPPS typically present with pain in the pelvic area but may also include the perineum, rectum, prostate, penis, testicles, and abdomen. They may also experience urinary symptoms, such as urgency, frequency, hesitancy, and poor or interrupted flow. Pain during ejaculation is also a common symptom.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CP/CPPS can significantly impact the patient's QoL, leading to negative cognitive, behavioral, sexual, or emotional outcomes.

### Low quality of life in men with chronic prostatitis-like symptoms [^60809d71]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Considering that more than 5% of the total adult male population may have CP, and that its impact on QOL appears to be substantial, CP imposes a serious health burden at the societal level. In relatively young, working-age men, CP's largest effect on QOL is to impair their mental health and their role functioning. That is, CP lowers their productivity, which is to say that in addition to individual effects on individual patients CP also has a substantial economic impact on society. This emphasizes the need to focus not only on patients in whom CP has already been diagnosed but also on men in whom CP is suspected, and particularly on younger men.

More than half of the participants with CPS were under 60 years old, and the largest gap between the prevalence of DCP and that of CPS was among men in their 30 s (Fig. 1). That is, CP seems to be seriously underdiagnosed in young men. There are several possible reasons for this finding: One is that these younger men may simply be too busy with full-time work to seek medical attention. As expected from the age distributions, full-time employment was more common among participants with CPS than among those with DCP (Table 1). Another possible explanation is that CP is not well known, especially among young people, so they may be less likely to know that they might benefit from medical attention. Furthermore, even those who do seek medical attention may not receive the correct diagnosis if they go to a clinic that does not specialize in urology. Even consulting a urologist might not be enough. Liu et al. stated that urologists themselves may be confused and frustrated when treating patients who have CP. Their difficulties interpreting their patients' complaints can lead to a lack of confidence in their diagnoses and treatments. To overcome this situation, it is necessary to develop screening tools for CP in the general population, and then to provide referrals for consultation to men who test positive and thus are likely to have undiagnosed CP. Additionally, we believe that there is an urgent need to develop better tools to assist in diagnosing CP in primary care and in urology clinics. Such tools might incorporate quantitative prediction rules that use information both from patients and from physicians. This study has several limitations. First, the sample was not drawn at random. However, even with random sampling, the influence of non-respondents cannot be excluded, as the participation rate in previous studies was about 30%. We believe that the method employed in this study to allocate the number of respondents by age group and by geographic information resulted in a sample that is reasonably representative. Second, there may be misclassification of DCP because this study uses only self-reported information from the participants. It is possible that patients with a diagnosis of a similar disease, such as acute prostatitis, answered that they had received a CP diagnosis. Furthermore, since this study is based on a questionnaire survey, we cannot be sure of the accuracy of the CP diagnosis at each clinic. Third, there may also be misclassification due to the use of Nickel's criteria for CPS. It is possible that those assigned to the CPS group were in fact affected by other diseases with similar symptoms. Specifically, some participants were at a relatively high risk for BPH because of their age, and thus the CPS group may have included men with BPH as well as men with undiagnosed CP. However, Nickel's criteria provide the only tool that can be used in epidemiological studies, and they have been used in several previous studies. Also, the results of the two sensitivity analyses indicate that assignment to the CPS group in this study was robust to the use of definitions of CPS other than Nickel's criteria.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data sources

This study used the 1996–2008 reimbursement claims submitted to the National Health Insurance programme, a universal insurance system established by the Bureau of National Health Insurance of the Department of Health in Taiwan. This insurance programme has covered > 99% of the population since 1999. The data set consisted of claims from 1 000 000 people randomly selected from a total of 23 million insured individuals based on the year 2000 population. In these claims, information on socio-demographic status was available, in addition to health care visits of in-patients and out-patients, from 1996 to 2008. The electronic data files were obtained from the National Health Research Institutes. The identification numbers of all the patients were scrambled to ensure patient confidentiality. This study was, therefore, exempted from full institutional review. We used the International Codes of Diseases 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to identify diseases.

Study subjects

We identified men aged 50 years and above with primary prostate cancer (ICD-9-CM 185 or A-code A124) diagnosed during the period of 1997–2008 as the sample population. For each prostate cancer patient, four controls comprising cancer-free men at the age of 50 and above were randomly selected from the same data set within the same time period. The age of a study subject was defined according to the date when the patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer or when the control was selected. To explore the potential comorbidities associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, we screened the medical history to search for comorbidities that existed before the identification of the study subjects. Metabolism syndrome and infection have been previously studied as risk factors associated with prostate cancer. Comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM 250 or A-code A181), hypertension (ICD-9-CM 401–405 or A-code A260, A269), hyperlipidemia (ICD-9-CM 272 or A-code A182), prostatitis (ICD-9-CM 601.X), testitis and epididymitis (604.X), gonorrhoea and chlamydia infection (ICD-9-CM 098.X, 099.X), BPH (ICD-9-CM 600 or A-code A360), and obesity (ICD-9-CM 278.00, 278.01 or A-code A183) were included as covariates in this study.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis: two different sub-categories according to a previous manipulation of the lower urinary tract [^f9be0206]. World Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bacterial prostatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bacterial prostatitis is an uncommon infection of the prostate gland due to bacteria, usually with severe presentation.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute bacterial prostatitis is an infection of the prostate gland, typically caused by common urinary tract pathogens. The bacteria usually enter the prostate from the urethra, triggering an inflammatory response within the gland. This inflammation can lead to swelling and discomfort in the prostate and surrounding areas.
- **Epidemiology**: Acute bacterial prostatitis constitutes nearly 10% of prostatitis diagnoses, predominantly affecting individuals aged 20–40 and those > 70 years.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute bacterial prostatitis often present with a range of symptoms. These can include fever, chills, and malaise, as well as urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. Some patients may also experience pelvic or perineal pain, and in severe cases, there may be blood in the urine. In some instances, patients may present with symptoms of urosepsis, such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute bacterial prostatitis is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves antibiotics.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^03b7b179]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Epidemiology and associated conditions in CP/CPPS — Across studies, the prevalence of prostatitis-like symptoms ranged from 2.2% to 16%, with a median prevalence approximating 7.1% for CP/CPPS, and mean prevalence by continent ranged from 7.5% in Asia to 12.2% in Africa; the RICE study estimated that 1.8% of men (2 million) in the United States may have prostatitis-like symptoms. Etiology remains uncertain: the etiology of CP/CPPS is unknown and CP/CPPS is not due to an ongoing infection; no clear organism has been identified, although MAPP Network data identified overrepresentation of B. cenocepacia, and NIH-sponsored CPCRN findings indicate asymptomatic men have as many bacteria on culture of EPS, semen, and the four components of the traditional Meares Stamey 4 glass test as symptomatic men. In the NIH CPCRN study, men with CP/CPPS were found to be six times more likely to have cardiovascular disease (most commonly hypertension), the average age in this cohort was 42.2 years, and they were five times more likely to have neurologic disease (most commonly vertebral disc disease).

### A review of the development and validation of the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptom index [^2c901080]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) causes morbidity, both through symptoms and associated impairment in health-related quality of life, both of which illustrate the importance of patient-centered outcomes. Despite preliminary work by several investigators, research and clinical efforts to provide help for men afflicted with CPPS have been hampered by the absence of a widely accepted, reliable, and valid instrument to measure symptoms and quality-of-life impact. Investigators from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network (CPCRN) sought to remedy this problem by developing a psychometrically valid index of symptoms and quality-of-life impact in men with chronic prostatitis. This instrument, now validated in English, Spanish, German, and Korean, is known as the NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). It contains 13 items that are scored in 3 discrete domains: pain, urinary symptoms, and quality-of-life impact. In early studies, the NIH-CPSI has been shown to be reliable, valid, and responsive to change. Further work is needed to determine whether it performs as well in minority populations, men seeking care in nonreferral centers, and other diverse populations.
