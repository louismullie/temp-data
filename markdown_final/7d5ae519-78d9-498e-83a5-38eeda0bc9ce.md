## Question

Uveitis in diarrheal illness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how uveitis relates to diarrheal illness, including mechanisms, etiologies, diagnostic approach, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining uveitis and its major etiologic buckets. Then, I should categorize diarrheal illnesses and their postinfectious and systemic associations. Next, I will examine immune-mediated links between the gut and eye, followed by infectious and postinfectious uveitis patterns. After that, I should review IBD-specific data and risk factors, outline a diagnostic algorithm, and finally synthesize management principles and a practical clinical takeaway, making sure I verify each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct of uveitis and its etiologic categories. Uveitis is intraocular inflammation classified by anatomic location (anterior, intermediate, posterior, panuveitis) and by etiology into infectious, autoimmune/autoinflammatory, traumatic, and idiopathic groups; in many Western cohorts, a substantial proportion remains idiopathic at presentation, though careful re-evaluation identifies systemic associations in a meaningful minority, so I should avoid prematurely labeling cases as idiopathic without targeted workup [^115DEe63] [^112Po2q3] [^116pu3h6].

> Next, I should review diarrheal illnesses and their spectrum. Acute diarrheal diseases include bacterial, viral, and parasitic etiologies, and guidelines emphasize that most cases are self-limited. However, certain pathogens carry postinfectious complications, including reactive arthritis and ocular inflammation, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion for immune-mediated sequelae after enteric infection [^116RVwBx] [^112nS66C].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the immune-mediated pathways linking gut and eye. Molecular mimicry, dysbiosis-driven imbalance of regulatory versus effector T cells, increased intestinal permeability, and loss of tolerogenic metabolites are plausible mechanisms by which gut inflammation could trigger ocular autoimmunity. Dysbiosis has been associated with uveitis in observational and experimental contexts, but causality remains incompletely established, so I need to frame this as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^117CB7ko] [^113VgGr5].

> I will now examine infectious uveitis directly linked to enteric pathogens. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for specific organisms. Ebola virus disease survivors have a well-documented postconvalescent uveitis syndrome with anterior uveitis most common and posterior involvement also reported; risk correlates with higher acute viral load and conjunctival injection, and ocular persistence in immune-privileged sites is described, supporting a direct or immune-mediated pathogenesis rather than mere coincidence [^1117PMLn]. Enteroviruses can present with conjunctivitis and, in some cases, evolve to anterior uveitis, indicating that systemic viral infections with GI symptoms may occasionally seed ocular inflammation; I should confirm that systemic symptoms including diarrhea are recognized in enteroviral disease, which they are [^113pzTuo]. Microsporidia, particularly Encephalitozoon species, cause GI disease and keratoconjunctivitis or superficial ocular disease, and disseminated cases can involve deeper ocular structures; I need to remember that ocular involvement is species-dependent and more likely in immunocompromised hosts, though not exclusively so [^114Xyai3] [^116VP4YV]. Finally, Tropheryma whipplei can cause both GI malabsorption/diarrhea and uveitis, and intra-familial transmission has been described, so in the right clinical context I should actively consider it in the differential [^1153UMSm].

> Let me consider postinfectious immune-mediated uveitis, especially reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis follows enteric infection with organisms such as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia, typically 1–3 weeks later, and may include uveitis as part of the syndrome; ocular involvement can be unilateral or bilateral and ranges from anterior to posterior segment disease, so I should ask about recent diarrheal illness and joint symptoms in any new uveitis case [^111YhHM6] [^116RVwBx]. But wait, what if the patient has IBD masquerading as postinfectious disease? Uveitis in IBD is a recognized extraintestinal manifestation, more common in Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis, and can precede or be independent of bowel symptoms; large cohort data show approximately 11% prevalence in Crohn's and 5–6% in UC, with a female predominance and association with more severe disease, so I should screen for GI symptoms and family history even when bowel disease is not yet diagnosed [^113NtXsr] [^115rZrdV] [^1111H4zb]. Case series and reports illustrate that uveitis can be the initial presentation of IBD, including panuveitis with retinal vasculitis, underscoring the need for endoscopic evaluation when clinical suspicion is high [^112qz7nm] [^111pSsri].

> Next, I should review risk factors and clinical patterns to refine pretest probabilities. Female sex, Crohn's disease phenotype, longer disease duration, and a positive family history of IBD increase the likelihood of uveitis. Importantly, uveitis activity does not always track with intestinal disease activity, so quiescent IBD does not exclude ocular inflammation, and conversely, ocular symptoms may herald undiagnosed IBD. Pediatric IBD cohorts show that uveitis can precede, accompany, or follow IBD diagnosis, reinforcing the need for proactive screening in high-risk groups [^115rZrdV] [^113NtXsr] [^112F1rsr].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is structured and avoids unnecessary testing. A careful history should document timing of diarrheal illness, travel, sexual exposures, arthritis, mucocutaneous lesions, oral/genital ulcers, and family history. The ocular exam should classify anatomic location and inflammatory activity using SUN criteria. Targeted labs should be guided by clues, with infectious uveitis workup including syphilis serology, chest imaging for sarcoidosis, and, when indicated, aqueous or vitreous sampling for molecular testing to confirm infectious etiologies such as HSV, VZV, CMV, Toxoplasma, TB, or Treponema. I should double-check that IDSA/ASM endorse anterior chamber or vitreous sampling for definitive infectious diagnosis in select cases, which they do [^116pu3h6] [^114PBFG2]. If IBD is suspected, fecal calprotectin may support intestinal inflammation, and endoscopy with biopsy can secure the diagnosis. In parallel, I should remember that immune-mediated uveitis is common enough that a negative infectious workup should pivot management toward anti-inflammatory strategies rather than prolonged empiric antimicrobials [^1111H4zb] [^115DEe63].

> Now, management principles require careful alignment with etiology. For infectious uveitis, pathogen-directed therapy is essential. For example, CMV retinitis requires anti-CMV therapy and HIV management, with attention to immune recovery uveitis risk during immune reconstitution, which may necessitate periocular or systemic corticosteroids. For microsporidiosis, albendazole or fumagillin may be indicated depending on species and host status. For suspected toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis, anti-parasitic therapy is standard. And for Ebola-associated uveitis, management is largely supportive with corticosteroids and close monitoring given the risk of vision-threatening inflammation [^1117PMLn] [^115bq8dE] [^1175xroA]. For noninfectious uveitis, topical corticosteroids are first-line for anterior disease, with mydriatic/cycloplegic agents for pain and synechia prevention. Systemic or periocular steroids are used for posterior disease or refractory cases, and steroid-sparing immunomodulators or biologics, particularly anti-TNF agents, are indicated for recurrent or sight-threatening inflammation. I should confirm that guidelines support anti-TNF therapy for refractory noninfectious uveitis, which they do, albeit with variable strength of evidence across subtypes [^115DEe63] [^114Vptzr]. Hold on, I should verify ocular safety considerations with systemic steroids. Yes, prolonged systemic steroids carry risks of cataract and glaucoma, and ocular surface disease may complicate management, so ophthalmic co-management is prudent [^115hWeRm].

> Let me synthesize the clinical takeaway and ensure it matches the evidence. Uveitis in the setting of diarrheal illness most commonly reflects either direct ocular infection by enteric pathogens, postinfectious immune-mediated disease such as reactive arthritis, or an underlying systemic inflammatory disorder like IBD or Behçet's disease; a structured history, careful ocular classification, and targeted testing for infection and systemic disease are key, and management must be etiology-specific, with early involvement of ophthalmology and, when IBD is suspected, gastroenterology to optimize outcomes and prevent vision loss [^115DEe63] [^112as893] [^1111H4zb].

Uveitis can occur in diarrheal illness through **immune-mediated mechanisms** (molecular mimicry, dysbiosis, translocation) [^117CB7ko] and direct infection [^114PBFG2]. The most common associations are with **IBD** (especially Crohn's) [^113NtXsr], **reactive arthritis** (post-infectious) [^111YhHM6], and infectious agents such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Shigella, and Tropheryma whipplei [^116RVwBx]. Uveitis may present as anterior, posterior, or panuveitis, and can precede or follow gastrointestinal symptoms [^112F1rsr]. Management requires **prompt ophthalmology referral** [^1111jDiQ], topical/systemic corticosteroids, and treatment of the underlying diarrheal cause; prognosis depends on severity and timeliness of care [^1111jDiQ].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking uveitis and diarrheal illness

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain the association between uveitis and diarrheal illness:

- **Immune-mediated inflammation**: Molecular mimicry and cross-reactivity between intestinal and ocular antigens can trigger autoimmune responses, leading to uveitis [^117CB7ko].

- **Microbial translocation**: Increased intestinal permeability during diarrheal illness allows bacterial products to enter systemic circulation, provoking ocular inflammation [^notfound].

- **Direct infection**: Certain pathogens can directly infect ocular tissues, causing infectious uveitis [^114PBFG2].

---

## Infectious agents associated with uveitis in diarrheal illness

Several **infectious agents** have been implicated in the development of uveitis in the context of diarrheal illness:

| **Pathogen** | **Associated diarrheal illness** | **Uveitis manifestation** |
|-|-|-|
| Salmonella spp. | Gastroenteritis, enteric fever | Reactive arthritis with uveitis [^116RVwBx] |
| Campylobacter jejuni | Gastroenteritis | Reactive arthritis with uveitis [^116RVwBx] |
| Yersinia enterocolitica | Gastroenteritis | Reactive arthritis with uveitis [^116RVwBx] |
| Shigella spp. | Dysentery | Reactive arthritis with uveitis [^116RVwBx] |
| Tropheryma whipplei | Whipple's disease | Chronic uveitis, retinitis [^1153UMSm] |
| Microsporidia spp. | Chronic diarrhea, especially in immunocompromised | Keratoconjunctivitis, uveitis [^114Xyai3] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic features

Uveitis associated with diarrheal illness presents with characteristic **clinical features**:

- **Anterior uveitis**: Pain, redness, photophobia, blurred vision, and conjunctival injection [^1111jDiQ].

- **Posterior uveitis**: Floaters, blurred vision, and visual field defects [^1121GcFt].

- **Panuveitis**: Involvement of all uveal layers, often associated with severe systemic symptoms [^notfound].

Diagnostic evaluation includes a thorough ophthalmic examination, **slit-lamp biomicroscopy**, and **dilated fundus examination**. Laboratory tests may include stool cultures, serological tests, and PCR for specific pathogens [^115KAQ4R]. Imaging studies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography may be useful in assessing ocular involvement [^1117PMLn].

---

## Management strategies

Management of uveitis in diarrheal illness requires a **multidisciplinary approach** involving ophthalmologists, gastroenterologists, and infectious disease specialists:

- **Treat underlying diarrheal illness**: Appropriate antimicrobial therapy targeting the specific pathogen is essential [^1148R2pr].

- **Corticosteroid therapy**: Topical or systemic corticosteroids are used to control ocular inflammation [^1111jDiQ].

- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, or biologic agents (e.g. infliximab) may be required in refractory cases [^115DEe63].

- **Supportive care**: Analgesics, mydriatic agents, and close monitoring of ocular complications are essential [^1111jDiQ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with the severity of ocular inflammation, the underlying cause, and the timeliness of intervention. Complications include cataract, glaucoma, macular edema, retinal detachment, and permanent vision loss if untreated [^116i9MTb]. Early diagnosis and **appropriate treatment** significantly improve outcomes and reduce the risk of permanent vision loss [^116aFcGp].

---

## Preventive measures and public health implications

Preventive measures focus on **good hygiene**, safe food and water practices, and prompt treatment of diarrheal illness [^112pme1z]. Public health initiatives aimed at reducing the incidence of infectious diarrhea may indirectly reduce the risk of uveitis associated with diarrheal illness [^111YhHM6].

---

Uveitis in diarrheal illness is a significant clinical entity with substantial morbidity. Understanding the underlying mechanisms, recognizing clinical features, and implementing appropriate management strategies are essential for optimal patient outcomes.

Uveitis in children is an entity most pediatricians and ophthalmologists seldom encounter. It is prevalent in society, however, and the high incidence of sight-threatening complications in untreated children warrants a baseline knowl-edge of the diseases and disorders involved as well as a sense of when to refer to a specialist.

Discussion

Worldwide, uveitis and its aftereffects continue to be a leading cause of blindness. Many times, there is no known cause. Although uveitis frequently occurs alone, it is not a single disease. Uveitis can be a part of numerous distinct disease processes, much like arthritis can. Uveitis develops as a failure of the ocular immune system, and the condition is characterized by inflammation and tissue damage. Importantly, leukocyte migration, activation, and retention in inflamed ocular tissue are mediated by chemokines and their receptors, which may represent potential therapeutic targets. Calprotectin is a protein that has been extensively researched in inflammatory disease. So, the aim of this work is to investigate the correlation between serum calprotectin level and anterior uveitis in Egyptian patients.

In our study, compared to healthy eyes, patients with acute noninfectious anterior uveitis (granulomatous and non-granulomatous) had considerably higher serum calprotectin levels. Calprotectin has previously been investigated in systemic illness of various clinical phenotypes with overall presentation of uveitis. When compared to patients with idiopathic anterior uveitis and healthy individuals, patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis had elevated of serum calprotectin levels, and systemic conditions appeared to interfere with the calprotectin. Additionally, Behcet's disease (BD) patients were found to have elevated serum calprotectin levels, and faecal calprotectin may be useful in assessing the intestinal involvement of BD. Calprotectin expression in uveitis should be examined as a single entity to ascertain its precise function in the condition. Olson et alreported early in 1996 that elevated calprotectin level in endogenous posterior uveitis, but only enrolled 27 patients with no relation between calprotectin and clinical parameters due to the small sample size of patients. In the same line, Pascual et alfound age and gender did not substantially differ across the studied groups. Also, serum calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients' groups than those of the control groups.

COVID-19 vaccination in patients with uveitis — risk and monitoring: Several studies have found that patients with a history of noninfectious uveitis may have a slightly increased risk of recurrence following COVID-19 vaccination. The absolute risk of reactivation is very low and should not be considered a barrier to normal vaccination recommendations. However, increased monitoring in the first 1 to 2 months following vaccination may be indicated in patients with a history of uveitis.

### Case report: disease mechanisms and medical management of calcium nephrolithiasis in rheumatologic diseases [^115J3GJv]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatologic conditions may not be initially considered in the differential if the presenting features are kidney stones or electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia or metabolic acidosis. However these can be the presenting manifestations of rheumatologic conditions that predominantly affect the renal tubules rather than the glomeruli.

Case presentation

A 32 year old presented for a rheumatologic evaluation for a several month history of fatigue, dry eyes, dry mouth, weight loss, alopecia, arthralgias and dyspnea on exertion.

Review of medical records noted an unusual presentation to her local emergency room 4 years earlier with profound weakness where she was found to have marked hypokalemia with serum potassium 1.4 milliequivalents per liter. She also had a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis at that time with a serum bicarbonate of 12–14 milliequivalents per liter and a urine pH of 7–8. Magnesium level was normal. This episode was never explained but was attributed to possible "occult" diarrheal illness even though patient had denied diarrheal illness. The hypokalemia resolved with potassium chloride supplementation and she was maintained on potassium supplementation for some time subsequently.

Therapeutic management

Infectious UME should be treated with the appropriate etiological treatment. Herein, we will focus on the various UME of non-infectious causes.

An accurate initial diagnosis of ME etiology is of outmost importance, as even with the right treatment, a possible resistance to it might raise doubts over whether the initial investigations were not properly done.

### Approach to the diagnosis of the uveitides [^116pu3h6]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe an approach to diagnosing the uveitides, a collection of about 30 separate diseases characterized by intraocular inflammation.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Integration of clinical approach with a more formal, informatics-derived approach to characterization and a Bayesian approach to laboratory testing.

Results

The patient's uveitis is characterized along several dimensions: course, laterality, anatomic location of the inflammation, morphology, presence of active infection, and the host (age, presence of a systemic disease). Posterior uveitis can be characterized further by whether it is primarily a retinitis, choroiditis, or retinal vasculitis; by whether it is paucifocal or multifocal; and by the morphology of the lesions. This characterization narrows the differential diagnosis to 1 or, at most, a few diseases. Laboratory screening (ie, testing all patients) should be reserved for those diseases that can present as any type of uveitis, whereas targeted testing (ie, testing a subset with specific features) is used selectively. Laboratory testing should be used to identify an infection (which will alter therapy) or a systemic disease that will affect the patient's health. A uveitis that is not one of the established diagnoses is designated as "undifferentiated" with the course, laterality, and anatomic location (eg, undifferentiated bilateral chronic anterior uveitis). We avoid the term "idiopathic" uveitis as most identified noninfectious uveitic diseases are idiopathic, and most systemic diseases associated with uveitis also are idiopathic (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis).

Conclusion

This approach should lead to the correct diagnosis of the specific uveitic disease in the large majority of cases without overuse of laboratory testing.

### Ocular manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease [^111uzzkZ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by intestinal inflammation; however, it is also known to have extraintestinal manifestations. Ocular manifestations of IBD include keratopathy, episcleritis, scleritis, and uveitis and are among the most common extraintestinal manifestations. These diseases can lead to significant ocular morbidity if unrecognized and left untreated. A review of the literature was performed on PubMed and is summarized and critically appraised in this article with the aim being to describe the varying ocular manifestations of IBD and outlining their treatments. Ultimately, a framework is provided to investigate ocular symptoms in patients with IBD. An ocular review of systems is also provided as a tool to equip gastroenterologists and internal medicine physicians to be able to recognize and triage ocular complaints appropriately.

### Clinical characteristics and aetiology of uveitis in a viral haemorrhagic fever zone [^113THLqV]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary findings of this project underscore the continued prevalence of uveitis as a significant cause of visual impairment, particularly in the form of advanced disease as posterior uveitis, panuveitis and bilateral disease. Given the large number of uveitis sufferers in the country and the low number of ophthalmic trained staff available to manage them with limited resources, this condition represents a significant public health concern. Trauma is an important risk factor for uveitis and contributed to a significant proportion of disease. The study highlights substantial advancements in the development and application of laboratory investigations for uveitis diagnosis, yet further efforts are required to enhance the differentiation of its underlying causes. Specifically, it is recommended that additional laboratory studies would aid in identifying the aetiology. Obtaining anterior chamber and vitreous samples for processing would be beneficial in obtaining more definitive diagnoses for infectious aetiologies.

Immune recovery uveitis (IRIS) after antiretroviral therapy (ART) — Immune recovery uveitis after initiation of effective ART is an immunologic reaction to CMV that is associated with inflammation in the anterior chamber and/or the vitreous and, therefore, is a form of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Patients with low CD4 counts who are starting ART are at risk of IRIS. Frequent ophthalmologic examinations are warranted during the period of immune reconstitution in children who are unable to report symptoms, and ophthalmologic examination is indicated for children of any age who develop visual symptoms. Immune recovery uveitis may respond to periocular corticosteroids or a short course of systemic steroids, and oral ganciclovir has been beneficial in one small uncontrolled study.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: looking at the less frequent associations [^112SPWrD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic illnesses in which alterations of the innate and adaptive immune responses play a crucial role in starting and perpetuating intestinal inflammation. IBD includes mainly Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These diseases present not only gastrointestinal symptoms, but also signs that refer to other body districts and, in severe cases, to systemic implication. The involvement of organs other than those of the gastrointestinal tract is called 'extraintestinal manifestations'. These extraintestinal manifestations occur in varying percentages in IBD patients, and often a single patient has more than one such manifestation. Some extraintestinal manifestations of IBD are related to intestinal inflammation, while others are independent of disease course.

Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD were defined at the sixth scientific workshop of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation as any 'inflammatory pathology in a patient with IBD that is located outside the gut and for which the pathogenesis is either dependent on extension/translocation of immune responses from the intestine, or is an independent inflammatory event perpetuated by IBD or that shares a common environmental or genetic predisposition with IBD'. Extraintestinal manifestations more commonly involve the joints (peripheral and axial spondyloarthropathies), skin (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum), eyes (uveitis, episcleritis, iridocyclitis), and hepatobiliary tract [primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)].

### Prevalence and clinical features of chronic uveitis in pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases: a nationwide study [^112F1rsr]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompass a group of chronic inflammatory disorders primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract but capable of impacting various organs, including the eye, with uveitis being the most common ocular condition. We assessed uveitis prevalence and clinical features in a nationwide cohort of pediatric IBD. Among 4229 cases, six patients (four Crohn's disease, one ulcerative colitis, and one unclassified IBD) were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence rate of 141.8 per 100,000 patients. Uveitis onset varied: two before IBD, two after, and two concomitantly. Symptomatic uveitis occurred in 2/6 patients, with anterior involvement in all cases. Median follow-up was 3 years (interquartile range 2–4.75 years). At the last follow-up, 5/6 patients exhibited quiescent IBD, while 4/6 had inactive uveitis. One patient had ocular complications. Uveitis is a rare but potentially complicating manifestation of pediatric IBD.

### Prevalence of subclinical anterior uveitis in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^112JuS4v]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the prevalence of subclinical anterior uveitis in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods

In 179 consecutive patients (96 with Crohn's disease, 55 with ulcerative colitis, and 28 with inflammatory bowel disease of undetermined nature) without previous or concurrent ocular complaints, quantitative flare measurements were obtained with the Kowa FC laser flare to detect the presence of subclinical uveitis.

Results

The mean flare value was 3.9 (SD 1.1) ph/ms in patients younger than 30 years of age, rising to 5.8 (2.5) ph/ms in those over 60 years of age. No measurement performed in this patient population fell outside the mean observed value plus or minus SD of the normal controls within the same age category.

Conclusion

In an adult population of 179 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease the presence of a form of subclinical uveitis, as described by Hofley et al in a group of juvenile patients, is highly unlikely.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^1111jDiQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Iritis (anterior uveitis) — presentation, treatment, and evacuation: Nontraumatic iritis may present with pain, redness of the conjunctiva, blurred vision, and photophobia, with consensual photophobia on exam; standard therapy includes corticosteroids such as prednisolone 1% eye drops — 1 drop into the affected eye every hour if severe or every 4 h if mild, and if drops are unavailable or the condition is worsening, oral steroids can be given — prednisone 40 mg to 60 mg oral daily. If there is concern for herpetic lesions or other serious infection, steroids should be avoided; in this case, a topical nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drug (NSAID) may be beneficial. Cycloplegic (mydriatic) drops such as atropine are key for pain control, but cycloplegics should be avoided if there is concern for elevated intraocular pressures, with dosing of 1 drop in the affected eye 2 times daily. Evacuation should be emergent because iritis can be complicated by scarring of the pupil and elevated IOP. Recommendation ratings specify: Topical steroids — Strong recommendation, low‑quality evidence; Systemic steroids — Weak recommendation, low‑quality evidence; Mydriatic drops — Strong recommendation, low‑quality evidence; Topical NSAID — Weak recommendation, low‑quality evidence; Emergent evacuation — Strong recommendation, low‑quality evidence.

### Ocular manifestations of enterovirus: an important emerging pathogen [^113pzTuo]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

A total of 12 289 ocular viral PCR specimens were processed during the study period. Of them, 3687 (30.0%) were positive: 1197 were HSV1 positive (9.74%), 16 were HSV type 2 positive (0.13%), 434 were VZV positive (3.53%), 45 were CMV positive (0.36%), 1914 were adenovirus positive (15.57%), and 81 were EV positive (0.66%). The 81 EV-positive samples included 52 from conjunctival samples (64.20%), 28 from corneal samples (34.50%), and 1 from an aqueous sample (1.23%). There were no positive vitreous samples. The mean patient age was 46.2 years (median 46; range 1–89 years) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1.0. Similar to previous studies reporting on EV infections, conjunctivitis was the most common presentation. Forty-nine patients (60.50%) presented with conjunctivitis, whereas 30 patients (37.0%) presented with corneal signs (Table 1). Two patients initially presented with conjunctival injection and lid lesions or follicles but developed anterior uveitis at their subsequent follow-up visit. Seventy-two (88.9%) patients presented with unilateral signs; 9 patients presented with bilateral disease, including 1 patient with coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 1 patient who was also adenovirus PCR positive. A history of systemic symptoms was not recorded routinely in the clinical notes. It is known that systemic EV infections may be asymptomatic or present with clinical manifestations comprising fever, exanthem, headache, respiratory illness, sore throat, myocarditis, vomiting, and diarrhea.

### Features of axial spondyloarthritis in two multicenter cohorts of patients with psoriasis, uveitis, and colitis presenting with undiagnosed back pain [^115gbNZk]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is delayed for almost a decade, leading to a substantial burden of illness and a risk of irreversible spinal damage. Patients with back pain who concomitantly have psoriasis (PsO), acute anterior uveitis (AAU), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may initially present to dermatology, ophthalmology, or gastroenterology clinics, respectively, when there may be an opportunity to diagnose the condition much sooner. Earlier diagnosis and treatment might not only alleviate spinal symptoms earlier in the disease course but also help to make more informed decisions aimed at therapeutics that are effective for both axSpA and the comorbid condition. Recent referral recommendations advocate referral to a rheumatologist of patients with chronic back pain, symptom onset at less than 45 years of age, and extra‐articular features related to axSpA. However, nonspecific back disorders are common, and access to a rheumatologist is limited in many parts of the world. Moreover, features indicating inflammatory back pain (IBP) are relatively nonspecific, and HLA‐B27 appears to be less strongly associated with axSpA in patients with PsO and IBD. Previous reports evaluating the prevalence of axSpA, distinguishing clinical features, and associations with HLA‐B27 have been largely retrospective case studies of selected populations. There are limited prospective studies in which the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteriahave been used to identify patients with axSpA, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) was only conducted when considered clinically indicated as opposed to being done routinely for all patients. However, the performance of the ASAS criteria has not been assessed in these disease subgroups and may be adversely impacted by the lack of association with HLA‐B27. Moreover, MRI findings in the SIJs that are indicative of axSpA do not correlate well with clinical features of IBP and may be present even in asymptomatic patients with AAU, PsO, or IBD.

Infectious diarrhea — initial assessment and Shiga toxin–producing organisms: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults. When the clinical or epidemic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish Escherichia coli O157:H7 from other Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) in stool; if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used. In addition, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially in people with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler. Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections.

### Inability to walk: a rare presentation of Crohn's disease [^116ixeFE]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) usually present with severe diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue or weight loss. However, besides the gastrointestinal localisation of the diseases, multiple extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) have been described. Many organs can be involved, with the most common manifestations occurring musculoskeletal (joint pain, peripheral and axial arthropathies, arthritis) or dermatological (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, stomatitis). Less common organ involvement consist of renal, ocular or hepatobiliary tract. Underestimated and therefore also under-reported EIM of IBD are neurological complications. Here, we present a rare case, where a neurological manifestation appears to be the presenting symptom of IBD.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — fever or bloody diarrhea and enteric fever: People with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may confer clinical benefit including Salmonella enterica subspecies, Shigella, and Campylobacter (strong, low). Enteric fever should be considered when a febrile person (with or without diarrhea) has a history of travel to areas in which causative agents are endemic, has consumed foods prepared by people with recent endemic exposure, or has had laboratory exposure to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi (strong, moderate). In typhoid and paratyphoid fever, diarrhea is an uncommon feature, typhoid fever outbreaks in the United States are uncommon and usually associated with foodborne transmission from an asymptomatic carrier, and a travel history is frequent, reported in 68% of patients with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and 50% with Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^114Vptzr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Uveitis, a group of conditions characterized by intraocular inflammation, is a major cause of sight loss in the working population. Most uveitis seen in Western countries is noninfectious and appears to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory in nature, requiring treatment with immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory drugs. In this educational review, we outline the ideal characteristics of drugs for uveitis and review the data to support the use of current and emerging therapies in this context. It is crucial that we continue to develop new therapies for use in uveitis that aim to suppress disease activity, prevent accumulation of damage, and preserve visual function for patients with the minimum possible side effects.

### Etiology of uveitis in upper Egypt [^1117Hpin]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A large number of inflammatory ocular conditions can be grouped under the term "uveitis". And the etiologies of ocular inflammation vary to a great extent from one geographic place to another and show a prominent ethnic predisposition. Owing to the blinding potential of a large percentage of ocular inflammatory conditions, it is of critical importance to ophthalmologists to be well-oriented with the pattern of uveitis prevalent in the region of the world they serve in, as well as its common causes. This assists them proceed more successfully in their differential diagnosis plan, and timely instigate the most appropriate treatment. In this domain, a number of reports and studies have been published from different countries, in order to report and expose the predominant causes and forms of ocular inflammation in each country.

The present study aims to report the causes of uveitis among patients referred to a tertiary level hospital in Upper Egypt.

Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The causes of acute diarrhea in children vary with the location, time of year, and population studied. There is increasing recognition of a widening array of enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal diseases. Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement and maintenance are key to managing diarrheal illnesses. Thorough clinical and epidemiologic evaluation is needed to define the severity and type of illness, exposures, and whether the patient in is immunocompromised to direct the performance of selective diagnosis cultures, toxin testing, parasite studies, and the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

A 14-year-old girl presented to the ophthalmology clinic with progressive diminution of vision, redness, pain and photophobia in both eyes for the last 1month. She had abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss during that period. Ocular examination revealed features of anterior uveitis, vitritis and retinal vasculitis. In view of gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal imaging was done, which showed multiple enhancing bowel wall thickening with skip lesions in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. Colonoscopy showed ulcers in the ascending colon, caecum and terminal ileum. Histopathology revealed microgranulomas in lamina propria and submucosal granulomas suggestive of Crohn's disease. The patient was started on topical steroid eye drops and oral budesonide and mesalazine. Her vision improved after 3weeks and bowel symptoms attained remission after 8weeks, and at present, she is doing well.

### Uveitis manifestations in patients of the Swiss inflammatory bowel disease cohort study [^115rZrdV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background:

The knowledge about risk factors for the onset of uveitis manifestations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still limited. Here, we aimed to provide an overview of the clinical factors associated with the onset of uveitis in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS).

Methods:

We included epidemiological and clinical data from 1840 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 1426 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) followed up in the SIBDCS between 2006 and 2018. Associations between disease characteristics and uveitis were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results:

Overall, we identified 285 patients with uveitis. Uveitis was more frequent in patients with CD (11.1%; 205 of 1635) than UC (5.6%; 80 of 1346; odds ratio 2.11, p < 0.001). The occurrence of uveitis manifestations in patients with UC and CD was significantly associated with the onset of other extraintestinal manifestations, also in multivariate analyses. The onset of uveitis was associated with the hallmark features of severe disease in both CD and UC, including a higher clinical disease activity index and the use of immunomodulators or calcineurin inhibitors. In CD, uveitis was more frequent in females and showed a positive correlation with a positive family history of IBD.

Conclusions:

Our data demonstrate that uveitis in IBD occurs more often in CD as well as in women and is associated with a more severe disease course. This might guide physicians' awareness in at-risk patients to the presence of uveitis extraintestinal manifestations and help to improve patient care.

### Calprotectin as a biomarker for diagnosis and severity of acute noninfectious anterior uveitis in Egyptian patients [^116fMkhR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Another study by Gazim, et alconcluded that, the clinician may be able to categorise the causes of anterior uveitis with the aid of faecal calprotectin levels. Spondylarthritis (SpA) associated uveitis is difficult to diagnose in some cases because some rheumatological findings are absent or insufficient. SpA may also present itself initially as uveitis. Finding high faecal calprotectin levels could be another piece of information that contributes to this classification. To fully comprehend the significance of faecal calprotectin levels for detection of SpA among individuals presenting with anterior uveitis, more research is required. Even though none of our patients had Behcet's illness, it is important to note that this condition is similarly linked to intestinal inflammation and high amounts of faecal calprotectin. The relevance of calprotectin levels in differential detection of severity for these two diseases may be clarified by further research comparing the calprotectin levels in uveitis patients with SpA and Behcet's disease.

### New onset or recurrence of uveitis following COVID-19 infection [^113B3BrG]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

We found that receiving local or systemic steroid treatment can improve the condition of newly diagnosed or recurrent uveitis. Multiple studies have reported that uveitis can be well controlled through local or systemic steroid treatment. A recent case report showed that a 14-year-old male pneumonia patient was diagnosed with COVID-19-associated bilateral anterior uveitis. The patient's ocular symptoms improved after treatment with local and systemic corticosteroids. Iriqat et al. reported a case of anterior uveitis that occurred after recovery from COVID-19, which was severe but was relieved after local and systemic steroid treatment. In our study, all of our uveitis patients responded well to local and systemic steroid treatment without complications or relapses during the study period. In addition, none of the patients experienced increased IOP during treatment and all recovered without using antiviral drugs, which may indicate a potential immunogenic etiology for non-granulomatous uveitis. Although the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients is controversial among international experts, based on our study observation, we support the timely and appropriate use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients with concurrent uveitis, taking into account the severity of uveitis, systemic disease, age, and lens status.

Our study has a limitation in establishing a definitive relationship between uveitis and COVID-19 infection, despite all patients presenting with new-onset or recurrent uveitis symptoms within one month of COVID-19 infection. The overall positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ocular fluid is rare, with some studies reporting a failure to detect any RNA in conjunctival swabs. Nevertheless, it is prudent to remain cautious and the potential occurrence of uveitis after COVID-19 infection should be considered. The relative lack of detectable viral RNA in ocular fluid also prompts the question of whether the ocular manifestations of COVID-19 truly result from viral infection in ocular tissues or are part of a spectrum of ocular symptoms accompanying various viral diseases. Furthermore, the sample size in our study was still comparatively small to comprehensively delineate the intricate relationship between COVID-19 infection and uveitis.

### Current trends in inflammatory bowel disease: the natural history [^115wQdwN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The description of the prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is based on systematic follow-up of population-based cohorts. A steady increase in incidence of IBD has occurred. The distribution of ulcerative colitis (UC) is fairly uniform with a preponderance of left-sided disease. One-third of Crohn's disease (CD) patients present with colonic disease, one-third with ileocolonic disease and one-third with small bowel disease. IBD is associated with extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) in up to 36% of patients. Uveitis and episcleritis are the most common. The cumulative probability of a relapsing course in UC is 90% after 25 years. In CD disease behaviour varies substantially with time. At diagnosis behaviour is inflammatory in 70% of patients. At follow-up there is a change to either stricturing or penetrating disease. Most patients with CD will eventually require surgery. Risk factors for CD recurrence after surgery include penetrating/fistulizing disease behaviour, young age, short duration of disease before first surgery and ileocolonic disease. The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in UC seems to be decreasing. The risk of CRC in CD seems to be equivalent to the risk in UC. Patients with small bowel CD are also at increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma. CD is associated with a mortality rate 20–70% higher than expected, whereas mortality in UC is equivalent to that of the general population. The improved prognosis of IBD, especially UC, could be due to a chemopreventive effect of the medications used. Further studies are needed to develop the best strategy for the reduction of mortality and cancer risk in IBD.

### Bilateral uveitis and macular edema induced by nivolumab: a case report [^113wTZXr]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nivolumab is a fully human antibody which is routinely used at first therapy for metastatic melanoma. Usually, side effects are immune-related adverse events. We report a case of a man who developed bilateral anterior uveitis and macular serous retinal detachment during nivolumab treatment for metastatic melanoma.

Case Presentation

A man on nivolumab treatment for a leg melanoma with duodenal and lymph nodes metastases developed a sudden bilateral visual acuity impairment and bilateral non-painfull redness eyes several days after the third infusion. The clinical examination showed a significant decreased of the visual acuity. Slit lamp examination revealed the presence of bilateral granulomatous keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells +++, bilateral synechiae, bilateral papilledema and macular edema associated with serous retinal detachment in the left eye. The anti-Programmed cells Death-1 was stopped and a topical corticosteroid treatment was administrated. After 8 days of topical corticosteroid treatment visual acuity was worsening with similar optical coherence tomography examination. An oral corticosteroid treatment was started. Evolution was favorable with a decrease of ocular inflammation and a complete visual acuity recovery after 3 weeks. Nivolumab was re-initiated.

Conclusions

This is the second clinical report of bilateral anterior uveitis associated with macular serous retinal detachment related to anti-PD-1 treatment, and the first with nivolumab. Cases of uveitis were reported several times. Although rare, ophthalmologic manifestations that are rapidly recognized and adequately managed can be treated.

### The eyes have it: a rheumatologist's view of uveitis [^113x4UNf]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Uveitis is defined as intraocular inflammation. It is an extraarticular manifestation of many forms of joint disease, which include spondyloarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Behçet's disease. Rheumatologists may be asked to consult on the ophthalmologic care of patients with uveitis in order to identify an associated systemic illness. Diagnoses such as spondyloarthritis, sarcoidosis, and interstitial nephritis with uveitis are frequently overlooked by referring ophthalmologists. Alternatively, rheumatologists may be asked to help manage the patient's immunosuppression, including biologic therapy, which can be required to treat a subset of patients with uveitis. This review is intended to provide rheumatologists with the necessary information to facilitate collaboration in the comanagement of patients with uveitis.

### Information for clinicians | E. coli infection… [^111fhZdK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most intestinal E. coliinfections can be managed symptomatically.
- Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated.
- Early use of intravenous fluids may decrease the risk of renal failure in children with STEC infection. Diagnosis E. coli infection is diagnosed when the bacteria are identified from the sample of a patient with an acute diarrheal illness. Treatment Hydration Most E. coli infections can be managed symptomatically. Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated. Evidence from studies of children with STEC O157 infection indicates that early use of intravenous fluids may decrease the risk of renal failure. Antibiotics Antibiotics used to treat infection with diarrheagenic E. coli other than STEC include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and rifaximin.

Clinicians treating a patient whose clinical syndrome suggests STEC infection should be aware that administering antimicrobial agents may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS, which can be a complication of STEC infection, is a type of thrombotic microangiopathy, characterized by anemia, kidney injury, and a low platelet count. HUS can lead to permanent health problems and even death. The features of HUS, especially in adults, can be similar to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. TTP can lead to strokes, brain damage, and death. HUS diagnosis HUS is diagnosed using standard blood chemistry and blood count tests. HUS treatment HUS is treated with supportive care, including the management of fluids and electrolytes.

In some cases, treatment may involve:

- Dialysis
- Transfusions of red blood cells, platelets, or both With good supportive care, most people with HUS recover completely. Outcomes are typically better for children than adults.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^115DEe63]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

Uveitis is an important clinical problem, with high prevalence worldwide, and with high visual morbidity. It is an umbrella term for a range of clinical entities, and the range of different aetiologies for uveitis, including infectious, autoimmune and autoinflammatory, traumatic and ischaemic causes, means that single overarching guidelines are difficult to produce. Guidance exists on the use of newer treatments such as the monoclonal antibody anti-TNF treatment adalimumab and slow release dexamethasone intravitreal implants in non-infectious posterior uveitis, but this covers only a small proportion of cases of uveitis, and anti-TNF treatment is only recommended for cases refractory to first line (corticosteroid) and second line (conventional immunosuppressive) therapies. However, no guidance exists on when to initiate these first- and second-line treatments. There is also a marked lack of guidance on the more common presentation of anterior uveitis; and on infectious uveitis, which can be devastating to vision.

Designing specific guidelines for each subtype of uveitis is likely impractical, as is a single CPG to cover all uveitis. However, an achievable way of increasing coverage of uveitis by CPGs, to the benefit of patients worldwide, may be to aim for guidance on uveitides based on aetiology and/or anatomical location. Broad guidelines could cover diagnosis, treatment strategies and monitoring of several uveitis subtypes under this arrangement.

Regrettably, evidence derived from CPGs for uveitis to support the development of the WHO PECI form a small pool, and cover only a minority of the clinical presentations of uveitis in sufficient detail to help clinical decision making. Thus, there will be a greater reliance on Cochrane Systematic Reviews and expert opinion in deciding on interventions to include in the PECI. There is an urgent requirement for high-quality, evidence-based guidance on a wider range of uveitides. The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a necessary collaboration between clinicians around the world, including uveitis specialists, due to the need for shared experience during a period of uncertainty. This era of collaboration may accelerate larger and higher-quality studies and reviews, which would support measures such as the PECI in the future.

Acute Phase Reactions: Symptoms consistent with acute phase reaction have been reported with bisphosphonate use. The overall incidence of acute phase reaction was 3.6% of patients on ACTONEL 5 mg daily and 7.6% of patients on ACTONEL 75 mg two consecutive days per month. These incidence rates are based on reporting of any of 33 acute phase reaction-like symptoms within 5 days of the first dose. Fever or influenza-like illness with onset within the same period were reported by 0.0% of patients on ACTONEL 5 mg daily and 0.6% of patients on ACTONEL 75 mg two consecutive days per month.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Events: The ACTONEL 75 mg two consecutive days per month group resulted in a higher incidence of discontinuation due to vomiting (1.0% versus 0.2%) and diarrhea (1.0% versus 0.3%) compared to the ACTONEL 5 mg daily group. Most of these events occurred within a few days of dosing.

Ocular Adverse Events: None of the patients treated with ACTONEL 75 mg two consecutive days per month reported ocular inflammation such as uveitis, scleritis, or iritis; 1 patient treated with ACTONEL 5 mg daily reported uveitis.

Laboratory Test Findings: When ACTONEL 5 mg daily and ACTONEL 75 mg two consecutive days per month were compared in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the mean percent changes from baseline at 24 months were 0.2% and 0.8% for serum calcium, -1.9% and -1.3% for phosphate, and -10.4% and -17.2% for PTH, respectively. Compared to the ACTONEL 5 mg daily group, ACTONEL 75 mg two consecutive days per month resulted in a slightly higher incidence of hypocalcemia at the end of the first month of treatment (4.5% versus 3.0%). Thereafter, the incidence of hypocalcemia with these regimens was similar at approximately 2%.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^112VdSw1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses a group of chronic inflammatory disorders comprising most commonly of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The incidence of IBD appears to be rising in recent decades. Ng et al. reported that the highest prevalence values were in Europe (UC 505 per 100 000 in Norway; CD 322 per 100 000 in Germany) and North America (UC 286 per 100 000 in the USA; CD 319 per 100 000 in Canada). The prevalence of IBD exceeded 0.3% in North America, Oceania, and many countries in Europe. Overall, the majority of studies on CD and UC report stable or decreasing incidence of IBD in North America and Europe. Since 1990, the incidence has been rising in newly industrialized countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, including Brazil. The overall incidence of UC in Europe, North America, and Oceania is independent of gender. In CD, less consistent findings have been reported, with some cohorts suggesting a female predominance in the incidence of CD and others failing to find any gender difference. Differences in gender-specific incidence exist, with a female predominance in CD in western populations and a male predominance in eastern studies. No gender differences were found in UC.

IBD typically manifests in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life. Although their pathogenesis is still unclear, it is hypothesized that chronic intestinal inflammation originates from an overly aggressive mucosal immune response against luminal bacteria in genetically susceptible subjects.

CD is characterized by transmural inflammation that can occur in the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract and common localizations include the terminal ileum and colon. Due to the transmural inflammation, complications may present such as abscesses and fistulas.

In contrast, UC demonstrates mucosal inflammation and typically starts distally in the rectum, showing progression towards the more proximal colon. The disease will mostly be limited to the colon and ileal involvement is rare (backwash ileitis).

Diagnosis of IBD is generally made by assessment of symptoms, biochemical markers, and colonoscopy combined with radiology and histology. The different phenotypes of IBD share common clinical features but may have a heterogeneous presentation which includes abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and anemia. Extra-intestinal manifestations such as arthritis, skin disorders, and uveitis may also be present.

### Dexamethasone [^115hWeRm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating dexamethasone in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram- negative septicemia.

Cerebral Malaria

Avoid corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, in patients with cerebral malaria.

Vaccination

Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for Addison's disease.

Ophthalmic

Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist for patients who develop ocular symptoms or use corticosteroid-containing products for more than 6 weeks. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.

Best of five questions

Question 1

A 23-year-old man presented with an 8-week history of bloody diarrhoea, severe anorectal pain and low-grade pyrexia. On further questioning he also complained of malaise, myalgia and arthralgia. He admitted to unprotected receptive anal sexual intercourse with two male partners in the preceding 6 months. Perianal and rectal examination revealed two fluctuant, tender areas of induration adjacent to the anal verge suggestive of abscesses. An urgent flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed inflamed, friable rectal mucosa with several large ulcers and spontaneous bleeding. Rectal swabs sent for NAAT and genotyping revealed the presence of C trachomatis genotype L1.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment regimen:
A — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days
B — Erythromycin 250 mg four times a day for 21 days
C — Olfloxacin 400 mg a day for 7 days
D — Erythromycin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days
E — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 21 days

Question 2

A 32-year-old man presents with a 6-week history of diarrhoea, anorectal pain and maculopapular rash affecting the trunk, hands and feet. Two years previously he had been investigated for possible Crohn's disease after presenting with several perianal and anal verge ulcers. These had resolved spontaneously and no formal diagnosis had been made. On further questioning he admitted to a 4-week history of perianal swelling and several oral ulcers with a snail track distribution on inspection. Perianal inspection is demonstrated in figure 3.

What is the most likely causative organism:
A — HSV
B — T pallidum
C — N gonorrhoea
D — C trachomatis
E — Human papilloma virus

Question 3

A 40-year-old male patient of Turkish origin presented to ophthalmology as an emergency with acute painless reduced visual acuity in both eyes. Further questioning revealed a several year history of intermittent diarrhoea, recurrent oral and penile ulceration, with orogenital scarring evident on examination. He also complained of painful red nodules on the extensor aspects of both forearms. One year previously he had been diagnosed with anterior uveitis requiring prolonged steroid use. Slit lamp retinal examination revealed multiple intraretinal haemorrhages, soft exudates and macular oedema in both eyes.

What is the most likely diagnosis:
A — Crohn's disease
B — Sarcoidosis
C — Behçet's syndrome
D — Tuberculosis
E — Multiple sclerosis

Summary

What was known before

Uveitis causes a significant burden of visual morbidity in Sierra Leone from the last uveitis study in Sierra Leone over 30 years ago.
Toxoplasmosis associated uveitis caused a significant proportion of uveitis in Sierra Leone.
The Ebola Virus Epidemic of 2013–16 may have caused a large proportion of uveitis and other ocular complications that has not yet been assessed in Sierra Leone.

What this study adds

Ebola associated uveitis contributed to up to 2% of uveitis in this sample of patients with uveitis.
Uveitis remains a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in Sierra Leone, caused by bilateral disease, posterior and pan-uveitis.
Syphilis testing in-country in active uveitis patients helped differentiate between other causes of uveitis and affected the management and clinical course of disease for those patients.

### Autoimmunity, autoinflammation, and infection in uveitis [^112MCZhT]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the pathogenesis of uveitis in light of recent advances in our understanding of innate and adaptive immune responses and their regulation.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Methods included a review of prevailing views on the pathogenesis of uveitis and an analysis of developments in immunology that impact on its conceptual basis, particularly the concept of immunologic tolerance and its loss in autoimmunity. Importantly, the role of infection in the pathogenesis of uveitis is evaluated.

Results

The results comprise a reappraisal of the pathogenesis of anterior vs posterior uveitis in the context of the blood-retinal barrier and its relation to autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and infectious uveitis. Autoimmunity is seen as a possible cause of certain forms of uveitis but definitive proof is lacking. Autoinflammatory disease, involving activated innate immune mechanisms, is considered causative in a second set of uveitis conditions. A place for infection in uveitis generally is proposed within a unifying concept for the pathogenesis of uveitis.

Conclusion

Infection may be implicated directly or indirectly in many forms of noninfectious or undifferentiated uveitis. In addition to the growing recognition that foreign antigen, including reactivatable infectious agents, might hide within ocular tissues, the possibility that a dysregulated microbiome might generate T cells that cause immune-mediated ocular inflammation has now been demonstrated experimentally. An uncontrolled, overexuberant host immune response may cause continuing irreversible tissue damage even after the infection has been cleared.

Results

Epidemiology of uveitis in patients in the SIBDCS

Data from 3266 patients with IBD were analysed (1840 CD; 1426 UC/IBDU). Out of those 1840 patients with CD, 877 patients were male and 963 were female. Overall, 11.1% of patients with CD (205) suffered from uveitis either before inclusion or during participation in the SIBDCS. From the total number of 1426 patients with UC/IBDU, 766 patients were male and 660 were female. Overall, 5.6% of patients (80) suffered from uveitis at any time during their disease course. The risk of suffering from uveitis was significantly higher in patients with CD versus UC [odds ratio (OR) 2.11, 1.61–2.76; p < 0.0001].

Disease characteristics and uveitis manifestations in patients with CD

A total of 124 (60.5%) patients with CD with uveitis were female and 81 (39.5%; p = 0.013) were male. Patients with CD without uveitis did not show any significant sex difference (51.3% female versus 48.7% male). Though the age at CD diagnosis did not significantly differ between patients with or without uveitis, the disease duration was clearly different with a median disease duration of 16 versus 12 years in patients with CD with versus without at the time of onset of uveitis EIMs (p < 0.001). More patients without uveitis were initially diagnosed with disease located in the terminal ileum, whereas about one fifth of patients with uveitis manifestations presented with unknown/unclear disease localization at diagnosis. In contrast, no differences were observed regarding disease localization at the latest follow-up visit. Disease severity was significantly higher in patients with uveitis at enrollment as well as at the latest follow-up visit. Interestingly, patients with CD with uveitis had a higher rate of positive family history for IBD (18.0% versus 12.8%; p < 0.001; Table 1).

Clinical presentation and diagnosis

The manifestations of BD are similar to those of IBD, specifically uveitis, arthritis, oral ulcers, pyoderma gangrenosum, vaso-occlusive disease, and thrombotic events. Uveitis in BD can be characterized by chronic pan-uveitis or posterior uveitis with necrotizing retinal vasculitis and tends to be more recurrent and sight threatening than other endogenous uveitis. Other ocular manifestations also include iridocyclitis, keratitis, episcleritis, scleritis, vitritis and optic neuritis. The most commonly reported ocular manifestations in IBD are dry eye, blepharitis, episcleritis, or anterior uveitis. When related to CD, uveitis is frequently bilateral, with insidious onset, and long-lasting, although characteristic acute anterior uveitis with sudden onset may occur. Arthropathy is a common manifestation in BD: arthralgia, oligoarthritis and polyarthritis are the most common reported forms of joint involvement. Arthropathies associated with IBD in the spondyloarthritis group can be divided into axial and peripheral involvement. Genital lesions and neurologic involvement are more common in BD. Vascular complications are present in one third of BD patients. BD involves the gastrointestinal tract in 10–15% of cases with localized lesions that occur in the ileocecal region. Gastrointestinal manifestations usually occur 4.5–6 years later than the onset of oral ulcerations. Sometimes, however, intestinal lesions can precede extra-intestinal manifestations. Anal complications such as stricture, fistula, and abscess formation, which are frequently observed in a third of patients with CD due to its transmural mucosal involvement, are rare in BD, occurring in less than 1% of patients. CD is an inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, presenting at onset with a clinical picture characterized by a combination of symptoms/signs such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, abdominal tenderness, weight loss and fever. It often includes, like BD, extra-intestinal signs and symptoms (fever, weight loss, anaemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye) affecting different systems with skin, ocular, articular lesions. Classically, CD has a clinical manifestation with pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Similar to adults, children with IBD may present with a range of symptoms, depending on the location, severity and chronicity of inflammation. Children with CD, presenting less specific symptoms than those with ulcerative colitis, have a longer period of symptoms prior to diagnosis that contributes to various short- or long-term consequences, including impaired linear growth and delayed pubertal development and inappropriate therapies or interventions. While diagnosis of CD is based on endoscopic and histological features, there is no specific diagnostic test for BD and diagnosis depends on clinical features. In 1990, the International Study Group (ISG) for BD defined the diagnostic criteria of BD. It can be considered in the presence of recurrent oral ulcerations plus 2 of the following criteria: recurrent genital ulcerations, eye lesions, skin lesions, positive results from a pathergy test (Fig. 1). In 2014, new criteria for BD diagnosis called ICBD (International Criteria for Behcet's Disease) were proposed and include two additional clinical criteria, neurological and vascular involvement, permitting diagnosis even without the presence of oral aphthous lesions which were considered mandatory in previous ISG classifications. An international expert consensus group (the pediatric BD, PEDBD group) has recently proposed a new set of criteria for the classification of BD in children. These diagnostic criteria for BD do not include intestinal symptoms. Cheon et al. defined novel diagnostic criteria for intestinal BD in Korean patients with ileum-colonic ulcers based on endoscopic features (typical or atypical intestinal BD ulcerations) and clinical patterns (systemic symptoms, oral ulcerations or extra-intestinal manifestations). The positive predictive value and accuracy of these criteria were 86.1 and 91.1% respectively (Fig. 2). Previously, some clinicians had used Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) for evaluating intestinal BD activity. CDAI is the most common indicator used in CD relapses and includes some criteria such as: present state of being, abdominal pain, number of bowel movements, haematocrit value, body weight, and administered drugs. The Korean IBD Study Group has developed a disease activity index for intestinal Behçet's disease (DAIBD). DAIBD includes clinical features that have been present over the preceding 7 days such as the general condition of patient, extra-intestinal manifestations, intestinal complications, abdominal symptoms and signs, fever and stool frequency not requiring laboratory data or endoscopic findings (Fig. 3). Each item has a single score and total score can differentiate disease activity into "severe", "moderate", "mild", and "quiescent", showing much higher responsiveness than the CDAI (r = 0.812 vs. r = 0.645, respectively) but no significant association with endoscopic activity. There are no pathognomonic laboratory tests for BD diagnosis. In the presence of active BD, such as in patients with IBD or other forms or vasculitis, levels of serum markers of inflammation, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are elevated. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) are anti-glycan antibodies directed against the phosphopeptido mannans found in the cell wall of baker's and brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Choi et al. have demonstrated that ASCA positivity is possible in up to 44% of patients with intestinal BD and is associated with an increased surgical risk. Antiα-enolase antibodies (AAEA) have been observed in patients with BD. The α-enolase protein is a glycolytic enzyme that serves as a plasminogen receptor on the surface of a variety of hematopoietic, epithelial, and endothelial cells and is crucial in intravascular and pericellular fibrinolytic systems. Evidence suggests that α-enolase plays an important role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Recently, Lee et al. reported that α-enolase is the target antigen recognized by anti-endothelial cell antibodies in the sera of patients with BD. IgM AAEAs were observed in 18 out of 40 patients with BD (45%). Based on their results, they suggest that AAEA has the potential to be a diagnostic marker of BD. Shin et al. assessed the prevalence of IgM AAEA in patients with intestinal BD and found that IgM AAEA can be helpful for the diagnosis of intestinal BD, especially in patients without systemic manifestations of BD. They evaluated the relationships between IgM AAEA and various intestinal BD-related clinical factors, suggesting the association between IgM AAEA and disease activity and severity. Expression of ASCA reflects a specific mucosal immune-mediated response in CD. ASCA frequency in CD patients ranges from 50 to 80% of total IgG and 30 to 50% of total IgA antibodies. ASCA is found more often in CD (50–70%) than healthy controls (< 5%); these antibodies increase with age and are associated with a more severe disease course in CD. The sensitivity and specificity of these antibodies in diagnosing Crohn's disease range from 40 to 70% and 82 to 89%, respectively. In conclusion, for both diseases, clinical diagnosis is not supported by specific serum markers.

BD cohort

In confirmed BD patients, a positive family history was present in 17% of patients, and the age onset (median) was 7.95 years with an earlier appearance of symptoms in females (mean 7.5 years in females vs 9.2 years in males, see Table 1). Oral ulcers (OU) were the clinical sign shared by all patients, 77% had genital ulcers (GU), 35% pseudo-folliculitis, 32% papulo-pustular lesions or acne and 8% erythema nodosum. In 39% of patients, pathergy test was positive, being a relevant sign distinguishing BD from confounding diseases (in this category, data on skin pathergy reactions were sometimes missing). In 54% of patients, ocular manifestations were found: anterior (29%) and posterior uveitis (27%), retinal vasculitis and papillary oedema (8%), and impaired vision (17%). Vascular involvement was rare and limited to venous thrombosis (8%). Neurologic manifestations were present in 42% of patients: 25% had an isolated headache (the most frequent symptom), and 17% cranial nerve palsy. In 38% of patients GI symptoms were present, mainly as abdominal pain (33%), diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding (13%) and anal/perianal ulcers (8%). In 33% of patients, musculoskeletal manifestations were detected (29% arthralgia and 13% arthritis). Fever was present in 50% of patients, with a prevalently irregular pattern. HLA-B51 was present in 69% of patients (See Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3, available at Rheumatology online).

Table 2.
Clinical manifestations in confirmed and probable BD

Females more frequently presented GU, skin manifestations and gastroenteric symptoms. On the contrary, ocular, vascular and neurologic involvement occurred more frequently in males. The general frequency of the different manifestations in the two genders is reported in Fig. 2, while in Supplementary Fig. S2 (available at Rheumatology online) the frequency of each manifestation per gender is summarised.

Figure 2.
Frequency of the clinical manifestations in male and female confirmed BD patients

Among patients with probable BD, four had oral and genital aphthous ulcers and one had an anterior uveitis associated with oral aphthosis. The others were assigned to this group because of unusual features such as maculopapular rash, early age onset and in the absence of enough typical manifestations necessary to make a diagnosis of BD.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus retinitis — clinical manifestations in HIV include that retinitis is the most common end-organ disease and presents as unilateral disease in two-thirds of patients at presentation, ultimately becoming bilateral in most without therapy or immune recovery; in unilateral CMV retinitis with CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3, rates of contralateral disease approach those of the pre-ART era. Peripheral retinitis may be asymptomatic or cause floaters, scotomata, or peripheral visual field defects, whereas central retinal lesions or lesions impinging on the macula or optic nerve are associated with decreased visual acuity or central field defects, and CMV retinitis is described as a full-thickness necrotizing retinitis with fluffy, yellow-white lesions with or without intraretinal hemorrhage and little vitreous inflammation unless immune recovery with ART intervenes. In the absence of ART or specific anti-CMV therapy, retinitis invariably progresses, usually within 10 to 21 days after presentation. Beyond the eye, colitis occurs in 5% to 10% of patients with AIDS and CMV end-organ disease and hemorrhage and perforation can be life-threatening complications; esophagitis occurs in a small percentage with symptoms such as odynophagia, nausea, and occasionally midepigastric or retrosternal discomfort, and colitis and esophagitis may cause fever.

### Uveitis manifestations in patients of the Swiss inflammatory bowel disease cohort study [^112fr4dj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our data provide an overview about the clinical associations and implications of uveitis in patients with IBD. We demonstrate that uveitis occurs in about one tenth of our patients, and therefore recognition of ocular manifestations is of crucial relevance for daily clinical practice. Additionally, the identification of risk factors for uveitis in patients with IBD, which can precede the onset of intestinal inflammation, may help to improve diagnosis of IBD and also of the ocular involvement. Our data might contribute to an increased physician awareness for the presence of ocular EIMs in patients with IBD, possibly leading to earlier diagnosis, prompt tailored therapeutic measures and finally improved care of patients with IBD.

### Diagnosis and classification of reactive arthritis [^111YhHM6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis is a form of seronegative spondyloarthritis clinically associated with inflammatory back pain, additive or migratory oligoarthritis, and extra-articular symptoms that typically follow a gastrointestinal or urogenital infection by a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 3–6 weeks. Once arthritis is observed, however, microbial tests and blood or synovial fluid cultures are negative, and only serum antibodies are detected. Reactive arthritis commonly affects young adults, most frequently white and carrying the HLA-B27 allele. The genetic susceptibility appears as necessary with only 1–15% of cases of infection developing reactive arthritis. Clinical symptoms are different from septic arthritis which manifests with fever, systemic signs of infection, and monoarthritis. The presence of large joint oligoarthritis, urogenital tract infection, and uveitis characterizes Reiter's syndrome as a clinical subtype. Ocular, skin, and heart involvement are not uncommon and may be largely variable in severity. Diagnostic criteria are based on the ACR guidelines and include rheumatological signs along with a proof of infection.

### The microbiome and uveitis: a narrative review [^117CB7ko]. The American Journal of Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

The human intestinal microbiome is composed of hundreds of species and has recently been recognized as an important source of immune homeostasis. While dysbiosis, an altered microbiome from the normal core microbiome, has been associated with both intestinal and extraintestinal autoimmune disorders, including uveitis, causality has been difficult to establish. There are four proposed mechanisms of how the gut microbiome may influence the development of uveitis: molecular mimicry, imbalance of regulatory and effector T cells, increased intestinal permeability, and loss of intestinal metabolites. This review summarizes current literature on both animal and human studies that establish the link between dysbiosis and the development of uveitis, as well as provides evidence for the above mechanisms. Current studies provide valuable mechanistic insights as well as identify potential therapeutic targets. However, study limitations and the wide variability in the intestinal microbiome among populations and diseases make a specific targeted therapy difficult to establish. Further longitudinal clinical studies are required to identify any potential therapeutic that targets the intestinal microbiome.

### Extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease [^1169sN1K]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Extra-intestinal manifestations occur in at least 25% of Crohn's disease patients. Some extra-intestinal manifestations, such as erythema nodusum and peripheral arthropathy, will wax and wane in keeping with bowel inflammation. The more severe cutaneous ulcerations, uveitis, and axial arthropathy may precede bowel disease or persist after it subsides. Screening may be appropriate for eye disease and for osteoporosis to prevent complications. Medical management for extra-intestinal manifestations is similar to treatment for the bowel symptoms of Crohn's disease, with corticosteroids the mainstay. Pain and depression are associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and their control benefits patients. Recent small studies with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are promising for most extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease, and may permit more steroid-sparing disease control in the future.

Important causes include "Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, HSV, VZV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Treponema pallidum". For retinitis, "T. gondii and CMV are the most common etiologic agents" and "Toxoplasmosis accounts for ~90% of all focal necrotizing retinitis". Regarding CMV viral load interpretation, "what represents a positive CMV viral load and a high CMV viral load will vary among laboratories", so "Physicians should consult the laboratory performing the CMV viral load for assistance with test interpretation", and "Patients with detectable CMV viral loads have a higher likelihood of retinal disease progression".

### The link between gastrointestinal microbiome and ocular disorders [^113VgGr5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The field of ophthalmology is among the fastest developing areas in medicine. Numerous pathologies are investigated for possible inciting factors with well-established diseases to tailor appropriate management protocols. One of the potential triggers is the gut microbiota. Changes in gut microbiota composition, as evidenced from stool samples of patients with eye pathologies, are correlated with ocular inflammation. In this article, we explore different mechanisms believed to be responsible for this, possible treatment modalities, and how a holistic approach to various ophthalmic conditions could potentially alter patient health outcomes.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116VP4YV]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Microsporidiosis — clinical manifestations focus on gastrointestinal (GI) tract infection with diarrhea and multisystem involvement by species. The most common manifestation is gastrointestinal (GI) tract infection, and microsporidia-associated diarrhea is described as intermittent, copious, watery, and non-bloody with crampy abdominal pain and uncommon fever, and chronic severe diarrhea can result in dehydration, malnutrition, and failure to thrive, while species-specific patterns include E. bieneusi associated with malabsorption, diarrhea, pulmonary disease, and cholangitis; E. cuniculi associated with hepatitis, encephalitis, peritonitis, keratoconjunctivitis, sinusitis, osteomyelitis, pulmonary disease, and disseminated disease; Encephalitozoon (syn Septata) intestinalis associated with diarrhea, cholangitis, dermatitis, disseminated infection, and superficial keratoconjunctivitis; and E. hellem associated with superficial keratoconjunctivitis, sinusitis, respiratory disease, prostatic abscesses, nephritis, urethritis, cystitis, and disseminated infection, with disease also occurring in multiple other organs and as disseminated disease.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^1117PMLn]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

After contact with the virus, the asymptomatic incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days with an average of 8 to 10 days. EVD is typically characterized by an initial fever, myalgias and fatigue, progressing to gastro-intestinal symptoms (diarrhoea and vomiting) and eventually a fatal multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. During acute infection, ocular manifestations include conjunctival injection (48–58%; often bilateral), subconjunctival haemorrhages and vision loss of unclear origin.

An important clinical sequel has surfaced in survivors, termed the 'post-Ebola virus disease syndrome'. This commonly manifests with ocular disease (60%), and may be accompanied by arthritis, hearing loss, abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric disorders as well as viral persistence in immune-privileged organs. Uveitis is the most common ocular complication, occurring in ~13–34% of EVD survivors in West Africa within the first 12 weeks (but sometimes even after a year) following convalescence. This commonly presents with eye pain, redness and photophobia and may lead to acute or chronic vision loss, with a unilateral predominance. Within uveitis, case series quote variable prevalence statistics, overall indicating anterior uveitis as most frequent, followed by posterior uveitis, and rarely panuveitis. Slit lamp examination often shows non-specific signs of active or past ocular inflammation e.g. posterior synechiae, keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cell and flare and conjunctival injection. Multimodal imaging including fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to evaluate retinal lesions in posterior or panuveitis. A case series evaluating 14 EVD survivors noted retinal lesions that were predominantly non-pigmented with perilesional areas of dark without pressure, and peripapillary lesions that exhibited variable curvatures respecting the horizontal raphe and sparing the fovea. OCT showed abnormalities of the outer retinal layers (Fig. 1). In these uncontrolled cohorts, risk factors predicting uveitis include conjunctival injection, and a high viral load (corresponding to a low cycling threshold on reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis) during acute EVD, and advanced age. The PREVAIL III prospective cohort study in Liberia found that survivors exhibited more frequent uveitis than controls, and the prevalence increased during follow-up (at enrolment, 26.4% vs. 12.1%; at year 1, 33.3% vs. 15.4%). Neuro-ophthalmic complications are also possible, including optic neuropathy and ocular motility disorders. Other ophthalmic sequelae include episcleritis, interstitial keratitis and cataract.

### Diagnosis and treatment of extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease [^111BdP3n]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating disorder that can manifest in many ways and affect multiple organ systems outside the gastrointestinal tract. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are common in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and include dermatologic, musculoskeletal, ophthalmologic, and hepatobiliary systems. This study reviews details the most common EIMs of IBD, including their presentation, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment considerations.

### Diagnostic techniques for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future: a review [^116tW2tt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

In active endogenous uveitis, elevated immunoglobulins have also been detected both from the sera as well as aqueous. Elevated IgG, IgM and IgA levels have been measured in acute anterior uveitis. Likewise, elevated non-specific IgG and IgA from aqueous has also been detected. It has been proposed that the presence of IgA response suggests an environmental or infectious aetiology acting across a mucosal tissue. However the lack of pathogen-specificity do not support an infective pathogenesis. On the other hand, the presence of elevated IgG antibodies, especially the detection of anti-retinal IgG antibodies, reinforces an autoimmune pathogenesis in "idiopathic" and non-infectious posterior uveitides.

Multiresistant Shigella flexneri isolates were cultured from the cornea and stool of a girl. Genetic analysis showed the isolates were identical. Shigella spp. are rare causes of ulcerative keratitis; there have only been 14 published cases since 1943. Although prognosis after local treatment is good, shigellosis is a systemic infection, possibly leading to dehydration.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^116iSKhW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Crohn's disease (CD) clinical features and diagnosis — Key concept: Hallmark/cardinal symptoms of CD include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue and weight loss, fever, growth failure, anemia, recurrent fistulas, or extraintestinal manifestations can also be presenting features. The most common symptom of CD is chronic diarrhea, but some patients may not experience this symptom. Key concept: CD is diagnosed clinically; there are no truly pathognomonic features, and endoscopic, radiographic, and histologic criteria with evidence of chronic intestinal inflammation will be present. Key concept: Extraintestinal manifestations of CD include arthropathy, dermatological, ocular, and hepatobiliary disease (primary sclerosing cholangitis), and other extraintestinal complications include thromboembolic events, metabolic bone disease, osteoporosis, cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis, and other immune-mediated diseases (asthma, chronic bronchitis, pericarditis, psoriasis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis).

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^116P5WoH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

Uveitis can be either infectious or noninfectious; whilst both may present with similar clinical features, they are best considered as distinct disease entities since the underlying pathophysiology and treatment strategies are very different.

Whilst common in the developing world, infectious causes account for the minority of uveitis cases presenting to tertiary referral centers in the West. Infectious causes include organisms such as toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, and herpes viruses. Local infection results in foreign antigen presentation to ocular immune cells, with appropriate immune activation aimed at clearing the invading organism. Uveitis occurs as a secondary effect of this immune activation.

Noninfectious uveitis is thought to result from inappropriate activation of the immune systemand it is therefore not surprising that it is often associated with systemic autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), sarcoidosis, or Behçet's Disease (BD). In the remainder, however, no such systemic association is identified; these cases are generally labeled as "idiopathic" in recognition of the fact that the autoimmune/autoinflammatory origin of most of these cases is presumed rather than proven. Human data and experimental models indicate parallel changes in the inflammatory milieu of the intraocular microenvironment. Uveitis may be induced in animal models by a range of mechanisms that cause differentiation of naïve CD4+ T-cells to pathogenic effector cells, resulting in tissue damage.–Although similar pathogenic effector cells have been recovered from ocular fluids and tissue in human uveitis, the evidence for autoreactive T-cells (such as seen in the animal models) is much more limited.

Such idiopathic cases account for the largest cohort of patients seen in most clinical practices in the West. In a retrospective study of all uveitis cases presenting to a tertiary center, Rodriguez et al reported 34% to be idiopathic, 10.4% to be associated with seronegative spondyloarthropathies, and 9.6% to be associated with sarcoidosis, although it should be noted that certain conditions are typically associated with particular anatomical groups, such as anterior uveitis with seronegative spondyloarthropathies. It is also of interest to note that, in a report from the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases (SITE) retrospective study of US tertiary uveitis services, the leading systemic associations in 4,911 patients with uveitis were sarcoidosis (7%), seronegative spondyloarthropathy (5%), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (5%), and BD (3%).

### Ocular manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease [^113PNYsF]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) occur in one third of patients. Ocular complications are infrequent, occurring in less than 10% of cases, but can be associated with significant morbidity, including blindness. Ocular complaints are often nonspecific; clinical relevance may not be appreciated by patient or physician and, thus, be misdiagnosed. Evaluation of the eye should be a routine component in the care of patients with IBD. Clinicians must be aware of the spectrum of ocular symptoms and know that these complaints may precede a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). We review ocular pathology in IBD to alert clinicians to the diverse, at times confusing, spectrum of eye disorders associated with these diseases. Clinical manifestations include blurred vision, teary, burning or itchy eyes, ocular pain, photophobia, conjunctival or scleral hyperemia, loss of visual acuity, and possible blindness. Many patients are unaware that IBD has a risk of eye complications and, therefore, patient education is vital.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Microsporidiosis in HIV-exposed or HIV-infected children — clinical manifestations are dominated by gastrointestinal (GI) tract infection, with microsporidia-associated diarrhea described as intermittent, copious, watery, and non-bloody; it may be accompanied by crampy abdominal pain, fever is uncommon, and chronic severe diarrhea can result in dehydration, malnutrition, and failure to thrive. Disease can involve multiple organs and be disseminated, and different infecting species have distinct associations: E. bieneusi with malabsorption, diarrhea, pulmonary disease, and cholangitis; E. cuniculi with hepatitis, encephalitis, peritonitis, keratoconjunctivitis, sinusitis, osteomyelitis, pulmonary disease, and disseminated disease; Encephalitozoon (syn Septata) intestinalis with diarrhea, cholangitis, dermatitis, disseminated infection, and superficial keratoconjunctivitis; E. hellem with superficial keratoconjunctivitis, sinusitis, respiratory disease, prostatic abscesses, nephritis, urethritis, cystitis, and disseminated infection; Nosema, Vittaforma, and Microsporidium spp. with stromal keratitis following trauma in immunocompetent hosts; Pleistophora, Anncaliia, and Trachipleistophora spp. with myositis; and Trachipleistophora spp. also with encephalitis, cardiac disease, and disseminated disease.

### Uveitis manifestations in patients of the Swiss inflammatory bowel disease cohort study [^113Z4PR8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) affecting joints, skin, eyes and the biliary duct represent a common feature in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Depending on the organ affected and their severity, EIMs can be even more devastating for the patient than the actual intestinal disease. According to the literature between up to 40% of patients with IBD suffer from at least one EIM during the disease course. The activity of some EIMs runs in parallel to the activity of intestinal inflammation, such as episcleritis, peripheral arthritis, erythema nodosum and aphthous ulcers; however, the activity of others such as uveitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), pyoderma gangrenosum and spondyloarthropathy, is independent of intestinal disease activity.– About 25% of patients with IBD suffer from more than one EIM.

Importantly, EIMs may sometimes even occur before the onset of intestinal disease and diagnosis of IBD. The pathogenesis of IBD-related EIMs to date is only poorly understood; however, a current hypothesis suggests that shared epitopes between the inflamed intestinal mucosa and extraintestinal tissue significantly contribute to the occurrence of EIMs. Further, genetic factors might critically contribute to the onset of EIMs because EIMs are associated with genetic risk variants. Particularly, the onset of ocular EIMs is associated with variations in the gene loci encoding HLA-B27 and HLA-B58. Further evidence for a genetic background comes from case-control studies and epidemiologic investigations.

After manifestations in joints and skin, the eye is the third major organ affected by immune-mediated EIMs. About 4–10% of patients with IBD suffer from ocular EIMs, with the majority having concomitant Crohn's disease (CD). Episcleritis is the most frequent ocular manifestation of IBD, affecting 2–5% of patients with IBD. It is characterized by an increased activity in parallel with increased intestinal inflammation. In contrast, uveitis is independent from intestinal disease and is present in up to 3% of patients with IBD. It frequently precedes IBD diagnosis and is associated mainly with peripheral arthritis and is more common in women than men. A much rarer condition is scleritis, which is not related to intestinal disease activity and may either precede IBD diagnosis or occur thereafter. Other rare ocular manifestations in patients with IBD are keratinopathy and retinopathy/chorioretinopathy.

### Infectious uveitis in Virginia [^112kRjNe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis includes a wide range of inflammatory eye diseases representing a diverse set of both infectious and non-infectious etiologies. Globally, uveitis accounts for up to 25% of blindness. Although this percentage is lower in developed countries than in developing countries, uveitis still accounts for 10%–15% of blindness in the United States, representing a devastating loss of quality of life and productivity to those affected.–

Infectious uveitis includes bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic etiologies. The prevalence of specific infectious etiologies varies historically and with geographic location. In the West, infectious uveitis is often associated with systemic diseases, including diseases caused by Toxoplasma gondii, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) and, less often, syphilis and tuberculosis (TB). Previous studies from around the world have focused primarily on describing the incidence and prevalence of all uveitis etiologies at different referral centers. Studies of infectious uveitis have either focused on a specific infectious etiology or on a specific demographic variable.–This retrospective, observational study was performed in order to report all infectious uveitis cases at the University of Virginia, a mid-Atlantic US tertiary referral center, over a 30-year period and to analyze the causes, clinical features, and outcomes in this population.

### Unraveling the link between inflammatory bowel disease and perianal abscess: insights from bidirectional and multivariable mendelian randomization study [^1156hfhb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic immune-mediated disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, is principally categorized into two distinct clinical entities: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These subtypes exhibit heterogeneous phenotypic manifestations ranging from mild localized inflammation to severe transmural or extensive colonic involvement. A pronounced epidemiological shift in IBD emerged in the mid-to-late 20th century, with incidence rates rising substantially throughout industrialized North America and Europe. UC and CD demonstrate systemic inflammatory effects extending beyond their primary gastrointestinal pathology, manifesting with diverse extraintestinal involvement. Characteristic immune-mediated manifestations include dermatologic (such as erythema nodosum), ophthalmologic (such as uveitis), hepatobiliary (such as primary sclerosing cholangitis), and musculoskeletal complications (such as peripheral arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis), reflecting the multisystem nature of inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis. Accumulating epidemiological evidence indicates a rising global incidence of IBD, with pronounced acceleration in rapidly industrializing regions. This trend imposes a substantial lifelong disease burden, compounded by the lack of disease-modifying therapies and the incomplete elucidation of its multifactorial pathophysiology.

### Intrafamilial circulation of tropheryma whipplei, France [^1153UMSm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Whipple disease, a rare sporadic disease, was first considered a metabolic disease and later suspected to be an infectious disease caused by a rare bacterium, Tropheryma whipplei. However, the causative bacterium is common, and the well-known and classic form of Whipple disease (characterized by periodic acid–Schiff-stained bacilli in infected small-bowel macrophages) represents only 1 rare clinical form of infection caused by T. whipplei. In the absence of intestinal lesions, T. whipplei is involved in subacute or chronic infections, such as endocarditis, encephalitis, uveitis, adenopathy, and osteoarticular infections. Recently, T. whipplei was reported to cause acute infections, such as pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and bacteremia. Asymptomatic carriers have been identified for whom T. whipplei prevalence varied widely by geography or occupation. In Europe, the prevalence of T. whipplei in fecal samples from the general healthy adult population is ≈1%–11%. T. whipplei has been detected in sewage and is more prevalent in fecal samples of sewer workers (12%–26%) than in the general population (4%). In a study in 2 rural Senegalese villages, 44% of children 2–10 years of age carried T. whipplei in their feces.

T. whipplei genotyping has shown high genetic diversity unrelated to pathogenicity, but this diversity varies geographically between Europe and Africa. Some clones circulate in particular communities, suggesting interhuman transmissibility. Moreover, the chronic carriage of T. whipplei in saliva and feces suggests that the bacterium might be transmissible within the same family. This question was raised to one of us (D.R.) by a person who had chronic carriage of T. whipplei in his saliva and was concerned about his family. The development of T. whipplei serologic assays has enabled delineation between patients with Whipple disease who lack or have weak immune responses against T. whipplei and asymptomatic carriers who show strong immune response to the bacterium.

To identify T. whipplei within families, during 2003–2011 we conducted molecular and serologic investigations on samples from the families of patients who had chronic T. whipplei infection and were asymptomatic carriers. We also studied T. whipplei seroprevalence in the population of France, which enabled us to compare the prevalence with that of the families.

### Uveal effusion associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection presenting as bilateral angle closure glaucoma [^111zWcMv]. Journal of Glaucoma (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

We present a case in which a gastrointestinal infection with Campylobacter jejuni presented as acute angle closure glaucoma secondary to the uveal effusion syndrome.

Method

A 58-year-old white man presented with acute angle closure and raised pressure in both the eyes along with diarrhea. Ultrasound B-scans showed choroidal effusion. Stool culture grew C. jejuni.

Results

A 3-week treatment with topical steroids and antiglaucoma medication resolved the condition. He was also treated with oral antibiotics.

Conclusion

C. jejuni has not been isolated earlier in a case of uveal effusion presenting as secondary angle closure glaucoma. In this respect our case is unique.

### Reclassifying idiopathic uveitis: lessons from a tertiary uveitis center [^112Po2q3]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Idiopathic uveitis is frequently the most common diagnosis in series from uveitis clinics. This study sought to determine the percentage of patients initially diagnosed as idiopathic, noninfectious uveitis referred to a tertiary uveitis center who were subsequently found to have an identifiable cause of uveitis.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

We performed a computerized database analysis of 179 consecutive patients who were referred to our practice with the diagnosis of idiopathic, noninfectious uveitis between 2008 and 2016. Patients were evaluated by a thorough history and ophthalmic examination with selected laboratory testing targeted by clues from the history and examination. Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria were used to better assess different types of uveitis.

Results

Fifty-two out of 179 (29.0%) patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic uveitis were subsequently diagnosed with an underlying condition. Among patients referred with a diagnosis of idiopathic disease, female patients were most commonly affected (121/179; 67.6%). Among subsequent diagnoses, sarcoidosis was the most common (19/52 or 36.5%), followed by HLA-B27-associated uveitis (11/52, 21.1%), infectious uveitis (6/52, 11.5%), tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (6/52, 11.5%), and juvenile idiopathic uveitis (4/52, 7.7%). Other diagnosable conditions included Behçet disease, multifocal choroiditis, panuveitis, Crohn disease, multiple sclerosis, and relapsing polychondritis. An underlying condition was not found in 127 of 179 (70.9%) patients.

Conclusions

We report that 29% of patients referred to our tertiary uveitis center diagnosed as "idiopathic" had an associated identifiable cause. Identifying an underlying condition associated with uveitis could be potentially lifesaving for some illnesses (eg, sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement) and is critical to management (eg, infection). Although we were able to use limited testing to classify many patients who had been previously incorrectly labeled with idiopathic uveitis, idiopathic uveitis remains the most common diagnosis in our uveitis clinic.

### Risedronate sodium [^112ukH2N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute Phase Reactions: Symptoms consistent with acute phase reaction have been reported with bisphosphonate use. The overall incidence of acute phase reaction was 3.6% of patients on risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily and 7.6% of patients on risedronate sodium tablets 75 mg two consecutive days per month. These incidence rates are based on reporting of any of 33 acute phase reaction-like symptoms within 5 days of the first dose. Fever or influenza-like illness with onset within the same period were reported by 0.0% of patients on risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily and 0.6% of patients on risedronate sodium tablets 75 mg two consecutive days per month.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Events: The risedronate sodium tablets 75 mg two consecutive days per month group resulted in a higher incidence of discontinuation due to vomiting (1.0% versus 0.2%) and diarrhea (1.0% versus 0.3%) compared to the risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily group. Most of these events occurred within a few days of dosing.

Ocular Adverse Events: None of the patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets 75 mg two consecutive days per month reported ocular inflammation such as uveitis, scleritis, or iritis; 1 patient treated with risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily reported uveitis.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea — adults and children: In immunocompetent children and adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea while waiting for results of investigations is not recommended (strong, low), except for infants < 3 months of age with suspicion of a bacterial etiology; ill immunocompetent people with fever documented in a medical setting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery presumptively due to Shigella; and people who have recently travelled internationally with body temperatures ≥ 38.5°C and/or signs of sepsis (weak, low). When indicated, the empiric antimicrobial therapy in adults should be either a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin, depending on the local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate), and empiric therapy for children includes a third-generation cephalosporin for infants < 3 months of age and others with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin, depending on local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric antibacterial treatment should be considered in immunocompromised people with severe illness and bloody diarrhea (strong, low), and asymptomatic contacts of people with bloody diarrhea should not be offered empiric treatment but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate).
