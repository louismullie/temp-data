## Question

treatment of cocaine use disorder outpatient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outpatient treatment for cocaine use disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming diagnosis and outpatient appropriateness. Then, I should set patient-centered goals using measurement-based care. Next, I will review first-line psychosocial treatments, with a special focus on contingency management and how to pair it with CBT or CRA. After that, I need to consider pharmacologic adjuncts, clarifying what to prioritize and what to avoid. I will also examine co-occurring opioid use disorder management without withholding MOUD. Finally, I should outline monitoring, retention, relapse prevention, and special populations, ensuring each step is evidence-based and practical for outpatient care.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic and placement step. Hold on, I should verify that DSM-5 criteria are applied to confirm cocaine use disorder and that severity is assessed, while also evaluating medical, psychiatric, and social context to ensure outpatient safety and feasibility; this also means documenting a baseline (urine drug tests, craving scale, withdrawal symptoms, function) to support measurement-based care and track change over time, including DSM-5 remission specifiers for early and sustained remission during follow-up [^115KksrA].

> I need to ensure patient-centered goals are set next. Wait, let me verify that the plan includes collaboratively defining abstinence as the primary objective when feasible, articulating harm-reduction targets when necessary, and establishing 3- and 12-month milestones, with objective monitoring intervals every 2–4 weeks to enable timely treatment adjustments, feedback to the patient, and stepped-intensity care if progress stalls or worsens [^115KksrA] [^112bTt2j] [^115T49BC].

> Next, I should review psychosocial first-line care. I almost said CBT alone is sufficient for most, but hold on, the strongest evidence commands that contingency management be a primary component and be combined with another behavioral therapy such as CBT, the Community Reinforcement Approach, or a structured Matrix Model when appropriate; I should confirm the guidelines concur that psychosocial approaches are the foundation of outpatient treatment for stimulant use disorders including cocaine [^115fzv9S] [^111cuirm] [^112L1Kpk] [^1113aEJa].

> I will now examine contingency management details. Wait, I should double-check that effect sizes are small-to-moderate at end-of-treatment and that higher-value incentives improve outcomes; indeed, meta-analytic data report Cohen's d around 0.46, with better abstinence when adequate voucher magnitude is used and with typical durations around 12–16 weeks, and I should not forget that effects tend to dissipate after discontinuation, so pairing CM with CRA/CBT and building naturalistic reinforcers is crucial for durability [^114wx4JJ] [^115T49BC] [^116Jt4VY] [^117KcD4L].

> Let me consider how to pair therapies. I should confirm that CBT targets cognitions and behaviors linked to use, CRA systematically cultivates non-drug reinforcers across work, relationships, and recreation, and the Matrix Model provides a more intensive 16-week structure for moderate-to-severe presentations; if CM access is limited, CBT or CRA alone is still reasonable, though defaulting to CM plus one of these modalities is preferred when available [^111cuirm] [^112L1Kpk] [^115fzv9S].

> Now, pharmacologic adjuncts require careful prioritization. Wait, I almost implied there are FDA-approved medications for CUD — there are none; I should correct that and emphasize medication is adjunctive to psychosocial care. With that in mind, I should consider bupropion when appropriate, as guidelines recommend considering it to promote abstinence, especially with co-occurring depression or tobacco use; disulfiram may increase abstinence in motivated, adherent patients without significant liver disease; modafinil's evidence is mixed overall but may reduce craving or help sleep and could benefit a subgroup with co-occurring alcohol use; gabapentin and amantadine have limited and low-quality evidence and should be reserved for select cases such as prominent withdrawal/anxiety or severe withdrawal phenotypes while monitoring closely [^116cWrvR] [^117T5CCL] [^116Z9o5q] [^113pvoCB] [^116dVjVH] [^112cJdzB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antidepressants in general. I should double-check that broad classes of antidepressants have not shown consistent benefit for CUD and that nefazodone failed to demonstrate efficacy while increasing adverse events, which means routine use of antidepressants for cocaine outcomes is not recommended unless treating a comorbid mood disorder, where selection like bupropion may be preferable based on dual indications and the guideline signal [^116nWjZe] [^114zYKAA] [^116cWrvR].

> Let me outline a practical medication decision flow without overpromising. First optimize CM with CBT or CRA; if response is inadequate after a defined interval with objective monitoring, consider adding bupropion as first-line adjunct; if co-occurring alcohol use disorder is present and motivation/adherence are high, consider disulfiram, or consider a modafinil trial when alcohol use is comorbid or sleep normalization is a clinical priority; reserve gabapentin or amantadine for specific symptom-driven indications; throughout, I need to monitor cravings, urine results, mood, sleep, adverse effects, and adherence every 2–4 weeks, and de-prescribe agents that do not demonstrate benefit while reinforcing psychosocial engagement [^115fzv9S] [^116cWrvR] [^117T5CCL] [^116Z9o5q] [^115KksrA].

> But wait, what if the patient also has opioid use disorder, which is common with cocaine use. I should confirm we never withhold methadone or buprenorphine because of ongoing stimulant use, that no clear superiority exists between methadone and buprenorphine for reducing concurrent cocaine use, and that we can target stimulant abstinence with CM during MOUD; I also need to prescribe benzodiazepines with extreme caution in MOUD patients and increase supports if polysubstance use persists [^111q2quV] [^116nT1dR] [^114wx4JJ] [^116qthdR].

> Next, I should review structured measurement-based care to guide decisions. Let me verify that we reassess every 2–4 weeks using urine drug screens for benzoylecgonine, validated craving measures, withdrawal and sleep assessments, and functional outcomes; as the patient improves, continue current care and plan for relapse prevention, and if progress plateaus or worsens, increase psychosocial intensity and consider or adjust pharmacotherapy; I need to ensure DSM-5 remission status is documented at 3 and 12 months for early and sustained remission, and feed back results to the patient to enhance engagement [^115KksrA] [^112bTt2j] [^115T49BC].

> Retention is critical; I should double-check practical strategies that improve continuity. Transportation assistance, flexible scheduling, and telehealth for stable phases can mitigate logistical barriers; case management, peer recovery support, and family involvement can enhance engagement; early dropout risk is highest in the first month, so proactive outreach after missed visits is warranted, while recognizing that evidence for generic psychosocial add-ons improving MOUD retention is mixed, highlighting the importance of targeted, patient-specific supports [^112NFawX] [^112EppL2].

> I will now examine relapse prevention and continuing care. Wait, I need to ensure we plan the step-down deliberately as remission stabilizes, gradually tapering CM while bolstering CRA-derived natural reinforcers and continuing CBT skills practice; I should acknowledge CM effects often wane after discontinuation, so strengthening employment, education, social, and recreational reinforcement before CM ends is essential, and linking to mutual-help options like 12-step or SMART Recovery can sustain gains [^116Jt4VY] [^111cuirm] [^117KcD4L].

> Special populations deserve tailored planning. For co-occurring bipolar disorder, I might reconsider whether lamotrigine or quetiapine augmentation could help mood stability and indirectly reduce cocaine use, though the data are small and open-label and thus hypothesis-generating rather than definitive; for pregnancy, referral to specialized programs is prudent; for adolescents and those with criminal justice involvement, family-inclusive CRA and structured CM can be adapted to context, always aligning with patient preference and availability [^113LkbFu] [^112GPXe7] [^112L1Kpk].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and medical comorbidity management are integrated. Cocaine confers significant cardiovascular and multisystem risk, so coordination with primary care and cardiology as indicated, and education about acute toxicity, are necessary alongside addiction treatment, reinforcing that comprehensive care reduces morbidity while the addiction plan targets sustained behavior change [^112mLDEQ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the outpatient algorithm remains clear: confirm CUD with DSM-5 and outpatient appropriateness; set measurable, patient-centered goals; implement contingency management paired with CBT or CRA as first-line; monitor using measurement-based care every 2–4 weeks; if inadequate response, add targeted pharmacologic adjuncts starting with bupropion, considering disulfiram or modafinil in specific contexts, and reserving symptom-driven agents cautiously; manage co-occurring OUD without withholding MOUD and use CM to target stimulants; prioritize retention, plan for CM discontinuation with strengthened natural reinforcers, and maintain continuing care for relapse prevention; throughout, keep verifying progress and adjusting the plan based on objective data and patient preference [^115fzv9S] [^111cuirm] [^1113aEJa] [^115KksrA] [^116cWrvR].

Outpatient treatment for cocaine use disorder should prioritize **contingency management (CM)** [^115fzv9S] as the most effective intervention [^1113aEJa], with **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** and the **community reinforcement approach (CRA)** [^112L1Kpk] as key adjuncts [^111cuirm]. No medications are **FDA-approved for CUD** [^112mLDEQ], but bupropion may be considered for some patients [^116cWrvR]. Care should be **individualized**, with regular urine testing [^115T49BC], measurement-based care [^115T49BC], and integration of medical and psychiatric services to address comorbidities and enhance retention.

---

## Psychosocial interventions

### Contingency management (CM)

Effectiveness: CM is the most effective outpatient intervention for CUD [^1113aEJa], providing tangible rewards for cocaine-negative urine samples [^114wx4JJ] and significantly increasing **abstinence and retention** [^115fzv9S] [^111cuirm]. Implementation: Use voucher- or prize-based systems with **escalating rewards** [^117KcD4L] and reset contingencies to maximize effectiveness.

---

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

Effectiveness: CBT is effective for CUD [^111cuirm], targeting triggers, cravings, and **relapse prevention** [^1113aEJa] through skill-building and cognitive restructuring [^112L1Kpk]. Implementation: Deliver CBT individually or in groups, often alongside CM for **synergistic effects** [^116Jt4VY].

---

### Community reinforcement approach (CRA)

Effectiveness: CRA [^112L1Kpk] enhances social, vocational, and recreational **reinforcement for abstinence** [^111cuirm] and is especially effective when combined with CM [^117KcD4L] [^116Jt4VY]. Implementation: Integrate CRA with CM and CBT for **comprehensive care** [^1113aEJa].

---

### Matrix model

Effectiveness: The Matrix Model [^111cuirm] combines CBT, CM, family education, and 12-step support and is recommended for outpatient CUD care [^1113aEJa]. Implementation: Provide **structured, multicomponent care** over 16–20 weeks.

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Currently, **no medications are FDA-approved for CUD** [^112mLDEQ], though some may be considered in specific contexts:

| **Medication** | **Evidence summary** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Bupropion | May promote abstinence in some patients [^116cWrvR] [^112bR4Qs] | Consider for patients with comorbid depression or nicotine dependence |
| Disulfiram | - Mixed evidence <br/> - May increase abstinence in some trials [^117T5CCL] | Consider for patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder |
| Modafinil | - Mixed evidence <br/> - May reduce craving in some subgroups [^116Z9o5q] [^113pvoCB] | Consider for patients with severe withdrawal symptoms |
| Amantadine | May reduce use in patients with severe withdrawal [^112cJdzB] | Consider for patients with severe withdrawal symptoms |
| Gabapentin | - Limited evidence <br/> - May reduce use in psychiatric populations [^116dVjVH] [^112bR4Qs] | Consider for patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are **essential** in outpatient CUD treatment [^115T49BC]:

- **Urine drug testing**: Conduct regular testing [^114wx4JJ] to monitor use and reinforce abstinence.

- **Measurement-based care**: Use standardized tools [^112bTt2j] to track symptoms, cravings, and functioning, and adjust treatment accordingly.

- **Relapse prevention**: Provide ongoing support, including booster sessions and access to peer support [^116Jt4VY].

---

## Addressing comorbidities

Comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions are common and **require integrated care** [^112L1Kpk]. Psychiatric comorbidities should be treated by addressing co-occurring **depression, anxiety, and ADHD** with appropriate pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, while **medical comorbidities** are managed through coordinated care for cardiovascular, infectious, and other medical issues.

---

## Barriers and facilitators

Several factors influence **outpatient treatment success**. Key **barriers** include stigma, limited access, financial constraints, and lack of social support, whereas **facilitators** include a strong therapeutic alliance, family involvement, and integrated services [^1113aEJa].

---

## Emerging treatments

Emerging treatments show promise but **require further research**: preliminary trials of **cannabidiol (CBD)** show no significant benefit [^114CzBzM], and **GLP-1 receptor agonists** appear feasible in early case series but require larger trials [^115hjvoj].

---

Outpatient treatment for cocaine use disorder should **prioritize CM, CBT, and CRA**, with individualized care, regular monitoring, and integrated management of comorbidities [^1113aEJa].

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^117LwsHF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly in relation to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend planning and monitoring the transition from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine.

- **Transitioning from antagonist to agonist therapies**: Understand that transitioning from an antagonist, such as naltrexone, to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complex than moving from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist. This is due to the absence of physical dependence with antagonist treatment, eliminating the risk of precipitated withdrawal. When initiating methadone or buprenorphine, begin with low initial doses as patients transitioning from naltrexone will not have developed physical dependence on opioids.

The transition should not occur until naltrexone is sufficiently cleared from the patient's system, approximately 1 day for oral naltrexone, or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically in relation to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not using oral naltrexone for the treatment of OUD, except under very limited circumstances due to poor medication adherence. Its use should be reserved for patients able to comply with special techniques to enhance adherence, such as observed dosing. It is recognized that extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces but does not eliminate issues with medication adherence.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^115KksrA]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Establishing a clinical diagnosis will always be an essential clinical task, but even minimal probing for additional information for each endorsed item can provide valuable insight for care planning, delivery, and adaptation as treatment progresses. Each symptom can be extensible with further probing questions as needed, including the administration of a clinical instrument developed for treatment planning.

To the best of our knowledge, the DSM-5 OUD working group selected a 3-month point for evaluation of early remission because it has long been believed that this is the point from which clinically meaningful outcomes are observed. We think this is sensible, but we also recommend evaluation at 6 months from treatment initiation. 'Stable remission' is assigned to someone who has no OUD symptoms for at least 12 months (not including craving and discounting tolerance and withdrawal, if enrolled in and fully compliant with MOUD). A specifier denotes whether the person is living in a controlled medical or custodial setting. For those patients retained in longer-term treatment, it would seem reasonable to expect that a remission status evaluation is performed twice-yearly and at exit.

### Contingency management for patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114wx4JJ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

- **Polysubstance use**: Twenty-three studies tested the efficacy of contingency management for increasing abstinence from two or more drugs. Contingency management was associated with increased abstinence at the end-of-treatment assessment in 16 studies (70%). Notably, psychomotor stimulants were among the drugs targeted in all of these studies.

The type of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) varied across studies. Methadone was prescribed in 13 studies (57%), buprenorphine in 6 (26%), naltrexone in 2 (9%), levacetylmethadol in 1 (4%), and combined methadone and buprenorphine in 2 (9%). The mean (SD) contingency management duration was 14.3 (7.0) weeks, and the mean (SD) maximum daily earnings was $10.63 ($7.45).

Sufficient information to calculate effect sizes was available for 18 out of 23 studies (78%). Contingency management was associated with an overall small-to-medium effect size on abstinence compared with controls at the end-of-treatment assessment (Cohen's d = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30–0.62; I² = 64.8%).

- **Illicit opioids**: Eleven studies tested the efficacy of contingency management for increasing abstinence from illicit opioid use. Contingency management was associated with increased abstinence at the end of treatment in 7 studies (64%).

Methadone was prescribed in 9 studies (82%), buprenorphine in 1 (9%), and naltrexone in 1 (9%). The mean (SD) contingency management duration was 13.9 (7.2) weeks, and the mean (SD) maximum daily…

### Retrospective analysis of the diagnostic yield of newborn drug testing [^116cdRJa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Non-medical drug use includes amphetamines (amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy), benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, and opioids used outside of health professional outpatient prescription or inpatient administration.

This category was for untreated maternal psychiatric illness (e.g. major depression, bipolar disorder) excluding non-medical drug use.

Abbreviations: HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.

Cases for which newborn drug testing was performed solely due to the presence of either untreated maternal psychiatric illness and/or unexplained prematurity (i.e. no other risk factors present) were significantly less frequent in Group C (1.7%) versus Group A (30.5%), Group B (37.1%), or Group D (26.1%).

### Characteristics of an outpatient treatment sample by primary substance of abuse [^115tdYPu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This study examines sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as a function of the primary substance of abuse among clients approached, screened, and assessed for eligibility in a 10-site effectiveness trial of a web-based psychosocial intervention for substance use disorders. Consistent with the design of effectiveness trials, the eligibility criteria were broad, and exclusion criteria were minimal; thus, the recruited sample may be viewed as relatively representative of patients seeking treatment throughout the United States.

- **Methods**: χ tests for categorical variables and F tests for continuous variables were used to analyze demographic, substance use, physical and mental health, and sexual risk data collected at screening and baseline. Pairwise comparisons between primary substance subgroups for baseline data were conducted if the test statistic P value was 0.01 or less.

- **Results**: Few participants expressed disinterest in the study at screening because of the computer-assisted intervention. A diverse sample of substance users completed baseline and were enrolled: 22.9% marijuana, 21.7% opiates, 20.9% alcohol, 20.5% cocaine, and 13.9% stimulants users. Marijuana users demonstrated the greatest differences across primary substances: they were younger, less likely to be married or attend 12-step meetings, and more likely to be in treatment as a result of criminal justice involvement. All patients, even marijuana users, reported comparable rates of co-occurring mental health disorders and sexual risk and substantial rates of polysubstance use disorders.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^115T49BC]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

In this Addiction Debate article, we describe the concept, clinical procedures, and probable benefits of a simple measurement-based care (MBC) approach for opioid use disorder (OUD). MBC can be applied to any treatment in the substance use disorders field; however, we focus on first-line medications delivered in primary care and specialist clinics. This focus is due to the opioid crisis and the dramatic increase in fatal opioid-related poisonings in the United States, Canada, Australia, and several other countries in Europe, which have led to an urgent call to increase provision in primary care. Additionally, a national initiative in the United States aims to increase the capacity and integration of treatment in hospitals, state health departments, specialist programs, and the criminal justice system.

MBC is an evidence-based healthcare practice in which disease symptoms, signs, or biomarkers are used to inform clinical actions, with feedback given to patients about their progress in treatment to increase engagement, adherence, and beneficial exposure to evidence-based therapies. Physical health conditions are almost always treated like this (e.g. hypertension and diabetes, in which blood pressure and glycated haemoglobin, respectively, are primary biomarkers in clinical practice).

In mental health, many clinical decisions are guided by the presence and severity of patient-reported symptoms. For example, the nine-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was constructed from the symptoms of major depressive disorder in DSM-IV.

### Examining predictors of cocaine withdrawal syndrome at the end of detoxification treatment in women with cocaine use disorder [^1117d8M6]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Several studies have analyzed variables related to cocaine withdrawal syndrome and abstinence during outpatient or detoxification treatment. For instance, Ahmadi and collaborators (2009) demonstrated that the baseline treatment variables most consistently predicting patients who achieved four weeks of abstinence from cocaine, compared to those who did not, were the initial urine drug screen results, the initial CSSA scores, and initial self-reported cocaine use in the past 30 days. In contrast, cocaine craving, alcohol craving, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms did not play significant roles.

Viola and collaborators (2020) found that patients with CUD and frequent recent cannabis use reported higher severity of cocaine withdrawal after three weeks of treatment, while recent alcohol or tobacco use did not show an association with increased CSSA scores. In addition to substance use variables, some studies have shown that psychosocial experiences can also influence the severity of cocaine withdrawal syndrome. For example, Francke and collaborators (2013) presented findings indicating that women with CUD and a history of childhood neglect exposure exhibited a significantly lower reduction in the severity of cocaine withdrawal symptoms during three weeks of treatment compared to those with CUD but without a history of childhood neglect.

While the aforementioned studies have examined a subset of factors individually, in our study, we comprehensively analyzed more than 250 variables collected from women with CUD who enrolled in a 3-week inpatient treatment program for detoxification.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^116rGcnF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control have recently described opioid use and resultant deaths as an epidemic. At this point in time, treating this disease well with medication requires skill and time that are not generally available to primary care doctors in most practice models. Suboptimal treatment has likely contributed to the expansion of the epidemic and concerns for unethical practices. At the same time, access to competent treatment is profoundly restricted because few physicians are willing and able to provide it.

This "Practice Guideline" was developed to assist in the evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder, and with the hope that, using this tool, more physicians will be able to provide effective treatment. Although there are existing guidelines for the treatment of opioid use disorder, none have included all of the medications used at present for its treatment. Moreover, few of the existing guidelines address the needs of special populations such as pregnant women, individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, individuals with pain, adolescents, or individuals involved in the criminal justice system.

- **RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM)**: This practice guideline was developed using the RAND Corporation (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM) - a process that combines scientific evidence and clinical knowledge to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures. The RAM is a deliberate approach encompassing review of existing guidelines, literature reviews, appropriateness ratings, necessity reviews, and document development.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly in relation to methadone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend the immediate reinstitution of methadone if a relapse occurs or if an assessment determines that the risk of relapse is high, unless contraindicated. This applies to patients who have previously received methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD).

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^115KWBXr]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapeutic and psychological approaches for opioid use disorder (OUD) are delivered in outpatient clinics and offices, inpatient hospital settings, and residential settings. Ongoing prescriptions of medications for OUD (MOUD), including oral methadone (MET) and sublingual buprenorphine (BUP), are the first-line treatments used in many countries worldwide and are the focus here. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concludes that MET and BUP are associated with the suppression of non-medical opioid use and increased periods of abstinence. Observational follow-up studies of treatment routinely delivered show reductions in drug injecting, opioid overdose, blood-borne viral infections, and crime. Recent randomized controlled efficacy trials have shown clinical benefits for extended-release injectable depot formulations of naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) and BUP.

Given these positive findings, why do we need a measurement-based care (MBC) approach? One compelling reason is that the average treatment effect from MOUD research masks the actual experience of many patients. Up to 40–50% of patients discontinue MOUD treatment, most within a month, and many follow a repeating cycle of readmission and early discontinuation. In an influential randomized controlled study of MOUD for people with prescription medication OUD, Roger Weiss and colleagues observed that more than a quarter of their sample were unable to stop non-medical opioid use after two weeks of BUP, with this early non-response strongly predictive of drug use three months later in treatment.

### Disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence [^117T5CCL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Cocaine is a psychostimulant used by approximately 0.4% of the general population worldwide. Cocaine dependence is a chronic mental disorder characterized by the inability to control cocaine use and a host of severe medical and psychosocial complications. There is no approved pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependence. Some researchers have proposed disulfiram, a medication approved to treat alcohol use disorder. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Search methods**: We updated our searches of the following databases to August 2022: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via two trials registries. We hand-searched the references of topic-related systematic reviews and included studies. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated disulfiram alone or associated with psychosocial interventions versus placebo, no intervention, other pharmacological interventions, or any psychosocial intervention for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies (1191 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Disulfiram versus placebo or no treatment disulfiram compared to placebo may increase the number of people who are abstinent.

### BAP updated guidelines: Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of substance abuse, harmful use, addiction and comorbidity: Recommendations from BAP [^112bR4Qs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly in patients with opioid use disorder, the BAP 2012 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support the addition of bupropion, desipramine, amantadine, or gabapentin to methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment to reduce cocaine use in opioid-dependent cocaine users.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^113pvoCB]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Modafinil is a novel stimulant-like medication that promotes wakefulness and serves as a treatment for hypersomnia and narcolepsy. The mechanism of action is only partially understood at this time; however, there is evidence that this agent acts as a central alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, reduces basal cerebral GABA activity, and increases both dopamine and glutamate release in select areas of the brain. Chronic cocaine use results in a hypodopaminergic state as well as depletion of both extracellular glutamate levels and glutamatergic synaptic strength in the nucleus accumbens. These neurotransmitter systems serve as the principal targets of modafinil's effects, and promising results in human clinical trials for the treatment of cocaine dependence have been observed.

The safety of co-administration of modafinil and cocaine was established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 10) conducted by Dackis et al. Modafinil demonstrated no significant exacerbating effects on vital sign measures or electrocardiogram (EKG) findings. As a secondary measure, pretreatment with modafinil at two oral dosages (200 mg and 400 mg, respectively) demonstrated an ability to significantly attenuate euphoria from intravenously administered cocaine in one subjective measure (P = 0.02). Importantly, this early study suggested safety as well as the possibility of a cocaine-blunting effect with modafinil.

In addition to examining the impact of modafinil on the euphorigenic effects of cocaine, early research focused on the similarity of modafinil to stimulant medications in order to…

### Lamotrigine in patients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence [^113LkbFu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is associated with the highest substance abuse rates of any psychiatric illness. Therefore, treatments that stabilize mood and decrease drug use or cravings are of great interest. Open-label lamotrigine was examined in 30 outpatients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence. Lamotrigine was either added to existing medication regimens or used as monotherapy.

- **Method**: Lamotrigine was started at a dose of 25 mg/day (12.5 mg/day in those taking valproic acid) and titrated to a maximum dose of 300 mg/day. Subjects received a baseline evaluation including a structured clinical interview and weekly assessments for 12 weeks with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ). At each appointment, a urine sample was obtained, and participants reported drug use during the previous week. The subjects consisted of 13 men and 17 women with cocaine dependence and bipolar I disorder (N = 22), bipolar II disorder (N = 7), or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (N = 1), with a mean ± SD age of 35.4 ± 7.2 years. Data were analyzed using the last observation carried forward on all subjects who completed the baseline evaluation and at least one post-baseline assessment.

- **Results**: Significant improvement was observed in HAM-D, YMRS, and BPRS scores (p ≤ .02). Cravings also significantly decreased as measured by the CCQ (p < .001). The dollar amount spent on drugs decreased nonsignificantly. Lamotrigine was well tolerated, with no subject discontinuing due to adverse effects.

### Contingency management for patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Jt4VY]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

One observation that warrants underscoring is that among studies targeting abstinence from substance use, the smallest overall effect size was observed with polysubstance abstinence (Cohen d = 0.46). It appears that when the number of drugs simultaneously targeted by contingency management increased, the overall effect size decreased, although remaining statistically significant. This pattern is consistent with results from prior reviews and cautions against including too many targets simultaneously without making adjustments to the intervention (e.g. increasing the monetary value of the incentive accordingly). Similarly, our finding that contingency management was most effective when greater maximum daily earnings were offered is consistent with prior research and demonstrates the importance of adequate financial incentives in contingency management interventions.

The follow-up results in the present meta-analysis are also consistent with those from a prior meta-analysis, showing that treatment effects often dissipate after contingency management is discontinued. This is not surprising and is consistent with other maintenance therapies for other chronic medical conditions. Nevertheless, relapse prevention after contingency management discontinuation needs to be considered in the treatment planning process. Two evidence-based options are to combine contingency management with other psychosocial interventions, such as Community Reinforcement Approach therapy, that help to assure that naturalistic sources of reinforcement for sober living are in place prior to discontinuing contingency management.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114JQqsg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly with methadone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend ensuring that patients transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine are on low doses of methadone before making the transition. It is important to recognize that patients on low doses of methadone (≤ 30–40 mg/day) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort when transitioning medications.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^112Y5N1s]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

These factors add complexity to treatment planning and may risk discontinuation and poor outcome. The opportunity to respond here will depend on time and resources. Even if remission is elusive or not achieved for long, MOUD may provide some symptom control and protection against opioid poisoning. The clinician should also not be disheartened if a MOUD-resistant patient refuses an adjunctive intervention, as they may accept this offer in the future. If there is no response after continuous treatment, clinicians might consider whether to shift to another MOUD medication, as different pharmacological properties might be more suitable for some patients than others. Another consideration is the timing of treatment intervention during ongoing care (early versus later). More research is needed to address the absence of evidence on which patient characteristics predict response to one MOUD versus another.

- **MBC research**: We hope that pragmatic randomized controlled trials will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of MBC for MOUD and other OUD interventions. Our proposals for MBC can guide endpoint selection and analysis in clinical trials (where DSM-5 remission status is not often used in endpoint evaluations). At the very least, a single-item PRO measure could be helpfully included in treatment trials as secondary outcome measures. Cohort research on MBC delivery for OUD within healthcare systems would also provide additional insights on the response to specific interventions received, generating valuable real-world evidence for the system itself.

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 Western European countries: Observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^116pgQf4]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

The participating countries agreed to share aggregated data from their national monitoring registers for the years 2011 to 2018 in order to perform trend analysis. To ensure harmonization and robust trend data, countries with less comprehensive national coverage or who encountered technical changes over time in their TDI monitoring register were requested to provide data collected among a subgroup of centers that have provided stable and reliable data over the years. Otherwise, the TDI data set providing yearly data for all centers included in their TDI monitoring was used. TDI gathers information on the primary and adjunctive substances of use at treatment admission, as well as demographic data and information concerning the treatment history of the client.

Data on the total number of clients in treatment for substance use, number of clients in treatment for cocaine as primary and cocaine as primary or secondary drug were collected. A distinction was also made between the treatment episodes of the specific substances (powder cocaine and crack) and between patients treated previously or treated for the first time for drug addiction.

The proportion of clients entering treatment for cocaine as a primary substance or as a primary/adjunctive substance between 2011 and 2018 were separately calculated. Proportions were calculated for clients entering treatment for the first time in their life as well as for all clients entering treatment (first‐time plus previously treated). The proportion of clients reporting the use of cocaine was used in preference to absolute numbers.

### Feasibility of exenatide, a GLP-1R agonist, for treating cocaine use disorder: A case series study [^115hjvoj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Cocaine use remains a serious public health problem associated with a marked increase in overdose deaths in the past decade. No medications have yet been proven to be effective for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CUD). Among the highly promising medications have been glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) that are currently used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and weight management. Preclinically, GLP-1RAs have been shown to attenuate cocaine self-administration; however, this has not yet been demonstrated in a human laboratory study. The GLP-1RA extended-release exenatide is given as a once-weekly injection, which may be clinically advantageous for addressing medication nonadherence among individuals with CUD.

Here, we assess feasibility and safety by reporting on three cases of patients with CUD who received six weeks of exenatide 2 mg subcutaneously once-weekly in an open-label fashion, along with standard individual drug counseling. We observed excellent attendance and compliance, along with positive end-of-study satisfaction ratings. The medication was well tolerated and without unexpected or severe adverse events. Results for cocaine use and related clinical effects were more mixed, yet encouraging. Future empirical testing of exenatide for treating CUD should utilize a randomized controlled trial design and longer treatment duration.

### Contingency management for patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fTqVB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is efficacious; however, comorbid stimulant use and other behavioral health problems often undermine its efficacy. The objective of this study is to examine the association of contingency management, a behavioral intervention wherein patients receive material incentives contingent on objectively verified behavior change, with end-of-treatment outcomes for these comorbid behavioral problems.

A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and reference sections of articles was conducted from inception through May 5, 2020. The search terms used included: vouchers OR contingency management OR financial incentives. The study selection focused on prospective experimental studies of monetary-based contingency management among participants receiving MOUD.

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline, three independent investigators extracted data from included studies for a random-effects meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the association of contingency management at end-of-treatment assessments with six clinical problems: stimulant use, polysubstance use, illicit opioid use, cigarette smoking, therapy attendance, and medication adherence. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to compute weighted mean effect size estimates (Cohen d) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals separately for each clinical problem, and subsequently collapsing across the three categories assessing abstinence and the two assessing treatment adherence outcomes.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115kL9am]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning withdrawal management, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management over the abrupt cessation of opioids. Recognize that abrupt cessation of opioids may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome, which can put the patient at risk for relapse, overdose, and overdose death.

### Recent advances in the pharmacotherapy of cocaine dependence [^1168QmxZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacotherapy of cocaine dependence is a rapidly developing field of research that may soon produce efficacious medications. Expanding research on reward-related brain circuitry, which is acutely activated and chronically dysregulated by cocaine, has helped reveal the neurobiological features of cocaine dependence and is guiding pharmacologic strategies that have significant potential to improve clinical outcomes.

Cocaine dependence is a multifaceted disorder with distinct clinical components that may respond to different pharmacologic approaches. Pharmacologic strategies for this disorder include blocking euphoria, reducing withdrawal and negative mood symptoms, ameliorating craving, and enhancing prefrontal cortical function, which seems to be impaired in cocaine-dependent patients. One medication may not be sufficient to treat these diverse elements of cocaine dependence, as preliminary studies report efficacy with medications that have opposite actions on reward-related circuits.

This review highlights pertinent advances in cocaine neurobiology, recent clinical trials, and controversies in the pharmacologic treatment of cocaine dependence.

### Nefazodone in out-patient treatment of inhaled cocaine dependence: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^114zYKAA]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of oral nefazodone in treating cocaine dependence. The design involved a 10-week randomized double-blind clinical trial.

Methods: All 210 subjects fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) criteria for cocaine dependence and were randomly assigned to receive either 300 mg/day of oral nefazodone (N) or a placebo (P). The study assessed self-reported drug use, retention interval in treatment, adherence to prescription, and depressive symptoms using the Hamilton scale.

- **Findings**: Abstinence from cocaine for 3 weeks or more was achieved by 49.5% of participants in the nefazodone group (N) and 45.7% in the placebo group (P) (P = 0.58). However, 16.2% (N) and 22.9% (P) used other drugs during abstinence. The average interval to resumption of drug use was 33.9 days (N) and 36.1 days (P). Adverse effects were reported by 45.8% (N) and 29.5% (P) (P = 0.01). Treatment for these adverse events was more frequently needed in the nefazodone group (24.0%) compared to the placebo group (9.5%) (P < 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: These results do not support the indication of nefazodone for outpatient treatment of inhaled cocaine dependence, with or without other associated drug dependence diagnoses.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^112bTt2j]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Much has been learned from long-standing efforts in the alcohol and drug field to develop clinical outcome monitoring systems. A patient's response to treatment will be influenced by several factors, including their ability and motivation to adhere to their prescription, such as the distance traveled to receive dosing and clinical practice on directly observed or self-administered dosing and attendance.

Another reason that measurement-based care (MBC) is needed is because repeated calls for treatment services and systems to monitor outcomes, have not led to widespread action. Several relatively brief instruments are in routine use in healthcare systems, including the Brief Addiction Monitor developed for the US Veterans Administration and the Treatment Outcomes Profile, the national outcome standard for drug and alcohol treatment services in England for the past decade. However, neither instrument was designed to diagnose substance use disorder (SUD) or classify remission. There is no consensus on which indicators are most relevant for MBC, and few services would describe themselves as MBC-driven.

- **Measurement-based care using DSM-5 symptoms**: The DSM-5 OUD checklist is usually completed solely for administrative reasons, such as seeking insurance authorization for treatment or documenting eligibility criteria for a research study. Surprisingly, these questions are rarely used in the clinic either as a means of planning treatment or classifying remission. Many practitioners are attuned to their patients' signs and symptoms and respond when OUD worsens or improves, but time pressures often mean that treatment adjustments are not adequately implemented.

### Consensus recommendations on the treatment of opioid use disorder in the emergency department [^111B1vVh]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine and methadone reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with opioid use disorder. The initiation of buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) has been associated with increased rates of outpatient treatment linkage and decreased drug use when compared to patients randomized to receive standard ED referral. As such, the ED has been increasingly recognized as a venue for the identification and initiation of treatment for opioid use disorder, but no formal American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommendations on the topic have previously been published.

The ACEP convened a group of emergency physicians with expertise in clinical research, addiction, toxicology, and administration to review literature and develop consensus recommendations on the treatment of opioid use disorder in the ED. Based on literature review, clinical experience, and expert consensus, the group recommends that emergency physicians offer to initiate opioid use disorder treatment with buprenorphine in appropriate patients and provide direct linkage to ongoing treatment for patients with untreated opioid use disorder. These consensus recommendations include strategies for opioid use disorder treatment initiation and ED program implementation. They were approved by the ACEP board of directors in January 2021.

### American society of addiction medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^114kJRJn]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Opioid use disorder is a chronic, relapsing disease with significant economic, personal, and public health consequences. This "Practice Guideline" was developed to assist in the evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder. Although existing guidelines for the treatment of opioid use disorder are available, none have included all medications currently used for its treatment. Moreover, few of these guidelines address the needs of special populations such as pregnant women, individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, individuals with pain, adolescents, or those involved in the criminal justice system. This article serves as an overview of the guideline. It is recommended that those who wish to understand this subject in sufficient detail to prescribe carefully should read the full guideline.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^111BzJNp]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

These prospects in the pharmacologic management of cocaine dependence have demonstrated an ability to reduce subjective reward, craving, and withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine use in human clinical trials; however, there is still much progress to be made before they become viable widespread treatments. Of the dopamine agonist medications, although they have been shown to decrease euphoric and, in some cases, withdrawal symptoms, concerns regarding the addictive liability of amphetamine-type medications continue to limit the widespread acceptance and use of this treatment.

Further, findings from clinical trials of GABAergic medications have been less clear in demonstrating significant efficacy in treating cocaine dependence. They have shown some ability to reduce cocaine craving or improve sleep duration and quality in those recently abstaining from cocaine. Cocaine abusers with comorbid alcohol dependence may represent a subpopulation particularly responsive to the effects of GVG.

The cocaine vaccine, TA-CD, has demonstrated the ability to elicit an immunologic response capable of reducing the subjective reward of cocaine use in both animals and humans. These results make immunologic treatment of substance use disorders an exciting direction for the treatment of not only cocaine dependence but other substances as well.

Finally, findings from preclinical trials for L-THP suggest this medication, already used for centuries as an herbal remedy for other disorders, may be helpful in reducing cocaine dependence.

The trends were broken down by the type of cocaine reported (powder cocaine or crack), the client's history in addiction treatment (previously treated or not), and the primary role of cocaine in the treatment demand. Studying the difference for these two types of cocaine is important because these substances tend to be used by different user populations [16] and are associated with different clinical profiles and intensity of harms [17].

### Cannabidiol as a treatment for craving and relapse in individuals with cocaine use disorder: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^114CzBzM]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health concern for which no efficacious pharmacological interventions are available. Cannabidiol (CBD) has attracted considerable interest as a promising treatment for addiction. This study tested CBD efficacy for reducing craving and preventing relapse in people with CUD.

- **Design**: Single-site double-blind randomized controlled superiority trial comparing CBD with placebo.

- **Setting and participants**: Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Canada. Seventy-eight adults (14 women) with moderate to severe CUD participated.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by stratified blocks to daily 800 mg CBD (n = 40) or placebo (n = 38). They first underwent an inpatient detoxification phase lasting 10 days. Those who completed this phase entered a 12-week outpatient follow-up.

- **Measurements**: Primary outcomes were drug-cue-induced craving during detoxification and time-to-cocaine relapse during subsequent outpatient treatment.

- **Findings**: During drug-cue exposure, craving scores [mean ± standard deviation (SD)] increased from baseline by 4.69 (2.89) versus 3.21 (2.78) points, respectively, in CBD (n = 36) and placebo (n = 28) participants [confidence interval (CI) = −0.33 to 3.04; P = 0.069; Bayes factor = 0.498]. All but three participants relapsed to cocaine by week 12, with similar risk for CBD (n = 34) and placebo (n = 27) participants (hazard ratio = 1.20, CI = 0.65–2.20; P = 0.51; Bayes factor = 0.152). CBD treatment was well tolerated and associated mainly with diarrhoea.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112FAJjS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The choice of available treatment options for addiction involving opioid use should be a shared decision between clinician and patient. Clinicians should consider the patient's preferences, past treatment history, and treatment setting when deciding between the use of methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use.

- **Treatment setting**: The treatment setting described as level 1 treatment in the ASAM Criteria may be a general outpatient location, such as a clinician's practice site. The setting described as level 2 in the ASAM Criteria may be an intensive outpatient treatment or partial hospitalization program housed in a specialty addiction treatment facility, a community mental health center, or another setting. The ASAM Criteria describes level 3 or level 4 treatment, respectively, as a residential addiction treatment facility or hospital.

- **Venue of treatment**: The venue in which treatment is provided is as important as the specific medication selected. Opioid Treatment Programs offer daily supervised dosing of methadone, and increasingly of buprenorphine. In accordance with Federal law (21 CFR §1306.07), office-based opioid treatment (OBOT), which provides medication on a prescribed weekly or monthly basis, is limited to buprenorphine. Naltrexone can be prescribed in any setting by any clinician with the authority to prescribe any medication. Clinicians should consider a patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and risk of diversion when determining whether opioid treatment program (OTP) or OBOT is most appropriate.

### Antidepressants for cocaine dependence [^116nWjZe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition that has become a substantial public health problem. The past decade has witnessed a sustained search for an effective pharmacotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cocaine dependence. While administration of cocaine acutely increases intercellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels by blocking their presynaptic reuptake, chronic cocaine abuse leads to down-regulation of monoamine systems. Post-cocaine use depression and cocaine craving may be linked to this down-regulation. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy, by augmenting monoamine levels, may alleviate cocaine abstinence symptomatology, as well as relieve dysphoria and associated craving through its general antidepressant action.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review of all RCTs on the use of antidepressants for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966 to 2000), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2000), LILACS (from 1982 to 2000), PsycLIT (from 1974 to 2000), and Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). Other searches included reference searching, personal communication, conference abstracts, unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry, and book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Selection criteria**: The inclusion criteria for all randomized controlled trials were that they should focus on the use of antidepressants in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Trials including patients with additional diagnoses such as opiate dependence were also eligible.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^112mLDEQ]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cocaine is a stimulant that leads to the rapid accumulation of catecholamines and serotonin in the brain by preventing their re-uptake into the neuron that released the neurotransmitter. Cocaine use disorders are widely accepted as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Cocaine use is associated with numerous acute and chronic medical complications, ranging from coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction, and respiratory disease to neurologic and psychiatric consequences such as cerebral hemorrhage, mood disorders, and psychosis. Additionally, cocaine use has been associated with increased risk of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and violence.

Development of effective treatments for cocaine dependence is necessary to reduce the impact of this illness upon both the individual and society. These effective treatments need most importantly to reduce cocaine use and to have excellent compliance, which has encouraged depot and other long-lasting formulations. Currently, however, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for the treatment of this illness, and behavioral therapies alone have demonstrated limited efficacy. Our growing understanding of cocaine neurobiology has translated into numerous studies of pharmacologic agents for treatment of cocaine dependence in both animal and human models. These models include human laboratory drug administration studies using surrogate endpoints such as craving, subjective effects, and behavioral choices of money versus drug. This article reviews findings from recent cocaine pharmacotherapy research.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116d5PFL]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not delaying the transition from buprenorphine to methadone. The transition to a full mu-opioid agonist from a partial agonist typically does not result in an adverse reaction.

### Quetiapine in bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence [^112GPXe7]. Bipolar Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is associated with the highest rates of substance abuse of any psychiatric illness, making treatments that stabilize mood and decrease drug use or cravings highly important. Atypical antipsychotics are widely used in patients with bipolar disorder; however, minimal data are available regarding their use in bipolar patients with comorbid substance abuse.

- **Methods**: Open-label, add-on quetiapine therapy was examined for 12 weeks in 17 outpatients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence. Subjects were evaluated using a structured clinical interview, the Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS), Young Mania Rating (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating (BPRS) scales, and the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ). Urine samples and self-reported drug use were also obtained. Data were analyzed using a last observation carried forward method on all subjects given medication at baseline.

- **Results**: Significant improvement from baseline to exit was observed in HDRS, YMRS, BPRS, and CCQ scores (p ≤ 0.05). Dollars spent on cocaine and days/week of cocaine use decreased non-significantly, and urine drug screens did not change significantly from baseline to exit. Quetiapine was well tolerated, with no subjects, to our knowledge, discontinuing because of side effects.

- **Conclusions**: The use of quetiapine was associated with substantial improvement in psychiatric symptoms and cocaine cravings. The findings are promising and suggest that larger controlled trials of quetiapine are needed in this population.

### Cannabidiol as a treatment for craving and relapse in individuals with cocaine use disorder: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^112KpWeQ]. Addiction (2021). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Study design**: This Phase II double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled superiority trial was conducted at the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Quebec, Canada. It followed the Tri-Council Policy Statement, the Helsinki Declaration, the Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines), the Good Manufacturing Practices, and Health Canada division 5 guidelines. The CHUM's ethics committee approved the study, and all participants signed informed consent forms. The trial was divided into two phases: a 10-day inpatient detoxification (Phase I) followed by a 12-week outpatient follow-up (Phase II). Only participants who remained inpatient for all 10 days were eligible for Phase II. Participants were compensated up to $400.

- **Participants**: Recruitment occurred between 20 July 2016 and 25 June 2019. We included adults aged between 18 and 65 years diagnosed with cocaine use disorder (CUD) [Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for the DSM-V] and who had consumed cocaine within 2 weeks prior to admission [time-line follow-back (TLFB)]. Only participants speaking English or French and able to consent were eligible. We excluded participants with severe and/or unstable medical or psychiatric conditions [Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) version 7.0], immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity to cannabinoids, or those under treatment with medications interacting with CBD. Participants diagnosed with another substance use disorder (except nicotine) that would require treatment were ineligible. Men with a history of fertility problems were also excluded.

Recent clinical trials of modafinil in human subjects have highlighted either (1) the medication's impact upon actual cocaine use or (2) its ability to mitigate symptoms associated with cocaine abstinence. The rationale for using this medication relates to its stimulant-like properties and potential efficacy as a substitution agent that can reduce craving for cocaine. Modafinil was examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 210) at doses of 200 mg and 400 mg to assess its effect on cocaine use. However, no significant differences were observed between the modafinil and placebo groups in their change in the average weekly percentage of cocaine non-use days. Notably, modafinil 200 mg demonstrated a significant reduction in craving as a secondary outcome. Interestingly, a post-hoc analysis also found an increase in cocaine non-use days among those with co-morbid alcohol dependence treated with modafinil, suggesting a possible target subgroup among cocaine-addicted individuals.

The impact of modafinil on sleep in chronic cocaine users was examined in a randomized, placebo-controlled, inpatient study (N = 20) by Morgan et al. The researchers found that modafinil 400 mg decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow-wave sleep time. Additionally, by the third week of abstinence from cocaine, the modafinil group experienced longer total sleep time and shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latency. Ultimately, modafinil demonstrated a normalizing effect on sleep, which could be particularly important during early phases of abstinence.

### Retention strategies for medications for opioid use disorder in adults: A rapid evidence review [^112NFawX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Psychosocial interventions**: One good-quality systematic review (26 relevant RCTs) and nine additional RCTs (n = 49–653) — 2 of good quality, 4 of fair quality, and 3 of poor quality — examined psychosocial interventions (e.g. psychiatric care, psychotherapy, counseling, social work services) to improve MOUD retention.

The existing systematic review meta-analysis found that combining MOUD treatment with psychosocial interventions did not improve retention (n = 3124, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98–1.07). Of the 9 additional RCTs we identified, 8 also found no difference in MOUD retention. The one positive study was a poor-quality study (n = 170) of a community reinforcement approach (CRA+) that utilized participants' social networks to increase MOUD program retention, plus contingency management versus contingency management alone, and reported increased retention in the CRA+ group (80% vs. 64%; OR 2.3, CI 1.15–4.60).

Few studies reported significant harms of psychosocial interventions. One study (n = 542) of pharmacist-delivered motivational interviewing versus standard methadone treatment found that intervention group participants reported poorer physical health.

Few studies assessed which patient subgroups were most likely to benefit from the addition of psychosocial interventions. A study (n = 125) of XR-naltrexone coupled with a Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy compared to XR-naltrexone coupled with a Compliance Enhancement intervention reported higher retention at 6 months in the Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy group among patients with low-severity OUD (< 6 bags of heroin/day; 60% vs. 24%, P = 0.03).

### Retention strategies for medications for opioid use disorder in adults: A rapid evidence review [^1138WQJd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Although medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) save lives, treatment retention remains challenging. Identification of interventions to improve MOUD retention is of interest to policymakers and researchers. On behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we conducted a rapid evidence review on interventions to improve MOUD retention.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from February 2009 through August 2019 for systematic reviews and randomized trials of care settings, services, logistical support, contingency management, health information technology (IT), extended-release (XR) formulations, and psychosocial interventions that assessed retention for at least 3 months.

- **Results**: Two systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included; most did not focus on retention as the primary outcome. Initiating MOUD in soon-to-be-released incarcerated people improved retention following release. Contingency management may improve retention using antagonist but not agonist MOUD. Retention with interventions integrating medical, psychiatric, social services, or IT did not differ from in-person treatment-as-usual approaches. Retention was comparable with XR- compared to daily buprenorphine formulations and conflicting with XR-naltrexone monthly injection compared to daily buprenorphine. Most psychosocial interventions did not improve retention.

Consistent but sparse evidence supports criminal justice prerelease MOUD initiation, and contingency management interventions for antagonist MOUD. Integrating MOUD with medical, psychiatric, and social services warrants further investigation.

### Management of opioid use disorder: 2024 update to the national clinical practice guideline [^113bAohq]. CMAJ (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly with respect to withdrawal management, the CRISM 2024 guidelines recommend not offering withdrawal management alone to patients with OUD. This approach is advised against due to the increased rates of relapse, morbidity, and mortality. Long-term addiction treatment should be offered instead.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111HCU5v]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to methadone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend using strategies directed at relapse prevention in any plan of care for patients receiving OUD treatment or ongoing monitoring of the status of their disorder.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111e4Lqx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioid use disorder, especially concerning patients with other substance use disorders, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not withholding or suspending treatment with methadone or buprenorphine in patients using benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics. Recognize that while the combined use of these medications increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. Conduct a risk-benefit analysis and provide greater support, including careful medication management, to reduce risks.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112k1P4a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Psychosocial treatment in conjunction with medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder**: Psychosocial treatment is recommended alongside any pharmacological treatment for opioid use disorder. At a minimum, it should include a psychosocial needs assessment, supportive counseling, connections to existing family supports, and referrals to community services. Treatment planning should involve collaboration with qualified behavioral healthcare providers to determine the optimal type and intensity of psychosocial treatments and to renegotiate treatment plans if patients do not adhere to recommended plans or referrals for psychosocial treatment. Psychosocial treatment is generally advised for patients receiving opioid agonist treatments such as methadone or buprenorphine. It should also be offered with oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone, although the efficacy of extended-release injectable naltrexone for treating opioid use disorder has not been confirmed when used as pharmacotherapy without accompanying psychosocial treatment.

- **Special populations: Pregnant women**: When evaluating pregnant women for opioid use disorder, the first priority should be to identify emergent or urgent medical conditions that require immediate clinical evaluation. A comprehensive medical examination and psychosocial assessment are recommended as part of this evaluation. Obstetricians and gynecologists should remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of opioid use disorder.

### Psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder [^1113aEJa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant use disorder is a continuously growing medical and social burden without approved medications available for its treatment. Psychosocial interventions could be a valid approach to help people reduce or cease stimulant consumption. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registers in September 2023. All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched the references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any psychosocial intervention with no intervention, treatment as usual (TAU), or a different intervention in adults with stimulant use disorder.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included a total of 64 RCTs (8241 participants). Seventy-three percent of studies included participants with cocaine or crack cocaine use disorder; 3.1% included participants with amphetamine use disorder; 10.9% included participants with methamphetamine use disorder; and 12.5% included participants with any stimulant use disorder. In 18 studies, all participants were in methadone maintenance treatment. In our primary comparison of any psychosocial intervention with no intervention or TAU, we analyzed various psychosocial interventions' effects on stimulant use outcomes.

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 western European countries: Observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^112Cqq3h]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

It would be valuable to focus on the combination of substance use and polydrug use, as cocaine as an adjunctive substance is frequently recorded in combination with the primary use of opioids [1]. In the United Kingdom, there has been a recent increase in clients starting treatment for opiate and crack problem use [27]. In Belgium, between 2015 and 2018, clients entering treatment for opiates, cannabis, and alcohol as primary substances reported an increased consumption of cocaine as an adjunctive substance [28].

The study is subject to a range of limitations:

- **Data limitations**: TDI data provided information on clients entering drug treatment (for the first time in their life or after previous treatment) during the reporting year, meaning that data on clients who are in continuous treatment (i.e. who remain in treatment from one year to the next) were not provided. Treatment data collected by the national TDI systems did not cover all treatment demands and hence need to be interpreted with caution.

- **Coverage issues**: The coverage of treatment services was not 100% and the proportion differed by country. Inclusion of treatment services not currently represented may provide different results. However, data coverage of specialized outpatient and inpatient treatment facilities is good in most countries, with lower representation concentrated among other services (e.g. general practitioners, low-threshold agencies, prisons) [15].

- **Temporal availability**: Not all years were available for all countries, which might also have influenced some figures.

### Doing our best in a broken system: The urgent need for expansion of medication for opioid use disorder treatments in the United States [^115wmDJN]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In reply: In this commentary, we respond to Dr. Vogel and Dr. Dürstelar's letter regarding our original piece, "A Plea From People Who Use Drugs to Clinicians: New Ways to Initiate Buprenorphine Are Urgently Needed in the Fentanyl Era", published in this journal in July to August 2022. We agree with much of their comment on buprenorphine initiation and emphasize the need for rapid expansion of medication for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatments in the United States. It is critical to understand the context of buprenorphine and methadone access.

We highlight how the treatment of OUD with agonist therapy remains limited to methadone or buprenorphine, despite an increasingly toxic drug supply within our legal and regulatory environment. There is a call for urgent research and pilot programs to trial additional agonist therapies for those with opioid OUD, as well as the need for regulatory changes to increase access to both methadone and buprenorphine.

### Examining predictors of cocaine withdrawal syndrome at the end of detoxification treatment in women with cocaine use disorder [^116YW8C7]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a major public health issue associated with poor outcomes for both patients and society. Inpatient detoxification treatment is often recommended for moderate to severe CUD, particularly for individuals who frequently consume cocaine and are at high risk of severe intoxication, craving, overdose, or withdrawal. The assessment for this indication also considers co-occurring substance use disorders, mental health and emotional needs, medical and physical requirements, and social and environmental factors affecting patients.

Inpatient treatment is also considered for individuals experiencing significant addiction-related issues necessitating a protected environment, when maintaining abstinence is challenging, or when minimizing exposure to cocaine-related triggers is essential. However, the response to inpatient detoxification treatment varies among patients, as some individuals face greater challenges in managing the withdrawal syndrome than others.

An important clinical outcome measure for CUD detoxification response is the management of the severity of cocaine withdrawal syndrome. This includes symptoms such as craving, anxiety, irritability, mood changes, physiological manifestations (e.g. fatigue, restlessness, sleepiness, appetite alterations, tremors, muscle aches, nerve pain), and even suicidal ideation. Identifying patients with severe cocaine withdrawal syndrome during early treatment stages would be beneficial in clinical practice since these patients have significant challenges.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116iJFfK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to general principles, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend ensuring that all approved medications for the treatment of OUD are available to all patients. When deciding between the use of methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, take into consideration the patient's preferences, past treatment history, state of illness, and treatment setting.

### Effects of varying the monetary value of voucher-based incentives on abstinence achieved during and following treatment among cocaine-dependent outpatients [^117KcD4L]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

This study examined whether increasing the amount of abstinence achieved during outpatient treatment for cocaine dependence is an effective method for increasing longer-term cocaine abstinence.

- **Design**: A two-condition, parallel groups, randomized controlled trial was conducted.

- **Setting**: The trial was conducted in a university-based research clinic.

- **Participants**: A total of 100 cocaine-dependent outpatients participated in the trial.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive treatment based on the community reinforcement approach (CRA) plus voucher-based incentives set at a relatively high monetary value (maximal value = $1995/12 weeks) or CRA with vouchers set at a relatively low monetary value (maximal value = $499/12 weeks). Vouchers were earned contingent on cocaine-negative urinalysis results during the initial 12 weeks of the 24-week outpatient treatment.

- **Measurements**: Outcomes were evaluated using urine-toxicology testing, questionnaires, and other self-report instruments.

- **Findings**: Increasing voucher value increased the duration of continuous cocaine abstinence achieved during the 24-week treatment period. Point-prevalence cocaine abstinence, assessed every 3 months throughout an 18-month follow-up period, was greater in the high- than low-value voucher conditions. The duration of abstinence achieved during treatment predicted abstinence during follow-up, although that relationship weakened over time.

Increasing the value of abstinence-contingent incentives during the initial weeks of treatment appears to represent an effective method to influence longer-term abstinence outcomes for cocaine-dependent outpatients.

### Apokyn [^111y3KfN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If the patient tolerates the initial test dose and responds adequately, the starting dose should be the same as the test dose, used on an as-needed basis to treat recurring "off" episodes. If needed, the dose can be increased in 0.1 mL (1 mg) increments every few days on an outpatient basis.

The general principle guiding subsequent dosing is to determine that the patient needs and can tolerate a higher test dose, such as 0.3 mL or 0.4 mL (3 mg or 4 mg, respectively), under close medical supervision. A trial of outpatient dosing may follow, periodically assessing both efficacy and tolerability, using a dose 0.1 mL (1 mg) lower than the tolerated test dose.

If the patient tolerates a 0.1 mL (1 mg) test dose but does not respond adequately, a test dose of 0.2 mL (2 mg) may be administered under medical supervision, at least 2 hours after the initial test dose, at the next observed "off" period. If the patient tolerates a 0.2 mL (2 mg) test dose but does not respond adequately, a test dose of 0.4 mL (4 mg) may be administered under medical supervision, at least 2 hours after the initial test dose, at the next observed "off" period. Patients who do not tolerate 0.2 mL (2 mg) may need to be titrated slowly. If the patient tolerates and responds to a test dose of 0.4 mL (4 mg), the initial maintenance dose should be 0.3 mL (3 mg), used on an as-needed basis to treat recurring "off" episodes as an outpatient. If needed, the dose can be increased in 0.1 mL (1 mg) increments every few days on an outpatient basis.

### Antidepressants for cocaine dependence [^111WeHfV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition, which has become a substantial public health problem. The past decade has witnessed a sustained search for an effective pharmacotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cocaine dependence. While the administration of cocaine acutely increases intercellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels by blocking their presynaptic reuptake, chronic cocaine abuse leads to the down-regulation of monoamine systems. Post-cocaine use depression and cocaine craving may be linked to this down-regulation. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy, by augmenting monoamine levels, may alleviate cocaine abstinence symptomatology, as well as relieve dysphoria and associated craving through general antidepressant action.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review of all RCTs on the use of antidepressants for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966 to 2000), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2000), LILACS (from 1982 to 2000), PsycLIT (from 1974 to 2000), and Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). Other searches included reference searching, personal communication, conference abstracts, unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry, and book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Selection criteria**: The inclusion criteria for all randomized controlled trials were that they should focus on the use of antidepressants for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Trials including patients with additional diagnoses such as opiate dependence were also eligible.

### Methadone vs. buprenorphine for in-hospital initiation: Which is better for outpatient care retention in patients with opioid use disorder [^111yaj8q]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Low credibility.

Currently, few hospitals provide medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to admitted patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Data are needed to inform whether the choice of medication during hospitalization influences the probability of retention in outpatient OUD treatment.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients who received a medical toxicology consult for OUD. Medical records were reviewed to determine if patients received MOUD and were referred to Engaging Patients in Care Coordination (EPICC), a service that connects hospitalized patients with OUD to outpatient care. Patients were stratified by the last form of MOUD they received in the hospital (methadone versus buprenorphine); retention in outpatient treatment was measured at 2 weeks, 30 days, and 12 weeks. The log-rank test was used to determine the difference in probabilities of retention in the methadone and buprenorphine groups. An event was defined as a dropout from outpatient treatment.

- **Results**: Of 267 total patients with medical toxicology consults for OUD, 155 received MOUD and referral to EPICC. One hundred six patients received buprenorphine, and 46 received methadone. Three additional patients were excluded. The rate of retention in outpatient treatment for patients who received buprenorphine was 37%, 26%, and 13%, and for patients who received methadone was 43%, 39%, and 35% at 2 weeks, 30 days, and 12 weeks, respectively. Methadone was associated with a statistically significant increased probability of retention in outpatient treatment as compared to buprenorphine.

### Amantadine in the treatment of cocaine-dependent patients with severe withdrawal symptoms [^112cJdzB]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

The study examined the effectiveness of amantadine in reducing cocaine withdrawal symptoms and improving treatment outcomes among cocaine-dependent patients in outpatient treatment.

- **Method**: Sixty-one cocaine-dependent subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of amantadine.

- **Results**: Among subjects with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms at the start of treatment, those who received amantadine used significantly less cocaine during the trial than subjects who received a placebo. Compared to subjects who received a placebo, those who received amantadine submitted significantly more benzoylecgonine-negative urine samples and used cocaine on significantly fewer days during the trial.

- **Conclusions**: Amantadine may be an effective treatment for cocaine-dependent patients with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms.

### Gabapentin reduces cocaine use among addicts from a community clinic sample [^116dVjVH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Individuals with chronic psychiatric conditions display a high rate of cocaine use. Gabapentin was hypothesized to reduce cocaine use by restoring inhibitory GABAergic feedback on ascending dopaminergic projections to nucleus accumbens neurons.

- **Method**: Nine participants with DSM-IV cocaine dependence were selected from patients attending a large community psychiatric clinic. During a 24-week open-label trial of gabapentin (800–2400 mg/day), qualitative urine drug screens were collected from the participants up to 3 times per week. Data were collected from September 1999 to May 2001.

- **Results**: With gabapentin, the mean ± SD number of cocaine-positive urine screens decreased from 53.11 ± 13.23 to 35.22 ± 14.84 (t = 3.58, N = 9, p < .01). The number of weeks of abstinence from cocaine increased from 2.1 ± 1.5 to 8.0 ± 5.5 (t = 3.21, N = 9, p < .01).

- **Conclusion**: Gabapentin appeared to be a safe and efficacious medication to reduce cocaine usage in a community sample of psychiatric patients.
