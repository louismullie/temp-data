## Question

If a patient was previously taking lithium and their creatinine level increased to 1.35 but have stopping went back to 1.15, is that a counterindication to taking lithium again?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a reversible rise in creatinine while on lithium that improved after stopping is an absolute contraindication to restarting lithium, and what a clinically sound, evidence‑based plan should look like if a rechallenge is considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the creatinine trajectory implies pathophysiologically and how it maps to CKD definitions. Then, I should characterize lithium's renal toxicity profile and risk factors. Next, I need to review data on reversibility after discontinuation and the effect of restarting. After that, I should risk‑stratify the current renal status against labeling constraints. Then, I will weigh renal risks against psychiatric benefits and determine whether the situation represents an absolute or relative contraindication. Finally, I will outline a monitoring and mitigation plan if lithium is restarted and note viable alternatives if it is not.

> Let me first confirm what the creatinine changes tell me. A rise to 1.35 mg/dL on lithium with subsequent improvement to 1.15 mg/dL after cessation suggests at least partial functional reversibility, which is compatible with lithium‑related tubular injury superimposed on early chronic tubulointerstitial pathology rather than fixed end‑stage fibrosis. Wait, I should verify that interpretation against guidance emphasizing that even changes within the normal range during lithium therapy warrant re‑evaluation, and that decisions should be anchored to eGFR rather than creatinine alone, with labs reporting eGFR whenever creatinine is measured. So I need to convert this creatinine to an eGFR based on age and sex before making firm conclusions about CKD stage or dosing implications [^1116dpVc] [^113LV5s7].

> Next, I will characterize lithium‑induced kidney injury. Lithium is classically associated with chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy featuring tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and cysts, and patients can also manifest nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and, less commonly, proteinuric glomerular lesions. I should confirm risk amplifiers including long duration of therapy, past lithium toxicity, concurrent nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs or diuretics, and comorbid hypertension or diabetes. Hold on, I initially attributed a specific mean annual eGFR decline rate to the FDA label, but that was imprecise. Let me correct that now. The quantified decline rates of approximately 1.5 to 1.7 mL/min/1.73 m² per year come from observational cohort data rather than the FDA label, specifically the LiSIE study, whereas the FDA labeling emphasizes routine renal assessment and vigilance for progressive changes rather than a single decline estimate [^1116dpVc] [^116CzAef] [^116ZW1Lu].

> I should now examine reversibility evidence. The LiSIE mirror‑image cohort demonstrated that stopping lithium slows eGFR loss from about −1.58 to approximately 0 mL/min/1.73 m² per year on average, with greater improvements in those with lower baseline eGFR, and importantly, that eGFR decline resumes at about −1.71 mL/min/1.73 m² per year when lithium is restarted. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because not all studies are concordant, but the bi‑directional signal in LiSIE is strong and sustained over five years, and the notion of a strict point of no return around eGFR 40 mL/min/1.73 m² remains debated with mixed evidence. Still, the pattern that improvement slows or partially reverses off lithium and deteriorates again on rechallenge is consistent and clinically meaningful for shared decision‑making [^116ZW1Lu] [^1153TcfL].

> Now, I need to ensure appropriate risk stratification and alignment with labeling. FDA labeling advises lower initial doses and slow titration with frequent level checks for mild to moderate renal impairment, defined as creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min, and states lithium is not recommended when creatinine clearance is below 30 mL/min. Given a creatinine of 1.15 mg/dL, the patient likely has an eGFR above 60 mL/min/1.73 m² if younger and male, but I should double‑check this against age, sex, and body size rather than assume, because the dosing and monitoring intensity hinge on the precise GFR category. If eGFR is at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and albuminuria is not in a high‑risk category, labeling would not render lithium absolutely contraindicated, though caution is warranted given prior susceptibility [^1177veaM] [^116CzAef] [^115Mg2Kk].

> I will now weigh renal risks against psychiatric benefits. The renal risk of rechallenge is a predictable resumption of eGFR decline near 1.7 mL/min/1.73 m² per year, which can meaningfully accelerate CKD progression over a 5 to 10 year horizon in susceptible patients. Population data also show an increased incidence of CKD in lithium‑treated individuals versus matched mood disorder controls, reinforcing the need for vigilant renal surveillance. On the other hand, lithium remains uniquely efficacious for relapse prevention and suicide risk reduction in bipolar disorder, benefits that may outweigh renal risks when alternative mood stabilizers have failed or are poorly tolerated. But wait, I should verify that the evidence base for renal risk and psychiatric benefit applies to this clinical phenotype, and I should document prior trials of alternatives before concluding that the net benefit favors rechallenge [^116ZW1Lu] [^114fZ27y].

> Let me determine contraindication status precisely. I should confirm that the FDA does not designate prior reversible creatinine rise as an absolute contraindication. The clear absolute labeling boundary is severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, where use is not recommended. Therefore, in a patient whose creatinine improved to approximately 1.15 mg/dL with likely eGFR above 60 mL/min/1.73 m², restarting lithium is not absolutely contraindicated. However, given demonstrated nephrotoxic susceptibility and the high likelihood of renewed eGFR decline on rechallenge, this constitutes a strong relative contraindication until alternative treatments are exhausted and the psychiatric risk clearly outweighs the projected renal trajectory [^1177veaM] [^116CzAef] [^116ZW1Lu].

> If a lithium rechallenge is pursued, I need to ensure a conservative dosing and monitoring framework. I should start at a reduced dose compared with prior requirements, target the low end of the therapeutic range around 0.6 to 0.8 mEq/L if clinically feasible, and titrate slowly with frequent trough lithium levels until stable followed by regular checks. I should confirm baseline renal function, electrolytes, and thyroid status, and then monitor creatinine and eGFR closely, monthly at first and then every 3 months once stable, with urinalysis for albumin or protein at intervals guided by risk. I should double‑check that this approach reflects FDA labeling for monitoring and KDIGO guidance that higher‑risk patients merit more frequent eGFR and albuminuria assessment when it informs therapy [^115zwJ5V] [^1116dpVc] [^1177veaM] [^111rAoay].

> I need to mitigate nephrotoxic co‑factors and pharmacokinetic interactions. Hold on, I should verify the key interactions that raise lithium levels or worsen renal function. NSAIDs can increase lithium concentrations and reduce renal perfusion, and should be avoided when possible. ACE inhibitors and ARBs can raise lithium levels and additionally affect renal hemodynamics, so if clinically indicated for hypertension or albuminuria they require careful initiation with enhanced lithium and renal monitoring. Diuretics can also increase lithium levels. I should educate the patient to maintain hydration, promptly report intercurrent illness or volume depletion, and avoid over‑the‑counter NSAIDs, because these steps can meaningfully reduce AKI risk and lithium toxicity [^111AwyuL] [^111r1RRr] [^116wu4WE].

> But wait, what if alternatives can reasonably meet psychiatric needs while minimizing renal risk. Let me consider non‑lithium options such as valproate, lamotrigine, or atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine, tailored to the bipolar phenotype and prior treatment history. For refractory cases with high suicide risk or frequent relapse, I should discuss clozapine or electroconvulsive therapy in collaboration with psychiatry. I should confirm the patient's prior responses and tolerability profile and document any previous failures, since that drives the strength of the rationale for retrying lithium despite renal concerns [^114nu8CE].

> In summary, I should double‑check that the creatinine improvement after stopping lithium argues against an absolute contraindication to restarting lithium in a patient whose current eGFR is likely above 60 mL/min/1.73 m², yet it clearly flags heightened susceptibility to nephrotoxicity. The best clinical framing is a strong relative contraindication, justified to override only when non‑lithium strategies are unlikely to provide adequate mood stabilization or suicide risk reduction. If lithium is restarted, it should be at the minimum effective dose with lower target levels, intensive early monitoring of lithium and kidney function, and rigorous avoidance of nephrotoxins and interacting drugs, recognizing that eGFR decline will likely resume on rechallenge and must be continuously weighed against psychiatric benefit in shared decision‑making [^1177veaM] [^116CzAef] [^116ZW1Lu] [^114fZ27y].

No, a transient creatinine rise from 1.15 to 1.35 mg/dL that returns to baseline after stopping lithium is **not a contraindication** to restarting lithium [^116CzAef]. However, it signals increased renal risk [^114fZ27y] and warrants **cautious reinitiation** with lower starting doses, slow titration [^1177veaM], and close monitoring of serum lithium, creatinine, and eGFR. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, ACEi/ARBs, diuretics) [^111AwyuL] and reassess if creatinine rises > 30% or eGFR falls < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115Mg2Kk]. If renal function declines again, discontinue lithium and consider alternatives [^116ZW1Lu] [^1116dpVc].

## Clinical significance of transient creatinine elevation

- **Transient creatinine rise**: A reversible increase from 1.15 to 1.35 mg/dL suggests hemodynamic or tubular effects rather than permanent structural injury.

- **Reversibility**: Return to baseline after stopping lithium indicates no irreversible nephropathy [^116ZW1Lu].

- **Risk marker**: Even transient rises signal higher susceptibility to lithium-related renal effects and merit closer monitoring [^111rAoay].

---

## Lithium and renal function: clinical guidelines

Lithium is renally cleared [^116CzAef]; therefore, impaired renal function increases toxicity risk, making **dose adjustments and monitoring** essential.

- **Pre-treatment assessment**: Check renal function, electrolytes, and thyroid before starting lithium [^115zwJ5V].

- **Renal impairment**: For CrCl 30–89 mL/min, use lower doses, titrate slowly, and monitor lithium and renal function frequently [^116CzAef].

- **Severe impairment**: Avoid lithium if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^116CzAef].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum lithium and renal function regularly during treatment [^1116dpVc].

## Risks associated with restarting lithium after transient creatinine elevation

Restarting lithium following a transient creatinine rise carries an **increased risk** [^114fZ27y] of recurrent renal impairment or chronic kidney disease. Lithium can cause recurrent renal dysfunction, especially in susceptible patients, and long-term exposure is linked to chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy and CKD [^1116dpVc]. Regular renal function checks are critical to detect early decline [^111rAoay].

---

## Clinical recommendations for restarting lithium therapy

When restarting lithium following a transient creatinine rise, follow these **precautions**:

- **Lower dose**: Start at a reduced dose and titrate slowly [^116CzAef].

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check serum lithium, creatinine, and eGFR regularly [^116CzAef].

- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Minimize or avoid NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics [^111r1RRr].

- **Reassess promptly**: If creatinine rises > 30% or eGFR falls < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², reconsider lithium [^113LV5s7] [^115Mg2Kk].

---

## Alternative mood stabilizers

If lithium is contraindicated or renal function declines, consider these **alternatives** [^113477UC]:

| **Medication** | **Renal considerations** | **Monitoring requirements** |
|-|-|-|
| Valproate | - Hepatic metabolism <br/> - Minimal renal impact | - Liver function <br/> - Platelets <br/> - Valproate levels |
| Carbamazepine | - Hepatic metabolism <br/> - Minimal renal impact | - Liver function <br/> - CBC <br/> - Carbamazepine levels |
| Lamotrigine | Minimal renal impact | Minimal monitoring |
| Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. quetiapine, olanzapine) | Minimal renal impact | Metabolic monitoring |

---

## Conclusion and clinical decision

A transient creatinine rise that normalizes after stopping lithium is **not a contraindication** to restarting, but it signals **increased renal risk**. Restart **cautiously** with lower doses, slow titration, and close monitoring; avoid nephrotoxic drugs and reassess if renal function worsens. If decline recurs, discontinue lithium and use alternatives.

- **Dosage adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period**: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, it is important to monitor serum lithium concentrations and adjust the dosage as needed because renal lithium clearance increases during pregnancy. Avoid sodium restriction or diuretic administration. To decrease the risk of postpartum lithium intoxication, decrease or discontinue lithium therapy two to three days before the expected delivery date. This helps reduce neonatal concentrations and minimizes the risk of maternal lithium intoxication due to changes in vascular volume during delivery. At delivery, vascular volume rapidly decreases, and the renal clearance of lithium may revert to pre-pregnancy levels. Restart treatment at the preconception dose when the patient is medically stable after delivery, with careful monitoring of serum lithium concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment**: Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with dosages less than those for patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and watching for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) [see Use in Specific Populations].

### Lithium carbonate [^1116dpVc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Lithium-induced chronic kidney disease**: The predominant form of chronic renal disease associated with long-term lithium treatment is chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy (CTIN). Biopsy findings in patients with lithium-induced CTIN include tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, sclerotic glomeruli, tubular dilation, and nephron atrophy with cyst formation. The relationship between renal function and morphologic changes and their association with lithium treatment has not been established. CTIN patients might present with nephrotic proteinuria (> 3.0g/dL), worsening renal insufficiency, and/or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Postmarketing cases consistent with nephrotic syndrome in patients with or without CTIN have also been reported. Biopsy findings in patients with nephrotic syndrome include minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The discontinuation of lithium in patients with nephrotic syndrome has resulted in the remission of nephrotic syndrome.

	- Kidney function should be assessed prior to and during lithium treatment. Routine urinalysis and other tests may be used to evaluate tubular function (e.g. urine specific gravity or osmolality following a period of water deprivation, or 24-hour urine volume) and glomerular function (e.g. serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, or proteinuria). During lithium treatment, progressive or sudden changes in renal function, even within the normal range, indicate the need for re-evaluation of treatment.

Renal impairment

As lithium is eliminated primarily through the kidney, lithium renal clearance is decreased in patients with abnormal renal function, and the risk of lithium intoxication increases considerably in this setting. Lithium should not be used in severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault), especially if the condition requires adherence to a low-sodium diet [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with lower doses of lithium, and titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and for signs of lithium toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^1153TcfL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In older studies, a 'point of no return' at a GFR of approximately 40 mL/min/1.73 m² has been discussed, at which progression to kidney failure irreversibly continues despite lithium discontinuation. In this scenario, the underlying pathological process of lithium nephropathy (i.e. renal fibrosis) would become self-perpetuating so that it could not be halted by lithium discontinuation. Alternatively, lithium could have been discontinued too late, so that substantial tissue destruction had already taken place.

In our study, the positive effect of lithium discontinuation was most pronounced in participants with low eGFR. In most participants, this was a relative improvement. They continued to decrease in kidney function despite lithium discontinuation, albeit at a slower rate. In some, eGFR increased, a sign of renal recovery. Recovery of kidney function even occurred in participants with eGFR < 30 at the time of lithium discontinuation. Participants who showed signs of recovery did not have higher eGFR than those who did not. This finding is in conflict with Hoekstra et al. In this study, 13 patients discontinued lithium with an eGFR < 60. Of these, six patients continued to decline in kidney function. They had lower eGFR than patients with eGFR improvement (32 vs. 46 mL/min/1.73 m²). It is possible that these patients had other causes of low eGFR than lithium nephropathy.

In our study, we censored measurements in the setting of severe illness or AKI and excluded glomerular diseases with rapid GFR decline. We also corrected for diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

### Besremi [^111zdnxb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hepatotoxicity has occurred in patients receiving interferon alfa products, including Besremi. These toxicities may include increases in serum ALT, AST, GGT, and bilirubin. Besremi is contraindicated in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

Increases in serum ALT ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), AST ≥ 3 times the ULN, GGT ≥ 3 times the ULN, and bilirubin > 2 times the ULN have been observed in patients treated with Besremi.

In the clinical development program of Besremi, 36 patients (20%) experienced liver enzyme elevations, 33 of whom had elevations of 1.25–5× ULN. Patients were able to resume Besremi upon resolution of liver enzyme elevations. Liver enzyme elevations have also been reported in patients after long-term Besremi therapy.

Monitor liver enzymes and hepatic function at baseline and during Besremi treatment.

- **Dosage adjustment**: Reduce Besremi dosage by 50 mcg for increased AST/ALT/GGT. Then monitor AST/ALT/GGT weekly until the values return to baseline or grade 1 (ALT and AST) × ULN. Consider permanent discontinuation if increased liver enzyme levels persist after four dose-reductions.

Discontinue Besremi in patients who develop evidence of persistent liver enzyme elevations.

### Descovy [^112wkFes]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Immune reconstitution syndrome**: Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including FTC, a component of Descovy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections, such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders, such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis, have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution. However, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after the initiation of treatment.

- **New onset or worsening renal impairment**: Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), and Fanconi syndrome, have been reported with TAF-containing products. While most of these cases were characterized by potential confounders that may have contributed to the reported renal events, it is also possible that these factors may have predisposed patients to tenofovir-related adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Descovy is not recommended for individuals with an estimated creatinine clearance of 15 to below 30 mL per minute or in individuals with an estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL per minute who are not receiving chronic hemodialysis.

### Valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in an elderly patient with a history of nephrectomy: a case report [^112SQfB4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

There have been many proposed mechanisms for the cause of AKI in patients taking valacyclovir. The most common mechanism, agreed upon by various papers, includes crystal nephropathy causing obstructive and cellular necrosis. Another mechanism involves the acyclovir aldehyde effect on tubular dysfunction. Valacyclovir causes direct cell damage, leading to membrane permeability. Destruction of mitochondria inhibits key enzymatic activity, leading to cell necrosis.

The patient described in our case study had multiple risk factors that increased her likelihood of developing AKI, including underlying CKD, diabetes, and the usage of ACE inhibitors. This combined effect, in addition to a history of nephrectomy, contributed to the development of acute renal failure. Our case is unique in that it is the first paper, at the time of writing, to describe a patient with a history of nephrectomy and the use of valacyclovir who developed acute renal failure with neurotoxicity. The patient fits the demographic of an elderly female prone to valacyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity.

To rule out other etiologies of acute kidney injury and allow for a definitive diagnosis, a kidney biopsy should be performed. Kato et al. describe renal biopsy findings in an elderly woman with nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity induced by valacyclovir, which include acute tubular injury with eosinophilic material in the tubular lumen as well as arteriosclerosis, without glomerulonephritis or interstitial nephritis. However, a limitation in our case was the inability to obtain a renal biopsy due to the patient's condition.

Regarding quality improvement for chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning laboratory requirements, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend the consistent use of enzymatic creatinine assays in children. This recommendation is due to the higher relative contribution of non-creatinine chromogens to measured creatinine when using the Jaffe assay and the high prevalence of icteric and hemolyzed samples in the neonatal period.

### Triumeq PD [^115yEYef]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir, all patients should be screened for the HLA‑B✱5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with Triumeq or Triumeq PD, or reinitiating therapy with Triumeq or Triumeq PD, unless patients have a previously documented HLA‑B✱5701 allele assessment. Triumeq and Triumeq PD are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA‑B✱5701‑positive patients.

Before starting Triumeq or Triumeq PD, it is essential to review the medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product. Never restart Triumeq or Triumeq PD or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA‑B✱5701 status. To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, irrespective of HLA‑B✱5701 status, discontinue Triumeq or Triumeq PD immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g. acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications). Clinical status, including liver chemistries, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated.

If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart Triumeq or Triumeq PD or any other abacavir-containing products, as more severe symptoms, which may include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours.

### Lithium carbonate [^115zwJ5V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concurrent medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**: See dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years). Obtain serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose and regularly until the patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. Each 5 mL of lithium oral solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), which is equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate.

- **Serum lithium monitoring**: Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone.

### Phosphate restriction prevents metabolic acidosis and curbs rise in FGF23 and mortality in murine folic acid-induced AKI [^114XStyp]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

- **Results**: Phosphate (Pᵢ) restriction diminished the AKI-induced rise in plasma intact and c-terminal FGF23.

Twenty-four hours after acute kidney injury (AKI) induction, kidney weight, plasma urea and creatinine, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and renal expression of Havcr1 (kidney injury molecule 1 or KIM-1) were significantly elevated. Body weight decreased similarly in both folic acid (FA) groups, confirming the induction of AKI. The efficacy of phosphate restriction was confirmed by a significantly lower urinary phosphate per creatinine ratio in the low phosphate (LP) group compared to the normal phosphate (NP) groups, independent of FA treatment. Plasma phosphate was elevated after FA treatment in the NP group, as previously reported; however, it remained unchanged in the LP group. Conversely, plasma total calcium (Ca²⁺) increased in the LP-FA group but was unchanged in the NP-FA group.

- **Figure 1**: This figure illustrates kidney injury markers and phosphate 24 hours after FA-AKI. Wild-type male C57BL6/JRj mice were fed either a normal (NP, 0.6% Pᵢ) or low (LP, < 0.1% Pᵢ) diet for four days before being treated with FA or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃, vehicle) and sacrificed after 24 hours.

	- Plasma urea and creatinine levels and urinary NGAL (expressed in logarithmically transformed data, native units: ng/mg) were normalized to creatinine.

### Clozaril [^114MHmN1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Weight gain has occurred with the use of antipsychotics, including Clozaril. It is essential to monitor weight during treatment with Clozaril. The studies conducted provide insights into this issue:

- **Weight gain by duration of exposure**: Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with Clozaril and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609 days in the Clozaril group, 728 days in the olanzapine group, and 42 days in the chlorpromazine group.

- **Weight gain relative to baseline in schizophrenia subjects**: Table 8 summarizes pooled data from 11 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia demonstrating weight gain ≥ 7% of body weight relative to baseline. The median duration of exposure was the same as noted previously, with 609 days for the Clozaril group, 728 days for the olanzapine group, and 42 days for the chlorpromazine group.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a serious adverse effect associated with antipsychotic drugs, including Clozaril. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability, such as irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome can be complicated. It is crucial to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions, such as severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever.

Management of NMS should include immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to the patient's immediate care.

### Managing bipolar affective disorder in chronic kidney disease when lithium is no longer an option [^113477UC]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

This is the case of a woman in her 70s on lithium maintenance therapy for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) while on haemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Similar to Case 1, she experienced multiple inpatient admissions for manic episodes in her twenties and then remained stable in mental state for many years on maintenance lithium therapy. She was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3B, with eGFR 30, creatinine 164, and urea 13.5, while maintaining lithium levels ranging from 0.84 to 0.94. She was referred to nephrology, and her lithium dose was reduced due to continued decline in renal function.

Due to continued kidney function decline, lithium was discontinued, and olanzapine and carbamazepine were commenced as alternative mood-stabilizing agents. Her mental health then deteriorated, leading to a prolonged inpatient admission for a manic relapse, necessitating a combination of olanzapine, carbamazepine, and clonazepam to stabilize her mental state. Following discharge home, her mental state failed to return to baseline, and she experienced significant anxiety symptoms and subjective memory impairment.

As she was approaching ESRD, she was referred for consideration of renal transplant. Initially, she was listed for transplantation; however, her mental state remained anxious with depressive symptoms. Following a protracted assessment and support from nephrology, psychiatry, transplant services, and her family, she was deemed no longer suitable and was delisted for transplant. Renal decline progressed, and she was commenced on haemodialysis. She continues to experience significant depressive symptoms, and following extensive collaboration among her healthcare teams, efforts continue to manage her mental and physical health.

### Avapro [^111AwyuL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Lithium**: There is a risk of lithium toxicity when taken with irbesartan. Patients should have their lithium levels monitored.
	- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): The combination may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and a reduction in the antihypertensive effects of irbesartan. It is advised to monitor renal function periodically in patients coadministered these drugs.
	- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system**: This can increase the risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: The coadministration of Avapro with drugs that elevate serum potassium levels can lead to hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Therefore, serum potassium should be monitored in such patients.

- **Lithium**: Irbesartan may increase serum lithium concentrations, leading to lithium toxicity. Monitoring lithium levels in patients receiving both irbesartan and lithium is recommended.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: Elderly, volume-depleted patients, or those with compromised renal function may experience deterioration of renal function up to acute renal failure when NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors are coadministered with angiotensin II receptor antagonists like irbesartan. These effects are usually reversible, necessitating periodic monitoring of renal function. Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)**: Employing a dual blockade with angiotensin receptor blockers can increase the risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

### Treximet [^116wu4WE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- Drugs that interfere with hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking Treximet with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of Treximet and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended.

	- **ACE inhibitors and ARBs**: Concomitant use with Treximet in elderly, volume-depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high-risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function.

	- **Diuretics**: NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of loop and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to ensure the efficacy of diuretics, including antihypertensive effects.

	- **Digoxin**: Concomitant use with Treximet can increase serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Monitor serum digoxin levels.

	- **Lithium**: Increases lithium plasma levels.

	- **Methotrexate**: Increases methotrexate plasma levels.

- **Clinically significant drug interactions with Treximet**: See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions with NSAIDs or sumatriptan.

- **Drug/laboratory test interactions**:

	- **Blood tests**: Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time. This effect should be considered when bleeding times are determined.

	- **Urine tests**: The administration of naproxen sodium may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids due to an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-di-nitrobenzene used in this assay.

### Lemtrada [^113kcvns]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The incidence of antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including inhibitory antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Lemtrada with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a competitive binding assay, anti-alemtuzumab binding antibodies were detected in 62%, 67%, and 29% of Lemtrada-treated patients at months 1, 3, and 12 (Course 1), as well as 83%, 83%, and 75% of Lemtrada-treated patients at months 13, 15, and 24 (Course 2). Samples that tested positive for binding antibodies were further evaluated for evidence of in vitro inhibition using a flow cytometry assay. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 87%, 46%, and 5% of positive binding antibody patients at months 1, 3, and 12 (Course 1), as well as 94%, 88%, and 42% of positive binding antibody patients at months 13, 15, and 24 (Course 2). Anti-alemtuzumab antibodies were associated with decreased alemtuzumab concentration during Course 2, but not Course 1. Through two treatment courses, there was no evidence from clinical trials that the presence of binding or inhibitory anti-alemtuzumab antibodies had a significant effect on clinical outcomes.

### Dasetta 1/35 [^1151WYzV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your healthcare professional about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding or four weeks following a second-trimester abortion. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill.

- **Circulatory disease risk**: The risk of circulatory disease in oral contraceptive users may be higher in users of high-dose pills and may be greater with longer duration of oral contraceptive use. In addition, some of these increased risks may continue for a number of years after stopping oral contraceptives.

- **Age-related risk**: The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and non-users of oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages. For women aged 20 to 44, it is estimated that about 1 in 2,000 using oral contraceptives will be hospitalized each year because of abnormal clotting. Among nonusers in the same age group, about 1 in 20,000 would be hospitalized each year.

For oral contraceptive users in general, it has been estimated that in women between the ages of 15 and 34…

### Elevated right ventricular systolic pressure and outcomes after emergency hip surgery: A case control study [^11759WCZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

During the study period, 527 patients underwent emergency hip surgery for joint replacement or fracture fixation in our hospital. Ninety-eight patients (19%) had a preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and were included in the study population.

- **Study population**: The indications for requesting a preoperative TTE included a history or signs of heart disease (n = 88), a history of stroke or thromboembolic event (n = 5), or a history of pulmonary hypertension (n = 4). The indications for preoperative TTE in the remaining patient were not recorded.

- **RVSP findings**: Forty-two of the 98 patients (43%) who had a preoperative TTE were found to have an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (mean RVSP: 47 ± 10 mmHg). In these 42 patients, the RVSP was 35–39 mmHg in 9 patients, 40–49 mmHg in 18 patients, and ≥ 50 mmHg in 15 patients. Fifty-six patients (57%) were classified as having a normal RVSP (mean RVSP: 25 ± 6 mmHg). Of these 56 patients, 22 had no recorded RVSP on their preoperative TTE due to insufficient tricuspid regurgitation or poorly visualized tricuspid valve. For the purposes of this study, these 22 patients were assigned to the normal RVSP group.

- **Pulmonary hypertension diagnoses**: Four of the 98 patients (4%) had a previous diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. All were found to have an elevated RVSP (mean 47 ± 6 mmHg) on TTE. One had pulmonary hypertension secondary to left heart disease, and three had multifactorial mechanisms.

During the study period, the mortality rate for all patients undergoing emergency hip surgery (n = 527) was 5%.

### Managing bipolar affective disorder in chronic kidney disease when lithium is no longer an option [^114nu8CE]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

With longevity of use, the clinical risks and benefits of lithium are clearly described. Adverse effects, including impact on glomerular function and end-stage renal disease, are considerations for the psychiatrist when commencing lithium in a younger patient. Clarity of diagnosis, where there is a risk of suicide and recurrence of an acute manic or depressive episode, must be confirmed before lithium is commenced. Ceasing lithium therapy as renal function declines and cross-titrating to other mood stabilizers is an option. In both of our cases, alternative mood stabilizers were appropriately trialed when CKD stage 3b was reached but were not sufficient to maintain stability of mental state.

The mortality gap between individuals with BPAD and the general population is widening. Psychiatrists should take a proactive approach to physical health monitoring with intervention when abnormalities are detected.

This case series highlights the challenges of managing BPAD in those with lithium-induced kidney disease approaching ESRD. Collaboration between specialties is essential in managing these patients. Recommencing lithium in hemodialysis with careful monitoring of lithium levels and dosing regimens in coordination with the patient's hemodialysis schedule was a successful option in case 2. With advances in medical management and life expectancy in ESRD, this clinical scenario will likely become more prevalent. Regular monitoring of laboratory parameters, including creatinine and eGFR, is essential, as is personal follow-up. Further research in this area, including clear guidance, is necessary.

### Apadaz [^116nGmYR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may exhibit increased sensitivity to hydrocodone. Therefore, exercise caution when selecting a dosage for elderly patients, typically starting at the lower end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as the presence of concomitant disease or other drug therapies. Respiratory depression is the primary risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after administering large initial doses to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Apadaz slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Hydrocodone and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. As elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, dose selection should be approached with care, and it may be beneficial to regularly assess renal function.

- **Hepatic impairment**: The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Apadaz has not been determined. Patients with hepatic impairment may exhibit higher plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function. It is advisable to use a low initial dose of Apadaz in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease and regularly evaluate for adverse events such as respiratory depression and hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions].

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^111XFYJB]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Lithium salts have been a mainstay in the treatment of mood disorders since the 1970s. Guidelines support lithium as a first-line drug for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder (BD). Lithium is thought to lower the risk of suicide and to be superior to other mood stabilizers. Apart from being used as a maintenance treatment for BD, lithium is also used for the treatment of acute mania or as an augmentation therapy for unipolar depression. However, long-term lithium treatment causes faster loss of kidney function. Decreased kidney function is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it may also increase the risk of lithium intoxication. Finally, kidney failure can ensue. Lithium-associated glomerular damage (lithium nephropathy) has been at the forefront of clinicians' minds since the early 1980s, giving rise to the question of whether the benefits of lithium to mental health were bought at the expense of renal health. Treatment strategies to address renal side effects of lithium remain lacking even today.

Intuitively, stopping lithium could be considered the most effective way to prevent the progression of lithium nephropathy. In our previous work, we have shown that decreasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) accounts for 9% of lithium discontinuations. However, it remains unclear whether stopping lithium improves kidney function. We searched PubMed for studies published between January 1, 2003, and August 11, 2024, using the search strings 'lithium AND kidney' or 'lithium AND renal', without language restrictions.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^114KDVSw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The mirror periods were pivotal in assessing the impact of lithium discontinuation. The mirror marked the point when lithium treatment was halted. In cases where lithium was tapered, the date of the first dose reduction was used. The pre-mirror period encompassed 5 years, as did the post-mirror period, unless interrupted by specific events. These events included:

- **Initiation of chronic renal replacement therapy**: This necessitated a premature end to the post-mirror period.
- **Death**: This naturally concluded data collection.
- **The study's end date**: Marked at 31 December 2017, this date also signified the end of data collection.
- **Lithium reintroduction**: Defined as continuous treatment exceeding 90 days, this event also curtailed the post-mirror period.
- **Development of other somatic diseases**: If these conditions affected kidney function or resulted in muscle mass loss — thereby complicating creatinine-based eGFR interpretation — they influenced data collection.

For participants diagnosed with a somatic disease affecting creatinine interpretation during the pre-mirror period, only data up to the time of diagnosis were included, excluding all post-mirror data. When analyzing changes in eGFR after lithium reintroduction, the observation period was extended by a minimum of 2 years post-reinstatement. This extension resulted in a maximum observation period of 7 years for participants who discontinued and then reinstated lithium (Supporting Information Fig. A1).

### Vpriv [^116nzhex]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Immunogenicity: As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Several factors may influence the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparing the incidence of antibodies to Vpriv in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

In clinical studies, 1 of 54 (2%) enzyme treatment-naïve patients treated with Vpriv developed IgG antibodies to Vpriv. One additional patient developed IgG antibodies to Vpriv during an extension study. In both patients, the IgG antibodies to Vpriv were determined to be neutralizing in an in vitro assay. The presence of IgG antibodies to Vpriv was not associated with hypersensitivity reactions. It is unknown if the presence of IgG antibodies to Vpriv is associated with a higher risk of infusion reactions. Patients with an immune response to other enzyme replacement therapies who are switching to Vpriv should continue to be monitored for antibodies to Vpriv.

Postmarketing experience: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Vpriv. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^116ZW1Lu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Long-term lithium treatment decreases kidney function. However, it remains unclear whether stopping lithium improves kidney function. The objective of this study was to evaluate kidney function in patients who stopped and subsequently restarted lithium treatment.

- **Methods**: A mirror-image design using data from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study was employed. The mirror was set to when lithium was discontinued, with a 5-year pre- and post-mirror period. Adult patients with bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or unipolar depression who had been on lithium for ≥ 4.5 years in the pre-mirror period were included. Creatinine measurements from 1997 to 2017 were analyzed. The main outcome measured was the difference in mean annual change of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), adjusted for sex, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

- **Results**: A total of 168 participants (94 women and 74 men) were included. The mean annual change in eGFR was −1.58 (−1.87 to −1.28) mL/min/1.73 m²/year before and −0.023 (−0.49 to +0.44) mL/min/1.73 m²/year after lithium discontinuation for participants with a baseline eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². For those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², the change was 3.03 (2.15–3.92) mL/min/1.73 m²/year. The improvement was sustained over the 5-year post-mirror period. In participants who restarted lithium, the mean annual change in eGFR was −1.71 (−2.26 to −1.16) mL/min/1.73 m²/year, indicating a setback compared to their lithium-free post-mirror period (p < 0.0001). No significant difference was noted compared to the pre-mirror period (p = 0.51).

### Aldurazyme [^111FhNSh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The immunogenicity of Aldurazyme is profoundly influenced by the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Differences in assay methods make comparing the incidence of ADA across different studies challenging, including those of Aldurazyme or other laronidase products.

In clinical studies 1, 2, and 3 [see clinical studies (14.1, 14.2)], and a dose-ranging study involving eight patients aged 3 to 17 years receiving weekly intravenous doses of 0.58 mg/kg of Aldurazyme, 70 out of 73 patients (96%) treated with Aldurazyme developed IgG anti-laronidase antibodies, also known as ADA. The three patients who did not develop ADA had Hurler-Scheie forms of MPS I. For the 70 patients who developed ADA, most showed ADA positivity within two months of starting Aldurazyme treatment. ADA titers peaked around four months and generally declined over time. Higher ADA titers were noted in patients with Hurler forms of MPS I. Neutralizing antibodies, which inhibited cellular uptake of laronidase, were detected in 38 of the 70 (54%) patients with ADA. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies that inhibited laronidase enzyme activity were identified in 1 out of the 70 (1.4%) patients with ADA.

- **Anti-drug antibody effects on pharmacokinetics**: In Study 1, some Aldurazyme-treated patients who developed ADA experienced increased plasma clearance of laronidase at week 12, compared to week 1. Patients with higher ADA titers exhibited higher clearance rates.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111ro2Wh]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (initiation), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend offering hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors after iron repletion in patients with symptomatic anemia (hemoglobin < 105 g/L) of CKD (stages 3–5, eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) who are not receiving dialysis at the start of therapy. This is particularly advised for patients who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function, and to avoid blood transfusion, especially in patients considered suitable for transplantation.

### Operando real-space imaging of a structural phase transformation in the high-voltage electrode LiNiMnO [^115Kx67z]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Figure 1c–j presents the central slice of the measured operando 3D diffraction data as a function of depth of discharge (DoD, in equilibrium equivalent to x in LiₓNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄) for the 111 Bragg peak of both phases (see Fig. S4 for the full dataset with 50 measurements). At 0% DoD, corresponding to the fully charged state, only one Bragg peak surrounded by interference fringes appears at the larger momentum transfer, normal to the (111) planes (Fig. 1c).

During the initial stages of discharge, spanning from 0% to 35% DoD, the main peak shows variations in its interference fringes, suggesting local structural changes within the nanoparticle due to lithium intercalation (Figs. 1d and S4). From 0% to 15.3% DoD (Fig. S4), a flare appears on the main peak, which we interpret as x-ray interference due to changes in the displacement field from Li intercalation, rather than the emergence of a second structural phase. There is a slight decrease in the peak position, indicating a solid solution behavior during the initial introduction of lithium.

Beginning between 41.5% and 50.5% DoD (Fig. 1e, f), a secondary peak emerges, steadily gaining intensity at the cost of diminishing intensity in the primary peak (Fig. 1e–i). This is the hallmark of a discontinuous structural phase transformation, characterized by a substantial variation in the order parameter, namely, the lattice constant. The presence of both diffraction peaks emanating from an individual sub-micrometer crystal indicates phase coexistence.

Control for bias and missing data:

In LiSIE, we controlled for selection bias with key parameters available in anonymized form, including age, sex, and, where applicable, maximum recorded concentrations of lithium and creatinine. In accordance with the ethics approval granted, we compared these parameters for consenting and non-consenting participants. There were no significant differences between the two groups, and the data were complete for included participants for the defined outcome.

### Unexpected diagnosis of WHIM syndrome in refractory autoimmune cytopenia [^111mbB9c]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Impaired CXCR4 internalization in B-cell mutants was observed. Phosphorylated CXCR4 recruits β-arrestin-1 and -2, which promotes CXCR4 internalization and terminates activation. We tested the internalization of surface CXCR4 with CXCL12 activation in WT and mutant-bearing NALM6 cells, chosen because they allow examination of this function in a B-cell line. Although there was rapid loss of surface CXCR4 in cells bearing the WT receptor, the cells bearing the mutants V320EfsX23 and S319CfsX24 showed little or no loss in the same 30- to 360-minute time frame (Figure 2B). A small loss of receptor expression was also seen for the common mutants R334X and S338X cells, but not to the extent noted for the WT cells.

### Voraxaze [^1173LN83]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other glucarpidase products may be misleading.

In clinical trials, 121 patients who received one (n = 99), two (n = 21), or three (n = 1) doses of Voraxaze were evaluated for anti-glucarpidase antibodies. Twenty-five of these 121 patients (21%) had detectable anti-glucarpidase antibodies following Voraxaze administration, of which 19 received one dose of Voraxaze and six received two doses of Voraxaze. Antibody titers were determined using a bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-glucarpidase antibodies.

Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 11 of the 25 patients who tested positive for anti-glucarpidase binding antibodies. Eight of these 11 patients had received a single dose of Voraxaze; however, the development of neutralizing antibodies may be underreported due to lack of assay sensitivity.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^114tjfV5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The procedures for the measurement of kidney function and estimation of GFR utilized creatinine measurements available from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2017, accessible through the central laboratory database. This database included all measurements taken in both public and private healthcare settings. All blood samples were analyzed using enzymatic methods. Samples from 2004 onward were analyzed by an assay calibrated to isotope dilution mass spectrometry creatinine. Blood samples taken before 2004 were analyzed by an assay calibrated to the manufacturer's specifications of that time; these were converted prior to statistical analysis to ensure comparability with newer samples. We included all measurements from the pre- and post-mirror periods and the period after restarting lithium. The eGFR was calculated from creatinine, age, and sex using the Lund-Malmö revised formula, which is validated in a Swedish population. Creatinine samples taken during episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) were censored, according to criteria specified in the 'Procedures' section of the Supporting Information.

The outcome was the difference in mean annual eGFR change in mL/min/1.73 m² between the pre- and post-mirror periods, adjusted for sex, hypertension, and diabetes.

### Xolair [^114du8pw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Based on spontaneous reports and an estimated exposure of about 57,300 patients from June 2003 through December 2006, the frequency of anaphylaxis attributed to Xolair use was estimated to be at least 0.2% of patients.

Diagnostic criteria of anaphylaxis included skin or mucosal tissue involvement and either airway compromise and/or reduced blood pressure, with or without associated symptoms. There was a temporal relationship to Xolair administration with no other identifiable cause. Signs and symptoms in these reported cases included:

- Bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, urticaria, angioedema of the throat or tongue, dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, and/or cutaneous angioedema.

Pulmonary involvement was reported in 89% of the cases, while hypotension or syncope occurred in 14% of cases. Fifteen percent of the reported cases resulted in hospitalization. Additionally, a previous history of anaphylaxis unrelated to Xolair was reported in 24% of the cases.

Of the reported cases of anaphylaxis attributed to Xolair:

- 39% occurred with the first dose.
- 19% occurred with the second dose.
- 10% occurred with the third dose, with the remainder occurring after subsequent doses.

One particular case occurred after 39 doses; after 19 months of continuous therapy, anaphylaxis occurred when treatment was restarted following a 3-month gap.

The time to onset of anaphylaxis in these cases was variable:

- Up to 30 minutes in 35% of cases.
- Greater than 30 and up to 60 minutes in 16%.
- Greater than 60 and up to 90 minutes in 2%.
- Greater than 90 and up to 120 minutes in 6%.
- Greater than 2 hours and up to 6 hours in 5%.
- Greater than 6 hours and up to 12 hours.

### Zolgensma [^114u5ByE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The most frequent adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5%) and increases in alanine aminotransferase in the four studies (data cut-off date: September 27, 2018) are summarized in Table 2.

One death occurred in a patient who received Zolgensma at the age of 5 months (6 kg) in a completed non-United States clinical trial (NCT03461289). The patient initially presented with respiratory insufficiency 12 days after Zolgensma infusion and was found to have RSV and parainfluenza in respiratory secretions. The patient experienced episodes of serious hypotension followed by seizures and was found to have leukoencephalopathy (brain white matter defects) approximately 30 days after Zolgensma infusion. The patient died after withdrawal of life support 52 days after Zolgensma infusion.

- **Immunogenicity**: In Zolgensma clinical trials, patients were required to have baseline anti-AAV9 antibody titers of ≤ 1:50, measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Evidence of prior exposure to AAV9 was uncommon. The safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in patients with anti-AAV9 antibody titers above 1:50 have not been evaluated. Perform baseline testing for the presence of anti-AAV9 antibodies prior to Zolgensma infusion. Retesting may be performed if anti-AAV9 antibody titers are reported as > 1:50 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].

Following Zolgensma infusion, increases from baseline in anti-AAV9 antibody titers occurred in all patients. In Study 2, anti-AAV9 antibody titers reached at least 1:102,400 in every patient, and titers exceeded 1:819,200 in most patients.

### Sulindac [^111r1RRr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cyclosporine: Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) concomitantly with cyclosporine has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.

Diflunisal: The concomitant administration of sulindac and diflunisal in normal volunteers resulted in a lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.

Diuretics: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that sulindac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

DMSO: DMSO should not be used with sulindac. Concomitant administration has been reported to reduce the plasma levels of the active sulfide metabolite and potentially reduce efficacy. In addition, this combination has been reported to cause peripheral neuropathy.

Lithium: NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to the inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111k56ZZ]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors initiation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend ensuring that patients are iron replete. This is defined as achieving and maintaining the target hemoglobin range in patients receiving ESAs:

- **Target levels for iron parameters**:
	- Percentage of hypochromic red cells > 31 pg, ferritin > 100 mcg/L, and transferrin saturation > 20% for patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD or on peritoneal dialysis.
	- Ferritin > 200 mcg/L for patients on hemodialysis.
	- Ferritin > 100 mcg/L for children with CKD on dialysis, as well as children with CKD not on ESAs.

- **Iron administration considerations**:
	- Consider administering iron when ferritin is < 500 mcg/L and/or transferrin saturation is < 30% to ensure iron repletion.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^114GQe2G]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Long-term lithium treatment decreases kidney function. However, it remains unclear whether stopping lithium improves kidney function.

- **Objectives**: To study kidney function in patients who stopped and subsequently restarted lithium treatment.

- **Methods**: A mirror-image design was employed using data from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study. The mirror was set to when lithium was stopped, with a 5-year pre- and post-mirror period. Adult patients with bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or unipolar depression who had been on lithium for ≥ 4.5 years in the pre-mirror period were included. Creatinine measurements were available from 1997 to 2017. The main outcome was the difference in mean annual change of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) adjusted for sex, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

- **Results**: A total of 168 participants (94 women, 74 men) were included. Mean annual eGFR change was -1.58 (-1.87 to -1.28) mL/min/1.73 m²/year before and -0.023 (-0.49 to +0.44) mL/min/1.73 m²/year after lithium discontinuation (p < 0.0001) for participants with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The change was 3.03 (2.15–3.92) mL/min/1.73 m²/year for participants with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The effect was persistent over the 5-year post-mirror study period. For participants restarting lithium, the mean annual eGFR change was -1.71 (-2.26 to -1.16) mL/min/1.73 m²/year, a setback compared to their lithium-free post-mirror period (p < 0.0001). No difference was observed compared to the pre-mirror period (p = 0.51).

- **Conclusions**: The study indicates that kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation, but may regress upon resumption of lithium therapy.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^1161iYyS]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

In circumstances specific to chronic kidney disease, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend initiating either an ACEi or ARB. This approach aims to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events in non-pregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension who have either moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30–299 mg/g creatinine) or severely increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine), and/or an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^114F7tQL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Lithium discontinuation slowed down the mean eGFR decline in the whole study group. This observation was consistent throughout the 5-year observation period after lithium discontinuation. The effect was more pronounced in participants with lower eGFR at the time of lithium discontinuation. In participants who restarted lithium, the mean annual decline of eGFR reverted to that of pre-lithium discontinuation levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a bi-directional association between lithium treatment and kidney function, in that the decline of eGFR improves when lithium is discontinued and worsens again when lithium is reinstated.

In our literature review, we found ten other studies exploring the effect of lithium discontinuation on kidney function, reported either as GFR or creatinine clearance (supporting information Table A1). Two additional studies re-analysed datasets from the previous ten studies. Of all identified studies, three showed significant improvement, eight no significant difference after stopping lithium, and one report found kidney function decline to be significantly accelerated after discontinuation. This report is an update on a previous study. The original study did not find any difference when comparing eGFR over four years in participants with eGFR < 45 in whom lithium was continued compared to participants in whom lithium was reduced or discontinued. The later follow-up found a difference in favour of continuing lithium. Details on the statistical analysis and characteristics of participants were not reported.

### Risk of chronic kidney disease in individuals on lithium therapy in Iceland: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^114fZ27y]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

The association between lithium use and chronic kidney disease, and the effect of comorbidities on this association, are poorly understood. Our aim was to examine the risk of developing stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease among people receiving lithium therapy.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study of all adults (aged ≥ 18 years) in Iceland treated with lithium for a mood disorder who had two or more serum creatinine measurements available in the years 2008–2017, irrespective of the duration of lithium therapy. Participants were identified from the Prescription Medicines Register of the Directorate of Health or through blood lithium measurements. The control group comprised all eligible outpatients with mood disorders (ICD-10 codes F30-F39) who had not been prescribed lithium and who had attended the national tertiary referral center in 2014–2016. Individuals with chronic kidney disease (identified by ICD codes or an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²) before January 1, 2008, or those with glomerular disease, genetic or congenital kidney disease, or small kidneys diagnosed before or after 2008, were excluded. Chronic kidney disease stages 3 and higher were defined according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. The eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine; all ICD-10 and ICD-9 diagnosis codes, serum creatinine and blood lithium concentrations, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios were obtained from healthcare institutions.

### Combination blood pressure lowering therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes: messages from the ADVANCE trial [^1115Qbtp]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Hirakawa et al. assessed the association between discontinuation of study blood pressure (BP) lowering treatment and adverse clinical outcomes in the ADVANCE trial. Although discontinuation of active treatment was uncommon in ADVANCE — only 1% lower adherence in active versus placebo groups — patients who permanently discontinued randomized BP lowering medication during the study period (n = 1557) compared to those who continued active treatment (n = 9583) experienced increased risk of combined macrovascular and microvascular events (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.96–2.57) and all-cause mortality (HR 7.99, 6.92–9.21). These findings highlight the importance of adherence to therapy in at-risk individuals; any discontinuation of therapy should flag patients for urgent investigation and management.

Transient increases in serum creatinine are a known and expected effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Treatment discontinuation is recommended if patients experience a ≥ 30% increase in serum creatinine after commencement of therapy. However, the long-term effects of continued or discontinued treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors following a creatinine rise were unknown. The ADVANCE trial included a six-week active run-in period where all patients received perindopril and indapamide. Afterward, patients were randomized to continue treatment or discontinue treatment and start placebo. Ohkuma et al. studied the association between increases in serum creatinine during the 6-week active run-in period and the benefit of continued randomized therapy with perindopril and indapamide versus placebo.

### Zortress [^114PLxLV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A third treatment group of Zortress 3 mg per day (1.5 mg twice daily; target trough concentrations 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced exposure cyclosporine was included in the study described above. Although it was as effective as the lower dose Zortress group, the overall safety was worse; consequently, higher doses of Zortress cannot be recommended. Out of 279 patients, 95 (34%) discontinued the study medication, with 57 (20%) doing so because of adverse reactions.

- **Adverse reactions**: The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Zortress when used at this higher dose were injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (Zortress 1.5 mg: 5%, Zortress 3 mg: 7%, and control: 2%), infections (2%, 6%, and 3%, respectively), renal and urinary disorders (4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (1%, 3%, and 2%).

The combination of fixed-dose Zortress and standard doses of cyclosporine in previous kidney clinical trials resulted in frequent elevations of serum creatinine, with higher mean and median serum creatinine values observed than in the study with reduced exposure cyclosporine. These results indicate that Zortress increases cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity and, therefore, should only be used in a concentration-controlled regimen with reduced exposure cyclosporine [see Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### A first-in-class Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein activator with antitumor activity in hematologic cancers [^114V6iaE]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

Gene expression profiling was conducted by exposing the REC1 cell line to DMSO and EG-011 (500 nM) for eight hours. The HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for the analysis, with processing and statistical analysis performed in R/Bioconductor as previously described. Transcript mapping utilized HG19 with manufacturer-supplied annotation, and data were analyzed using the Omics Playground platform (https://bigomics.ch).

- **Kinase assay screening**: EG-011 was screened against 468 human kinases using the ATP-independent KINOMEscan assay (Discoverx, CA, USA) at a concentration of 1 μM. Additionally, it was tested against 320 kinases at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 μM with a regular ATP-related assay (Wildtype-Profiler, ProQinase, Freiburg, Germany).

- **Thermal proteome profiling, surface plasmon resonance, and nuclear magnetic resonance**: These experiments followed protocols described by Franken et al. with modifications. Comprehensive methodological details are available in the Online Supplementary Materials and Methods.

- **Functional Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein experiments and pyrene actin assembly assays**: Complete methodological details can be accessed in the Online Supplementary Materials and Methods.

- **Immunofluorescence**: Due to protocol compatibility issues, the VL51 sensitive cell line was used instead of the REC1 cell line for immunofluorescence studies. Full methodological details are provided in the Online Supplementary Materials and Methods.

### Arbli [^1149fizo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Co-administration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

- **Lithium**: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)**: Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes (VA NEPHRON-D) trial enrolled 1,448 patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^116Z2uio]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

For this study, we included participants whose lithium treatment had been stopped between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2013. Medical records were examined for termination of the prescription or lack of serum lithium concentrations. The cause and exact time of lithium discontinuation were manually validated independently by two researchers. We then selected participants with (a) a cumulative time on lithium of at least 4.5 years within the 5 years prior to discontinuation and (b) continuous lithium treatment during the 3 months preceding discontinuation. When there were several episodes of lithium discontinuation, we included the episode with the longest lithium-free follow-up.

To enable a comparison of the two mirror periods under equal conditions, only participants with known kidney diseases expected to have a slow and continuous GFR decline pattern were included. Participants with kidney diseases where irregular or rapid GFR decline patterns could occur were excluded [described in the 'Method' section of Supporting Information]. We further excluded participants in whom, after manual validation, a diagnosis of schizophrenia or personality disorder was more likely than BD or SZD.

Sex was defined according to legal sex stated in the medical records on 31 December 2017. Case notes were evaluated until 31 December 2017. The following comorbidities were recorded: diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, smoking, cardiovascular disease, renal diseases, lithium intoxications, and prescriptions of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-inhibitors.

### A case of karyomegalic interstitial nephritis without FAN1 mutations in the setting of brentuximab, ifosfamide, and carboplatin exposure [^113mFBqM]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

A 49-year-old female was diagnosed with anaplastic high-grade Hodgkin's lymphoma of the stomach in 2018, which had metastasized to the liver, large intestine, adrenal gland, peritoneum, and periaortic and splenic hilar lymph nodes. She initially underwent treatment with 4 cycles of ABVD chemotherapy (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), which was complicated by neutropenic fevers. Subsequently, her treatment was switched to ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) therapy due to residual gastric and intra-abdominal nodal disease. After 3 cycles of ICE, she was hospitalized for myelosuppression with pancytopenia, nausea and vomiting, and acute kidney injury, with a serum creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL. She was hydrated, and the serum creatinine improved to 1.09 mg/dL. She then received 2 doses of brentuximab 3 weeks apart, at which point her creatinine levels steadily increased, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dropped below 30 ml/min/1.72 m², prompting the discontinuation of brentuximab.

Two months after the last dose of brentuximab, she was seen in the nephrology clinic. She had no significant family history of kidney disease and denied smoking, alcohol use, or exposure to ochratoxin A, heavy metals, lithium, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A toxicological work-up was negative. Serological tests for ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, HIV, HBV, and HCV were also negative. Serum complement C3 and C4 were within normal range.

At the time of the initial consultation, her serum creatinine was 2.75 mg/dL, BUN was 15 mg/dL, and eGFR was 19 ml/min/1.72 m². Other laboratory tests revealed sodium levels at 132 mmol/L.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116nxhEz]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic nephropathy, particularly in relation to RAAS inhibitors such as ACEis/ARBs, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend continuing renin-angiotensin system blockade for mild-to-moderate increases in serum creatinine (≥ 30%) in patients with no signs of extracellular fluid volume depletion.
