## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line treatment for hypertension, including which drug classes to choose, when to use monotherapy versus combination therapy, how to individualize by stage and comorbidity, and how to monitor and escalate therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment goals and BP targets. Then, I should verify which drug classes are truly first-line and why. Next, I will examine the evidence for monotherapy versus initial combination therapy by stage and risk. After that, I need to individualize choices by age, race/ethnicity, diabetes, CKD, CAD, and heart failure. I will then review special populations and contraindications, outline a practical initiation and titration algorithm, and finally confirm monitoring, adherence, and resistant hypertension strategies with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the treatment goals and thresholds, because everything else hinges on these. The primary objective is to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by achieving evidence-based BP targets, with most contemporary guidelines recommending an initial target of less than 140/90 mmHg in all treated patients and, if tolerated, a more intensive target of less than 130/80 mmHg for most adults, including those with diabetes or high cardiovascular risk, while allowing individualized relaxation in older or frail adults [^112j6vuh] [^113Xz66w] [^112W9t9b].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line drug classes before I jump ahead. Across major guidelines, four classes are consistently recommended as first-line: thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs, with strong RCT and meta-analytic support showing reductions in cardiovascular events compared with placebo and broadly similar effects on mortality across classes, albeit with small outcome differences in head-to-head comparisons [^113wcFJf] [^1143TDMX] [^113u9ZD3] [^112WMsfz].

> Hold on, I should verify where beta-blockers fit, because this is easy to misstate. Beta-blockers are not preferred first-line for uncomplicated hypertension due to inferior stroke prevention and tolerability concerns, but they remain essential for compelling indications such as HFrEF, post-MI, angina, and arrhythmia control, and should be used when those indications are present [^113wcFJf] [^117E9Ho2] [^1112Eq5E].

> Next, I should review the comparative effectiveness among first-line classes to guide selection when no compelling indication exists. Low-dose thiazides have the most consistent and robust evidence for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality versus placebo and perform at least as well as, and in some analyses better than, other classes for several outcomes, while ACE inhibitors and CCBs are reasonable alternatives with broadly similar mortality effects but differing morbidity trade-offs, such as CCBs reducing stroke more but increasing heart failure compared with RAS blockers [^112WMsfz] [^114VRfqY] [^115x2qQ6] [^117HF4AY].

> I need to check the strength of evidence for initial combination therapy versus monotherapy, because this drives modern initiation strategies. For adults with stage 2 hypertension, defined as SBP at least 140 mmHg or DBP at least 90 mmHg, guidelines recommend initiating two first-line agents of different classes, ideally as a single-pill combination, to improve speed and likelihood of BP control and adherence, whereas for stage 1 hypertension, starting with a single first-line agent and titrating or adding sequentially is reasonable [^113mCBSz] [^111kNc8j] [^111rJjTU] [^116nKqcH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that combination therapy is universally superior for all patients; I should correct that. The evidence base for hard outcomes comparing initial combination versus monotherapy is limited and of very low certainty, so the strong preference for initial combination in stage 2 hypertension is largely driven by faster BP control, better adherence with SPCs, and mechanistic synergy, with large pragmatic trials still needed for definitive outcome differences [^115Q3UvG] [^113i4TjW] [^112eUZf7].

> Let me consider age and race/ethnicity next, because these factors meaningfully influence first-line selection. In adults younger than 55–60 years, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often favored mechanistically, whereas in adults aged 55 years or older or in Black patients, thiazide-like diuretics or CCBs achieve greater BP lowering and may be preferred initially; observational data also suggest CCBs can yield larger early BP reductions than ACEi/ARBs in younger non-Black patients, though absolute differences are modest and confidence intervals overlap [^111zxsTh] [^115hsw1Z] [^116Wpf2M] [^115hCmFc].

> I should confirm diabetes-specific guidance, since it alters both thresholds and class selection. In type 2 diabetes, treatment is recommended at SBP 130 mmHg or higher with a goal of less than 130 mmHg if tolerated, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred when CKD is present or albuminuria is significant to slow kidney disease progression, while all first-line classes remain acceptable for BP lowering when no CKD is present [^112W9t9b] [^116y1erM].

> For chronic kidney disease, I need to ensure I am precise. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line when CKD is present, particularly with albuminuria, and dual RAS blockade with ACEi plus ARB is contraindicated due to harm, including hyperkalemia and kidney function decline, so I should avoid that combination outright [^112J4jTd].

> Let me think about coronary artery disease and heart failure, because compelling indications change the calculus. In stable CAD or for anti-ischemic therapy, beta-blockers are appropriate, and in HFrEF, both beta-blockers and RAS blockade are foundational; in isolated systolic hypertension in older adults, thiazide-like diuretics or CCBs are preferred, and beta-blockers should generally be avoided as first-line in this phenotype [^117E9Ho2] [^112mJUdy].

> I should double-check pregnancy and other special situations. In pregnancy, methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are preferred antihypertensives, and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors are contraindicated; in frail older adults or those with symptomatic orthostasis, gentler monotherapy and conservative targets are prudent; in resistant hypertension, I will address that separately below [^116nKqcH].

> Next, I should review a practical initiation algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. For stage 2 hypertension, start with two first-line agents from different classes, preferably as a single-pill combination of a RAS blocker with either a CCB or a thiazide-like diuretic, while avoiding harmful combinations such as ACEi plus ARB; for stage 1 hypertension, start with a single first-line agent and titrate or add a second agent if BP remains uncontrolled after about 4 weeks, reassessing adherence and measurement technique before escalating [^111kNc8j] [^111rJjTU] [^113wcFJf] [^116iPpfD].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of thiazide-like agents versus hydrochlorothiazide, because potency and outcomes differ. Chlorthalidone and indapamide are preferred thiazide-like options due to longer half-lives and stronger outcome data, and they are often favored when thiazides are chosen, particularly in combination regimens and in resistant hypertension pathways [^notfound].

> I will now examine monitoring and titration cadence, since timely adjustments improve control. Reassess BP within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose change, intensify therapy if not at goal, and consider 24-hour ambulatory or home monitoring to confirm control and detect white-coat or masked effects; if using SPCs, adherence is generally better, which supports their use when combination therapy is indicated [^116iPpfD] [^115DxLHQ] [^115XyoWN].

> But wait, what if BP remains above goal despite two agents at appropriate doses. I should confirm the definition and management of resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension is typically defined as uncontrolled BP despite adherence to three first-line agents, including a RAS blocker, a CCB, and a thiazide-like diuretic, or controlled BP requiring four or more agents; in such cases, add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone if eGFR is at least 45 mL/min/1.73 m², and systematically evaluate for secondary causes and medication contributors [^117BqjS3] [^1158pLpV].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. First-line therapy for hypertension should be anchored in one of four classes — thiazide-like diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs — with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications; initiate combination therapy in stage 2 hypertension to achieve faster control and enhance adherence, and use monotherapy with planned escalation in stage 1 hypertension; individualize by age, race/ethnicity, diabetes, CKD, CAD, and frailty; and escalate promptly, verify adherence, and add spironolactone for resistant hypertension as indicated [^113wcFJf] [^113u9ZD3] [^111rJjTU] [^111kNc8j].

---

First-line therapy for hypertension is **thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or calcium channel blockers** [^113u9ZD3] [^116GyidC], with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications (heart failure, CAD, arrhythmias) [^113wcFJf] [^117E9Ho2]. Low-dose thiazides have the **strongest evidence** for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality [^112WMsfz] [^114VRfqY] and are preferred in older adults and Black patients [^115vXdik]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred for diabetes, CKD, or heart failure [^notfound]; CCBs are suitable for older adults, isolated systolic hypertension, or when thiazides are not tolerated [^115vXdik]. Combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension or when BP is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above target [^113mCBSz] [^112FXV7A], ideally as a single-pill combination to improve adherence [^115XyoWN] [^11475XTt]. Beta-blockers are not first-line unless there is a compelling indication due to inferior stroke prevention and higher discontinuation rates [^113wcFJf] [^115FQHjS].

---

## First-line antihypertensive drug classes

Current guidelines recommend **four classes** as first-line therapy:

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics | - Chlorthalidone <br/> - Indapamide <br/> - Hydrochlorothiazide | - Strong evidence for CV risk reduction [^112WMsfz] <br/> - Preferred in older adults and Black patients [^115vXdik] [^115jzTRA] |
| Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril <br/> - Ramipril | - Preferred in diabetes, CKD, heart failure [^112W9t9b] [^116y1erM] |
| Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan <br/> - Irbesartan | - Preferred in diabetes, CKD, heart failure [^112W9t9b] [^116y1erM] |
| Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) | - Amlodipine <br/> - Felodipine <br/> - Diltiazem <br/> - Verapamil | - Suitable for older adults, isolated systolic hypertension, or when thiazides are not tolerated [^115vXdik] |

---

Beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol, atenolol) are **not first-line** unless there is a compelling indication (e.g. heart failure, CAD, arrhythmias) due to inferior stroke prevention and higher discontinuation rates [^113wcFJf] [^114VRfqY].

---

## Evidence supporting first-line therapy

Thiazide diuretics have the **strongest evidence** for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality, particularly in older adults and Black patients [^112WMsfz] [^114VRfqY]. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are preferred for patients with diabetes, CKD, or heart failure due to their renal and cardiovascular benefits [^112W9t9b] [^116y1erM]. Calcium channel blockers are effective, especially in older adults and those with isolated systolic hypertension [^117HF4AY].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy is recommended for patients with stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) or when BP is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above target [^113mCBSz]. Preferred combinations include an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic [^111rJjTU]. Single-pill combinations are recommended to **improve adherence** and simplify treatment regimens [^115XyoWN] [^11475XTt].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Older adults**: Thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred due to their efficacy and safety profile [^115vXdik].
- **Black patients**: Thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred due to greater BP-lowering efficacy [^115jzTRA] [^115hCmFc].
- **Diabetes or CKD**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred due to renal and cardiovascular benefits [^112W9t9b] [^116y1erM].
- **Pregnancy**: Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are preferred due to safety considerations.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regular monitoring of BP and adjustment of therapy are essential to achieve target BP levels [^116iPpfD]. If BP remains uncontrolled, **add a second agent** from a different class or use a single-pill combination [^111kNc8j]. For resistant hypertension (uncontrolled BP despite three agents), add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (e.g. spironolactone) [^11758EvT].

---

First-line therapy for hypertension includes thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers, with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications. Combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension or when BP is significantly above target, and treatment should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^115XyoWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

### First-line diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs for hypertension [^114VRfqY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness with respect to reducing mortality and morbidity outcomes, and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes would demonstrate whether there are important differences.

Objectives

To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

Search Methods

Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers to March 2021. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, or other antihypertensive drug classes. Studies had to include clearly defined mortality and morbidity outcomes (serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure, and withdrawals due to adverse effects).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 26 comparator arms randomizing over 90,000 participants. The findings are relevant to first-line use of drug classes in older male and female hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 75) with multiple co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. First-line thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were compared with beta-blockers (six trials), calcium channel blockers (eight trials), ACE inhibitors (five trials), and alpha-adrenergic blockers (three trials); other comparators included angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor), and clonidine (a centrally acting drug). Only three studies reported data for total serious adverse events: two studies compared diuretics with calcium channel blockers and one with a direct renin inhibitor. Compared to first-line beta-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10; 5 trials, 18,241 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (5.4% versus 4.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.6%, moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), CHD (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), or heart failure (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.19; 1 trial, 6569 participants; low-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (10.1% versus 7.9%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85; 5 trials, 18,501 participants; ARR 2.2%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line calcium channel blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 7 trials, 35,417 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24; 2 trials, 7204 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (14.3% versus 13.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty) or CHD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (4.4% versus 3.2%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.82; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.2%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (7.6% versus 6.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88; 7 trials, 33,908 participants; ARR 1.4%; low-certainty). Compared to first-line ACE inhibitors, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 3 trials, 30,961 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.02; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce stroke slightly (4.7% versus 4.1%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; ARR 0.6%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; moderate-certainty) or heart failure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 2 trials, 30,392 participants; moderate-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (3.9% versus 2.9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84; 3 trials, 25,254 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line alpha-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (12.1% versus 9.0%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 3.1%; moderate-certainty) and stroke (2.7% versus 2.3%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 0.4%; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (5.4% versus 2.8%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.58; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; ARR 2.6%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (1.3% versus 0.9%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; 3 trials, 24,772 participants; ARR 0.4%; low-certainty). For the other drug classes, data were insufficient. No antihypertensive drug class demonstrated any clinically important advantages over first-line thiazides.

Authors' Conclusions

When used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, thiazides and thiazide-like drugs likely do not change total mortality and likely decrease some morbidity outcomes such as cardiovascular events and withdrawals due to adverse effects, when compared to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha-blockers.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients on the basis of postulated advantages for the reduction of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence). Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.

### Should a diuretic always be the first choice in patients with essential hypertension? The case for no [^116VJVx3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

A more extensive use of diuretics as first-line drug for the treatment of hypertensive patients has been recommended on the basis of the results of the recent Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, yet diuretics have numerous drawbacks that may limit their undisputed ability to lower BP. These include the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with the attending negative cardiovascular effects that ensue from this activation and several metabolic alterations, namely those in glucose, lipid, and potassium metabolism. Numerous mechanistic as well as interventional trials indicate that these limitations of diuretics can adversely affect the clinical outcome of patients and their compliance to treatment and consequently the cost of therapy. In addition, there are a number of clinical conditions in which the diuretics are admittedly contraindicated as first-line drugs. Thus, the emphasis should be on obtaining optimal BP control rather on the drug used to achieve it.

### Calcium channel blockers versus other classes of drugs for hypertension [^117HF4AY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2010. While calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are often recommended as a first-line drug to treat hypertension, the effect of CCBs on the prevention of cardiovascular events, as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes, is still debated.

Objectives

To determine whether CCBs used as first-line therapy for hypertension are different from other classes of antihypertensive drugs in reducing the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events.

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 1 September 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted the authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work and checked the references of published studies to identify additional trials. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing first-line CCBs with other antihypertensive classes, with at least 100 randomised hypertensive participants and a follow-up of at least two years.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias, and entered the data for analysis. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

This update contains five new trials. We included a total of 23 RCTs (18 dihydropyridines, 4 non-dihydropyridines, 1 not specified) with 153,849 participants with hypertension. All-cause mortality was not different between first-line CCBs and any other antihypertensive classes. As compared to diuretics, CCBs probably increased major cardiovascular events (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.09, P = 0.03) and increased congestive heart failure events (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.51, moderate-certainty evidence). As compared to beta-blockers, CCBs reduced the following outcomes: major cardiovascular events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.92), stroke (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88, moderate-certainty evidence), and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99, low-certainty evidence). As compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, CCBs reduced stroke (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99, low-certainty evidence) and increased congestive heart failure (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.28, low-certainty evidence). As compared to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), CCBs reduced myocardial infarction (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94, moderate-certainty evidence) and increased congestive heart failure (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.36, low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

For the treatment of hypertension, there is moderate certainty evidence that diuretics reduce major cardiovascular events and congestive heart failure more than CCBs. There is low to moderate certainty evidence that CCBs probably reduce major cardiovascular events more than beta-blockers. There is low to moderate certainty evidence that CCBs reduced stroke when compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and reduced myocardial infarction when compared to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but increased congestive heart failure when compared to ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust, and further trials might change the conclusions. More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of individuals taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different comorbidities such as diabetes.

### First-line β-blocker use for hypertension in the veterans health administration [^114HskhJ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Guideline recommendations regarding β-blocker use for first-line treatment of high blood pressure (BP) have changed significantly over the past 3 decades. In the 1980s and 1990s, several placebo-controlled trials demonstrated their efficacy to prevent adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, leading to first-line endorsement alongside thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (hereafter, thiazides) in the Sixth and Seventh Reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC6 and JNC7, respectively). This changed in 2014 with the Eighth JNC Report (JNC8) recommending β-blockers as first-line only for patients with "compelling indications" supported by strong evidence of benefit. In the absence of such compelling indications, β-blockers were relegated to second-line therapy after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARB), thiazides, and calcium channel blockers (CCB). This shift was based on trials and meta-analyses suggesting inferior stroke and mortality as well as higher discontinuation rates from adverse effects. Similar recommendations appeared in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) BP guidelines and were reinforced in the 2024 AHA/American Stroke Association Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke. In contrast, the 2018 and 2023 updates of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines supported first-line β-blocker use for uncomplicated hypertension, citing their efficacy compared with placebo in lowering BP and preventing CVD.

The quality of hypertension care for US veterans has been a major focus of the Veterans Health Administration (VA), the largest integrated health care system in the US. The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in 2004, 2014, and 2020 conformed with the recommendations outlined in the JNC7, JNC8, and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. However, in our recent analyses, we identified that β-blockers are prescribed as first-line hypertension treatment in approximately 20% of veterans who do not have a compelling indication, although this trend decreased over the 20-year study. To improve evidence-based prescribing of β-blockers for treatment of high BP, we sought to investigate the clinical factors associated with β-blocker use in a cohort of veterans initiating treatment for high BP over 23 years.

### Fixed-drug combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension [^113HmGzx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

As combinations of drugs from different classes that have synergistic or additive effect and properties to cancel out each others' untoward hemodynamic and metabolic effects become more and more widely used, their use as first-line therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients is growing in popularity as well. The possibility to begin therapy with a fixed 2-drug combination may be preferable to starting with monotherapy followed by upward titration and addition of other agents. More and more combinations are coming out on the market and proving their effectiveness in randomized controlled trials and in large multicenter studies. One suggestion is the "polypill", a fixed combination of multiple agents that address various components of the metabolic syndrome and coexisting common risk factors in both high-risk patients with conditions requiring polypharmacy, and in healthy asymptomatic individuals.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### Standardized treatment protocols for hypertension: global availability, characteristics, and alignment with the hypertension guideline recommendations [^112YM6UM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension control is suboptimal globally. Implementing evidence-based, simple, standardized treatment protocols (STPs) has been instrumental in effectively and efficiently improving treatment and control of hypertension. We aimed to identify, characterize, and critically appraise hypertension STPs.

Methods

We defined STP as a series of steps for the pharmacological treatment of primary hypertension, with information on target population, BP threshold for treatment initiation, target BP, specific drugs/classes/doses, and follow-up frequency. STPs for adult patients were identified from the websites of relevant health organizations, Google search, and through expert consultations (until July 2023). STPs for secondary, gestational, or malignant hypertension or those that were templates/samples were excluded. Included STPs were critically appraised using HEARTS in the Americas Checklist for hypertension management in primary care and compared with the 2021 WHO hypertension management guideline recommendations.

Results

Fifty STPs were identified. All STPs had a stepwise treatment approach, involved guideline-recommended first-line drugs, and 98% consisted of at least four steps. Majority (54%) recommended monotherapy with calcium channel blockers as first-line treatment. Only 44% STPs recommended treatment initiation with combination therapy, and 16% recommended single-pill combinations. Most (62%) had dose-intensification as the second step. Most (74%) STPs did not provide complete dosing information. Only one STP mentioned a target time for achieving BP control. On average, STPs scored a performance of 68% on the HEARTS Checklist.

Conclusion

Several STPs are available globally; however, most of them have enormous scope for improvement through interventions aimed at alignment with the latest evidence-based guidelines and multistakeholder engagement.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^115vXdik]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are indispensable drugs in the treatment of hypertension, their role as first-line or even second-line drugs is a provoking debate.

The European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guidelines recommend that thiazide diuretics should be considered as suitable as β-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment.

Another European position, endorsed by the British Hypertension Society, is that diuretics and calcium channel blockers should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients aged ≥ 55 years or black patients of any age, whereas ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers in the case of intolerance to ACE inhibitors) should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients younger than 55 years of age.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC VII) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that thiazide diuretics should be preferred drugs in "most" hypertensive patients, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes.

The present review does not intend to negate the important role of diuretics in certain groups of patients (blacks, salt-sensitive patients, concomitant heart failure) or to underestimate their role in multiple-drug combinations in patients with resistant hypertension. The main argument that will be discussed is the place of diuretics as first-line drugs or add-on drugs in the context of the available antihypertensive armamentarium.

The pro side of the controversy will argue that diuretics should remain the preferred drugs for initial treatment in many hypertensive patients, whereas the cons side will contend that emerging evidence from outcome-based studies is casting doubt on the role of these drugs as first-line and even second-line antihypertensive treatment.

EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the XX century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies. The first guideline document prepared by European Societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH together with the European Society of Cardiology jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013 and 2018, the latter being as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in the worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering to the readers elements of novelties. These include, for example, the thresholds and targets of the blood pressure-lowering intervention, the relevance of out-of-office blood pressure measurements, the modern quantification of cardiovascular risk, the greater use of organ damage measures, the upgrading of beta-blocking drugs to the level of major antihypertensive agents and the wider choice of drug combination between major drugs, with confirmation of their strategic role as first-line and subsequent treatment in the majority of patients. Finally, emphasis has been given to the treatment strategies based on renal denervation, particularly but not exclusively in drug-resistant hypertension, and to the patient's follow-up modalities, including the careful assessment of nonadherence as a fundamental barrier to the long-term blood pressure control.

Finally, given the importance of primary care providers in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the hypertensive state, ESH has decided to provide a novel concise format of the guidelines, the so called '2024 Clinical Practice Guidelines', for implementation into current clinical practice. The four pillars of these practice guidelines include the accurate diagnostic approach, the assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile, the careful selection of the treatment strategy and the long-term evaluation of the blood pressure response.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, subsequent therapy, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to add additional antihypertensive drugs if target BP levels are not achieved with standard-dose monotherapy.
Choose add-on drugs from first-line choices, such as thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics or CCBs with either ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers.
Be cautious when combining a nondihydropyridine CCB and a β-blocker.
Do not combine an ACEi and an ARB.

### Comparative analysis of first-line antihypertensive treatment classes [^1122MqMj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The best first-line monotherapy for hypertension remains uncertain, as current guidelines suggest that thiazides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are appropriate in the absence of specific comorbidities. We aimed to compare the outcomes of first-line antihypertensive classes in a real-life setting with a long follow-up period.

Methods

This nationwide retrospective new-user cohort study included patients insured by the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. We included patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension between 2008 and 2021 who initiated treatment with a single first-line drug for hypertension. Outcomes were assessed with and without propensity score matching for confounding factors. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, or heart failure (HF).

Results

A total of 97,639 patients initiated antihypertensive treatment with a single drug as first-line therapy. The most commonly prescribed class was ACEis/ARBs (66,717, 68.3%), followed by CCBs (15,922, 16.3%), beta-blockers (BBs, 12,869, 13.2%), and thiazides (2,131, 2.2%). For the primary outcome, the hazard ratios (HRs) for BBs, CCBs, and ACEis/ARBs were 1.44 (95% CI 1.25–1.66), 1.10 (95% CI 0.96–1.27), and 1.13 (95% CI 0.99–1.29), respectively, when compared to thiazides.

Conclusion

When initiating pharmacotherapy for hypertension with a single drug, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers were associated with similar risk of MI, ACS, stroke, or HF when compared to thiazides, while beta-blockers were associated with increased risk.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^115xcWg5]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the largest single contributor to the global burden of disease, affecting an estimated 1.39 billion people worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can aid in the effective management of this common condition, however, inconsistencies exist between CPGs, and the extent of this is unknown. Understanding the differences in CPG recommendations across income settings may provide an important means of understanding some of the global variations in clinical outcomes related to hypertension.

Aims

This study aims to analyse the variation between hypertension CPGs globally. It aims to assess the variation in three areas: diagnostic threshold and staging, treatment and target blood pressure (BP) recommendations in hypertension.

Methods

A search was conducted on the MEDLINE repository to identify national and international hypertension CPGs from 2010 to May 2020. An additional country-specific grey-literature search was conducted for all countries and territories of the world as identified by the World Bank. Data describing the diagnosis, staging, treatment and target blood pressure were extracted from CPGs, and variations between CPGs for these domains were analysed.

Results

Forty-eight CPGs from across all World Bank income settings were selected for analysis. Ninety-six per cent of guidelines defined hypertension as a clinic-based BP of ≥ 140/90mmHg, and 87% of guidelines recommended a target BP of < 140/90mmHg. In the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, eight different first-step, 17 different second-step and six different third-step drug recommendations were observed. Low-income countries preferentially recommended diuretics (63%) in the first-step treatment, whilst high-income countries offered more choice between antihypertensive classes. Forty-four per cent of guidelines, of which 71% were from higher-income contexts recommended initiating treatment with dual-drug therapy at BP 160/100mmHg or higher.

Conclusion

This study found that CPGs remained largely consistent in the definition, staging and target BP recommendations for hypertension. Extensive variation was observed in treatment recommendations, particularly for second-line therapy. Variation existed between income settings; low-income countries prescribed cheaper drugs, offered less clinician choice in medications and initiated dual therapy at later stages than higher-income countries. Future research exploring the underlying drivers of this variation may improve outcomes for hypertensive patients across clinical contexts.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy are recommended first-line options from thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence "supports 4 classes of first-line agents", and a meta-analysis reported "50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals", while "all other antihypertensive agents are considered secondary" and "BBs were less effective than first-line antihypertensive classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications".

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pharmacotherapy in advanced disease — Non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing, or responders who remain in (or progress to) WHO-FC III should be considered candidates for treatment with either an ERA or a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or a prostanoid. As head-to-head comparisons among different compounds are not available, no evidence-based first-line treatment can be proposed, and some experts still use first-line i.v. epoprostenol in WHO-FC III patients because of its survival benefits. For WHO-FC IV, continuous i.v. epoprostenol is recommended as first-line therapy; although ambrisentan, bosentan, and sildenafil are approved in WHO-FC IV patients in the United States, most experts consider these treatments as a second line in severely ill patients. In WHO-FC IV patients, initial combination therapy should also be considered. In the case of inadequate clinical response, sequential combination therapy should be considered; combinations can include either an ERA plus a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or a prostanoid plus an ERA, or a prostanoid plus a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, and in expert centres triple combination therapy is considered. For inadequate responders despite optimal therapy or where treatments are unavailable, BAS and/or lung transplantation are indicated and should be performed only in experienced centres.

### Arterial hypertension [^115DxLHQ]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Arterial hypertension is the most important contributor to the global burden of disease; however, disease control remains poor. Although the diagnosis of hypertension is still based on office blood pressure, confirmation with out-of-office blood pressure measurements (ie, ambulatory or home monitoring) is strongly recommended. The definition of hypertension differs throughout various guidelines, but the indications for antihypertensive therapy are relatively similar. Lifestyle adaptation is absolutely key in non-pharmacological treatment. Pharmacologically, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics are the first-line agents, with advice for the use of single-pill combination therapy by most guidelines. As a fourth-line agent, spironolactone should be considered. The rapidly evolving field of device-based therapy, especially renal denervation, will further broaden therapeutic options. Despite being a largely controllable condition, the actual rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension are disappointingly low. Further improvements throughout the process of patient screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up need to be urgently addressed.

### Health outcomes associated with various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents: a network meta-analysis [^112WMsfz]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Establishing relative benefit or harm from specific antihypertensive agents is limited by the complex array of studies that compare treatments. Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to better define risk or benefit.

Objective

To summarize the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms of major cardiovascular disease end points and all-cause mortality.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We used previous meta-analyses, MEDLINE searches, and journal reviews from January 1995 through December 2002. We identified long-term randomized controlled trials that assessed major cardiovascular disease end points as an outcome. Eligible studies included both those with placebo-treated or untreated controls and those with actively treated controls.

Data Extraction

Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from the other trials. The indirect comparisons, which preserve the within-trial randomized findings, were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common.

Data Synthesis

Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192 478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo: coronary heart disease (CHD; RR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.92); congestive heart failure (CHF; RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42–0.62); stroke (RR, 0.71; 0.63–0.81); cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69–0.83); cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers-was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with CCBs, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00) and CHF (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.81). Compared with ACE inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96), cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00), and stroke (RR, 0.86; 0.77–0.97). Compared with beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80–0.98). Compared with alpha-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43–0.60) and cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments.

Conclusions

Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice and treatment guidelines should reflect this evidence, and future trials should use low-dose diuretics as the standard for clinically useful comparisons.

### What is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension? [^113a1pp9]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the European Society of Cardiology released a new guideline for the management of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. The guideline introduced a new BP categorization: (1) nonelevated (office BP < 120/70 mmHg) for which drug treatment is not recommended, (2) elevated (120–139/70–89 mmHg) for which drug treatment is recommended based on cardiovascular disease risk and follow-up BP level, and (3) hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) for which prompt confirmation and drug treatment are recommended in most individuals. The initial default systolic BP treatment target is 120 to 129 mmHg; however, relaxed targets (BP as low as reasonably achievable) are recommended in case of treatment intolerance, adults ≥ 85 years, symptomatic orthostasis, moderate-to-severe frailty, or limited life expectancy. Here, we summarize what is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, relative to other major international hypertension guidelines in Europe and America. Our aim is to reconcile any uncertainty clinicians may have about implementing these various guidelines in patient care.

### Two-drug combinations as first-step antihypertensive treatment [^112eUZf7]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) control in patients with hypertension is variable worldwide, and in general, it results largely unsatisfactory. Factors responsible for this phenomenon include insufficient national cardiovascular healthcare policies for prevention, poor patient compliance with prescribed treatment schedules, and the reluctance of physicians to modify treatment strategies when BP is still elevated, that is, the so-called therapeutic inertia. A further important factor favoring poor BP control is the limited use of combination drug treatment, despite evidence of its superior ability to control BP in patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension. In addition, combination treatment allows to achieve BP control more easily (and more quickly) as compared with monotherapy. This article, after briefly examining the main features of BP control, will review the importance in the treatment of hypertension of the drug combination strategy, based on the recommendations of the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines. Empahsis will be given to the drug combination treatment as first step of the antihypertensive therapeutic intervention. The potential drawbacks and barriers to combination drug treatment as initial therapeutic strategy will also be briefly discussed.

### Cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines: a systematic review [^115jzTRA]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adultsrecommends several possible medicine classes for initial treatment of hypertension. TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes are recommended as the initial choice of antihypertensive medicines for non–African-American patients and for patients with diabetes. For African-American patients TDs and CCBs are recommended, and for patients with chronic kidney disease, ACEIs and ARBs are recommended. Prescribers may consider adding another medicine from TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes for the second step, and then β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, or others for the third step. Similarly, several medicine classes are recommended for first-line therapy in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for hypertension. The recommended initial treatment option is ACEIs or low-cost ARBs for patients aged < 55 years, CCBs for those aged ≥ 55 years or African American, and TD if CCBs are not suitable; β-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy. The second-line therapy is dual therapy of ACEs or ARBs with a CCB for most patients. The third-line therapy is the use of three medicines, including ACE or ARB with a CCB, and a TD, if required. Because several pharmacologic treatment options can be used for the first-line therapy, it is important to evaluate which medicines are more cost effective among those options.

The evidence from pharmacoeconomic evaluations can provide valuable information for decision makers in setting public health priorities. Many pharmacoeconomic studies of antihypertensive medicines conducted in recent years have found control of hypertension to be cost effective. Several systematic reviews of these studies also have been published, but their focus has been on a specific medicine, such as irbesartan, or medicine class, such as ACEIs or ARBs. Thus, no comprehensive review has been conducted for studies across all anti-hypertensive medicine classes. The objectives are to systematically review all pharmacoeconomic evaluations of antihypertensive medicines and summarize the cost effectiveness of these medicines.

Harmonized antihypertensive drugs

In 2022, Whelton et al.published the Harmonization of the Hypertension guidelines for multiple societies across the world. In this document, four major drug classes were recommended as first-line therapies. These include AT 1 receptor antagonists/blockers; angiotensin converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors; thiazide diuretics; and calcium channel antagonists. Of these four major classes, only the AT 1 receptor is a GPCR. We discuss the primary actions of some of these drugs and the potential "new" pharmacological action of these first-line drugs. This is followed by a discussion of second-line drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, many of which target GPCRs. We consulted the publications of leaders in the field in including the drug classes included below. We also consulted the FDA database (June 2023 accession dates;) for lists of drugs in each class that are approved for use in the treatment of hypertension. We do not consider drugs that have been combined in a medication.

For first-line therapy, we will not discuss ACE inhibitors or diuretics given that the targets of these drugs and proteins are outside the four recognized receptor subtypes. Nonetheless, Table 1 includes a fairly comprehensive list of first and second-line drugs, with both generic and Trade names.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — first-line drug classes and comparative evidence are as follows: For adults initiating therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports 4 classes of first-line agents compared with placebo, and a meta-analysis of 50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals revealed subtle differences between first-line agents. βBs were less effective than first-line classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications. The primary goal of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure (BP) to the target level, considering the underlying CVD risk and compelling indications. In a large pragmatic RCT comparing hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone did not lower the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116oZq7q]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In the above guidelines, the WHO provides the most current and relevant evidence-based global public health guidance on the initiation of treatment with pharmacological agents for hypertension in adults. The guidelines are expected to be valid for a period of 5 years. This period reflects the fact that new research findings are likely to become available in the meantime but also represents a feasible time frame, considering the costs, time and other resources that are needed to update such guidelines. If the evidence base or user needs change before the 5-year mark, consideration will be given to producing updates sooner. More large randomized controlled trials, powered for CVD and/or mortality outcomes, are needed to shed light on the research gaps mentioned in discussion above especially for subpopulations that have not been adequately represented in previous trials.

### Which patients benefit the most from the perindopril / amlodipine combination [^112D8yiD]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations have been strongly endorsed by European guidelines for first-line and second-line treatment of hypertension. Among recommended combinations, that of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker stands out because the mechanisms of action of these two therapeutic classes are complementary, leading to enhanced efficacy. In the large multicentre ASCOT-BPLA trial, treatment based on the combination of amlodipine and perindopril significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death, stroke, coronary events and procedures, new-onset diabetes, and new-onset renal impairment in a wide range of patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, when compared with atenolol/thiazide-based therapy. The perindopril/amlodipine single-pill combination was developed based on guideline recommendations for combination treatment, the indications of each component, and ASCOT-BPLA trial data. Several studies in real-life settings show that a wide range of hypertensive patients, including everyday hypertensives with common risk factors, would benefit from the perindopril/amlodipine combination.

Introduction

Sustained high blood pressure causes the development, progression, and recurrence of various cardiovascular diseases. High blood pressure also leads to a decrease in quality of life and an increase in the risk of death. Antihypertensive treatments are administered to reduce such risks. Lifestyle modification is advised as a primary treatment. However, when the target blood pressure cannot be achieved by these modifications, antihypertensive drug therapy is required.

The Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) has published Guidelines for management of hypertension. The recommendation of first-choice antihypertensive drugs in these guidelines has changed over time. Diuretics were often used as a concomitant medicine in the JSH guidelines in 2004 but were suggested as a first-choice drug together with other antihypertensive drug classes in the 2009 JSH guidelines. β-blockers were recommended as one of the classes for first-line treatment in the 2009 JSH guidelines but were excluded from the first-line treatments in the 2014 JSH guidelines.

### Perindopril 3.5 mg / amlodipine 2.5 mg versus renin-angiotensin system inhibitor monotherapy as first-line treatment in hypertension: a combined analysis [^116pNrD6]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients are diagnosed with hypertension each year, making rapid and effective control of blood pressure (BP) crucial. Appropriate first-line treatment is important, and special attention should be paid to the positive effects of lowering BP early. Perindopril 3.5 mg/amlodipine 2.5mg (P3.5/A2.5) is a single-pill combination suitable for first-line use. The doses of each component of the single-pill combination were selected for a first-line setting.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of the P3.5/A2.5 combination at lowering BP compared with renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-inhibitor monotherapies, after 1 month of treatment.

Methods

Individual patient data from three randomized controlled trials were used to evaluate the efficacy of P3.5/A2.5 versus RAS-inhibitor monotherapies after 1 month in 5496 patients with hypertension, in a combined analysis.

Results

P3.5/A2.5 was well tolerated and significantly more effective at reducing BP after 1 month than RAS-inhibitor monotherapies (perindopril 5mg, irbesartan 150mg or valsartan 80mg). P3.5/A2.5 was associated with a significantly lower SBP (P = 0.002) and DBP (P = 0.005) after 1 month of treatment compared with RAS-inhibitor monotherapies.

Conclusion

In a large patient population, early administration of P3.5/A2.5 resulted in a significantly greater BP-lowering effect than perindopril, irbesartan or valsartan monotherapies after 1 month. Reducing BP levels within a month of treatment may reasonably be expected to lead to a reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — stage-based recommendations are: In adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 first-line agents of different classes, ideally in a single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended (1 B-R). In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control (2a C-EO). In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm (3: Harm A). Pharmacologically, most patients require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control.

### Calcium channel blockers in treatment of hypertension [^114z1t4M]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are among the most often prescribed drugs for the treatment of hypertension, but there is still uncertainty regarding the risks and benefits of their use as first-line drugs in the treatment of hypertension. Compared with placebo, dihydropyridine CCBs (long-acting nifedipine and nitrendipine) reduce the risk for cardiovascular endpoints, and in a pooled analysis of available studies on treatment of hypertension, significantly decrease the risk for strokes and cardiovascular and total mortality. This also holds true for patients with diabetes who have a clearly reduced risk when treated with CCBs as compared with placebo. However, compared with other active treatments in mixed study populations, CCBs are associated with a small risk increase for myocardial infarction and heart failure, but for cardiovascular mortality, there is only a very small and nonsignificant trend to a risk increase, and total mortality is similar. Among patients with diabetes, compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in particular, available data suggest that CCB use is associated with a moderate increase in cardiac endpoints. Therefore, among patients with diabetes and those with heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferable as first-line drugs; among the large fraction of patients without these conditions, there is no convincing evidence that long-acting dihydropyridine or nondihydropyridine CCBs are inferior to other blood pressure-lowering drugs. In these patients, the choice of blood pressure-lowering medication can be based on the expected tolerability, costs, and personal preferences.

### Managing hypertension: a question of STRATHE [^113fz9JW]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Current international guidelines recommend the use of therapeutic strategies with proven efficacy in the management of hypertension to achieve a target blood pressure of < 140/90 mmHg. After lifestyle intervention, they endorse three different management strategies: (i) first-line use of a low-dose combination of two agents from different antihypertensive classes, with the option of doubling the dose of the combination; (ii) use of a sequential monotherapy strategy, initiating with one antihypertensive to be replaced by another one from a different class, if necessary; and (iii) a stepped care strategy, initiating with one antihypertensive, and increasing the dose or adding another agent from a different class, if necessary. The objective of the STRAtegies of Treatment in Hypertension: Evaluation (STRATHE) study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these three treatment strategies in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (n = 533). In all, 62% of the patients in the low-dose combination group were normalised (< 140/90 mmHg), compared with 49% of the sequential monotherapy group (P = 0.01) and 47% of the stepped-care group (P = 0.005). The percentage of patients achieving normalisation without experiencing drug-related adverse events was also significantly higher in the low-dose combination group (56%) than in the sequential monotherapy (42%, P = 0.001) and stepped-care groups (42%, P = 0.004), consistent with the observation that the reduced dosage of the antihypertensive agents in such preparations translates into improved acceptability. The results of STRATHE provide further support for an antihypertensive management strategy involving the low-dose combination of perindopril (2 mg) and indapamide (0.625 mg).

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

### Persistence and adherence to antihypertensive treatment in relation to initial prescription: diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs [^114tfP2G]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension is widely considered as a first-line treatment, given the efficacy and low cost of this class of drugs. This indication is not unanimous, because thiazides can cause metabolic alterations, and other side effects that reduce compliance and persistence on treatment.

Objectives

In a multicentre, open-label randomized study we compared adherence and persistence to therapy of chlortalidone versus other treatments, as a first-line antihypertensive therapy.

Methods

Ninety-two general practitioners (GPs) recruited 2409 hypertensive patients with indication to antihypertensive therapy, who were randomized in two arms to start treatment with chlortalidone (12.5–25mg daily) or any other single medications (excluding thiazides). The patients have been followed for at least 2 years.

Result

Patients receiving diuretic therapy as first-line antihypertensive treatment, modified antihypertensive treatment regimen more often than the others (79.1 versus 43.9%; χ(2) < 0.0001). Patients starting with diuretics received greater number of drugs, compared to patients starting with different antihypertensive therapy (1.55 versus 1.4 antihypertensive drugs; P < 0.0001), but achieved the same blood pressure (BP) control during the follow-up. No differences were observed in persistence and adherence to treatment between the two groups.

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate that the recommendation to start antihypertensive therapy with diuretics, when no compelling indications are present, is not supported by the evidence that this strategy produces more rapid and better control of BP.

Change in systolic blood pressure for CCB versus ACEI/ARB use by age

In people younger than 55, systolic blood pressure changed from 162.8 mm Hg to 140.7 mm Hg at 12 weeks in new users of CCB, compared with a change from 162.7 mm Hg to 142.2 mm Hg in new users of ACEI/ARB. In relative terms, for people younger than 55, CCB use was associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.69 mm Hg (99% confidence interval −2.52 to −0.86) more than ACEI/ARB use (table 2). In those aged 55 and older, systolic blood pressure changed from 163.8 mm Hg to 143.2 mm Hg at 12 weeks in new users of CCB, compared with a change from 164.6 mm Hg to 144.6 mm Hg in new users of ACEI/ARB (fig 2; table 2; relative difference −0.40 mm Hg (−0.98 to 0.18) in favour of CCB). Over one year's follow-up, no difference was observed for reductions in systolic blood pressure associated with CCB and ACEI/ARB use in either age group (table 2 and fig 2).

Office blood pressure treatment targets in hypertensive patients — It is recommended that the first objective of treatment should be to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all patients and that, if the treatment is well tolerated, treated BP values should be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most patients. In patients < 65 years receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be lowered to a BP range of 120–129 mmHg in most patients. In older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg, with close monitoring of adverse effects. These BP targets are recommended for patients at any level of CV risk and in patients with and without established CVD. A DBP target of < 80 mmHg should be considered for all hypertensive patients, independent of the level of risk and comorbidities.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^115eWtok]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mm Hg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

NICE and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend diagnosing hypertension at a higher level than the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). NICE treats to less stringent targets than both the ACC/AHA and the ESC, while using similar, although non-combination pill based, treatment regimens.

### Cardiovascular protection using β-blockers: a critical review of the evidence [^1112Eq5E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

For more than 3 decades, beta-blockers have been widely used in the treatment of hypertension and are still recommended as first-line agents by national and international guidelines. Recent meta-analyses indicate that, in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, compared with other antihypertensive agents, first-line therapy with beta-blockers was associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially in the elderly cohort with no benefit for the end points of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality. In this review, we critically analyze the evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers in patients with hypertension and evaluate evidence for its role in other indications. The review of the currently available literature shows that in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, there is a paucity of data or absence of evidence to support use of beta-blockers as monotherapy or as first-line agents. Given the increased risk of stroke, their "pseudo-antihypertensive" efficacy (failure to lower central aortic pressure), lack of effect on regression of target end organ effects like left ventricular hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction, and numerous adverse effects, the risk benefit ratio for beta-blockers is not acceptable for this indication. However, beta-blockers remain very efficacious agents for the treatment of heart failure, certain types of arrhythmia, hypertropic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and in patients with prior myocardial infarction.

### Prescription patterns for the use of antihypertensive drugs for primary prevention among patients with hypertension in the United Kingdom [^114cBUZi]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Several antihypertensive drugs are available for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, existing evidence on prescription patterns was primarily generated among patients at high CVD risk with short-term follow-up, and failed to capture impacts of time and patient characteristics. Our objective was therefore to describe longitudinal prescription patterns for antihypertensive drugs for the primary prevention of CVD among patients with arterial hypertension in the United Kingdom.

Methods

This population-based cohort study used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, included 660,545 patients with hypertension who initiated an antihypertensive drug between 1998 and 2018. Antihypertensive treatments were measured by drug class and described overall and in subgroups, focusing on first-line therapy (first antihypertensive drug(s) recorded after a diagnosis of hypertension) and second-line therapy (antihypertensive drug(s) prescribed as part of a treatment change following first-line therapy).

Results

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (29.0%), thiazide diuretics (22.1%), and calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) (21.0%) were the most prescribed first-line therapies. ACE inhibitors have been increasingly prescribed as first-line therapy since 2001. Men were more likely to be prescribed ACE inhibitors than women (43.5% vs. 32.1%; difference: 11.4%; 95% confidence interval, 11.0%-11.8%), and Black patients were more likely to be prescribed CCBs than White patients (63.6% vs. 37.0%; difference: 26.6%; 95% CI, 24.8%-28.4%).

Conclusions

Antihypertensive prescription patterns for the primary prevention of CVD among patients with hypertension are consistent with treatment guidelines that were in place during the study period, providing reassurance regarding the use of evidence-based prescribing.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes: hypertension treatment thresholds and agents — In adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at an SBP of ≥ 130 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 130 mm Hg, with encouragement to achieve an SBP < 120 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality; in adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at a DBP of ≥ 80 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 80 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality; in adults with T2D and hypertension, all first-line classes of antihypertensive agents (thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting CCB, ACEI, and ARB) are useful and effective for BP lowering; and in adults with diabetes and hypertension, ACEI or ARB are recommended in the presence of CKD as identified by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g and should be considered when mild albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g) is present to delay progression of diabetes-related kidney disease.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^115hCmFc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To study whether treatment recommendations based on age and ethnicity according to United Kingdom (UK) clinical guidelines for hypertension translate to blood pressure reductions in current routine clinical care.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

UK primary care, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017.

Participants

New users of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and thiazides.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in systolic blood pressure in new users of ACEI/ARB versus CCB, stratified by age (< v ≥ 55) and ethnicity (black v non-black), from baseline to 12, 26, and 52 week follow-up. Secondary analyses included comparisons of new users of CCB with those of thiazides. A negative outcome (herpes zoster) was used to detect residual confounding and a series of positive outcomes (expected drug effects) was used to determine whether the study design could identify expected associations.

Results

During one year of follow-up, 87440 new users of ACEI/ARB, 67274 new users of CCB, and 22040 new users of thiazides were included (median 4 (interquartile range 2–6) blood pressure measurements per user). For non-black people who did not have diabetes and who were younger than 55, CCB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.69 mm Hg (99% confidence interval -2.52 to -0.86) relative to ACEI/ARB use at 12 weeks, and a reduction of 0.40 mm Hg (-0.98 to 0.18) in those aged 55 and older. In subgroup analyses using six finer age categories of non-black people who did not have diabetes, CCB use versus ACEI/ARB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure only in people aged 75 and older. Among people who did not have diabetes, systolic blood pressure decreased more with CCB use than with ACEI/ARB use in black people (reduction difference 2.15 mm Hg (-6.17 to 1.87)); the corresponding reduction difference was 0.98 mm Hg (-1.49 to -0.47) in non-black people.

Conclusions

Similar reductions in blood pressure were found to be associated with new use of CCB as with new use of ACEI/ARB in non-black people who did not have diabetes, both in those who were aged younger than 55 and those aged 55 and older. For black people without diabetes, CCB new use was associated with numerically greater reductions in blood pressure than ACEI/ARB compared with non-black people without diabetes, but the confidence intervals were overlapping for the two groups. These results suggest that the current UK algorithmic approach to first line antihypertensive treatment might not lead to greater reductions in blood pressure. Specific indications could be considered in treatment recommendations.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^112FXV7A]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

The benefits of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy accrue rapidly in primary care and clinical trials. When better blood pressure (BP, mm Hg) control is achieved during the first 3 to 6 months of treatment, fewer cardiovascular events occur during this time interval. – Standard hypertension control metrics typically exclude patients during the first 6 months following diagnosis, after which time they are included. Thus, for both clinical outcomes and care quality metrics, controlling hypertension within the first 6 months after diagnosis is important.

Prompt initiation of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is a key to realizing the time-sensitive benefits of BP reduction. Antihypertensive monotherapy is the norm for treatment initiation in clinical practice, despite evidence that monotherapy is insufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Furthermore, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association high BP guideline recommends treatment initiation with 2 different antihypertensive medications when BP is ≥ 20/ ≥ 10 mm Hg above target. Previous research indicates that not only are most adults with hypertension initiated on antihypertensive monotherapy, but also that most of them remain on monotherapy at 3 years. Moreover, half of adults with uncontrolled hypertension were on monotherapy after 8 years.

Given the evidence, our study was designed to determine if initiating treatment with antihypertensive monotherapy (TI) during the first month after the diagnosis of hypertension that was uncontrolled led to more prompt and better BP control over time than when TI did not occur in the first month. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with the decision to initiate treatment during the first month following diagnosis of hypertension than later time points.

### Comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus β-blockers as second-line therapy for hypertension [^112k6mrn]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Trials comparing hypertension monotherapies have found either no difference or modest differences in blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular events. However, no trial has assessed the comparative effectiveness of 2nd-line therapy in patients whose BP was not controlled with a thiazide diuretic.

Methods and Results

This was an observational study conducted with a hypertension registry of adults enrolled in 3 large integrated health care delivery systems from 2002 to 2007. Patients newly started on thiazide monotherapy whose BP remained uncontrolled were observed after addition of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or β-blocker for subsequent BP control and cardiovascular events. Patients for whom either add-on drug was indicated or contraindicated were excluded. After adjustment for patient characteristics and study year, BP control during the subsequent 6 to 18 months was comparable for the 2 agents (70.5% ACE, 69.0% β-blockers; P = 0.09). Rates of incident myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.58) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.52) were also similar for the ACE inhibitor and β-blocker groups during an average of 2.3 years of follow-up. There were also no differences in heart failure or renal function.

Conclusions

ACE inhibitors and β-blockers are equally effective in lowering BP and preventing cardiovascular events for patients whose BP is not controlled with a thiazide diuretic alone and who have no compelling indication for a specific 2nd-line agent.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^113yYxy4]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data

We conducted a cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD-GOLD) linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. CPRD-GOLD is a nationally representative repository of prospectively collected, anonymised electronic health records from primary care in the UK, which has been extensively validated. It holds data on demographic information, health related behaviours, test results including blood pressure measurements, diagnoses, and prescriptions for more than 11 million people. The Hospital Episodes Statistics database records all hospital admissions for patients covered by the UK's health service who receive treatment from either English NHS trusts or independent providers. Almost 60% of general practices included in CPRD-GOLD are linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. We used linked data in this study to improve completeness of ethnicity recording.

Cohort entry

We identified new users of hypertension drugs (CCB, ACEI/ARB, and thiazides), defined as people who had a prescription for one of these drugs in the study period (1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017), with no previous use of these drugs in the preceding year. People entered the cohort (index date) on the date of the first prescription. People were eligible for inclusion from the latest of the following: study start date (1 January 2007), one year after general practice registration (to allow time for recording of covariates in the general practice record), the date when the general practices' data recording processes were considered of adequate standard to be included in CPRD-GOLD, or the person's 18th birthday. People remained in the cohort until the earliest of the following: end of the study period (31 December 2017), last data collection from the general practice, date of leaving the general practice, or death.

Exclusion

We sought to study the association between first line drug treatment for hypertension and blood pressure solely in those individuals treated for hypertension. Therefore, we excluded people who initiated any of the study drugs without recorded blood pressure measurements in the year before cohort entry, and those whose blood pressure was at target or lower (< 140/90 mm Hg, according to current NICE guidelines). We also excluded people who initiated more than one hypertension drug on the index date, as well as those with diabetes at baseline (because current NICE guidance recommends ACEI/ARB as first line hypertension treatment for all people with diabetes). Additionally, because ethnicity was a stratifying factor, we excluded people whose ethnicity was not determinable even after data linkage.

### First-line treatment for hypertension… [^114uHcvd]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 53-year-old, otherwise healthy woman presents with persistent hypertension despite lifestyle changes. She saw an advertisement on television about a new hypertension medication and asks about it for treatment. Clinical Question What class of medications is the best first-line treatment for hypertension. Cochrane Abstract Background: Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug is the best first-line option. This review answers that question. Objectives: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers. No RCTs were found for angiotensin receptor blockers or alpha blockers.

Authors' Conclusions: First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and beta blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides. Thiazide diuretics and ACE inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of CHD, whereas beta blockers and CCBs did not. Beta blockers and CCBs were also no different from placebo in reducing mortality risk. Thiazide diuretics and ACE inhibitors reduced total mortality risk significantly, but this risk reduction was smaller than that of cardiovascular events and stroke. The strongest body of evidence indicates that for most patients with hypertension, thiazide diuretics are the best proven first-line treatment in reducing morbidity and mortality.

They are particularly effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in all patients with hypertension, and in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Current evidence does not support the use of beta blockers, particularly atenolol, as first-line treatment for hypertension. Although there is increasing evidence that ACE inhibitors and possibly CCBs may be equivalent to thiazide diuretics in reducing morbidity and mortality, the relative expense of these medications makes thiazide diuretics a more favorable first-line choice in patients who do not have contraindications for their use.

### Are beta blockers effective first-line treatments for… [^115U4kjQ]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 55-year-old woman presents with new-onset hypertension. Clinical Question Should beta blockers be used as first-line treatments for lowering blood pressure. In addition, these systematic reviews did not assess the tolerability of beta blockers relative to other antihypertensive medications. Thus, we undertook this review to reassess the place of beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension compared with other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. Objectives: To quantify the effectiveness and safety of beta blockers on morbidity and mortality end points in adults with hypertension. Most of the evidence for these conclusions comes from trials in which atenolol was the beta blocker used. However, it is not known whether beta blockers have differential effects on younger and older patients or whether there are differences among the subtypes of beta blockers.

1 If patients do not meet blood pressure goals with lifestyle modifications, thiazide diuretics are recommended as first-line pharmacotherapies. Other antihypertensive medications are recommended if certain "compelling indications" are present: beta blockers for coronary heart disease with angina, beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for heart failure, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs for diabetes.

1. Two recent meta-analyses found that atenolol was less effective than other anti-hypertensives at reducing stroke 2 and overall cardiovascular outcomes, 3 calling into question the role of beta blockers in the primary treatment of hypertension. This Cochrane review found that the highest-quality evidence on the effect of beta blockers on patient-oriented outcomes such as morbidity and mortality is mainly from studies of atenolol in North American and Western European populations.
4.

Lifetime risk of coronary heart disease and stroke is directly related to higher blood pressure 5; therefore, the primary reason for treating hypertension is to reduce morbidity and mortality from these conditions. Generic beta blockers are inexpensive and may seem appealing as initial antihypertensive therapy; however, this Cochrane review supports the JNC 7 recommendation to begin medical treatment of high blood pressure with thiazide diuretics. ALLHAT demonstrated that thiazide diuretics are as effective as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors for reducing cardiovascular risk. 6.

### Thiazide diuretics remain first-line treatment for… [^115TQ9ko]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

The Study: ALLHAT was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial that examined whether fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease events were reduced in high-risk patients with hypertension using a thiazide diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a calcium channel blocker, or an alpha blocker. Findings from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis were also reevaluated. ANBP2 reported fewer CVD events with angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor therapy compared with diuretics, but the results were not directly comparable with ALLHAT because of ANBP2's open-label design, attrition, and inconsistent dosing protocols.

ASCOT found fewer CVD events with amlodipine with or without an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor compared with atenolol with or without the thiazide bendroflumethiazide. However, the thiazide dose used was up to one half the amount used in other relevant antihypertensive trials, and the study lacked appropriate randomization and was inconsistent in adding drug therapy. The ACCOMPLISH trial reported that a combination benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide agent was less effective in preventing CVD than benazepril/amlodipine; however, the maximum hydrochlorothiazide dose of 25 mg used in the ACCOMPLISH trial has elsewhere been reported to be less effective at reducing blood pressure than chlorthalidone, which was used in ALLHAT. The BPLTTC meta-analysis reported that CVD events were similarly reduced by thiazides and the other drug classes, but calcium channel blockers were less effective than the other agents in preventing heart failure.

Conclusion: Reanalysis of the initial 2002 ALLHAT data confirmed that neither alpha blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nor calcium channel blockers are more effective than thiazide diuretics as initial therapy to reduce cardiovascular or renal risk in high-risk patients with hypertension. Thiazides are superior to calcium channel blockers in preventing fatal and nonfatal heart failure.
