## Question

Biological therapy for cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about biological therapy for cancer, including definitions, mechanisms, major classes, clinical impact, limitations, and future directions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define biological therapy and distinguish it from conventional cytotoxics. Then, I should categorize the main modalities and their mechanisms. Next, I will review clinical outcomes and real-world impact, followed by limitations such as resistance, toxicity, and access. After that, I should examine combination strategies and biomarker-driven personalization. Finally, I will synthesize future directions and provide a concise clinical takeaway, ensuring I verify claims against guidelines and high-quality reviews throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Biological therapy, also called biotherapy or biological response modifier therapy, uses substances derived from living organisms to treat disease. In oncology, it includes immunotherapies that modulate the immune system and targeted therapies that attack specific cancer cell features, distinguishing them from nonselective cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation.

> I will now examine the major classes to anchor the discussion. Wait, let me verify the taxonomy before proceeding: immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4), monoclonal antibodies (including antibody–drug conjugates), adoptive cell therapies (CAR-T, TCR-T, TIL), cytokine therapies, cancer vaccines, and oncolytic viruses are the principal categories reflected across contemporary reviews and regulatory frameworks, with FDA noting accelerating approvals in cell and gene therapies and NCCN integrating biosimilar biologics into standard regimens [^115T7uuv] [^1142xF9h] [^1165pTVt].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to ensure clinical coherence. Immune checkpoint blockade removes inhibitory brakes on T cells, enabling durable antitumor responses in a subset. Monoclonal antibodies exert direct cytotoxicity, immune-mediated effects via Fc engagement, or deliver cytotoxic payloads. Adoptive cell therapies genetically engineer or expand tumor-reactive T cells. Cytokines modulate immune activation. Vaccines aim to prime tumor-specific T cells. And oncolytic viruses lyse tumor cells and stimulate immunity, all of which align with contemporary mechanistic overviews and translational frameworks [^112U6omP] [^111MErHJ] [^113aSqm1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform efficacy. I need to check clinical impact by indication. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have produced durable survival benefits across multiple solid tumors, including NSCLC, melanoma, and urothelial cancers, while targeted therapies like EGFR/ALK inhibitors have transformed outcomes in molecularly defined NSCLC. CAR-T has achieved high response and cure rates in B-cell malignancies, though benefits in solid tumors remain limited and under active investigation [^1157fVDA] [^117Dn6gi] [^113mESQo].

> I should double-check real-world utilization and equity, because efficacy in trials may not translate into equitable access. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that patients with lower socioeconomic status have significantly reduced access to predictive biomarker testing and to biological and precision therapies, with particularly pronounced disparities in lung cancer, which risks widening outcome gaps if unaddressed [^116JNxjU] [^111tWS18] [^114BzbGS].

> Now, I need to assess limitations and resistance mechanisms to avoid overstating benefits. Primary and acquired resistance to checkpoint blockade and targeted therapies are common and multifactorial, including tumor-intrinsic mutations, antigen loss, and immune suppression. Immune-related adverse events can be severe. Manufacturing and delivery constraints limit adoptive cell therapy scalability. And high costs strain systems and patients, reinforcing access disparities and complicating value assessments [^114vjhbg] [^113gtVM3] [^113mESQo] [^114BzbGS] [^112vTPtk].

> Let me consider combination strategies, but I should verify that the rationale is mechanistically grounded rather than empiric. Rational combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with targeted agents, chemotherapy, or other immunotherapies aim to enhance antigenicity, relieve immune suppression, and overcome resistance; however, many trials lack strong preclinical rationale or appropriate comparators, and regulatory guidance emphasizes careful design, biomarker integration, and external controls to demonstrate added benefit while managing toxicity and cost [^1153tWcj] [^111Wczs4] [^113NLkbS] [^115Ufvh5].

> I should confirm the role of biomarkers and systems approaches in personalizing therapy. Next-generation sequencing enables identification of actionable targets and informs matched targeted therapy, while emerging biomarkers and systems biology frameworks support patient selection and rational combinations; companion diagnostics and evolving regulatory science seek to align biomarker cutoffs with clinical utility rather than categorical definitions alone [^114kJaeq] [^113KZp5u] [^112xuuM3].

> But wait, what about the tumor microenvironment and delivery barriers that can blunt efficacy? I need to ensure these are not overlooked. The extracellular matrix and immunosuppressive milieu can impede drug penetration and T-cell function, and therapy-induced ECM remodeling may promote resistance; addressing these barriers via novel delivery systems, ECM-targeting strategies, and optimized cell-therapy trafficking is an active frontier [^115TE1hr] [^113mESQo].

> Next, I should review future directions to keep the synthesis forward-looking yet evidence-based. Advances include multi-specific antibodies, improved ADCs, next-generation CAR-T and TCR constructs, cytokine-based immunomodulation, personalized neoantigen vaccines, and live biotherapeutic products modulating the microbiome; regulatory and manufacturing innovations, including streamlined CMC and adaptive trial designs, are critical to translate these into accessible therapies [^112U6omP] [^117Gu3SG] [^111bR6Bj] [^115RzZ6i] [^115jMYKg].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical takeaway to ensure it is balanced and actionable. Biological therapies have shifted oncology toward precision, immune-mediated control, and in some cases durable remission, but realizing their full potential requires addressing resistance biology, toxicity management, equitable access, and evidence-based combinations; guideline-concordant use of biosimilars and biomarker-driven selection, alongside rational combinations, will be essential to broaden benefit while containing costs [^1142xF9h] [^1165pTVt] [^114kJaeq] [^1153tWcj].

### Agonist antibodies for cancer immunotherapy: history, hopes, and challenges [^111TXrRn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy is amongst the most promising new treatment modalities to arise over the last two decades; antibody drugs are delivering immunotherapy to millions of patients with many different types of cancer. Initial success with antibody therapeutics came in the form of direct targeting or cytotoxic antibodies, such as rituximab and trastuzumab, which bind directly to tumor cells to elicit their destruction. These were followed by immunomodulatory antibodies, that elicit anti-tumor responses by either stimulating immune cells or relieving tumor-mediated suppression. By far the most successful approach in the clinic to date has been relieving immune suppression, with immune checkpoint blockade now a standard approach in the treatment of many cancer types. Despite equivalent and sometimes even more impressive effects in pre-clinical models, agonist antibodies designed to stimulate the immune system have lagged behind in their clinical translation. In this review we document the main receptors that have been targeted by agonist antibodies, consider the various approaches that have been evaluated to date, detail what we have learnt and consider how their anti-cancer potential can be unlocked.

### Patient-reported outcomes in adoptive cell-therapy trials: mind the gap [^112vTPtk]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as health-related quality of life are essential in evaluating patients' perspectives and experiences during oncological treatments. They reflect patients' perceived benefits and harms of the provided intervention, which are not necessarily captured by other investigator-assessed endpoints. Both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency formally include PROs among the parameters considered for the evaluation of the clinical value of anticancer treatments. Practice guidelines providing key recommendations on patients' reported outcomes measurement (PROMs) during the continuum of clinical cancer care have been recently released by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO). Nevertheless, PROs remain poorly investigated in phase I–II oncological clinical trials. Dose-limiting toxicity or grade 3/4 adverse events, traditionally based on the assessment and reporting by investigators, still represent the primary endpoints of early-phase trials. However, these assessments may not appropriately reflect the patient's perception regarding the tolerability of the received treatment.

Adoptive cell therapies (ACT) are a category of advanced therapy medical products with the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment. These products can be autologous, made specifically for each patient from their own biological material, mostly in the case of T cells; or allogeneic, derived from healthy donors, as in the case of natural killer cells. The main types of T-cell therapies include chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T), T-cell receptor therapy (TCR-T), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy. Today, ACT constitutes the largest number of agents in development in the immuno-oncology field, with more than 1400 ongoing trials and a yearly increase of 30%.

While CAR-T has already revolutionized the hematological field, research is ongoing to expand the success of ACT in solid tumors.

Interestingly, only 6.8% of the recently published CAR-T trials investigated PROs as a primary or secondary outcome measure, and none of the TIL-ACT clinical trials in solid tumors included PROs as corollary endpoints. Indeed, much of academia's and industry's efforts to date have been aimed at shifting the cost-effectiveness balance of these therapies by understanding biological features of efficacy (cancer target identification, T-cell product characteristics, biomarkers of response, etc), improving the manufacturing pipeline, and scalability. Surprisingly, limited efforts have been directed to understand patients' perspectives during cell-therapy trials.

### What's next for cancer vaccines [^111bR6Bj]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cancer vaccines have been shown clinically to drive tumor-reactive cell activation, proliferation, and effector function. Unfortunately, tumor eradication by treatment with cancer vaccines has been unsuccessful in many patients. Critical steps are under way to improve vaccine efficacy and combine them with immunotherapy and standard-of-care treatments.

### Therapeutic vaccines for cancer: an overview of clinical trials [^113aSqm1]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic potential of host-specific and tumour-specific immune responses is well recognized and, after many years, active immunotherapies directed at inducing or augmenting these responses are entering clinical practice. Antitumour immunization is a complex, multi-component task, and the optimal combinations of antigens, adjuvants, delivery vehicles and routes of administration are not yet identified. Active immunotherapy must also address the immunosuppressive and tolerogenic mechanisms deployed by tumours. This Review provides an overview of new results from clinical studies of therapeutic cancer vaccines directed against tumour-associated antigens and discusses their implications for the use of active immunotherapy.

### Antibody therapy of cancer [^112CqzYR]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2012). Medium credibility.

The use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cancer therapy has achieved considerable success in recent years. Antibody-drug conjugates are powerful new treatment options for lymphomas and solid tumours, and immunomodulatory antibodies have also recently achieved remarkable clinical success. The development of therapeutic antibodies requires a deep understanding of cancer serology, protein-engineering techniques, mechanisms of action and resistance, and the interplay between the immune system and cancer cells. This Review outlines the fundamental strategies that are required to develop antibody therapies for cancer patients through iterative approaches to target and antibody selection, extending from preclinical studies to human trials.

### Cancer immunotherapy: the beginning of the end of cancer? [^111MErHJ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

These are exciting times for cancer immunotherapy. After many years of disappointing results, the tide has finally changed and immunotherapy has become a clinically validated treatment for many cancers. Immunotherapeutic strategies include cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, adoptive transfer of ex vivo activated T and natural killer cells, and administration of antibodies or recombinant proteins that either costimulate cells or block the so-called immune checkpoint pathways. The recent success of several immunotherapeutic regimes, such as monoclonal antibody blocking of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), has boosted the development of this treatment modality, with the consequence that new therapeutic targets and schemes which combine various immunological agents are now being described at a breathtaking pace. In this review, we outline some of the main strategies in cancer immunotherapy (cancer vaccines, adoptive cellular immunotherapy, immune checkpoint blockade, and oncolytic viruses) and discuss the progress in the synergistic design of immune-targeting combination therapies.

### Biology of interactions: antiepidermal growth factor receptor agents [^116EnJdd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling inhibition represents a highly promising arena for the application of molecularly targeted cancer therapies. Evolving from several decades of systematic research in cancer cell biology, a series of EGFR inhibitors from both the monoclonal antibody (mAb) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) class have been developed and promoted into clinical application. Several EGFR inhibitors have recently gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for cancer therapy in the United States (and many other countries), including the mAbs cetuximab and panitumumab, and the small molecule TKIs gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib. The rapidly expanding preclinical and clinical data contributing to these US Food and Drug Administration drug registrations validates a central role of the EGFR as an important molecular target in epithelial malignancies. In this review, we focus primarily on the biology of EGFR interactions. Through improved understanding of EGFR biology in human cancers, there is anticipation that more tumor-selective therapy approaches with diminished collateral normal tissue toxicity can be advanced. Many questions remain to be answered, particularly with regard to how best combine EGFR inhibitors with conventional cancer therapies, and how to select those patients (tumors) most likely to benefit from EGFR inhibition strategies.

### Optimal timing of cancer treatments: a call for emerging evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies [^113JdPGL]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Early detection and timely treatment are essential to ensure optimal survival and avoid long-term morbidities associated with complex therapies for advanced cancers. However, delayed diagnosis and long wait times for treatment remain significant healthcare problems globally, risking the progression of disease to more advanced stages and potentially shifting the treatment intent from curative to palliative.

Cancer treatment has entered the era of personalised or precision medicine. Cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment can be targeted by advanced therapies like targeted therapies and immunotherapies based on the expression of biomarkers, providing superior treatment efficacy and manageable toxicity profiles to systemic standard-of-care therapies. Such features drive progressive development of existing treatment options: combining non-surgical treatment options, extending indications to earlier-stage, resectable cancers in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings, and further refining treatment lines with more precise options. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy continue to evolve, improving the above strategies for better outcomes.

### Genetically engineered T cells for the treatment of cancer [^1116zd9c]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

Cancer therapy using genetically engineered T cells is still in its infancy and many approaches are being examined in parallel in small heterogenic groups of patients. The diversity of TCRs, CARs and vectors used in studies, the selection of various T cell subsets for gene transfer and the different preconditioning and supportive cytokine regimens available for patients are likely to lead to significant advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy. However, the diversity also means that it will be difficult to identify which particular aspects of a protocol are critical for its effectiveness. The relatively slow progress of T cell therapeutics into established drugs is also due to the low interest from the biotechnology industry to explore advanced biological therapeutic agents and invest in the field. However, due to the recent success with gene-engineered T cells and possibilities to commercialize gene transfer vectors, the potential of this upcoming therapy for cancer may soon be appreciated, leading to large randomized Phase III trials to prove the efficacy of these cells. To broaden patient access, it must be shown that genetically engineered T cells can be reproducibly manufactured to be clinically effective. Ultimately, it will be important to find out whether or not this novel and extremely promising form of therapy can deliver improvements in both progression-free survival and overall survival when compared with the standard of care.

### MDSC checkpoint blockade therapy: a new breakthrough point overcoming immunosuppression in cancer immunotherapy [^116pihnk]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

MDSC checkpoint blockade presents a promising strategy to overcome both immune suppression and the tumor-promoting effects of MDSCs. However, achieving clinical success will require overcoming challenges related to the selective targeting of these cells without affecting normal immune function. Combining MDSC checkpoint blockade with immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade), adaptive cellular therapies (e.g. CAR-T and CAR-NK cells) and multiple MDSC checkpoints targeting strategies could create synergistic therapeutic strategies to enhance anti-tumor immunity while mitigating the negative impact of MDSCs. A critical future research direction should involve optimizing combination therapy regimens, defining the optimal timing and dosing strategies, and developing specific targeting modalities that minimize off-target effects. In addition to therapeutic targeting, the development of predictive biomarkers to assess the presence and activity of MDSCs in patients will be crucial for patient stratification and monitoring treatment efficacy. Develop physiologically relevant tumor models that better mimic the human tumor microenvironment. In addition, early-phase clinical trials focused on MDSC-targeted therapies, especially those incorporating advanced delivery systems like nanoparticles or exosomes should be prioritized, moreover, integration of systems biology and artificial intelligence can provide predictive models for therapy optimization, further advancing the field of MDSC-targeted immunotherapy. By addressing these gaps, we are poised to significantly enhance the efficacy of current immunotherapies and provide durable responses in cancer patients. With continued progress in MDSC biology, therapeutic innovation, and personalized medicine, we can look forward to more effective and sustainable treatment options for patients, particularly in the context of solid tumors where MDSCs are major contributors to therapy resistance and disease progression.

### The importance of correctly timing cancer immunotherapy [^113mhTzh]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment options for cancer-surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy-are now supplemented with immunotherapy. Previously underappreciated but now gaining strong interest are the immune modulatory properties of the three conventional modalities. Moreover, there is a better understanding of the needs and potential of the different immune therapeutic platforms. Key to improved treatment will be the combinations of modalities that complete each other's shortcomings. Area covered: Tumor-specific T-cells are required for optimal immunotherapy. In this review, the authors focus on the correct timing of different types of chemotherapeutic agents or immune modulators and immunotherapeutic drugs, not only for the activation and expansion of tumor-specific T-cells but also to support and enhance their anti-tumor efficacy. Expert opinion: At an early phase of disease, clinical success can be obtained using single treatment modalities but at later disease stages, combinations of several modalities are required. The gain in success is determined by a thorough understanding of the direct and indirect immune effects of the modalities used. Profound knowledge of these effects requires optimal tuning of immunomonitoring. This will guide the appropriate combination of treatments and allow for correct sequencing the order and interval of the different therapeutic modalities.

### Combining immunotherapy and targeted therapies in cancer treatment [^111AHA4Q]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2012). Medium credibility.

During the past two decades, the paradigm for cancer treatment has evolved from relatively nonspecific cytotoxic agents to selective, mechanism-based therapeutics. Cancer chemotherapies were initially identified through screens for compounds that killed rapidly dividing cells. These drugs remain the backbone of current treatment, but they are limited by a narrow therapeutic index, significant toxicities and frequently acquired resistance. More recently, an improved understanding of cancer pathogenesis has given rise to new treatment options, including targeted agents and cancer immunotherapy. Targeted approaches aim to inhibit molecular pathways that are crucial for tumour growth and maintenance; whereas, immunotherapy endeavours to stimulate a host immune response that effectuates long-lived tumour destruction. Targeted therapies and cytotoxic agents also modulate immune responses, which raises the possibility that these treatment strategies might be effectively combined with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes.

### Development trends for monoclonal antibody cancer therapeutics [^114ojxnd]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2007). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies are now established as a key therapeutic modality for a range of diseases. Owing to the ability of these agents to selectively target tumour cells, cancer has been a major focus of development programmes for monoclonal antibodies so far. Here, we overview trends in the clinical development and regulatory approval of monoclonal antibodies for cancer since 1980, with the aim of informing future research and development for this class of therapeutics.

### Biological therapy agents… [^115rUW51]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapy Agents Biological therapy involves the use of biologically derived agents to modify the relationship between tumor and host, altering the host's biologic response to tumor cells, with a resultant therapeutic effect. Most biological therapies are designed to activate the patient's immune system and induce it to attack cancer cells. Common biological agents that have been approved for use in treating specific types of cancer are described below. There are three known classes of interferons: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-interferons. Only alpha-interferon has been approved as a cancer treatment. For example, inteferon alfa-2b is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in patients with follicular lymphoma and has proven to be effective for treating malignant melanoma. Targeted Therapy Some monoclonal antibodies/therapeutic antibodies are considered to be targeted therapies because they do not cause a response from the immune system.

They act by
- Marking cancers cells so they are more visible and can be killed by the immune system
- Directly stopping cancer cells from growing
- Causing cancer cells to self-destruct
- Serving as a vehicle to carry toxins to cancer cells.
- Atezolizumab is used to treat advanced stage and metastatic, breast, small cell lung, non-small cell lung and urothelial cancer.
- Bevacizumab is used alone or in combination to treat cervical, colorectal, ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer as well as Glioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma.
- Cetuximab is used alone or in combination with radiation or chemotherapy to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.
- Daratumumab is used alone or in combination to treat multiple myeloma.
- Ramucirumab is used alone or in combination to treat stomach, gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Growth factors are colony stimulating factors or hematopoietic growth factors. These substances promote the growth and maturation of normal cells. There are two types used in cancer treatment: one type stimulates bone marrow to make normal cells; the other acts as an anticancer agent. Colony stimulating factors are being used increasingly in the treatment of bone marrow transplant patients. They are also used for patients who develop anemia or low white blood cell counts because of cancer or cancer therapy.

### Integrating immunotherapy and targeted therapy in cancer treatment: mechanistic insights and clinical implications [^1147xxc8]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Small-molecule targeted therapies have demonstrated outstanding potential in the clinic. These drugs are designed to minimize adverse effects by selectively attacking cancer cells while exerting minimal damage to normal cells. Although initial response to targeted therapies may be high, yielding positive response rates and often improving survival for an important percentage of patients, resistance often limits long-term effectiveness. On the other hand, immunotherapy has demonstrated durable results, yet for a limited number of patients. Growing evidence indicates that some targeted agents can modulate different components of the antitumor immune response. These include immune sensitization by inhibiting tumor cell-intrinsic immune evasion programs or enhancing antigenicity, as well as direct effects on immune effector and immunosuppressive cells. The combination of these two approaches, therefore, has the potential to result in synergistic and durable outcomes for patients. In this review, we focus on the latest advances on integrating immunotherapy with small-molecule targeted inhibitors. In particular, we discuss how specific oncogenic events differentially affect immune response, and the implications of these findings on the rational design of effective combinations of immunotherapy and targeted therapies.

### Building better monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics [^116zb2SF]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2015). Medium credibility.

For 20 years, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been a standard component of cancer therapy, but there is still much room for improvement. Efforts continue to build better cancer therapeutics based on mAbs. Anticancer mAbs function through various mechanisms, including directly targeting the malignant cells, modifying the host response, delivering cytotoxic moieties and retargeting cellular immunity towards the malignant cells. Characteristics of mAbs that affect their efficacy include antigen specificity, overall structure, affinity for the target antigen and how a mAb component is incorporated into a construct that can trigger target cell death. This Review discusses the various approaches to using mAb-based therapeutics to treat cancer and the strategies used to take advantage of the unique potential of each approach, and provides examples of current mAb-based treatments.

### Cancer immunotherapy: the beginning of the end of cancer? [^113cR2yd]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Vaccines

Historically, the primary approach to specifically activate host T cells against tumor antigens has been therapeutic cancer vaccination. In addition to the successful use of preventative vaccines used in the defense against cancer-causing infectious diseases, including hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus, the knowledge that patients can harbor CD8+ and CD4+ T cells capable of recognizing tumor expressed antigens hinted at the possibility of developing cancer vaccines.

Unfortunately, the general lack of understanding of the mechanisms of immunization, and particularly of the role of dendritic cells (DCs), has led to a series of failures of therapeutic cancer vaccines in initial randomized trials. Early on, it was not appreciated that, by creating an environment that disables the immune response, cancer is able to induce tolerance. Therefore, in contrast to conventional prophylactic vaccines for infectious agents, in order to be effective, cancer vaccination must break the tolerance acquired by the tumor cells. DCs are known to be the most effective antigen presenting cells and play a pivotal role in coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, for cancer vaccines to break the tolerance, high quantities of antigens must be targeted to DCs and these, in turn, need to be expanded and activated with appropriate agents.

### The role of active vaccination in cancer immunotherapy: lessons from clinical trials [^117F8AZr]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

In the past few years, a number of different immunotherapeutic strategies have shown impressive results in cancer patients. These successful approaches include blockade of immunosuppressive molecules like PD-1 and CTLA-4, adoptive transfer of patient derived and genetically modified T-cells, and vaccines that stimulate tumor antigen specific T-cells. However, several large vaccine trials recently failed to reach designated primary endpoints. In light of the success of other immunotherapeutic approaches, these negative results raise the questions of why vaccines have not generated a better response, and what the role of active vaccination will be moving forward in cancer immunotherapy.

### Role of biological therapies in the development of personalized medicine [^115pjxya]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Development of personalized medicine involves integration of several biotechnologies. This editorial stresses the important role that biological therapies such as cell and gene therapies, recombinant proteins and vaccines play in personalization of treatment. Cell-based therapies, particularly vaccines made from the patient's own tumor cells, were the first therapeutic vaccines for cancer. Adoptive cell therapy is an immunotherapy based on ex vivo expansion of autologous T lymphocytes and subsequent administration to cancer patients. Stem cells as well as genetic modification of cells has been used for in vivo production of therapeutic substances best suited for individual patients. Besides cell therapy, RNAi has been used for personalized therapy of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, designed to bind specifically to receptors in certain tumors, are also personalized medicines.

### Systematic review of combinations of targeted or immunotherapy in advanced solid tumors [^115Ufvh5]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

With rapid advances in our understanding of cancer, there is an expanding number of potential novel combination therapies, including novel–novel combinations. Identifying which combinations are appropriate and in which subpopulations are among the most difficult questions in medical research. We conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided systematic review of trials of novel–novel combination therapies involving immunotherapies or molecular targeted therapies in advanced solid tumors. A MEDLINE search was conducted using a modified Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for published clinical trials between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2020, in the top-ranked medical and oncology journals. Trials were evaluated according to a criterion adapted from previously published Food and Drug Administration guidance and other key considerations in designing trials of combinations. This included the presence of a strong biological rationale, the use of a new established or emerging predictive biomarker prospectively incorporated into the clinical trial design, appropriate comparator arms of monotherapy or supportive external data sources and a primary endpoint demonstrating a clinically meaningful benefit. Of 32 identified trials, there were 11 (34%) trials of the novel–novel combination of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) therapy, and 10 (31%) trials of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) combination therapy. 20 (62.5%) trials were phase II trials, while 12 (37.5%) were phase III trials. Most (72%) trials lacked significant preclinical evidence supporting the development of the combination in the given indication. A majority of trials (69%) were conducted in biomarker unselected populations or used pre-existing biomarkers within the given indication for patient selection. Most studies (66%) were considered to have appropriate comparator arms or had supportive external data sources such as prior studies of monotherapy. All studies were evaluated as selecting a clinically meaningful primary endpoint. In conclusion, designing trials to evaluate novel–novel combination therapies presents numerous challenges to demonstrate efficacy in a comprehensive manner. A greater understanding of biological rationale for combinations and incorporating predictive biomarkers may improve effective evaluation of combination therapies. Innovative statistical methods and increasing use of external data to support combination approaches are potential strategies that may improve the efficiency of trial design.

### Understanding drug sensitivity and tackling resistance in cancer [^114vjhbg]. Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The Path Forward

Promises and challenges

Significant advances have been made in combatting drug resistance in cancer, which have been facilitated in a number of important ways. New technologies and analytics for biological exploration, such as deep sequencing, single-cell methods, functional readouts of primary tumor cells, and genome-wide screening approaches have revealed many new facets of cancer biology as well as the way in which cancers can respond to therapies and evolve after therapeutic exposure. These improvements in our conceptual understanding of mechanisms governing drug response and resistance have led to the deployment of numerous successful therapies and, increasingly, combination therapies that are rationally implemented on the basis of tumor biology and have led to some improvements in patient outcomes. In addition, the development of new and optimized classes of therapeutic agents has been an important contributor to the cutting edge of cancer investigation and therapy. Indeed, these innovations have collectively led to major successes in the creation and implementation of second- and third-line drugs that combat target-intrinsic resistance, drug combinations to target pathway- and tumor-intrinsic resistance, and conceptualization of combinations to simultaneously target tumor intrinsic biology as well as tumor-extrinsic resistance mechanisms.

### Personalized medicine in oncology: the future is now [^116puDuj]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2010). Medium credibility.

Cancer chemotherapy is in evolution from non-specific cytotoxic drugs that damage both tumour and normal cells to more specific agents and immunotherapy approaches. Targeted agents are directed at unique molecular features of cancer cells, and immunotherapeutics modulate the tumour immune response; both approaches aim to produce greater effectiveness with less toxicity. The development and use of such agents in biomarker-defined populations enables a more personalized approach to cancer treatment than previously possible and has the potential to reduce the cost of cancer care.

### Risk of cancer in patients receiving non-biologic disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis compared with the UK general population [^111iJ54m]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

It has long been recognized that patients with RA have an increased risk of certain types of cancer. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies of RA patients published during 1990–2007, including studies of anti-TNF-treated patients, found an overall 5% increased risk of cancer. There was an increased risk of lung cancer and lymphoma but a reduced risk of colorectal and breast cancer. In part, these differing directions of risk may be related to disease severity or treatment options. For example, in the case of lymphoma, increased inflammation is associated with an increased risk. NSAIDs are associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. Over the past 15 years the introduction of biologic therapies to the management of RA has again raised concerns about the risk of cancer in RA, particularly with respect to anti-TNF therapies due to the role of TNF in tumour surveillance. Concurrently there have also been significant changes in the overall way that RA is managed, with an earlier and more aggressive approach to disease control. Therefore, in order to place the risk of cancers observed under anti-TNF therapy in context, it is important to understand further the underlying risk of cancer in patients treated with non-biologic therapies in the 21st century. The purpose of this analysis is to (i) quantify the risk of cancer and compare it with the general population in a modern cohort of UK biologic-naïve RA patients recruited and followed prospectively since 2001 and (ii) identify risk factors for cancer among this cohort.

### Immunotherapy and immunoprevention of cancer: where do we stand? [^113aTGdH]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Although evolution has shaped the immune system to control microbial invasions, this does not necessarily mean that the immune system can not be triggered to eliminate tumour cells. The exploitation of the terrific potential of the immune system to recognise cell alterations and to selectively destroy large populations of neoplastic cells is a possibility made even more attractive by the advances in our understanding of the immune mechanisms and our ability to manipulate them. This review summarises the state of the different immunotherapy strategies available or in development today, and examines the future developments that hold out the promise of an effective control of cancer growth.

### Cancer systems biology: a peek into the future of patient care? [^113KZp5u]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, scientific research has focused on studying individual events, such as single mutations, gene function, or the effect that mutating one protein has on a biological phenotype. A range of technologies is beginning to provide information that will enable a holistic view of how genomic and epigenetic aberrations in cancer cells can alter the homeostasis of signalling networks within these cells, between cancer cells and the local microenvironment, and at the organ and organism level. This process, termed Systems Biology, needs to be integrated with an iterative approach wherein hypotheses and predictions that arise from modelling are refined and constrained by experimental evaluation. Systems biology approaches will be vital for developing and implementing effective strategies to deliver personalized cancer therapy. Specifically, these approaches will be important to select those patients who are most likely to benefit from targeted therapies and for the development and implementation of rational combinatorial therapies. Systems biology can help to increase therapy efficacy or bypass the emergence of resistance, thus converting the current-often short term-effects of targeted therapies into durable responses, ultimately to improve patient quality of life and provide a cure.

### Regulation of immunotherapeutic products for cancer and FDA's role in product development and clinical evaluation [^112X64MF]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Immunotherapeutics include drugs and biologics that render therapeutic benefit by harnessing the power of the immune system. The promise of immune-mediated therapies is target specificity with a consequent reduction in off-target side effects. Recent scientific advances have led to clinical trials of both active and passive immunotherapeutic products that have the potential to convert life-ending diseases into chronic but manageable conditions. Clinical trials investigating immunotherapeutics are ongoing with some trials at advanced stages of development. However, as with many products involving novel mechanisms of action, major regulatory and scientific issues arising with clinical use of immunotherapeutic products remain to be addressed. In this review, we address issues related to different immunotherapeutics and provide recommendations for the characterization and evaluation of these products during various stages of product and clinical development.

### Monoclonal antibodies in oncology therapeutics: present and future indications [^113mkUWC]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decade, the field of oncology has undergone revolutionary changes. One of the major reasons contributing to this change is the improvement in our understanding of the biology of cancer. Recognition of novel targets on the cancer cell has enabled development of tools to attack those targets. Monoclonal antibodies represent such a therapy that has rapidly been adapted in almost all major cancer subtypes.

Areas Covered

This review intends to give a comprehensive overview of monoclonal antibodies, including mechanism of action, the currently approved agents and future targets. The authors reviewed published data as well as information from the ongoing clinical trials.

Expert Opinion

Monoclonal antibodies represent a major new advance in oncology therapy but there remains significant room for improvement.

### Recent developments in therapeutic cancer vaccines [^1148ndyR]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic cancer vaccines are being developed with the intention of treating existing tumors or preventing tumor recurrence. While the results of clinical trials, predominantly in the metastatic setting have been sobering, the central hypothesis of active immunotherapy i.e. that the human immune system can be activated to recognize and destroy tumor cells, remains a viable one. We believe that a fundamental shift in how clinical trials are performed, and what concepts they test is required to make meaningful strides towards future clinical use of cancer vaccines. First, we must reappraise whether the metastatic setting is the appropriate arena to test these agents. Second, we must arrive at a consensus on the most important biologic endpoints and rapidly test vaccines for their ability to achieve these endpoints. Third, we need to expend more effort on understanding how to manipulate the immune system beyond the initial stimulation provided by a vaccine. Fourth, in order to permit comparison of results across different studies, it would be helpful to narrow down the large number of vaccine platforms. We will discuss the current state of development of cancer vaccines and the relevance for future clinical use of these agents to treat and prevent cancers.

### Systematic review of combinations of targeted or immunotherapy in advanced solid tumors [^111Wczs4]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With rapid advances in our understanding of cancer genomics and immunobiology, an expanding number of novel therapies are being evaluated in clinical trials. As a consequence, there is an exponentially increasing number of mathematically possible drug combinations, including novel–novel combinations, in which two or more drugs are investigational and are not yet approved standards of care. Concordantly, there has been an increase in the number of clinical trials evaluating combination therapies. The use of combination therapies to improve efficacy has traditionally been a central tenet of medical oncology ever since the initial use of combination chemotherapy regimens in hematological malignancies and breast cancer. The underlying rationale is anchored in the synergistic or additive effects of drugs with differing and potentially complementary mechanisms of action to increase the likelihood of response, forestall or overcome resistance and minimize overlapping toxicities. However, patient-to-patient variability and the independent action of drugs may also confer benefit for combination therapies without additive or synergistic interactions.

Multiarm, 'pick-the-winner' or factorial trial designs may often be used to evaluate more than one novel treatment individually and in combination in a single trial. However, it may be impractical to conduct such trials due to finite resources, particularly with an increasing number of novel therapies and potential combinations. Identifying which combinations are appropriate in which patient subpopulations are among the most difficult questions in medical research. Garnering regulatory approval requires demonstrating that each component of a combination contributes to its benefit. This creates numerous challenges for clinicians, industry and regulatory bodies alike in designing, conducting and interpreting trials of novel–novel combination therapies. Therefore, the rational, efficient and effective evaluation of novel–novel drug combinations is crucial. Regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have recognized these challenges and have released formal guidance for trial sponsors. Nevertheless, a fine balance between the level of evidence required to obtain regulatory approval of a novel–novel combination versus the practicality of conducting such trials is needed. Furthermore, as the drug development landscape in oncology continues to evolve, such as the advent of immunotherapeutic strategies, capabilities to adapt clinical trial design remain crucial.

### Biological therapies in lung cancer treatment: using our immune system as an ally to defeat the malignancy [^115Ttgp7]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biological therapies, with immunotherapy leading the field, have arisen as one of the quickest expanding areas of research for cancer treatment in the last few years. The clear benefits for patients are undeniable, satisfying the long-awaited necessity of a target-specific therapy. However, its full potential remains still unexploited due to a lack of response in a majority of patients and pending reliable biomarkers.

Areas Covered

This review provides a summarizing view of the current biological therapies for lung cancer, focusing on immunotherapy - including immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy and vaccines available in clinical/pre-clinical settings or currently in development. A thorough analysis of the technical and functional differences among all therapies is provided, along with a critical discussion of prospective treatments and potential biomarkers.

Expert Opinion

The use of immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer has provided clear benefits for patients. Still, exploitation of the full potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination, or adoptive cell therapies is hampered by, amongst other reasons, the lack of reliable biomarkers and possible adverse immune effects. We postulate that the development of liquid biopsy-based diagnostics will help to overcome these limitations in the near future.

### Antibody targeted drugs as cancer therapeutics [^111BGLPq]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Treatment of cancer is a double-edged sword: it should be as aggressive as possible to completely destroy the tumour, but it is precisely this aggressiveness which often causes severe side effects - a reason why some promising therapeutics can not be applied systemically. In addition, therapeutics such as cytokines that physiologically function in a para- or autocrine fashion require a locally enhanced level to exert their effect appropriately. An elegant way to accumulate therapeutic agents at the tumour site is their conjugation/fusion to tumour-specific antibodies. Here, we discuss recent preclinical and clinical data for antibody-drug conjugates and fusion proteins with a special focus on drug components that exert their antitumour effects through normal biological processes.

### IL-12 / IL-2 combination cytokine therapy for solid tumours: translation from bench to bedside [^114SynnZ]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

A broad range of approaches are under active investigation for the biological therapy of cancer, in particular, strategies directed at host immune response potentiation. These efforts have been fuelled by studies demonstrating the presence of an endogenous, but ineffective, host antitumour immune response and a greater understanding of the key factors which regulate this response. These mechanisms involve complex interactions between various effector cell populations, soluble factors and the tumour itself and are determined by the timing and relative intensity of positive and negative autoregulatory pathways, as well as a variety of immunosuppressive effects capable of mediating tumour self-defence. Based on these observations, immunotherapeutic regimens have been developed to potentiate antigen-specific sensitisation of effector cells with tumour vaccines/adjuvants, expand and amplify the number and function of effector cells, and to counteract suppressive pathways engaged by tumour cells themselves. Significant effort has focused on evaluating the use of exogenous cytokines, administered either systemically or locally into the tumour site via gene therapy. Several cytokines have demonstrated unique activity in the preclinical setting, including IL-2 and IFN-alpha -inducing cytokines such as IL12 and IL18. Most notably, later studies have now attempted to build on the clinical efficacy of IL-2 alone, to define combinations of agents with synergistic immunoregulatory and/or antitumour efficacy. Several lines of evidence suggest that IL-12 and IL-2 provide complementary immunoregulatory signals and have now shown that in combination, these two cytokines mediate synergistic antitumour activity in preclinical tumour models. This paper will review existing data regarding mechanisms of interaction between IL-2 and IL-12 in vitro and in preclinial models and describe future opportunities for the investigation of these potentially promising cytokines in the treatment of cancer.

### Therapeutic antibodies against cancer [^1155WXwh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Antibody-based therapeutics against cancer are highly successful and currently enjoy unprecedented recognition of their potential; 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been approved for clinical use in the European Union and in the United States. Bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab had sales in 2010 of more than $5 billion each. Hundreds of mAbs, including bispecific mAbs and multispecific fusion proteins, mAbs conjugated with small-molecule drugs, and mAbs with optimized pharmacokinetics, are in clinical trials. However, deeper understanding of mechanisms is needed to overcome major problems including resistance to therapy, access to targets, complexity of biological systems, and individual variations.

### Novel technologies and emerging biomarkers for personalized cancer immunotherapy [^113ZSFDd]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions and recomendations

As a result of over a century's efforts to understand the role of the immune system in controlling cancer, immunomodulation by checkpoint inhibitors (targeting both CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis) induced a durable tumor response in a wide range of malignancies. In addition to the FDA approvals of single immune checkpoint blockades for cancer immunotherapy, the FDA has granted accelerated approval to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab to treat advanced melanoma, the first approval of any immunotherapy combination to treat cancer. These therapies are revolutionizing therapeutic concepts and changing the standard of care for cancer treatment. Immunotherapy is now widely accepted as a key component of the therapeutic strategies to control and potentially cure cancer. Moreover, immunotherapy has the potential to cure or convert cancer from a fatal disease into a non-life threatening or chronic disease. The concept of a "clinical cure" is emerging as a description of long-term tumor control. The broad potential for a clinical cure is now being extensively explored by both mono and combination cancer immunotherapy.

### Cancer immunotherapy beyond checkpoint blockade: state-of-the-art review [^1157fVDA]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although predicted as a potential antitumor treatment modality more than 50 years ago, clinically tractable cancer immunotherapies have become a reality only in the past decade. This achievement is based on many decades of research advances elucidating basic mechanisms of both immunity and tumorigenesis. With the identification of new targets and novel combinations, use of immunotherapy in oncology is likely to grow in the coming decades because of its distinct advantages over more traditional anticancer drugs in terms of both depth and durability of potential responses. Rapid expansion of the therapeutic arsenal has presented challenges to clinicians, regulators, and the health care system, as mechanisms of action, response patterns, toxicities, and costs of these therapies diverge significantly from prior generations of cancer treatments. However, a few hallmarks of immune-based therapies have emerged from their widespread clinical adoption, including marked and durable survival benefits despite a low initial responding fraction of patients, as well as loss of immunotherapy sensitivity in some treated patients. These response patterns highlight future directions for research and development, which must continue to address issues of immune priming as well as both primary and secondary immune resistance, to achieve durable cancer control and cures.

### Promises and challenges of adoptive T-cell therapies for solid tumours [^113mESQo]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and, despite new targeted therapies and immunotherapies, many patients with advanced-stage- or high-risk cancers still die, owing to metastatic disease. Adoptive T-cell therapy, involving the autologous or allogeneic transplant of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes or genetically modified T cells expressing novel T-cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors, has shown promise in the treatment of cancer patients, leading to durable responses and, in some cases, cure. Technological advances in genomics, computational biology, immunology and cell manufacturing have brought the aspiration of individualised therapies for cancer patients closer to reality. This new era of cell-based individualised therapeutics challenges the traditional standards of therapeutic interventions and provides opportunities for a paradigm shift in our approach to cancer therapy. Invited speakers at a 2020 symposium discussed three areas-cancer genomics, cancer immunology and cell-therapy manufacturing-that are essential to the effective translation of T-cell therapies in the treatment of solid malignancies. Key advances have been made in understanding genetic intratumour heterogeneity, and strategies to accurately identify neoantigens, overcome T-cell exhaustion and circumvent tumour immunosuppression after cell-therapy infusion are being developed. Advances are being made in cell-manufacturing approaches that have the potential to establish cell-therapies as credible therapeutic options. T-cell therapies face many challenges but hold great promise for improving clinical outcomes for patients with solid tumours.

### Molecular targeted therapy for anticancer treatment [^117NaJsW]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the initial clinical approval in the late 1990s and remarkable anticancer effects for certain types of cancer, molecular targeted therapy utilizing small molecule agents or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies acting as signal transduction inhibitors has served as a fundamental backbone in precision medicine for cancer treatment. These approaches are now used clinically as first-line therapy for various types of human cancers. Compared to conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapeutic agents have efficient anticancer effects with fewer side effects. However, the emergence of drug resistance is a major drawback of molecular targeted therapy, and several strategies have been attempted to improve therapeutic efficacy by overcoming such resistance. Herein, we summarize current knowledge regarding several targeted therapeutic agents, including classification, a brief biology of target kinases, mechanisms of action, examples of clinically used targeted therapy, and perspectives for future development.

### Advances in the understanding and therapeutic manipulation of cancer immune responsiveness: a Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) review [^114DSFsi]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cancer immunotherapy — including immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) — has become a standard, potentially curative treatment for a subset of advanced solid and liquid tumors. However, most patients with cancer do not benefit from the rapidly evolving improvements in the understanding of principal mechanisms determining cancer immune responsiveness (CIR); including patient-specific genetically determined and acquired factors, as well as intrinsic cancer cell biology. Though CIR is multifactorial, fundamental concepts are emerging that should be considered for the design of novel therapeutic strategies and related clinical studies. Recent advancements as well as novel approaches to address the limitations of current treatments are discussed here, with a specific focus on ICI and ACT.

### Targeted therapies for cancer [^114kJaeq]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Targeted therapy is the key for improving overall survival while decreasing the undesirable adverse effects of cancer treatment. Patients who received matched targeted therapies showed dramatically improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those without matched therapies. However, each patient responds to targeted therapy differently due to their unique genomic profile. The discrepancy of treatment response between clinical trials and real-world clinical practice highlights an unmet need to develop tailored therapies for individual patients. The development of cutting-edge technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, has enabled us to identify more actionable targets. In this special issue of BMC Medicine, a collection of highly translational and clinical oncology papers presented a series of studies on targeted therapies for a variety of cancer types, aiming to bridge the gap between genomic testing and precision medicine and spark innovations on improving the efficacy of targeted therapies.

### The interplay between extracellular matrix remodeling and cancer therapeutics [^115TE1hr]. Cancer Discovery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an abundant noncellular component of most solid tumors known to support tumor progression and metastasis. The interplay between the ECM and cancer therapeutics opens up new avenues in understanding cancer biology. While the ECM is known to protect the tumor from anticancer agents by serving as a biomechanical barrier, emerging studies show that various cancer therapies induce ECM remodeling, resulting in therapy resistance and tumor progression. This review discusses critical issues in this field including how the ECM influences treatment outcome, how cancer therapies affect ECM remodeling, and the challenges associated with targeting the ECM.

Significance: The intricate relationship between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cancer therapeutics reveals novel insights into tumor biology and its effective treatment. While the ECM may protect tumors from anti-cancer agents, recent research highlights the paradoxical role of therapy-induced ECM remodeling in promoting treatment resistance and tumor progression. This review explores the key aspects of the interplay between ECM and cancer therapeutics.

### Targeted antitumour therapy – future perspectives [^1161o4sC]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The advent of targeted therapy presents an unprecedented opportunity for advances in the treatment of cancer. A key challenge will be to translate the undoubted promise of targeted agents into tangible clinical benefits. Achieving this goal is likely to be dependent upon a number of factors. These include continued research to improve our understanding of the heterogeneity and complexity of the tumour microenvironment; refinement of clinical trial design to incorporate nontraditional end points such as the optimum biological dose and health-related quality of life; and the use of technological advancements in proteomics, genomics and biomarker development to better predict tumour types and patient subsets that may be particularly responsive to treatment, as well as enable a more accurate assessment of drug effect at the molecular level. In summary, the future success of targeted agents will require an integrated multidisciplinary approach involving all stakeholders.

### Combination immunotherapy: a road map [^112tufun]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The number of cancer patients who benefit from immunotherapy has increased due to a better understanding of the immune response to cancer along with recent advances in biomarker development. The goal of combination approaches is to expand the spectrum of patients who respond to cancer immunotherapy (more responding patients in tumors that are sensitive to monotherapy and the identification of new sensitive tumor types that do not respond to monotherapy alone) and to improve the quality of clinical responses (i.e. extension of response duration, PFS, and OS) beyond what can be achieved with monotherapy alone. With research to further elucidate the mechanisms of action behind these agents as well as increased understanding of the resistant counter defense employed by tumors, the development of rational combination approaches is now extending even beyond doublets. Novel triplet regimens of synergistic combinations of immunotherapy agents as well as immunotherapy with conventional or targeted therapies are being investigated in a variety of disease settings. There is tremendous potential for these approaches to extend the clinical success of immunotherapies. However, the added benefit of each additional drug must be properly evaluated against the added toxicities as well as economic impact of the cost of these strategies (the "value proposition"). Previous experience also demonstrates that combination approaches should not be developed solely on the standard dosing and regimens of single agents. Instead, there is a need to investigate the dose and schedule of combination immunotherapies thoroughly and with added flexibility to optimize the dose, schedule, and configuration of each agent. Moreover, the optimal dose and schedule for a given combination may differ across disease indications. Although pre-clinical animal models have limitations, they can be useful for assessing the therapeutic potential of specific combination regimens, interrogating the mechanism of action, and providing insight into the underlying biology of various therapeutic strategies. Progress in combination immunotherapy will also depend on thorough clinical testing, with proper clinical trial design and endpoints. The SITC Combination Therapies Taskforce has summarized the critical issues currently facing the clinical development of combination immunotherapy (Table 2). These issues should help focus further development and promote discussion among academic, industry, and regulatory partners to more fully realize the potential of combination immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer.

Eight studies were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled OR for receipt of trastuzumab in those with low compared to high socio-economic status was 0.93 (95% CI 0.78–1.10; I² = 68%) (Fig. 4).

Nine lung cancer studies evaluated socio-economic status with biological and precision therapy receipt. Four of these reported bevacizumab, 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 1 both bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 1 immunotherapy, and 1 biological therapies (mostly bevacizumab). Six were eligible for meta-analysis, and the pooled OR for receipt of biological and precision therapies in those of low compared to high socio-economic status was 0.71 (95% CI 0.51–1.00; I² = 95%) (Fig. 5).

Twenty studies reported data of interest for 6 other cancers: hepatobiliary (4 studies), melanoma (3 studies), colorectal (8 studies), renal cell carcinoma (1 study), and head and neck cancer (2 studies). A further two studies reported data on more than one cancer. Studies referenced the following 7 treatments: immunotherapy, bevacizumab, sorafenib, ipilimumab, targeted biologics, IL-2, and cetuximab. Sixteen studies could be combined into meta-analyses, giving a pooled OR for receipt of biological and precision therapies for low socio-economic status of 0.84 (95% CI 0.76–0.94; I² = 73%) (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). The test for sub-group differences between breast, lung, and all other cancers was not significant (Additional file 1: Fig. S4).

### (R) evolutionary therapy: the potential of immunotherapy to fulfill the promise of personalized cancer treatment [^117ETRrP]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

Since the millennium, personalized medicine has been at the forefront of therapeutic endeavors in medical oncology. The latest technology has given researchers the ability to define cancer at its molecular core. This has led to the development of "targeted therapies", designed to eliminate driver mutations while leaving healthy cells unscathed. Unfortunately, more than 10 years into the targeted molecular therapy era, successes have been infrequent, and toxicity remains largely unchanged compared with relatively indiscriminant, traditional chemotherapy. Emerging data suggests that the malignant clonal heterogeneity within solid tumors is so diverse that targeting one or even several mutations is likely to have minimal, transient impact. In recent years, new therapies have emerged that can effectively stimulate the immune system and improve survival in patients with metastatic disease. Through immune activation, there is the potential to target the cancer with a biologic diversity that can potentially rival the multiplicity of malignant mutations within tumors. Stimulating the immune system to become an evolving adversary against malignant cells may revolutionize cancer therapy in the years to come.

### Personalized cancer vaccines [^115e8VA7]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

Personalized medicine has extended to management of cancer and implies prescription of specific therapeutics best suited for an individual patient and the type of tumor. These principles have been applied to cancer vaccines.

Areas Covered In This Review

Various cancer vaccines that can be personalized. Tumor-derived vaccines have been used and active immunotherapy based on antigens specific to the tumor. Dendritic cells (DCs) can prime tumor-specific T cell responses and are considered potentially effective vaccines for cancer. DCs may be genetically modified or fused with tumor cells. Adoptive cell therapy is based on autologous antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Personalized peptide vaccination has been combined with chemotherapy. Clinical trials have been conducted. There have been many failures but a selection of those currently in progress is presented.

What The Reader Will Gain

An overview of various types of personalized cancer vaccines, their mechanism of action and current status of development. Causes of failure of clinical trials and concepts of an ideal personalized cancer vaccine are presented.

Take Home Message

A number of approaches are available for personalized cancer vaccines with variable degree of success. There are several challenges and needs for refinement of methods but it remains a promising area of cancer therapy.

### The state of the art: immune-mediated mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy [^1177zDaX]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

There are important differences in the drug discovery strategies that will be required to develop such antibodies as compared with those used to generate antibodies to inhibit functional tumour antigens. The development of antibody therapies against targets such as Her-1 and Her-2 was driven, at least in part, by their capacity to elicit direct and measurable effects on tumour cells induced by antibody binding both in vitro and in murine models (reviewed by;). Studies using transgenic mouse models, inactive isotypes or depletion of specific immune cell populations have subsequently helped to dissect the contribution of Fc-mediated mechanisms to their efficacy. However, the primary antiproliferative and other biological effects mediated by the Fab portion of the antibody could reasonably be expected to effect therapeutic gain and were the basis for the therapeutic hypothesis justifying entry into clinical trials. In contrast, the development of antibodies against novel targets, which may depend more, or solely, on Fc-mediated mechanisms of action, requires in vitro and in vivo screening techniques convincingly predictive for efficacy in humans. Our current screening cascades are confounded by immunological differences between rodents and humans, and our limited understanding of the parameters that influence how the interactions between target cells, antigen epitopes, antibodies, Fc receptors and effector cells lead to cell kill. Success will depend on addressing these current knowledge gaps and technological barriers, ultimately to understand the key antigen and antibody characteristics that are required to achieve the optimised and tailored recruitment of specific immune system components, and to unleash their therapeutic power.

### Cancer vaccines: between the idea and the reality [^115rK6Vp]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2003). Medium credibility.

Whether vaccines are designed to prepare the immune system for the encounter with a pathogen or with cancer, certain common challenges need to be faced, such as what antigen and what adjuvant to use, what type of immune response to generate and how to make it long lasting. Cancer, additionally, presents several unique hurdles. Cancer vaccines must overcome immune suppression exerted by the tumour, by previous therapy or by the effects of advanced age of the patient. If used for cancer prevention, vaccines must elicit effective long-term memory without the potential of causing autoimmunity. This article addresses the common and the unique challenges to cancer vaccines and the progress that has been made in meeting them. Considering how refractory cancer has been to standard therapy, efforts to achieve immune control of this disease are well justified.

### Cell and molecular biology: a new section joins the fight against cancer [^116AD7RT]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

One of the common threads linking past and future progress in the fight against cancer is the powerful combination of cell and molecular biology. Deciphering how gene function affects cell behaviour is crucial to our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer progression and therapy resistance. Genome-editing tools, the development of three-dimensional culture systems that more accurately reflect cell growth within tumours than standard two-dimensional culture, and the ability to use high-throughput genetic and drug-screening tools are likely to make a major impact on both our understanding of the disease and the identification of novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. Such tools will reveal how the complex intratumour microenvironment, which includes cancer cells, infiltrating immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, effects the phenotypic transitions that represent key challenges to effective therapy.

Given the fundamental importance of this field to current and future cancer research and to the development of new and successful anticancer therapies, it is with great enthusiasm that we are launching a new Cell and Molecular Biology section in the British Journal of Cancer. We welcome increased submissions in this area including those that provide key insights into:
 — The molecular mechanisms underpinning cancer progression;
 — Mechanisms of drug and immunotherapy resistance;
 — The tumour microenvironment;
 — Cancer metabolism;
 — Phenotypic heterogeneity;
 — Dormancy;
 — DNA damage repair pathways;
 — Antitumour immunology;
 — Preclinical models for cancer; and
 — New methodologies.

By including a section dedicated to cell and molecular biology, we recognise the importance of this field to the future of cancer research. We also anticipate that articles covering the topics highlighted above will complement the existing, more clinically oriented, subject areas that have led to the British Journal of Cancer being recognised as one of the most-cited cancer journals.

### Are there socio-economic inequalities in utilization of predictive biomarker tests and biological and precision therapies for cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BzbGS]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditional cancer treatments (chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy) are subject to inequalities in utilization by socio-economic status. These socio-economic inequalities have persisted over time and exist across cancers, healthcare systems, and treatments. Individuals with a lower socio-economic status are less likely to receive conventional treatments, and this may contribute to poorer cancer outcomes in this group.

Increasingly, systemic treatments targeted at cancer biology (e.g. tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies) are being integrated into cancer clinical care. These agents are expensive (immunotherapy can cost, in US dollars, $100,000 per patient annually) and may only have efficacy in selected sub-populations. Hence, stratifying patients by molecular pathology to predict the likelihood of tumor response and adjusting therapy accordingly is now routinely recommended (see, for example). This move towards biological and precision therapies is reflected in the cancer drug development pipeline; for example, in 2019, 450 new cancer drug candidates were immunotherapies.

Socio-economic inequalities in biological and precision therapy utilization remain largely unexplored. Some speculate that using molecular information to target cancer treatment potentially provides a solution to current treatment inequalities. Others argue that novel cancer therapies, because of their cost, disproportionately favor those with more resources and, therefore, may widen inequalities further.

As novel cancer therapies and their associated predictive biomarker tests offer opportunities for increased tumor response, reduced adverse effects, and improved survival, it is important to understand whether there are inequalities in their receipt. This systematic review and meta-analysis integrated the existing research to investigate the relationship between socio-economic status and utilization of biological and precision cancer therapies and their associated predictive biomarker tests.

### The state of the art: immune-mediated mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy [^115LxnFD]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

A number of antibody products have now become accepted as effective anti-cancer therapies. Despite being mainly designed to act by inhibiting functional tumour antigens, there is increasing evidence that Fc-mediated engagement of the immune system is an important contributor to the efficacy of several of these therapies. The optimisation of this engagement offers the potential not only to augment efficacy against existing targets, but also to exploit non-functional tumour antigens. Antibodies that achieve efficacy wholly or predominantly through Fc-mediated mechanisms, represent rich opportunities for future therapeutics in oncology. This mini review summarises some of the key challenges, which need to be addressed to select the most effective molecules. These include the identification of optimal antibody characteristics and improvement of the drug discovery process, in particular, the relevance and predictive power of existing in vitro and in vivo screening methods. Advances in our understanding of tumour immunobiology and successful application of technologies designed to enhance immune system engagement will further aid this process.

### Cancer immunotherapy beyond checkpoint blockade: state-of-the-art review [^111fNfuh]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Avoidance of immune destruction is recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer development. Although first predicted as a potential antitumor treatment modality more than 50 years ago, the widespread clinical use of cancer immunotherapies has only recently become a reality. Cancer immunotherapy works by reactivation of a stalled pre-existing immune response or by eliciting a de novo immune response, and its toolkit comprises antibodies, vaccines, cytokines, and cell-based therapies. The treatment paradigm in some malignancies has completely changed over the past 10 to 15 years. Massive efforts in preclinical development have led to a surge of clinical trials testing innovative therapeutic approaches as monotherapy and, increasingly, in combination. Here we provide an overview of approved and emerging antitumor immune therapies, focusing on the rich landscape of therapeutic approaches beyond those that block the canonical PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 axes and placing them in the context of the latest understanding of tumor immunology.

### Treatment with biologic therapies and the risk of cancer in patients with IBD [^113nHiYB]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

The proven involvement of cytokines in the pathophysiology of IBD has led to the development of powerful, selective, anticytokine drugs — so-called biologics — as a therapy for IBD. Although the efficacy of infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor, is proven and the use of biologic agents is growing worldwide, there is concern about their long-term safety, which includes the risk of developing cancer. An increased risk of malignancies, particularly lymphoma, has been reported in some studies of infliximab-treated patients with IBD; however, the increased risk could be caused by the underlying chronic disease, severity of the disease, concomitant medications (e.g. conventional immunomodulators), infliximab itself, or all of these variables. At present, the data do not provide clear evidence for a causal association between infliximab and the increased cancer risk. In appropriately selected patients with severe, refractory Crohn's disease, the benefits of biologic therapy seem to outweigh the cancer risk. Multicenter, case-control studies in large populations, with a long-term follow-up are needed to define the outcome of patients with IBD treated with biologic therapies.

### Cancer immunotherapy: the beginning of the end of cancer? [^116jHwie]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The ideal vaccine will be one able to trigger the maturation of DCs to a state where they can promote the production of tumor-reactive, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. It is possible that conditions for immunization will finally be optimized; however, the efficacy of a tumor-specific T cell population may still be compromised by the numerous mechanisms of immunoevasion exploited by tumors to defend against T cell attack. These are not reasons to exclude vaccines from consideration as part of an immunotherapy, but rather to call attention to some of the limitations in assessing success in the absence of other immunological regimes. Work on vaccines should continue in a methodical fashion with human studies, since animal models are unlikely to illuminate the best path forward. In addition, similar to all forms of targeted therapy in cancer, the discovery and application of predictive biomarkers or diagnostics, for the identification of those patients most likely to profit from a given vaccine, will be an important challenge for future development.

### Next-generation combination approaches for immune checkpoint therapy [^1153tWcj]. Nature Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, leading to dramatic clinical outcomes for a subset of patients. However, many patients do not experience durable responses following immune checkpoint therapy owing to multiple resistance mechanisms, highlighting the need for effective combination strategies that target these resistance pathways and improve clinical responses. The development of combination strategies based on an understanding of the complex biology that regulates human antitumor immune responses has been a major challenge. In this Review, we describe the current landscape of combination therapies. We also discuss how the development of effective combination strategies will require the integration of small, tissue-rich clinical trials, to determine how therapy-driven perturbation of the human immune system affects downstream biological responses and eventual clinical outcomes, reverse translation of clinical observations to immunocompetent preclinical models, to interrogate specific biological pathways and their impact on antitumor immune responses, and novel computational methods and machine learning, to integrate multiple datasets across clinical and preclinical studies for the identification of the most relevant pathways that need to be targeted for successful combination strategies.

### Harnessing cytokines and chemokines for cancer therapy [^117Gu3SG]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

During the past 40 years, cytokines and cytokine receptors have been extensively investigated as either cancer targets or cancer treatments. A strong preclinical rationale supports therapeutic strategies to enhance the growth inhibitory and immunostimulatory effects of interferons and interleukins, including IL-2, IL-7, IL-12 and IL-15, or to inhibit the inflammatory and tumour-promoting actions of cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β and IL-6. This rationale is underscored by the discovery of altered and dysregulated cytokine expression in all human cancers. These findings prompted clinical trials of several cytokines or cytokine antagonists, revealing relevant biological activity but limited therapeutic efficacy. However, most trials involved patients with advanced-stage disease, which might not be the optimal setting for cytokine-based therapy. The advent of more effective immunotherapies and an increased understanding of the tumour microenvironment have presented new approaches to harnessing cytokine networks in the treatment of cancer, which include using cytokine-based therapies to enhance the activity or alleviate the immune-related toxicities of other treatments as well as to target early stage cancers. Many challenges remain, especially concerning delivery methods, context dependencies, and the pleiotropic, redundant and often conflicting actions of many cytokines. Herein, we discuss the lessons learnt from the initial trials of single-agent cytokine-based therapies and subsequent efforts to better exploit such agents for the treatment of solid tumours.

### Combination cancer therapy with immune checkpoint blockade: mechanisms and strategies [^112Pt5df]. Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

The success of immune checkpoint blockade in patients with a wide variety of malignancies has changed the treatment paradigm in oncology. However, combination therapies with immune checkpoint blockade will be needed to overcome resistance and broaden the clinical utility of immunotherapy. Here we discuss a framework for rationally designing combination therapy strategies based on enhancing major discriminatory functions of the immune system that are corrupted by cancer-namely, antigenicity, adjuvanticity, and homeostatic feedback inhibition. We review recent advances on how conventional genotoxic cancer therapies, molecularly targeted therapies, epigenetic agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors can restore these discriminatory functions. Potential barriers that can impede response despite combination therapy are also discussed.

B. Recommendations

Avoid duplication in partner targets in unselected patients, particularly in cancers for which single-agent immunotherapy has no activity.
In the design of a combination, consider whether other monotherapy arms are required when trial designs are conceived.
Consider if randomized arms of monotherapy are ethical; for example, if based on the mechanism of action, no clinical activity of monotherapy is expected.
Consider use of milestone survival or response endpoints to more efficiently generate early evidence.
Consider the incorporation of real-world evidence and novel hybrid designs, including in regulatory decision making.
Consider using (historical) data on single-agent efficacy, ideally to be obtained from multiple datasets and for all agents within the combination.
Consider introducing experimental therapies, including novel–novel combinations, into the trial at any time, allowing for rational combinations based on new biological or clinical insights.
Consider innovative but sound statistical methods, including use of historical or external data sources to support combination approaches.

### Advances in the development of cancer immunotherapies [^1149RPLQ]. Trends in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Manipulating the immune system in order to induce clinically relevant responses against cancer is a longstanding goal. Interventions to enhance tumor-specific immunity through vaccination, sustaining effector T cell activation, or increasing the numbers of tumor-specific T cells using ex vivo expansion, have all resulted in clinical successes. Here, we examine recent clinical advances and major ongoing studies in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Single agents have so far benefited a limited proportion of patients, and future studies combining different types of immunotherapies and other therapeutic modalities, such as drugs against specific signaling pathways driving cancer cell growth, are needed to pave the way for the development of effective anticancer treatments causing durable responses.

### Prospects for combining targeted and conventional cancer therapy with immunotherapy [^111Y8m7V]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2017). Medium credibility.

Over the past 25 years, research in cancer therapeutics has largely focused on two distinct lines of enquiry. In one approach, efforts to understand the underlying cell-autonomous, genetic drivers of tumorigenesis have led to the development of clinically important targeted agents that result in profound, but often not durable, tumour responses in genetically defined patient populations. In the second parallel approach, exploration of the mechanisms of protective tumour immunity has provided several therapeutic strategies - most notably the 'immune checkpoint' antibodies that reverse the negative regulators of T cell function - that accomplish durable clinical responses in subsets of patients with various tumour types. The integration of these potentially complementary research fields provides new opportunities to improve cancer treatments. Targeted and immune-based therapies have already transformed the standard-of-care for several malignancies. However, additional insights into the effects of targeted therapies, along with conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy, on the induction of antitumour immunity will help to advance the design of combination strategies that increase the rate of complete and durable clinical response in patients.

### Immunotherapy… [^115sTA64]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

How does immunotherapy work against cancer. As part of its normal function, the immune system detects and destroys abnormal cells and most likely prevents or curbs the growth of many cancers. For instance, immune cells are sometimes found in and around tumors. These cells, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs, are a sign that the immune system is responding to the tumor. People whose tumors contain TILs often do better than people whose tumors don't contain them. Even though the immune system can prevent or slow cancer growth, cancer cells have ways to avoid destruction by the immune system. For example, cancer cells may:

- Have genetic changes that make them less visible to the immune system.
- Have proteins on their surface that turn off immune cells.
- Change the normal cells around the tumor so they interfere with how the immune system responds to the cancer cells. Immunotherapy helps the immune system to better act against cancer. What are the types of immunotherapy.

Several types of immunotherapy are used to treat cancer. These include: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are drugs that block immune checkpoints. These checkpoints are a normal part of the immune system and keep immune responses from being too strong. By blocking them, these drugs allow immune cells to respond more strongly to cancer. Learn more about immune checkpoint inhibitors. T-cell transfer therapy, which is a treatment that boosts the natural ability of your T cells to fight cancer. In this treatment, immune cells are taken from your tumor. Those that are most active against your cancer are selected or changed in the lab to better attack your cancer cells, grown in large batches, and put back into your body through a needle in a vein. T-cell transfer therapy may also be called adoptive cell therapy, adoptive immunotherapy, or immune cell therapy. Learn more about T-cell transfer therapy.

Monoclonal antibodies, which are immune system proteins created in the lab that are designed to bind to specific targets on cancer cells. Some monoclonal antibodies mark cancer cells so that they will be better seen and destroyed by the immune system. Such monoclonal antibodies are a type of immunotherapy. Only a small portion of people who receive immunotherapy will respond to the treatment. Finding ways to predict which people will respond to treatment is a major area of research. Learning more about how cancer cells evade or suppress immune responses against them. A better understanding of how cancer cells get around the immune system could lead to the development of new drugs that block those processes.

### Awaiting a new era of cancer immunotherapy [^115YE3si]. Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

A major challenge in cancer therapy is the lack of specificity for cancer cells. Antibody-based therapies have better specificity and, thus, improved efficacy over standard chemotherapy regimens. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) constitute the most rapidly growing class of human therapeutics and are proven agents for recognizing and destroying malignant cells. However, the development of antibody therapies has focused only on targeting extracellular (cell-surface or secreted) proteins rather than intracellular targets (within cells, such as phosphatases and/or kinases and transcription factors), because antibodies are generally believed to be too large to enter cells, resulting in a large untapped source of intracellular therapeutic targets. Recently, we presented evidence that suggests that intracellular proteins with high expression in cancer cells are useful targets for mAb-based or vaccination immunotherapies, thus challenging current understanding. Here, we further discuss the concept and future uses of these immunotherapies against a large pool of intracellular oncoproteins for cancer therapy. This line of research has the potential to vastly expand the field of antibody therapy and usher in a new era of cancer vaccines.

### Integrating biologically targeted therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [^116iKV6a]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The integration of targeted therapies such as cetuximab to radiation therapy has revolutionized the management of head and neck cancers in the last decade. However, the use of targeted therapies raised several clinically relevant questions that have yet to be answered. These questions include the optimal patient and tumor profile for biologically targeted therapy, the optimal radiation fractionation to use with targeted therapies, how to integrate them into standard or new chemoradiation regimens, their schedule and duration of administration, their toxicity, and which direction to consider for novel targeted treatment. In this review, we highlight several of these important issues, discuss the clinical trials that are designed to address these issues, and introduce some novel targeted therapies that may contribute to the improvement of the therapeutic ratio for head and neck cancer therapy.

### Improving the therapeutic index in adoptive cell therapy: key factors that impact efficacy [^111nHxwh]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Success of ACT against solid tumors will depend on a deeper and precise understanding of individual patient's immune biology and the fine balance that governs distribution, deployment, expansion and activation of infused products. Here, we propose a logical process to define patient selection and therapeutic strategy for an optimal TI Several concepts raised here are speculative, derived from other disciplines or from pre-clinical models. The ultimate test in patients will require thoughtful, though not necessarily, over-burdensome study design to validate the usefulness of this logic. Progress in the treatment of solid cancers will stand a better chance only if systematic non-empirical approaches as the one described here are proactively sought.

### Immunotherapy to treat cancer [^117CUqZu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

This issue of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics focuses on immunotherapy as an approach to treat cancer by generating or augmenting an immune response against it. The enthusiasm for immunotherapy has waxed and waned over the past century. Enthusiasm for immunotherapy has risen over the past decade due, in part, to data showing that cancer immunotherapy consistently improves overall survival in select patients with advanced-stage cancer. Antitumor immunotherapy has broad potential and could be used to treat many different types of advanced-stage cancer due to the durable and robust response that it elicits across a diverse spectrum of cancers. This issue covers various aspects of relevant therapeutic topics ranging from discovery of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, development of novel immunotherapies using novel pharmacokinetic/dynamic modeling tools, to the utilization of immune checkpoint therapy. Regarding utilization, this issue addresses biomarker selection strategies for personalized treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with immune checkpoint therapy and also the management of the unique immune response adverse events (irAEs).

### Intentional heterogeneity in autologous cell-based gene therapies: strategic considerations for first-in-human trials [^115jMYKg]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Cell-based gene therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor-T, T-cell receptor-T, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies, have transformed the treatment landscape for certain cancers, yet their efficacy in solid tumors remains limited. Next-generation therapies aim to overcome biological barriers, enhance potency and safety, and streamline development timelines through innovative approaches. Recent advances in genome editing technologies have identified hundreds of gene edits that improve T-cell functionality in preclinical models. However, the limited direct translatability of these findings and the impracticality of testing each of the individual edits in a traditional clinical trial highlight the need for more efficient strategies. This article provides an overview of genome-wide screens that identify gene knockouts and knock-ins to enhance T-cell function and the limitations with translating these results to human trials. Next, we propose a novel clinical trial design for testing multiple gene modifications simultaneously within a single T-cell infusion product. This approach would enable head-to-head evaluation of edits in an internally controlled setting, accelerating the identification of promising candidate edits. Key considerations for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, non-clinical evaluation, and clinical protocols are discussed, with an emphasis on patient safety and ethical transparency. This framework is informed by insights shared at the "Unlocking Complex Cell-based Gene Therapies" workshop, held on May 6, 2024. Co-hosted by Friends of Cancer Research and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, the event brought together participants from academia, the US Food and Drug Administration, and patient advocacy groups. By fostering collaboration among these stakeholders, this innovative approach aims to accelerate the development of effective cell-based therapies for complex diseases.

### Antibody-based cancer therapy [^112U6omP]. Oncogene (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the past 25 years, antibody therapeutics have emerged as clinically and commercially successful pharmaceuticals, rapidly approaching 100 Food and Drug Administration approvals with combined annual global sales exceeding $100 billion. Nearly half of the marketed antibody therapeutics are used in oncology. These antibody-based cancer therapies can be broken down into three categories based on their different mechanisms of action, i.e., (i) natural properties, (ii) engagement of cytotoxic T cells, and (iii) delivery of cytotoxic payloads. Both natural and engineered properties of the antibody molecule are founded on its highly stable and modular architecture. In this review we provide an overview and outlook of the rapidly evolving landscape of antibody-based cancer therapy.

### Hallmarks of response to immune checkpoint blockade [^111FFDBD]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of cancer has been arduous, marked by just as much heterogeneity in cancer treatment modality and outcome as is now known to exist at a cellular and molecular level within tumours themselves. Cancer burden, morbidity, and mortality have a wide reaching impact globally, but recent advancements in precision medicine have given the field of oncology an opportunity to greatly improve therapeutic strategies. As the relative 'new kid on the block', cancer immunotherapy differs from conventional chemotherapeutic agents in that its mechanism of action employs, engages, or enhances a functional immune response to tumour cells, rather than aiming principally to physically remove or destroy cancer cells through inherent radio- or chemical toxicity. Importantly, although immunotherapy is commonly thought of as a new treatment modality, the first immunotherapy approaches in fact predate the discovery and development of cytotoxic agents for the treatment of cancer, or even the discovery of X-rays, let alone the therapeutic use of non-ionising radiation. Furthermore, immunotherapy encompasses several subtypes of treatment modality, including vaccination strategies, cell-based therapies using the patient's own immune cells with or without ex vivo modification, and immunomodulatory agents, of which checkpoint inhibitor therapies have been the most broadly successful to date.

### Radiosensitivity of cancer-initiating cells and normal stem cells (or what the heisenberg uncertainly principle has to do with biology) [^115ytmUQ]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Mounting evidence suggests that parallels between normal stem cell biology and cancer biology may provide new targets for cancer therapy. Prospective identification and isolation of cancer-initiating cells from solid tumors has promoted the descriptive and functional identification of these cells allowing for characterization of their response to contemporary cancer therapies, including chemotherapy and radiation. In clinical radiation therapy, the failure to clinically eradicate all tumor cells (eg, a lack of response, partial response, or nonpermanent complete response by imaging) is considered a treatment failure. As such, biologists have explored the characteristics of the small population of clonogenic cancer cells that can survive and are capable of repopulating the tumor after subcurative therapy. Herein, we discuss the convergence of these clonogenic studies with contemporary radiosensitivity studies that use cell surface markers to identify cancer-initiating cells. Implications for and uncertainties regarding incorporation of these concepts into the practice of modern radiation oncology are discussed.

### The role of biological therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer after first-line treatment: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1145CggQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The efficacy of biologic agents or 'molecular targeted therapy' in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been extensively investigated. Their role in second-line therapy and beyond, however, has not been systematically examined. For this review, biological agents were defined as drugs targeting specific cancer cell growth factors, receptors and molecular pathways including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and angiogenesis pathways.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify, describe and summarise the benefits of biologic therapies in addition to standard care in patients with mCRC following progression during or after first-line systemic therapy. Two clinical scenarios were addressed: biologic therapy added to standard treatment compared with standard treatment alone (chemotherapy in second line, best supportive care (BSC) in third line and beyond); and biologic therapy added to standard treatment compared with a different biologic therapy added to same standard. The systematic review examined the effect of biologic agents on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR) and documented toxicity and quality of life (QOL).

### Targeted therapies for cancer [^117Dn6gi]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The past few decades have seen extraordinary progress in developing novel treatment options that target tumors with specific molecular perturbations. These novel treatment options, known as targeted therapies, have shifted the treatment paradigm for a subset of cancer types, such as lung cancer. Emerging evidence has supported the rationale of the combination of targeted therapies with traditional therapies or immunotherapy to achieve optimal benefit while limiting the undesirable side effects. It takes a village to develop an approved targeted therapy from scratch. However, most cancer patients were unaware of the eligibility for targeted therapies upon diagnosis, which might have otherwise improved the overall prognoses. The development of next-generation sequencing has demonstrated a valuable asset for tailoring individualized treatment strategy. Nowadays, more and more patients could benefit from these targeted therapies. Even though, treatment resistance will inevitably develop, highlighting an urgent need to develop more innovative therapies that could target the evolving vulnerabilities.

### Are there socio-economic inequalities in utilization of predictive biomarker tests and biological and precision therapies for cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116JNxjU]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Novel biological and precision therapies and their associated predictive biomarker tests offer opportunities for increased tumor response, reduced adverse effects, and improved survival. This systematic review determined if there are socio-economic inequalities in utilization of predictive biomarker tests and/or biological and precision cancer therapies.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed studies, published in English between January 1998 and December 2019. Observational studies reporting utilization data for predictive biomarker tests and/or cancer biological and precision therapies by a measure of socio-economic status (SES) were eligible. Data was extracted from eligible studies. A modified ISPOR checklist for retrospective database studies was used to assess study quality. Meta-analyses were undertaken using a random-effects model, with sub-group analyses by cancer site and drug class. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for each study. Pooled utilization ORs for low versus high socio-economic groups were calculated for test and therapy receipt.

Results

Among 10,722 citations screened, 62 papers (58 studies; 8 test utilization studies, 37 therapy utilization studies, 3 studies on testing and therapy, 10 studies without denominator populations or which only reported mean socio-economic status) met the inclusion criteria. Studies reported on 7 cancers, 5 predictive biomarkers tests, and 11 biological and precision therapies. Thirty-eight studies (including 1,036,125 patients) were eligible for inclusion in meta-analyses. Low socio-economic status was associated with modestly lower predictive biomarker test utilization (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71–1.05; 10 studies) and significantly lower biological and precision therapy utilization (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75–0.91; 30 studies). Associations with therapy utilization were stronger in lung cancer (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51–1.00; 6 studies), than breast cancer (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78–1.10; 8 studies). The mean study quality score was 6.9/10.

Conclusions

These novel results indicate that there are socio-economic inequalities in predictive biomarker tests and biological and precision therapy utilization. This requires further investigation to prevent differences in outcomes due to inequalities in treatment with biological and precision therapies.

### Introduction to biological therapy… [^115Vkv5P]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction to Biological Therapy A relatively new approach for cancer treatment is biological therapy. This cancer treatment is also known as biotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological response modifier therapy. Biological therapy began with the discovery of immunization more than 200 years ago. Edward Jenner discovered the benefits of injecting humans with fluid taken from sores on cattle infected with cowpox, a disease also known as vaccinia. This fluid contains the organisms that produce the disease. His inoculation worked because the cells of the immune system developed antibodies against the cowpox organism. About a century later, William Coley, a New York surgeon, started using biological therapy to treat cancer patients. He noticed that people with some kinds of cancer appeared to enter remission after developing certain bacterial infections. He concluded that the body's response to the infection must be exerting some effect on the cancer.

He injected cancer patients with live bacteria, then later with filtered toxins. This induced an infectious response that sometimes led to a remission of their cancer. This method of treatment became known as Coley's toxins and was used for decades. More recently, Steven Rosenberg, a researcher at the U. S. National Cancer Institute, proved that the human immune system could be directed to discriminate between healthy cells and cancerous ones. Handled properly, immunotherapy could indeed stimulate the body's defenses. In 1992 genetically engineered IL-2 received the FDA's approval for treating advanced kidney cancer. Understanding how immune system cells exchange messages and finding ways to make these messages clearer and stronger are the goals of research in immunology. Each of these components, and each step in the immune response, represents a potential avenue for the development of a cancer therapy.

Biological therapy research focuses on isolating specific cells of the immune system and their chemical products, then manipulating them in the laboratory to target their activity and control their effects. In summary, biological therapies use the body's immune system, either directly or indirectly, to fight cancer or to reduce the side effects that may be caused by some cancer treatments. Types of Biological Therapy There are two basic categories of biological therapy: immunotherapy and cytotoxic therapy. Immunotherapy uses a variety of methods and drugs to manipulate the immune system. This creates a hostile environment for the existence or growth of cancer in the body. Cytotoxic therapy involves changing the cancer cells' biology so that they become weak and die. Updated: December 21, 2023.

### Vaccines for lung cancer [^112m5EgZ]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy is based on the knowledge that the immune system can distinguish cancerous cells from normal cells. Conceptually, this is an attractive adjuvant approach because it is highly specific and can deal with disseminated disease with minimal impact on normal tissues. In this review, we focus on strategies that use host immune machinery to generate anti-tumor effects, known as active immunotherapy. Proof of principle in lung cancer is now well established in clinical trials, although no superior approach has been defined and therapeutic efficacy remains unknown. In this review, we discuss rationale, biological theory, application, and clinical implementation to date.

### CAR T-cell therapies for T-cell malignancies: does cellular immunotherapy represent the best chance of cure? [^113dcADe]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

What have we learned about CAR-T for T-cell malignancies thus far?

Emerging clinical data in CAR-T for T-cell malignancies clearly shows that it is feasible and may be effective. These first early-phase trials do however raise many questions, the answers to which will guide future rational CAR-T and clinical trial design.

### Top 10 challenges in cancer immunotherapy [^114titjo]. Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Cancer immunotherapy is a validated and critically important approach for treating patients with cancer. Given the vast research and clinical investigation efforts dedicated to advancing both endogenous and synthetic immunotherapy approaches, there is a need to focus on crucial questions and define roadblocks to the basic understanding and clinical progress. Here, we define ten key challenges facing cancer immunotherapy, which range from lack of confidence in translating pre-clinical findings to identifying optimal combinations of immune-based therapies for any given patient. Addressing these challenges will require the combined efforts of basic researchers and clinicians, and the focusing of resources to accelerate understanding of the complex interactions between cancer and the immune system and the development of improved treatment options for patients with cancer.

### Evidence-based development and clinical use of precision oncology therapeutics [^112xuuM3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Precision medicine refers to the "tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient". 1 Because cancer is a disease of the genome, 2 molecular profiling often informs diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision making. Biomarker development generates actionable, reliable information for therapeutic development and clinical decision making. However, therapeutic development only requires biomarker to identify populations where a drug will be effective. Companion diagnostic development through categorical biomarker definitions may, therefore, not be ideal for biomarker development.

### Immune modulation for cancer therapy [^114Dh35R]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Preliminary studies of CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1-blocking antibodies show clear evidence of clinical activity, proving that immune checkpoint modulation is a viable emerging treatment modality across malignancy types, even in cancers not traditionally viewed as amenable to immunotherapy. However, because responses are confined to a subset of treated subjects, future development will focus upon rational combinatorial approaches and predictive biomarker discovery.

### Risk of cancer in patients with psoriasis on biological therapies: a systematic review [^112ytSSD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Biological therapies are highly effective in psoriasis, but have profound effects on innate and adaptive immune pathways that may negatively impact on cancer immunosurveillance mechanisms.

Objectives

To investigate the risk of cancer in patients with psoriasis treated with biological therapy.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (up to August 2016) for randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies and systematic reviews that reported cancer incidence in people exposed to biological therapy for psoriasis compared with a control population.

Results

Eight prospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. All the evidence reviewed related to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) with the exception of one study on ustekinumab. An increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), particularly squamous cell carcinoma, was reported with TNFi compared with both a general United States population and a rheumatoid arthritis population treated with TNFi. No evidence for increased risk of cancers (reported as all cancers, lymphoma, melanoma, prostate, colorectal and breast cancer) other than NMSC was identified.

Conclusions

There were important limitations to the studies identified including choice of comparator arms, inadequate adjustment for confounding factors and failure to account for latency periods of cancer. There remains a need for ongoing pharmacovigilance in relation to cancer risk and biological therapy; the NMSC signal requires further investigation to determine the risk specifically attributable to biological therapy using prospectively collected data with adjustment for known NMSC risk factors.

### The next age of immunotherapy: optimisation, stratification and therapeutic synergies [^1179KGco]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Main

Ten to fifteen years ago, clinical tumour immunology was mainly regarded as an esoteric scientific playground for enthusiasts. Clinical developments in the ensuing years have progressed so dramatically that immunological therapies have become the standard of care for many advanced types of cancer. This change from an area driven by fundamental research into a translational arena with a plethora of new therapies, side effects, and needs for novel biomarkers is truly a transformative one for the field of oncology. Despite these developments, clinical translation is often limited by our understanding of the tight network and regulation of immune responses in all parts of the human body. Our knowledge of the key pathways and counter-mechanisms involved in immune responses needs to be improved to harness the full potential of immunotherapy. The question is no longer 'Can the immune system be used as a potential tool in the fight against cancer?' but, instead, 'What are the key regulators required to achieve prolonged success with immunotherapies for specific cancers?'. This special issue on immunotherapy aims to address these fundamental questions, with articles providing valuable insight into immunotherapy design, stratification and toxicity management.

### Cancer nanomedicine: progress, challenges and opportunities [^115nTAvu]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2017). Medium credibility.

The intrinsic limits of conventional cancer therapies prompted the development and application of various nanotechnologies for more effective and safer cancer treatment, herein referred to as cancer nanomedicine. Considerable technological success has been achieved in this field, but the main obstacles to nanomedicine becoming a new paradigm in cancer therapy stem from the complexities and heterogeneity of tumour biology, an incomplete understanding of nano-bio interactions and the challenges regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls required for clinical translation and commercialization. This Review highlights the progress, challenges and opportunities in cancer nanomedicine and discusses novel engineering approaches that capitalize on our growing understanding of tumour biology and nano-bio interactions to develop more effective nanotherapeutics for cancer patients.

### Harnessing novel strategies and cell types to overcome immune tolerance during adoptive cell therapy in cancer [^1143kT1Q]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The present review highlighted some of the efforts made to overcome obstacles in ACT such as low penetrance into solid tumors, poor target recognition, immune activation and persistence in the TME. While most of this translational research is largely driven by the interest of the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, future studies should also investigate more deeply the various systemic responses of the tumor-bearing host after receiving infusions of customized cell therapy products. Moreover, it should be emphasized that every patient bears a unique tumor composition, let alone responses from the dynamic immune system. Ultimately, the question lies with how effectively we could incorporate the array of recent advances and novel insights to develop tailor-made adoptive cell therapies for every individual. One could envision the future of immunotherapy particularly in adoptive cell therapy, as a personalized medicine against cancer.

### Translational cancer research: balancing prevention and treatment to combat cancer globally [^114NoUPt]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

The Tradition of Translational Cancer Research

Recent decades have yielded unprecedented advances in understanding the biological mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression. Translation of this knowledge to the clinic promises new treatments tailored to exploit the molecular Achilles heel of a patient's tumor. This has been described as personalized medicine, precision medicine, or, more conservatively, as stratified medicine and is popularized in the term "bench-to-bedside" research. In the cancer field, this is what is generally understood by translational cancer research. Thus, molecularly informed treatment points to marked improvements in patient outcomes. However, cancer challenges are emerging that need additional and complementary solutions.

Because of population growth, increasing life expectancies and changes in underlying cancer incidence, the annual number of cases continues to rise globally, being expected to almost double in the next 20 years. Currently, close to half the people living within five years of a diagnosis (13.6 million) are from the richest countries, which comprise only one sixth of the world's population (840 million). Allied to this human burden is the spiraling cost of cancer therapy, which weighs ever more heavily on national budgets. However, the largest relative increases in new cases in the coming decades will occur in low-income countries, where even affordable and effective cancer treatments remain largely unavailable and demands on inadequate cancer services will only continue to grow. Lower income countries therefore face a "double burden" as they transition to higher numbers of cancers on top of preexisting burdens from communicable diseases and malnutrition.

### Cancer immunotherapy [^112AF28Q]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Immune-based therapies for cancer are now commonplace. Cytokine therapy, including interferon and interleukin-2, is safe in the community setting. The US Food and Drug Administration has recently approved sipuleucel-T for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, the first therapeutic cancer vaccine to meet this level of efficacy. The therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies directed against proteins controlling various cell functions, including growth and modulation of immune response, has become so pervasive that the oncologist, whether surgeon or medical oncologist, must be familiar with indications, contraindications, and the associated toxicities.

### Current status: site-specific antibody drug conjugates [^117MidCp]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapeutic strategies have long been used as the primary treatment against a broad range of cancers. However, tumor-cell specificity is only addressed with regard to rapid cell division rates present in most cancers, a feature that is true for a lot of non-malignant cell types as well, leading to systemic side-effects. Thus, targeted cancer treatments with therapeutic antibody biologics have gained major interest in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry. In recent years however, huge efforts have been made to merge the positive features of chemical and biological cancer treatments with the development of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) that deliver the highly cytotoxic drugs directly at the tumor site. As such, ADCs widen the therapeutic window in comparison to chemotherapeutics: The tumor-targeted, antibody-mediated drug delivery approach decreases the minimum effective dose and at the same time elevates the maximum tolerated dose (Fig. 1).

### Targeted therapy of cancer: new prospects for antibodies and immunoconjugates [^1157oUq1]. CA (2006). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy of cancer has been explored for over a century, but it is only in the last decade that various antibody-based products have been introduced into the management of patients with diverse cancers. At present, this is one of the most active areas of clinical research, with eight therapeutic products already approved in oncology. Antibodies against tumor-associated markers have been a part of medical practice in immunohistology and in vitro immunoassays for several decades, have even been used as radioconjugates in diagnostic imaging, and are now becoming increasingly recognized as important biological agents for the detection and treatment of cancer. Molecular engineering has improved the prospects for such antibody-based therapeutics, resulting in different constructs and humanized/human antibodies that can be administered frequently. Consequently, a renewed interest in the development of antibodies conjugated with radionuclides, drugs, and toxins has emerged. We review how antibodies and immunoconjugates have influenced cancer detection and therapy, and also describe promising new developments and challenges for broader applications.
