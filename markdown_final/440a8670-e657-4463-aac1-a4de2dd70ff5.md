## Question

How do you treat hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should stratify who needs surgery now versus who can be monitored. Next, I will outline definitive surgical management, including pre‑op optimization, intra‑op strategy, and post‑op care. After that, I need to cover medical therapy for non‑operative patients and monitoring. Finally, I must address acute hypercalcemic crisis and special scenarios like pregnancy, normocalcemic PHPT, and recurrent disease, making sure each section is anchored to guidelines and high‑quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and ensure we truly have hypercalcemic PHPT rather than a non‑parathyroid cause or secondary hyperparathyroidism; I should double‑check at least two elevated albumin‑adjusted and/or ionized calcium values, two or more weeks apart, with a concurrently elevated or inappropriately normal intact PTH using a second‑ or third‑generation assay, while excluding secondary drivers such as vitamin D deficiency and renal impairment [^115mxSJ5]. I need to check renal function with eGFR or preferably creatinine clearance and obtain a 24‑hour urine calcium with stone risk profile, both to characterize renal involvement and to help separate PHPT from hypocalciuric mimics; assessing 25‑hydroxyvitamin D and considering the urinary calcium/creatinine clearance ratio are also part of a careful differential when appropriate [^111aZ7bs] [^115K4TYH]. Hold on, I should verify ionized calcium if the total calcium is borderline or the albumin is abnormal, since misclassification at this step can mislead the entire pathway [^115mxSJ5].

> Next, I will now examine anatomic and skeletal assessments because they guide both operative planning and risk stratification; cervical ultrasound is appropriate to localize disease and evaluate concomitant thyroid pathology, and sestamibi SPECT combined with CT or 4D CT can be added when needed, especially for re‑operative mapping or discordant localization, while DXA including the distal one‑third radius documents cortical skeletal involvement [^112goaqb] [^1155Nf8y]. Wait, let me verify that imaging does not determine whether surgery is indicated; rather, it supports operative planning, and patients with non‑localizing studies may still be appropriate surgical candidates if criteria are met [^111yQyJ6].

> I should now stratify whether intervention is required; clear indications for parathyroidectomy include symptomatic hypercalcemia and, in asymptomatic patients, serum calcium at least 1 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal, age under 50 years, skeletal involvement such as a T‑score ≤ −2.5 or vertebral fracture, and renal involvement including eGFR < 60 mL/min, hypercalciuria above sex‑specific thresholds, nephrolithiasis, or nephrocalcinosis [^111RbJRd] [^116tzkNS] [^115f65xC] [^112SpR7H] [^111Xmf47]. Let me think about patient factors too; inability to comply with surveillance or a strong preference for cure justifies surgery, and suspicion for parathyroid carcinoma with marked PTH and severe hypercalcemia warrants urgent oncologic evaluation; pregnancy generally prompts deferral of surgery until postpartum with intensified neonatal monitoring if surgery is deferred [^115bkufZ] [^117RqHLn] [^117J3Lao]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought neurocognitive symptoms alone universally mandate surgery; hold on, I should verify the nuance here: AAES suggests considering surgery when symptoms are attributable, but the Fifth Workshop advises against surgery solely to improve neurocognition or quality of life due to inconclusive evidence, so individualized judgment is required [^116nAg13] [^114JgPz7].

> If criteria are not met or there are contraindications, I need to ensure an appropriate surveillance plan is offered, as monitoring without pharmacotherapy is an endorsed strategy in truly asymptomatic PHPT with careful periodic reassessment, rather than reflexive intervention [^113Bued9]. I should double‑check that surveillance includes periodic serum calcium and PTH, vitamin D repletion when needed, renal assessment, and interval DXA to detect progression that would subsequently fulfill operative criteria [^113Bued9].

> For definitive therapy, I should confirm that surgery performed by an experienced parathyroid surgeon offers the only cure and achieves high success when guided by appropriate intraoperative adjuncts; both focused minimally invasive parathyroidectomy and bilateral exploration can be appropriate, with surgeon expertise and disease pattern dictating the approach [^111yQyJ6] [^1136SaFb]. Hold on, I should verify conversion criteria during a focused approach; discovery of multigland disease, inability to identify an abnormal gland, or failure of intraoperative PTH to drop adequately are accepted reasons to convert to bilateral exploration to secure a cure [^115b2HTc] [^1132YjL2].

> Before the operation, let me consider optimization steps; I should confirm and correct vitamin D deficiency, typically targeting 25‑hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL but below the laboratory upper limit, and advise normal calcium intake rather than restriction, alongside adequate hydration to mitigate hypercalcemia risks pre‑op [^111H4sYr] [^116XPDL4]. Wait, I need to check that preoperative vitamin D repletion is specifically recommended in AAES guidance as well, since avoiding deficiency reduces postoperative hypocalcemia risk and secondary hyperparathyroid drive [^111xKeoN].

> Intraoperatively, I should confirm the use of a reliable intraoperative PTH protocol, typically expecting a ≥ 50% fall from baseline within about 10 minutes after excision, to establish biochemical success, and consider ex vivo PTH aspiration or frozen section selectively to confirm parathyroid tissue when doubt remains [^111yQyJ6] [^114Yo9yu]. Let me double‑check that planned bilateral exploration remains appropriate when imaging is discordant, multigland disease is suspected, or intraoperative PTH monitoring is unavailable, given cure rates are high with either strategy when properly executed [^1132YjL2] [^111yQyJ6].

> Postoperatively, I should verify cure as stable normocalcemia for at least six months and proactively manage transient hypocalcemia with calcium and, when indicated, calcitriol, tapering as the remaining glands recover; I should also maintain vitamin D sufficiency and follow IOM dietary calcium targets after successful surgery [^112c28Uf] [^111uRmmN] [^112moHt7]. Hold on, I need to check special situations; short‑term prophylactic calcium and/or vitamin D can prevent symptomatic hypocalcemia, and in prolonged hypoparathyroidism, recombinant PTH may be considered under specialist supervision [^114N1rPP] [^116Jb7ew].

> When surgery is not performed or not possible, I will now examine medical options to control hypercalcemia; cinacalcet is first‑line to lower calcium by increasing Ca‑sensing receptor sensitivity, with calcium monitored closely after initiation and during titration to avoid hypocalcemia and to maintain calcium in the mid‑normal range [^1152z3aX]. Wait, let me verify the indications; pharmacotherapy is reasonable for patients who decline or are unfit for surgery and have significant hypercalcemia or other targets unsuitable for surgical cure at the time of evaluation [^1145gdCr].

> For skeletal protection, I need to consider antiresorptives; alendronate or denosumab increases BMD in PHPT and may be paired with cinacalcet when both hypercalcemia control and bone preservation are needed, with the recognition that antiresorptives have minimal effect on serum calcium in isolation [^116SUpwz] [^113LsBWi]. I should double‑check a common misconception; I initially thought bisphosphonates substantially lower calcium in PHPT — wait, I must correct that: their principal benefit is BMD improvement, whereas cinacalcet is the agent that normalizes calcium, so combination therapy can be rational when both endpoints matter [^113LsBWi].

> I need to ensure foundational measures are addressed; calcium intake should not be restricted and should follow IOM guidance, and vitamin D deficiency should be corrected to at least 30 ng/mL in most patients because repletion modestly lowers PTH without materially worsening hypercalcemia when done carefully and monitored, which is endorsed by both workshop and consensus statements [^116XPDL4] [^111DWHjG] [^111H4sYr]. Next, I should review a monitoring schedule in non‑operative management, including periodic serum calcium, PTH, 25‑hydroxyvitamin D, renal function, and DXA every 1–2 years, adjusting intervals based on risk and therapy changes [^113Bued9].

> In acute severe hypercalcemia or hypercalcemic crisis, I should not jump to conclusions and must prioritize stabilization; aggressive isotonic saline hydration with careful attention to cardiac and renal status precedes loop diuretics for calciuresis, while calcitonin provides rapid but transient reduction and IV bisphosphonates deliver a more durable effect, with dialysis reserved for refractory cases or renal failure, and cinacalcet can be added early in PTH‑mediated hypercalcemia [^115Krs9L] [^1163j2zS]. Once stabilized with calcium typically ≤ 12 mg/dL and symptoms improved, I should confirm the plan to proceed to definitive parathyroidectomy when feasible to achieve cure and prevent recurrence of crisis [^115Krs9L].

> Let me consider normocalcemic PHPT carefully; diagnosis requires normal adjusted total and ionized calcium with elevated PTH on at least two occasions over 3–6 months after excluding all secondary causes such as vitamin D deficiency and CKD, and surgery is not routinely recommended due to insufficient evidence, though individualized decisions may be considered in select cases with end‑organ disease and specialist input [^114KmBRe] [^115SoFjt]. Hold on, I should verify the evolving data; some studies suggest variable bone and renal outcomes and a higher prevalence of multigland disease and non‑localizing imaging in NPHPT, so I should be cautious and candid about uncertainties when counseling patients [^114Tu7pc].

> For pregnancy, I should ensure maternal stabilization and avoid teratogenic agents; if surgery is deferred, close maternal and neonatal monitoring is essential, bisphosphonates and denosumab should be avoided, and data on cinacalcet in pregnancy are limited, so multidisciplinary planning is vital with postpartum parathyroidectomy generally preferred before subsequent pregnancies [^117J3Lao] [^114s8iNK]. But wait, I should double‑check timing; second‑trimester surgery may be considered in selected symptomatic cases at experienced centers, though guideline endorsements emphasize individualized risk‑benefit assessment and the paucity of high‑quality data, reinforcing the need for expert consultation [^117J3Lao].

> If lithium‑associated or suspected multigland disease is present, I need to reconsider routine minimally invasive strategies; high multigland risk warrants planned bilateral exploration or, if a focused approach is attempted, a low threshold for conversion, and intraoperative PTH monitoring remains valuable to guide extent of resection [^117WYwoB] [^114GwmsP] [^111yQyJ6]. I should confirm that expert referral is prudent when imaging is discordant or prior surgery has failed, given the greater complexity of remedial explorations [^114LkNyV].

> For suspected or confirmed parathyroid carcinoma, I should verify that markedly elevated PTH with severe hypercalcemia increases suspicion and prompt oncologic referral; ongoing surveillance includes serum calcium and PTH, and histopathologic confirmation hinges on features such as angioinvasion, with biomarker adjuncts considered in select cases [^117RqHLn] [^11645SYq] [^114cXnqP]. Hold on, I should not overlook that operative strategy and margins differ from benign disease; engaging surgical oncology expertise early is essential to optimize outcomes in this rare entity [^117RqHLn].

> In persistent or recurrent PHPT, I should double‑check the biochemistry to confirm true disease, reassess indications for re‑operation, review prior operative and pathology records, evaluate recurrent laryngeal nerve function, and ensure high‑fidelity localization with the case managed by an experienced parathyroid surgeon; intraoperative PTH monitoring is recommended in reoperative settings to maximize cure and minimize resection of normal tissue [^116Qrvj1] [^116qGStt] [^114VQmV9]. I need to ensure multidisciplinary planning and shared decision‑making given the escalated risks and the potential role for tailored medical therapy if surgery is not favored or feasible [^116qGStt].

Parathyroidectomy is the **definitive treatment** [^114guUzo] for hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism, with surgery indicated for symptomatic patients [^111RbJRd], serum calcium ≥ 1 mg/dL above normal [^114YZidV], osteoporosis or fragility fractures [^112SpR7H], nephrolithiasis, hypercalciuria, impaired renal function [^111Xmf47], or age < 50 years [^115f65xC]. For patients who are not surgical candidates, cinacalcet is the **first-line medical therapy** [^1152z3aX] to lower serum calcium, and bisphosphonates or denosumab are used to improve bone mineral density [^113LsBWi]; combination therapy may be considered when both calcium control and bone protection are needed [^113LsBWi] [^112vY24W]. Acute hypercalcemic crisis requires **aggressive hydration, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates**, with cinacalcet added if needed. Long-term management includes maintaining vitamin D > 30 ng/mL [^111H4sYr], following dietary calcium guidelines [^116XPDL4], and regular monitoring of calcium, renal function, and bone density [^113Bued9].

## Indications for treatment

Treatment decisions are based on **symptoms, biochemical severity, skeletal and renal involvement, and patient age**. The following table summarizes indications for surgical and medical management:

| **Indication** | **Surgical management** | **Medical management** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic hypercalcemia | Recommended [^111RbJRd] | Consider if surgery contraindicated |

## Surgical management

Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive cure for hyperparathyroidism-related hypercalcemia [^112ego2H]. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is preferred for **single-gland disease** [^112R3Wqa] localized on imaging, whereas bilateral exploration is recommended for multigland disease, non-localizing imaging, or a high suspicion of multigland involvement [^1132YjL2]. Intraoperative PTH monitoring [^111yQyJ6] is used to confirm removal of hyperfunctioning tissue and guide the extent of surgery. Postoperative management includes monitoring for hypocalcemia [^111uRmmN] and providing calcium and vitamin D supplementation as needed [^111uRmmN].

---

## Medical management

Medical management is indicated for patients who are not surgical candidates or decline surgery [^113Bued9]. The **primary goals** are to control hypercalcemia, prevent renal complications, and improve bone mineral density (BMD).

---

### Pharmacological therapies

- **Cinacalcet**: A calcimimetic agent that lowers serum calcium by increasing sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptors [^1152z3aX]. Recommended as first-line medical therapy for hypercalcemia control [^111Gy74C].

- **Bisphosphonates (e.g. alendronate)**: Antiresorptive agents that improve BMD but have limited effect on serum calcium [^113LsBWi].

- **Denosumab**: An alternative antiresorptive agent for patients intolerant to bisphosphonates or with contraindications [^113LsBWi] [^116SUpwz].

- **Combination therapy**: Cinacalcet combined with bisphosphonates or denosumab may be considered for patients requiring both calcium control and bone protection [^113LsBWi] [^112vY24W].

---

### Acute hypercalcemic crisis management

- **Aggressive intravenous hydration**: Initial management to reduce serum calcium.

- **Calcitonin**: Rapidly lowers calcium levels.

- **Bisphosphonates**: Administered intravenously for sustained calcium control.

- **Cinacalcet**: Added if hypercalcemia persists despite initial measures [^115Krs9L] [^1163j2zS].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels **> 30 ng/mL** to reduce PTH secretion without increasing calcium [^111H4sYr] and adhering to dietary calcium intake guidelines (800 mg/day for women < 50 years and men < 70 years; 1,000 mg/day for women ≥ 50 years and men ≥ 70 years) [^116XPDL4]. Adequate hydration to prevent nephrolithiasis is also recommended.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to assess **treatment efficacy** and detect **complications** [^113Bued9]:

- **Serum calcium and PTH levels**: Every 6–12 months [^113Bued9].

- **Renal function and imaging**: Annual assessment of eGFR and renal imaging for nephrolithiasis.

- **Bone mineral density**: DXA scan every 1–2 years [^113Bued9].

---

## Complications and side effects

Surgical complications include **hypocalcemia** [^111uRmmN], recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Medical therapy side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (cinacalcet), hypocalcemia, **osteonecrosis of the jaw** (bisphosphonates), and **atypical femoral fractures** [^113LsBWi].

---

## Special considerations

In **pregnancy**, second-trimester surgery is preferred; bisphosphonates and denosumab are contraindicated, and cinacalcet use is limited due to insufficient data. In **parathyroid carcinoma**, surgical resection is the primary treatment, and cinacalcet may be used for hypercalcemia control.

---

Parathyroidectomy is the **definitive treatment** for hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo], while medical management with cinacalcet and antiresorptive agents is appropriate for patients who cannot undergo surgery [^113LsBWi]. Regular monitoring and individualized treatment plans are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^114jRBXb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a group of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel adhered to a formal process, following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology, to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated the risk of bias, assessed the certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach, largely based on narrative reviews, to issue non-GRADEd recommendations.

The panel issued eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence, strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and costs, feasibility, acceptability, and equity. This article summarizes the methodology for issuing both GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism.

### When would I use medical therapies for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112DEB6V]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit, or have residual or recurrent disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation, but others require intervention for the management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcemia, loss of bone mineral density, or renal calculi. The selection of a suitable therapy for each patient should be individualized.

### New perspectives in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^1116jEy2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a biochemical syndrome caused by the inappropriate or unregulated overproduction of parathyroid hormone, leading to hypercalcemia. It was previously considered a relatively rare disorder, with clinical manifestations dominated by renal and/or bone disease. However, in modern times, the diagnosis is most frequently recognized coincidentally on biochemical testing in patients evaluated for unrelated complaints.

Parathyroidectomy is the only curative treatment for PHPT, with improved outcomes in symptomatic patients following this procedure. However, surgical intervention in patients with no clear clinical features remains controversial. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have developed consensus guidelines giving specific indications for when surgery is recommended in patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

This article examines the impact of treatment on asymptomatic PHPT, focusing on bone disease, neurocognitive function, quality of life, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Medical treatment options, including bisphosphonates and cinacalcet, are also discussed.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues relevant to practicing endocrinologists. The methods involve reviewing the latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and both traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism.

The results indicate that the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when a traditional hypercalcemic patient is found to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels, with no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism confirmed.

- **Traditional target organs**: The skeleton and the kidneys remain the focus in patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement, with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared to the lumbar spine, where bone mineral density is generally well maintained.

- **Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects**: These aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, although recently of interest, have not been shown to definitively influence the decision for, or against surgery.

The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines focusing on serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. For patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

In conclusion, primary hyperparathyroidism continues to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically with respect to vitamin D and calcium supplementation, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend maintaining vitamin D levels greater than 30 ng/mL and below the upper limit of normal for the laboratory reference range, which is less than 50 ng/mL.

---

### Approach to the patient: Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism [^113n6rMJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT), a phenotype of primary hyperparathyroidism, is characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone levels in the setting of persistently normal serum calcium. Diagnosis of NPHPT can be challenging and requires that secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism be excluded. The natural history of NPHPT remains inconclusive. Although biochemically less severe, the skeletal and renal complications of NPHPT vary across studies, primarily due to underlying selection bias. Due to limited data, there is currently no consensus regarding medical and surgical treatment. Recent studies on parathyroidectomy have indicated that normocalcemic patients present more often with negative preoperative localization studies and multiglandular disease, which complicates successful surgical management. In addition, postoperative improvements in bone mineral density and nephrolithiasis vary, raising questions about the optimal treatment approach. Further studies are needed to provide better evidence-based guidance for normocalcemic patients.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111yQyJ6]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common clinical problem for which the only definitive management is surgery. Surgical management strategies have evolved considerably over the last several decades. The objective of this guideline is to develop evidence-based strategies to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective practice of parathyroidectomy.

A multidisciplinary panel conducted an evidence review using PubMed, covering literature from January 1, 1985, to July 1, 2015. Levels of evidence were determined using the American College of Physicians grading system, and recommendations were discussed until consensus was reached.

Initial evaluation should include 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, 24-hour urine calcium measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and supplementation for vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for all symptomatic patients, should be considered for most asymptomatic patients, and is more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy.

- **Operative planning**: Cervical ultrasonography or other high-resolution imaging is recommended. Patients with non-localizing imaging remain surgical candidates. Preoperative parathyroid biopsy should be avoided.

- **Surgical outcomes**: Surgeons who perform a high volume of operations have better outcomes. The possibility of multigland disease should be routinely considered. Both focused, image-guided surgery (minimally invasive parathyroidectomy) and bilateral exploration are appropriate operations, achieving high cure rates.

For minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring via a reliable protocol is recommended to enhance surgical success.

### Testing for primary hyperparathyroidism in 17,491 patients with hypercalcemia [^112jCwYy]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is underdiagnosed and associated with many adverse health effects. Historically, many hypercalcemic patients have not received parathyroid hormone (PTH) testing; however, underlying reasons are uncertain. Our goals are to determine the PTH testing rate among hypercalcemic individuals at a large academic health system and to assess characteristics associated with testing versus not testing for PHPT to inform future strategies for closing testing gaps.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included adult patients with ≥ 1 elevated serum calcium result between 2018 and 2022. Based on the presence or absence of a serum PTH result, individuals were classified as "screened" versus "unscreened" for PHPT. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these groups were compared.

- **Results**: The sample comprised 17,491 patients: 6567 male (37.5%), 10,924 female (62.5%), with a mean age of 59 years. PTH testing was performed in 6096 (34.9%) of the patients. Characteristics independently associated with the greatest odds of screening were five or more elevated calcium results (odds ratio [OR] 5.02, P < 0.0001), calcium > 12.0 mg/dL (OR 2.48, P < 0.0001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.42, P < 0.0001). Characteristics associated with the lowest odds of screening were age < 35 years (OR 0.60, P < 0.0001), death during the study period (OR 0.68, P < 0.0001), age ≥ 85 years (OR 0.70, P = 0.0007), and depression (OR 0.84, P = 0.0081).

- **Conclusions**: Only 35% of hypercalcemic patients received PTH testing. Although the presence of PHPT-associated morbidity was not provided, recognition of characteristics influencing testing could inform strategies to improve diagnostic rates.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

- **Methods**: In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

- **Results**: PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

- **Conclusions**: Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts and management approaches for the disorder.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage, which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage, but, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia. However, bone density was higher in normocalcemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) as well as on self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcemic patients.

Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery. For those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and development of organ damage should be offered.

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the fourth International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism [^1163j2zS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

- **Methods**: Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

- **Conclusions**: The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D, aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, although a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) is also reasonable. Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase bone mineral density (BMD), or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, BMD does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114xjQLs]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

- **Methods**: The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. In 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, conducting new blood tests, and performing clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists, while 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

- **Conclusion**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research guidelines.

### Nonsurgical management of mild primary hyperparathyroidism - a reasonable option [^1139fnCF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a relatively common disorder, often diagnosed incidentally and characterized in the majority of those affected by mild stable biochemical abnormalities and a lack of symptoms. Nephrolithiasis and bone loss, leading to an increased risk of fracture, are generally accepted complications of PHPT. Some epidemiological studies report associations between PHPT and a wide range of common diseases, but these relationships may be confounded by the increased body weight observed in PHPT. Because there is a dearth of controlled clinical trial evidence in PHPT, optimal management is controversial. For individuals with mild stable PHPT, low fracture risk, and no renal stones, observation without intervention is reasonable. Surgical treatment is clearly indicated for patients at risk of severe hypercalcemia or with nephrolithiasis. For individuals with an increased risk of fracture, antiresorptive therapies improve bone mineral density to a similar degree as surgical treatment. Calcimimetic agents may have a role in managing patients with symptomatic PHPT who cannot undergo, or fail, surgical treatment. There is a need for additional randomized clinical trials to inform management of PHPT.

### Skeletal effects of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112xV9qE]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the effect of primary hyperparathyroidism on bone mass, the occurrence of fractures, and advances in medical management of this relatively common condition. A MEDLINE search of peer-reviewed publications from 1960 to 1999 was conducted. The reviewed studies evaluated bone mass and fracture risk in primary hyperparathyroidism for both male and female populations. The studies that assessed interventions, including hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, calcimimetic agents, and surgical treatment, and their effects on bone mass and fracture were also reviewed. Preference was given to prospective studies, but retrospective, cross-sectional, and case-control studies were also evaluated.

Most densitometry studies completed at the time of writing have been limited by their design. Some cross-sectional studies using both single-photon absorptiometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry have demonstrated preferential bone loss at cortical skeletal sites, whereas bone density seems relatively well-preserved at cancellous bone sites. The absence of large, prospective controlled trials makes it difficult to evaluate fracture incidence associated with hyperparathyroidism. Retrospective and case-control studies have found conflicting results relative to fracture incidence in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy has been shown to improve bone mineral density at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck. Hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with primary hyperparathyroidism has al

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Ndujv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia in the presence of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, patients who do not meet surgical criteria, cannot undergo surgery, or refuse surgery must be managed medically.

Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease, and management of hypercalcemia and renal stone disease.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available regarding evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, and surgical and nonsurgical approaches, as well as the natural history. To provide the most comprehensive summary of these developments, an international group consisting of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT was convened. This paper presents the results of the task force that was assigned to review the information on the management of PHPT.

Two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report, addressing the surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT using the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology. Both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, provide the most complete information available at the time of writing.

A panel of experts then considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report. In that report, evidence from all task forces is synthesized into a comprehensive review.

### Surgical management of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism [^112wLpog]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), typically defined as elevated serum calcium levels associated with inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, can also occur in patients with normal serum calcium levels. This study investigated the characteristics, workup, and surgical management of patients with normocalcemic pHPT.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of a prospectively collected, single-institution parathyroid database was performed on patients with sporadic pHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy between December 1999 and December 2008.

- **Results**: Overall, 93 out of 771 (12%) pHPT patients had normal serum calcium levels three months prior to surgery. Ionized calcium (iCa) levels were available for 58 patients and were elevated in 50 (86%). Among those with elevated iCa levels, 90% had single-gland disease (SGD), whereas 63% with normal iCa levels had SGD (p = 0.07). Preoperative imaging identified SGD in 60% of patients with normal iCa and in 66% with elevated iCa levels. Intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) monitoring identified cure in 51 of 58 (88%) patients, including 6 (75%) with normal iCa levels. At a median follow-up of 358 days, postoperative calcium and PTH levels were similar in both groups. One (1%) patient had recurrent disease.

- **Conclusions**: Most patients with apparent normocalcemic pHPT have elevated ionized calcium levels. For patients with normocalcemic pHPT, we recommend measuring iCa levels preoperatively, performing localization studies, and utilizing IOPTH monitoring to guide a successful operation.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement from the Fourth International Workshop [^111dqGvZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). High credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is routinely encountered in the clinical practice of endocrinology worldwide. This report distills an update of information about diagnostics, clinical features, and management of this disease into a set of revised guidelines.

- **Participants**: Participants, representing an international constituency with interest and expertise in various facets of asymptomatic PHPT, constituted four Workshop Panels that developed key questions to be addressed. They convened in an open 3-day conference from September 19–21, 2013, in Florence, Italy, where a series of presentations and discussions addressed these questions. A smaller subcommittee, the Expert Panel, then met in a closed session to reach an evidence-based consensus on how to address the questions and data discussed in the open forum.

- **Evidence**: Prior to the conference, each question was addressed by a relevant, extensive literature search. All presentations and deliberations of the Workshop Panels and the Expert Panel were based upon the latest information gleaned from this literature search.

- **Consensus process**: The Expert Panel considered all the evidence provided by the individual Workshop Panels and then reached a consensus.

In view of new findings since the last International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic PHPT, guidelines for management have been revised. The revised guidelines include recommendations for more extensive evaluation of the skeletal and renal systems and skeletal and/or renal involvement as determined by follow-up evaluations.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: An update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood due to a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management.

Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), focusing on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria, as well as vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common.

Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended for patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can achieve both effects. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT, the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, and the risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work advancing our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Imaging techniques in parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism [^117SAzJp]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

As more patients present with the incidental diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to biochemical screening, treatment guidelines have been developed for the management of hyperparathyroidism. The management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved in recent years, with considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches. Successful localization of the diseased gland(s) by nuclear imaging and anatomical studies, along with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay, has allowed for focused and minimally invasive surgical approaches.

Patients in whom localization studies have identified single-gland adenoma or unilateral disease are candidates for such focused approaches instead of the traditional approach of bilateral exploration. These imaging techniques have been critical in the successful management of patients with persistent disease.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: A literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines and can present a challenge for diagnosis and management.

The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high-volume centers.

### The landmark series: Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115o2tun]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Surgery is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The surgical management of PHPT has evolved over the past several decades in response to the continually growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. As imaging modalities for localization, operative approaches, and intraoperative adjuncts, such as intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing, have been optimized, a careful evaluation of the timing of parathyroidectomy in relation to the disease's natural history has been pursued to limit the detrimental end-organ effects of untreated PHPT. This review examines select studies that explore key aspects of PHPT management, fundamental to the practicing surgical oncologist and endocrine surgeon caring for patients with PHPT.

### Nuclear imaging and minimally invasive surgery in the management of hyperparathyroidism [^113GZWwP]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia, and the treatment is primarily surgical. Because of biochemical screening, more patients now present with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism, and consensus guidelines have been developed for the treatment of these patients. There is now considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Sestamibi scanning as a localizing study, used in combination with anatomic imaging and intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone assays, has enabled focused surgical approaches. Patients with localizing studies that indicate a single parathyroid adenoma are candidates for such approaches, including unilateral neck exploration, minimally invasive single-gland exploration, or endoscopic exploration instead of the traditional approach of bilateral neck exploration. Nuclear imaging is also critical to the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.
