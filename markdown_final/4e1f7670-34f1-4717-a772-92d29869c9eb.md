## Question

What is the diagnostic workup for hyperparathyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step diagnostic workup for hyperparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical diagnosis. Then, I should rule out secondary causes and key differentials. Next, I will assess end-organ involvement. After that, I will plan preoperative localization imaging, consider genetic testing where indicated, and address normocalcemic PHPT. Finally, I will clarify surgical indications, perioperative planning including intraoperative PTH, postoperative and nonsurgical surveillance, special scenarios like persistent/recurrent disease, and medical therapy when surgery is not feasible, ensuring I integrate high-quality guideline references throughout.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical diagnosis; I need to ensure albumin-adjusted total calcium is elevated, or ionized calcium if normocalcemic PHPT is suspected, alongside an intact PTH that is elevated or inappropriately normal for the degree of hypercalcemia, and I should repeat these on at least two occasions separated by two weeks to avoid analytical error and document persistence, because the biochemical pairing is the cornerstone of diagnosis and not a single datapoint snapshot [^113LrxeF] [^115mxSJ5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding mimics; I should check 25-hydroxyvitamin D and replete if low, assess renal function and, wait, I almost said eGFR is fine — guidelines actually prefer creatinine clearance for PHPT assessment, review medications such as thiazides and lithium, and calculate a 24‑hour urine calcium and calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio if familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a concern, especially in younger patients or with a family history, while keeping in mind that ectopic PTH secretion is exceedingly rare and a diagnosis of exclusion [^114DBWVe] [^111aZ7bs] [^113LrxeF] [^116VzLcv].

> Next, I should review end-organ involvement because it both informs surgical candidacy and establishes disease burden; for renal assessment, I need a 24‑hour urine calcium, creatinine clearance, and appropriate abdominal imaging to evaluate occult nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis even in "asymptomatic" disease, and for skeletal assessment, I must obtain three-site DXA including the distal one-third radius given the cortical bone vulnerability, consider vertebral imaging or VFA if there is height loss or suspicion of fracture, and, if available, add TBS for microarchitectural insight [^111aZ7bs] [^111MsztM] [^113KrW7g] [^1145Xcuv].

> I will now examine localization imaging, but wait, I initially thought imaging helps establish the diagnosis — let me correct that because diagnosis is biochemical and imaging is solely for preoperative localization, so first-line options include high-resolution neck ultrasound, 99mTc-sestamibi with SPECT/CT, or 4D-CT chosen based on local expertise and patient factors, while second-line approaches like MRI, methionine or choline PET/CT, and selective venous sampling are reserved for negative or discordant studies and reoperative cases, and I should remember that thymic lesions and thyroid nodules can yield false positives on functional imaging, so cross-correlation is essential [^1132GipD] [^112WTiUm] [^112goaqb] [^1155Nf8y] [^115BVVTc] [^117Bmcpw] [^117HYoxq] [^115cmWt7].

> Wait, let me verify the performance caveat in reoperative disease; I recall sestamibi-SPECT can perform well initially, but in persistent or recurrent PHPT the sensitivity drops substantially, and although I first remembered a broad 83–100% figure, in reoperative cohorts it can fall near one-third, so I should set expectations accordingly and consider 4D-CT or PET-based methods earlier in that context [^115Hq8Qw] [^115ZWPqa].

> Let me consider indications for genetic evaluation; I need to think about patients younger than 30 at diagnosis, those with multigland disease, a family history of hypercalcemia or syndromic features, or persistent/recurrent disease after surgery, because identifying hereditary forms like MEN1 changes operative strategy toward bilateral exploration with subtotal parathyroidectomy and cervical thymectomy to balance remission with hypoparathyroidism risk [^116VzLcv] [^114AB1hL].

> I should double-check the criteria and process for normocalcemic PHPT; if adjusted and ionized calcium are repeatedly normal but PTH is elevated, I must exclude all secondary causes such as vitamin D deficiency, renal impairment, hypercalciuria, malabsorption, or relevant medications, confirm persistence across at least 3–6 months, evaluate end-organ involvement similarly to hypercalcemic PHPT, and counsel that some patients progress to hypercalcemia over time, which argues for structured monitoring and individualized discussion about surgery [^114KmBRe] [^1145Xcuv] [^117UPCBt].

> Now, I need to ensure the surgical indications are explicit because surgery is the only curative therapy; these include serum calcium consistently more than 1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, symptomatic disease such as nephrolithiasis or fragility fracture, T-score at or below −2.5 at any site, impaired renal function, age under 50, or patient preference when surveillance is impractical, though hold on, let's not overpromise — parathyroidectomy is curative but patient selection must still weigh comorbidity and goals, especially since medical therapy can palliate but does not replicate surgery's breadth of benefit [^115WdPx8] [^114guUzo].

> Before the operation, I should verify that patients are referred to an experienced endocrine surgeon who will tailor imaging to local capabilities, screen for concomitant thyroid disease on ultrasound to plan any concurrent management, anticipate multigland disease which occurs in roughly 15–20% of cases, and arrange intraoperative PTH monitoring to confirm a biochemical cure with an expected drop of at least 50% from baseline, keeping in mind that a slow decline can still be consistent with cure in cystic or multigland scenarios [^114LkNyV] [^112goaqb] [^112ogURX] [^1139yAGB] [^111BVvfr].

> Postoperatively, I should confirm cure as sustained normocalcemia with appropriately normalized PTH beyond 6 months, manage transient hypocalcemia with calcium with or without calcitriol and taper as tolerated, and, but wait, I should also plan for those not undergoing surgery with annual calcium and 25‑OH vitamin D, periodic DXA at three sites every 1–2 years, annual creatinine clearance, and targeted abdominal imaging or 24‑hour urine calcium if clinically indicated, re-evaluating yearly for surgery if triggers emerge such as rising calcium, fractures, stones, worsening BMD, or declining renal function [^112c28Uf] [^112NYyQA] [^111uRmmN] [^1145Xcuv] [^115WdPx8].

> For persistent or recurrent PHPT, I need to check and reconfirm the biochemical diagnosis, review operative notes, pathology, and prior imaging carefully, assess vocal cord function pre-reoperation, and then escalate localization with SPECT/CT, 4D‑CT, MRI, or amino acid/choline PET/CT, acknowledging again that sestamibi accuracy diminishes in the redo setting and more advanced cross-sectional or PET techniques may be necessary [^116Qrvj1] [^1155Nf8y] [^114QRTai] [^115Hq8Qw].

> Let me think about medical therapy when surgery is not feasible or declined; cinacalcet can reliably lower serum calcium and achieve normocalcemia in a substantial proportion of patients with PHPT who are not surgical candidates, with titration from 30 mg twice daily upward and careful monitoring for hypocalcemia, while recognizing that it generally does not improve bone mineral density, so antiresorptives may be paired if low BMD is the predominant concern and ongoing monitoring remains essential [^117254cz] [^111WuHcb] [^111KFxga] [^114guUzo].

> But wait, what if atypical or severe sequelae are present; I should remember that hypercalcemia from PHPT can rarely precipitate pancreatitis and that calciphylaxis, though more typical of secondary or tertiary HPT, has been reported in PHPT and warrants urgent multidisciplinary management with definitive parathyroid surgery when appropriate, and that bone lesions suggesting giant cell tumor require careful differential to exclude brown tumors with appropriate endocrine evaluation and guideline-concordant bone oncology workup [^111fH38j] [^111mvYdQ] [^113Prkqo] [^115U4GQD].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm the biochemical diagnosis with repeat testing, exclude secondary causes and mimics, quantify renal and skeletal involvement, localize only after the diagnosis is secure, individualize imaging to expertise, consider genetics in the right scenarios, and pursue surgery when indicated while maintaining vigilant long-term follow-up or medical therapy when surgery is not an option; and I should not forget that PHPT is frequently underrecognized, so a structured approach and timely referral can close that gap for patients [^111aZ7bs] [^1155Nf8y] [^111Pk86F].

The workup of hyperparathyroidism focuses on **confirming the diagnosis** with biochemical testing [^113LrxeF], **excluding secondary causes** [^114DBWVe], and **localizing abnormal glands** for surgical planning [^112WTiUm] [^114guUzo]. Recommended steps include:

- **Biochemical confirmation**: Measure adjusted total calcium (or ionized calcium) [^114KmBRe], intact PTH [^111g74q9], phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and creatinine [^113LrxeF]; confirm hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart [^115mxSJ5].

- **Exclude secondary causes**: Rule out vitamin D deficiency [^114DBWVe], chronic kidney disease [^111aZ7bs], thiazide or lithium use, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) using a 24-hour urine calcium and calcium/creatinine clearance ratio [^114DBWVe] [^116VzLcv].

- **Imaging for localization**: Use cervical ultrasound [^112goaqb] and technetium-99m sestamibi (with SPECT/CT if needed) [^112WTiUm]; consider 4D-CT or MRI if initial imaging is inconclusive or for reoperative cases [^1155Nf8y] [^114QRTai].

- **Assess complications**: Obtain three-site DEXA (lumbar spine, hip, distal one-third radius) [^113KrW7g] and renal imaging (ultrasound or CT) [^111MsztM] to evaluate for osteoporosis and nephrolithiasis [^114guUzo].

- **Genetic testing**: Consider in patients < 30 years [^116VzLcv], those with multigland disease, or with a family history of hypercalcemia or syndromic disease [^112xV7fq].

This structured approach ensures accurate diagnosis, precise localization, and detection of complications, thereby **guiding management** [^111dqGvZ].

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes. Each of these phenotypes has been studied in detail, leading to evolving concepts regarding target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

- **Methods**: In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our understanding of this disease.

- **Results**: PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

- **Conclusions**: Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts and approaches in the management of the disease.

### Sensipar [^111WuHcb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with severe hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), who had failed or had contraindications to parathyroidectomy, participated in an open-label, single-arm study. The study consisted of two phases: a dose-titration phase and a maintenance phase. Severe hypercalcemia was defined as a screening serum calcium level of > 12.5 mg/dL. Patients initially received 30 mg cinacalcet twice daily and were then titrated every two weeks to a maximum dose of 90 mg four times daily. Dosage escalation during the variable-length (2 to 16 weeks) titration phase continued until the serum calcium concentration was ≤ 10 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L), the patient reached the highest possible dosage, or adverse events precluded further dosage increases.

Seventeen patients entered the study, with a median exposure to cinacalcet of 270 days (range: 32 to 1,105 days). At baseline, the mean (SE) serum calcium was 12.7 (0.2) mg/dL. At the end of the titration phase, the mean (SE) serum calcium was 10.4 (0.3) mg/dL, indicating a mean reduction of 2.3 (0.3) mg/dL from baseline. Daily doses during the study ranged from 30 mg twice a day to 90 mg four times a day.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. In nearly all cases, primary hyperparathyroidism results from a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue, manifesting as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Although it is generally discovered while asymptomatic, the disease has the potential to become symptomatic, leading to bone loss and kidney stones. In countries lacking widespread biochemical screening, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate.

A variant exists where the serum calcium concentration remains normal, but parathyroid hormone levels are elevated without an apparent cause. The condition can be cured by removing the affected parathyroid gland or glands. However, determining which patients would benefit most from surgery necessitates careful consideration of regularly updated guidelines. For patients not undergoing surgery, recommendations include monitoring serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

False-negative results in choline/methionine studies may occur in cases of moderate hypercalcemia and non-elevated PTH serum levels (so-called "abnormally normal serum PTH level"). In the case of MGD, one or several hyperplastic glands may be missed, particularly in sHPT or MEN. False-negative results may also be caused by a too restricted field of view, in particular in case of recurrence after parathyroidectomy.

### Update on the clinical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^114AB1hL]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the most frequent manifestation of MEN1 and often the first indication of the disease. In pediatric patients who are prospectively screened, at least half already exhibit early signs of pHPT, which is mostly asymptomatic and rarely seen before the age of 10. Symptomatic pHPT is typically not observed before the third decade of life.

pHPT in MEN1 is a multiglandular disease, although the glands are often affected asymmetrically and asynchronously. Patients with MEN1-related pHPT have a lower bone mineral density (BMD) than those with sporadic pHPT. Furthermore, urolithiasis is frequently observed at a young age, and patients with MEN1 aged 20–59 appear to have a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease stage 3 compared to the general US population. It is therefore crucial to monitor patients with MEN1-related pHPT for these complications.

The treatment of pHPT is surgical, with the aim of initial parathyroidectomy being to achieve eucalcemia for as long as possible while preventing hypoparathyroidism and facilitating potential reoperative surgery. Since the publication of guidelines and additional studies, most experts agree that the preferred initial operation in MEN1 is a bilateral cervical exploration. This involves identifying all four parathyroid glands and performing a subtotal parathyroidectomy with concomitant cervical thymectomy, which provides the best balance between rates of persistent/recurrent disease and postoperative hypoparathyroidism.

In recent years, there has been debate regarding the best surgical approach for young people with MEN1-related pHPT.

- **Primary hyperparathyroidism**: Primary hyperparathyroidism from parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of brown tumours.

- **Imaging workup**: Imaging workup for suspected cases should include ultrasound, 99m TC-sestamibi scintigraphy, or SPECT/CT. 4D-CT can also aid in the localisation of parathyroid adenoma.

- **Bone lesions**: Sclerotic bone lesions are most common, but lytic lesions are also possible. It is important to consider differential diagnoses, including primary and secondary bone tumours.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^112Yiz5z]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

- **Methods**: The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. In 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, conducting new blood tests, and performing clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

- **Conclusion**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for managing patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research guidelines.

### The diagnosis and management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^112J6QyU]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Classical primary hyperparathyroidism — a disease of 'bones, stones, and psychic groans' — is a rarity in the United States, although it is still seen in some parts of the world. Today, most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. This change in clinical profile is not merely because of improved detection techniques; patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who lack symptoms, if left untreated, rarely develop the 'classical' features that were common previously. Indeed, currently available data suggest that there is now a disorder with different, yet characteristic, effects on the end-organs of the hyperparathyroid process.

In this review, the features of the skeletal, renal, neuropsychological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations of 'asymptomatic' primary hyperparathyroidism will be discussed. The considerable body of data that has emerged since the recognition of the new clinical profile of primary hyperparathyroidism has allowed a reconsideration of standards of care for this disease. These data were reviewed and incorporated into new clinical guidelines at the 2002 NIH workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. These recommendations highlight both what is known about the disease and important areas that need investigation. Continued interest in the skeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease, along with therapeutic trials of medical approaches for its management, will further refine our understanding and could lead to additional modifications in the approach to patients with this common endocrine disorder.

### Three large, functioning cystic parathyroid adenomas [^111BVvfr]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To report a very rare case of three large, functioning cystic parathyroid adenomas causing primary hyperparathyroidism, we present the history, clinical findings, laboratory test results, radiologic findings, endocrine workup results, intraoperative surgical challenges, and surgical pathology report of the study patient. We review the literature and discuss the importance of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement in such cases.

A 79-year-old woman presented with primary hyperparathyroidism and elevated levels of calcium and PTH. Localization studies confirmed the presence of a large right upper parathyroid adenoma. On exploration, a very large cystic parathyroid gland was identified at that location. Because intraoperative PTH levels remained elevated, further exploration was pursued, which revealed two more large cystic glands on the left side that were resected. This resulted in an adequate but slow PTH drop. The right lower gland appeared normal. On follow-up four days and six weeks after surgery, the calcium and PTH levels had normalized.

This case highlights the aspects of intraoperative PTH use and underscores the need to exclude multigland disease even in the setting of a very large parathyroid cyst with concordant localization studies.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^113gWFLf]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data from 92 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism were identified in a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital. Data were collected during 2014, and all patients had been referred to or primarily managed by a specialist.

- **Patient evaluation**: Patients who had been assessed by a specialist were compared with those who had not been evaluated. A Mann–Whitney U test was used as the test of significance.

The 82 patients not assessed by a specialist were invited to answer a survey investigating previous medication, comorbidity, and body mass index. From this survey, 12 patients with medication (thiazides, calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates) that could possibly influence serum calcium and PTH levels were identified and excluded, as well as seven patients with a BMI ≥ 30. Moreover, two individuals had died, and four cases were considered too severely ill with multiple diseases to be suitable for treatment or further investigation of their hyperparathyroidism. Three patients declined further participation, four patients did not reply to the invitation, and three patients had moved to other parts of the country and were lost to follow-up. Another two patients had been diagnosed with pHPT and consequently cared for. All these cases were excluded from the study cohort.

Morphological explorations revealed two potential hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands: a left cervical lesion on the neck ultrasound and an ectopic mediastinal lesion on the parathyroid scintigraphy using Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile and on F-fluorocholine PET/CT. Surgical removal and histopathological examination determined that the mediastinal mass corresponded to a thymoma and the cervical lesion to a parathyroid adenoma. These images illustrate that a thymoma can produce false-positive results both on Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scintigraphy and F-fluorocholine PET/CT.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement from the Fourth International Workshop [^111dqGvZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). High credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is routinely encountered in clinical practices of endocrinology throughout the world. This report distills an update of information about diagnostics, clinical features, and management of this disease into a set of revised guidelines.

- **Participants**: Participants, representing an international constituency with interest and expertise in various facets of asymptomatic PHPT, constituted four Workshop Panels that developed key questions to be addressed. They then convened in an open 3-day conference from September 19–21, 2013, in Florence, Italy, where a series of presentations and discussions addressed these questions. A smaller subcommittee, the Expert Panel, then met in closed session to reach an evidence-based consensus on how to address the questions and data aired in the open forum.

- **Evidence**: Preceding the conference, each question was addressed by a relevant, extensive literature search. All presentations and deliberations of the Workshop Panels and the Expert Panel were based on the latest information gleaned from this literature search.

- **Consensus process**: The Expert Panel considered all the evidence provided by the individual Workshop Panels and then came to a consensus.

In view of new findings since the last International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic PHPT, guidelines for management have been revised. The revised guidelines include: 1) recommendations for more extensive evaluation of the skeletal and renal systems; 2) skeletal and/or renal involvement as determined by fu

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1163AsC4]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The patients' records were scrutinized concerning further handling and to exclude patients with plausible differential diagnoses. Altogether, 16 patients had to be excluded due to inaccessible medical records. The records of the remaining patients were reviewed at least one year after the initial blood tests. At this point, 92 patients were referred to a specialist, or the physician primarily ordering the tests was classified as a specialist (endocrinologist, endocrine surgeon, or nephrologist). These cases were thereby assumed to have been properly attended to and were excluded. Thirteen patients had previously been diagnosed with pHPT and were also excluded.

- **Patients with specific conditions**: Patients (n = 37) with tests ordered by the dialysis clinic were assumed to have sHPT and were excluded, as were 26 patients due to the high probability of renal sHPT. The majority of them (n = 22) had either progressively elevating levels of creatinine or previously diagnosed chronic renal failure, although with creatinine levels below 175 mmol/L in this test. Two children with chronic renal failure and two patients with a single kidney met the criteria but were all excluded because of plausible sHPT. An additional three children were excluded due to the low probability of pHPT at such an early age.

- **Case examples**: A one-year-old boy had hypercalcaemia (2.56 mmol/L) in combination with an infection with preserved PTH (5.0 pmol/L). A girl of the same age was investigated because of diverging from the normal growth curve and was found to have hypercalcaemia (2.64 mmol/L) and preserved PTH, plus elevated serum levels.

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^111iRoYT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare endocrine malignancy. It accounts for less than 1% of cases of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and is usually associated with more severe clinical manifestations than its much more common benign counterpart, parathyroid adenoma. Its course is typically indolent but progressive. The diagnosis of malignancy is often made only when local recurrence or metastases occur, because the histology of parathyroid tumors can be equivocal or misleading. Most patients with the disease ultimately succumb to the effects of hypercalcemia rather than to direct tumor invasion or distant metastases. A complete resection of all malignant tissue at the time of initial surgery allows for the greatest likelihood of a cure. **Clinical clues**: The possibility of parathyroid cancer should lead the surgeon to an aggressive initial operative approach. In the last decade, greater knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of parathyroid carcinoma has led to the development of diagnostic markers that show promise, particularly when the histology is ambiguous. Moreover, there is hope that a greater understanding of the cancer's pathogenesis will lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for advanced, inoperable disease. This review focuses on the more recent advances in parathyroid carcinoma, particularly its molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111MsM8p]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically after surgery, the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend evaluating patients with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism who have persistently elevated PTH levels after parathyroidectomy. Patients should be treated for causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism. If no such causes are present, monitor for disease recurrence.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcaemia or organ damage. However, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcaemic patients as in those with hypercalcaemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcaemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) as well as on self-reported symptoms, and this was regardless of whether patients were normocalcaemic or hypercalcaemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcaemic patients.

Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and to those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and development of organ damage should be offered.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for giant cell tumor of bone, the NCCN 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following workup for initial evaluation:

- **History and physical examination**: These are essential first steps in the diagnostic process.

- **Imaging of primary site as clinically indicated**: This may include X-ray and MRI with and without contrast, with or without computed tomography as necessary.

- **Chest imaging**: Necessary to evaluate potential metastasis or other thoracic involvement.

- **Bone scan**: Optional but can be considered in certain cases.

- **Biopsy to confirm diagnosis**: It is important to differentiate from other conditions, such as brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism, which should be considered as a differential diagnosis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly concerning follow-up without surgery, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining the following in the monitoring of patients who do not undergo parathyroidectomy:

- **Blood tests**: Serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D annually. Consider measuring PTH levels as clinically indicated.

- **Skeletal**: DEXA at three sites every one or two years unless bone mineral density is normal. Vertebral X-ray, vertebral fracture assessment, or trabecular bone score if clinically indicated.

- **Renal**: CrCl annually, as it is preferred over eGFR. Abdominal imaging, such as X-ray, CT, or ultrasound, if clinically indicated. A 24-hour urine test for calcium if clinically indicated.

### Hypercalcaemia in primary hyperparathyroidism: a rare cause of recurrent acute pancreatitis [^111fH38j]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism leading to hypercalcaemia is a rare cause of acute pancreatitis with a debatable association. The diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is frequently overlooked or delayed because symptoms are non-specific, and serum calcium is not routinely measured in acute pancreatitis. Early diagnosis and treatment of hyperparathyroidism may reduce the chances of complications.

We report a case of a 35-year-old woman who was admitted with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was previously diagnosed with gallstone-induced acute pancreatitis and had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the recurrence of acute pancreatitis suggested an alternative aetiology, prompting extensive investigations. Serum calcium was found to be elevated, and no additional risk factor for pancreatitis was identified. Further workup revealed primary hyperparathyroidism due to a functioning parathyroid adenoma. The patient underwent a parathyroidectomy, followed by an uneventful recovery. She subsequently conceived and is now in her first trimester, without any recurrence of acute pancreatitis since her surgery.

### Initial surgery for benign primary hyperparathyroidism: an analysis of 1,300 patients in a teaching hospital [^113366Ax]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Success rates of initial surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are greater than 95% in specialized centers, mostly referencing single-surgeon experiences. The present study was conducted to identify changes in clinical manifestations, diagnostic procedures, surgical strategies, and outcomes of initial parathyroid interventions in a teaching hospital over the past 25 years, with special regard to surgical expertise.

- **Methods**: Clinical data of patients who underwent an initial neck exploration for benign pHPT between 1985 and 2010 at the University Hospital Marburg were retrospectively evaluated. All data were analyzed particularly with regard to the implementation of additional pre- and intraoperative procedures and to the particular surgical strategy. Additionally, operative results were analyzed with regard to the experience of the responsible surgeons.

- **Results**: An initial neck exploration for benign pHPT was performed in 1,300 patients. Of these, 1,035 patients underwent bilateral cervical exploration (BCE) and 265 patients had a focused, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP). Cure rates did not differ between focused surgeries and BCE (98.9% vs. 98.3%, p = 0.596) following a mean follow-up of 33.4 (± 44.3) months. Postoperative transient hypoparathyroidism was significantly lower in the MIP group (11% vs. 47%, p < 0.0001). The rate of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies (0.4% vs. 2%, p = 0.064) and non-surgical complications (0% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.0875) tended to be lower in the MIP group. Success and complication rates of chief surgeons were consistent across interventions.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues relevant to the practicing endocrinologist. The latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and both traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism is reviewed.

The results indicate that the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels, in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed.

- **Traditional target organs**: The skeleton and the kidneys continue to be a focus in patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement, with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared with the lumbar spine, where bone mineral density is generally well maintained.

- **Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects**: While a focus of recent interest, these aspects have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for, or against surgery.

The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines focusing on serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

In conclusion, primary hyperparathyroidism continues to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism in a Sudanese adolescent boy; a case disguised as rickets [^117XTrhT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Juvenile primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a rare endocrine disease, and its diagnosis might be masked by the clinical, biochemical, and radiological features of rickets.

- **Case presentation**: A 12-year-old Sudanese boy presented with progressive lower limb deformity and difficulty in walking for six months. This was associated with fatigability, poor appetite, and generalized bone pain. On examination, he was thin, disproportionately short, pubertal, and had bilateral genu valgum deformity. X-rays showed osteopenia and signs of rickets. Biochemical workup revealed mildly elevated serum calcium, low phosphate, high alkaline phosphatase, and high parathyroid hormone with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D3. Celiac screening, liver function test, and renal profile were normal. Serum calcium rose dramatically after vitamin D therapy. Genetic testing was negative for CYP2R1 and MEN1 genes. Ultrasound of the neck showed a left inferior parathyroid adenoma, which was surgically excised. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma. Postoperatively, he had hypocalcemia, which was treated with calcium and alfacalcidol. Corrective surgery is planned for the genu valgum deformity, which markedly improved after parathyroidectomy.

- **Conclusion**: Although PHPT is extremely rare in the young population, it should be considered in patients with rickets and elevated serum calcium at baseline or after initiating vitamin D therapy.

### Limitations of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT imaging scans in persistent primary hyperparathyroidism [^113MBTaZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Using hospital records, we identified 19 consecutive patients who required reoperative parathyroidectomy for persistent hyperparathyroidism and who had undergone parathyroid localization studies with Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT before surgery. These patients included 14 women and 5 men, with a mean age of 55 ± 12 years at diagnosis, who had undergone between one and three unsuccessful earlier neck explorations. Sixteen of the 19 patients had their initial surgery and earlier reoperations, if applicable, at other institutions and were referred to our unit for further workup before reoperative parathyroidectomy.

We compared these patients with 23 patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism due to single gland disease who also had a Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT scan prior to initial surgery. These were 21 women and 2 men, with a mean age of 59 ± 12 years at diagnosis. All surgical procedures were undertaken by two surgeons with considerable experience in endocrine surgery.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available regarding evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. To summarize these developments, an international group consisting of over 50 experts in various aspects of PHPT was convened.

This paper presents the results of the task force assigned to review information on the management of PHPT. For this task force, two questions were systematically reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. This report summarizes the results of that methodological review and expands them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology.

Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature summarized in this paper provide the most comprehensive information available at the time of writing. A panel of experts assessed the last set of international guidelines in light of newer data and evaluated the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background for the guidelines report.

### Calciphylaxis due to hyperparathyroidism [^111mvYdQ]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To discuss when and how to workup calciphylaxis for early diagnosis and to delineate medical versus surgical management of the disease, the study involved a review of evidence-based medical literature on calciphylaxis due to primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Calciphylaxis is usually associated with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. However, it can also occur in the absence of chronic renal failure and has been reported in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma. Calciphylaxis occurs when the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood exceed their solubility level, leading to calcium-phosphate deposits in arteries that compromise the vasculature. These ischemic changes result in plaque-like lesions that progress to painful nodules. Diagnosis is based on physical examination, laboratory, and histopathologic findings.

- **Medical management**: When medical therapy has failed in the setting of secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism with calciphylaxis, parathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment.
- **Surgical management**: In primary hyperparathyroidism, early recognition and aggressive wound care with debridement are important. Resection of the offending parathyroid gland should be strongly considered.

Early detection is critical to the successful management of calciphylaxis. Although medical therapy can be effective, surgical resection of the diseased parathyroid glands can be curative and potentially life-saving.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the third international workshop [^112xV7fq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

The report addresses the common clinical problem of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and aims to guide the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

- **Participants**: Interested professional societies selected representatives for the consensus committee and funded a one-day meeting. A subgroup of the committee set the program and developed key questions for review. Consensus was established at a subsequent closed meeting, and conclusions were circulated to the participating societies.

- **Evidence**: Each question was addressed through a relevant literature search on PubMed, with data presented for discussion at the group meeting.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was achieved during a group meeting where statements were prepared by all authors. Accuracy was ensured by the diagnosis subgroup and representatives from the participating societies.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that: 1) Reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) Second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in diagnosing PHPT; 3) DNA sequence testing can be useful in cases of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia; 4) Normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation with hypercalcemia; 5) Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be measured, and vitamin D insufficiency should be treated as part of any management course; and 6) The estimated glomerular filtration rate should be used to determine the level of care required.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: A structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculating adjusted calcium, and a careful history should be taken to assess dietary calcium intake and the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review, we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum calcium levels are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria, as well as vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common.

Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended for patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum calcium levels, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Sensipar [^117254cz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sixty-seven patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), who met criteria for parathyroidectomy based on corrected total serum calcium levels (> 11.3 mg/dL [2.82 mmol/L] and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL [3.12 mmol/L]), but were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy, participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 33 patients were randomized to receive Sensipar, and 34 patients were randomized to receive a placebo. The mean age of the patients was 72 years; 52% were female, 61% were Caucasian, and 5% were Black.

The study began with a 12-week titration phase, followed by a 16-week efficacy-assessment phase. Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range. During the efficacy period, a significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet-treated patients, compared with placebo-treated patients, achieved a mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (≤ 10.3 mg/dL [2.57 mmol/L], 75.8% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) and a ≥ 1 mg/dL [0.25 mmol/L] decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (84.8% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001). The median dose of Sensipar at the completion of the study was 60 mg/day.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Ndujv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, patients who do not meet surgical criteria, cannot undergo, or refuse surgery, must be managed medically.

Medical management of PHPT involves the continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease, and management of hypercalcemia and renal stone disease.

### Sensipar [^111KFxga]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monitoring for hypocalcemia**: Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism with CKD on dialysis and every 2 months for patients with parathyroid carcinoma or primary hyperparathyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

	- For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis, if serum calcium falls below 8.4 mg/dL but remains above 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium. If serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL and/or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved. Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Limitations of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT imaging scans in persistent primary hyperparathyroidism [^115ZWPqa]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the predictive value of technetium 99m sestamibi single emission computed tomography (Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT) for localizing pathological parathyroid glands before a first parathyroidectomy (PTx) is 83–100%. Data are scarce in patients undergoing reoperative parathyroidectomy for persistent hyperparathyroidism. The aim of the present study was to determine the value of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT in localizing residual hyperactive parathyroid tissue in patients with persistent PHPT after the initial excision of one or more pathological glands.

- **Method**: We retrospectively evaluated the localizing accuracy of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT scans in 19 consecutive patients with persistent PHPT who had a scan before reoperative parathyroidectomy. We used 23 patients with sporadic PHPT who had a scan before initial surgery as controls.

- **Results**: In patients with persistent PHPT, Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT accurately localized a pathological parathyroid gland in 33% of cases before reoperative parathyroidectomy, compared to 61% before the first PTx for sporadic PHPT. The Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT scan accurately localized intra-thyroidal glands in 2 of 7 cases and a mediastinal gland in 1 of 3 cases either before initial or reoperative parathyroidectomy.

- **Conclusions**: Our data suggest that the accuracy of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT in localizing residual hyperactive glands is significantly lower before reoperative parathyroidectomy for persistent PHPT than before initial surgery for sporadic PHPT. These findings should be taken into consideration in the preoperative workup.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^117UPCBt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

A key question remains as to whether normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) should be considered a different entity from hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (hPHPT), or if they can be managed using a single approach. While studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently from hPHPT, such as with a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease, studies have also shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardized approach to managing primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate, and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualized and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counseling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive outcomes (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse outcomes (risk of surgical complications) that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction, and occasionally, if there is vitamin D deficiency.

- **Limitations of the literature**: Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This issue is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should address this imbalance to provide more comprehensive insights.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: An update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood due to a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism.

Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

Given the available data and the overall lack of consensus regarding optimal management, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Clinical guidelines and PTH measurement: Does assay generation matter [^111g74q9]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling. It is metabolized into PTH fragments, which are measured to varying extents by PTH assays of different generations due to differences in recognized fragments and a lack of assay standardization. PTH is measured in the workup of several conditions, and clinical guidelines provide recommendations concerning these measurements.

This review provides an overview of the impact of differences between PTH assays, applying distinct clinical guidelines for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and the perioperative use of PTH measurements. Guidelines address PTH measurement in different ways, recommending either trend monitoring, the use of a fold increase of the upper reference limit, or an absolute PTH cutoff value.

For classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the type of PTH assay used will not affect diagnosis or management because the precise concentration of PTH is less relevant. In chronic kidney disease, the guideline recommends treating secondary hyperparathyroidism above a twofold to ninefold PTH increase, which will result in different clinical decisions depending on the assay used. For patients after bariatric surgery, guidelines state absolute cutoff values for PTH, but the impact of different generation assays is unknown because direct comparison of PTH assays has never been performed. During parathyroid surgery, PTH measurements with a third-generation assay reflect treatment success more rapidly than second-generation assays. Increased awareness among clinicians regarding these differences is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114aSg3C]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

At Östersund Hospital, and in most Swedish laboratories, normal values of albumin-corrected serum calcium range from 2.15 to 2.50 mmol/L, and PTH from 1.9 to 6.9 pmol/L. The true ratio between PTH and calcium that correlates with histologically proven primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is still to be established. There are studies including normocalcaemic cases (calcium ≥ 2.1 mmol/L and PTH ≥ 6.9 pmol/L) as well as normohormonal cases (calcium ≥ 2.78 mmol/L and PTH < 4.2 pmol/L). Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that a significant disturbance of calcium homeostasis exists when calcium levels are in the upper part of the normal range together with non-suppressed PTH levels.

To reduce the number of false positive pHPT patients in the final cohort, we have tried to exclude all patients with a plausible other cause of the disturbed balance of serum calcium and PTH. In total, 156 patients were excluded due to possible differential diagnoses during the different steps of exclusion. A suspicion of a differential diagnosis derived from the patients' records or list of medications was deemed reason enough for exclusion. Of course, this approach causes a high risk of excluding patients with mild pHPT. On the other hand, false positive cases are more easily eliminated. The 82 patients not being cared for properly were all asked to voluntarily participate in the coming studies. Only 7 patients declined further participation.

The most common differential diagnosis was secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) due to renal failure. This was expected, as renal failure is a common disorder and the prevalence of sHPT increases with the degree of renal impairment.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114xjQLs]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

- **Methods**: The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. In 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, conducting new blood tests, and performing clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists, and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

- **Conclusion**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116eR25K]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data was collected from 23 patients diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) by an endocrine surgeon between 2016 and 2017. The cohort was derived from a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital for patients presenting with presumed pHPT during 2014 who had not been evaluated by a specialist. Analysis was conducted on 15 of the 23 patients.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^115q72UJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A surprisingly large portion (n = 82) of the 365 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to specialists, despite the absence of differential diagnosis or other reasons to exclude the patient from treatment. However, eleven patients had a long-term plan of follow-up or were diagnosed with pHPT by the physician ordering the initial blood tests. A total of 42 patients underwent new blood sampling, and 32 of them still exhibited an imbalance of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Ultimately, 23 patients (28% of those not referred to a specialist) were formally diagnosed with pHPT by an endocrine surgeon.

It is important to remember that patients were excluded stepwise without further investigation, which suggests that the number of patients with established pHPT but without proper medical management might be higher. Patients with mild pHPT will be subjected to further characterization regarding symptoms and complications due to pHPT, and the results will be published in a forthcoming report.

### Incidental detection of brain metastases from a pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma at 18 F-fluorocholine PET/CT in a context of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115BVVTc]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2024). High credibility.

This 65-year-old man, suffering from hypercalcemia in the context of hyperparathyroidism treated with calcimimetics, was referred to our institution to perform an 18 F-fluorocholine PET/CT to localize the pathological parathyroid gland(s). We incidentally discovered brain metastatic pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in addition to a parathyroid adenoma. This case illustrates the value of FCH PET/CT in the hyperparathyroidism workup, even under calcimimetic treatment, as well as the potential of FCH PET/CT to reveal occult malignancies.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1125F8xM]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A cohort of 82 patients was identified, all with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) according to preset criteria and with no other explanation for the disturbed calcium homeostasis. Of these 82 patients, nine had been diagnosed with pHPT and/or had monitoring planned in a primary care centre.

Five patients had both serum PTH and albumin-corrected serum calcium above the reference intervals. Conversely, a total of 27 patients had both PTH and albumin-corrected serum calcium within the reference ranges. Eight cases were normocalcaemic with high serum PTH, while 42 individuals were hypercalcaemic with PTH within the reference interval.

- **Data collection**: Data were collected during 2014, and none of the patients had been assessed by a specialist. The cohort data and distribution of albumin-corrected serum calcium and serum PTH were derived from a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital.

- **Figure representation**: Figure 2 plots the distribution of albumin-corrected serum calcium and serum PTH in the 82-patient cohort. The patients are sorted by age. The black dotted lines represent the upper limits of the normal range for albumin-corrected serum calcium (= 2.50 mmol/L) and serum PTH (= 6.9 pmol/L).

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1137a78P]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A total of 82 patients with plausible primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to a specialist. Cases with differential diagnoses or other explanations for the imbalance in calcium homeostasis were excluded methodically after answering a survey and based on the results of new blood tests and an assessment by an experienced endocrine surgeon.

A second sampling of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), ionized calcium, and creatinine was arranged for the remaining cohort of 45 patients. Ionized calcium was chosen for these tests to provide a more specific diagnosis of pHPT in a low-range hypercalcemia as compared to the formerly used albumin-corrected serum calcium values. Limits for exclusion were set at the same levels for PTH (≥ 4.3 pmol/L) and creatinine (< 175 mmol/L) as in the first inclusion criteria, and the limit for ionized calcium was set at 1.26 mmol/L (reference 1.13–1.30 mmol/L), corresponding to an albumin-corrected calcium of 2.40 mmol/L. All criteria had to be met before patients continued to be included in the study. Four patients declined further participation. Patients not fulfilling the criteria after this new blood sample (n = 12) were offered one repeated testing. Ten patients did not meet the criteria this second time or declined further samplings and had to be excluded. If they fulfilled the criteria at this second new sampling, they were included in the study (n = 2).

Patients in the final study cohort (n = 32) were given outpatient appointments at the Endocrine Surgery Unit of the Department of Surgery, Östersund Hospital. At this point, two patients declined further participation in the study.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in cases managed without surgery, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend surgical intervention for patients exhibiting any of the following conditions while under monitoring:

- **Serum calcium levels**: Consistently greater than 1 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal (ULN).
- **Low trauma fracture**: Occurrence of fractures from minimal trauma.
- **Kidney stones**: Development of kidney stones.
- **Bone mineral density**: Significant reduction to a T-score of ≤ -2.5 at any site.
- **Renal function**: Significant reduction in creatinine clearance (CrCl).

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111wk6QT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Once considered rare, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is now recognized as a common disease of mineral metabolism. The recent increase in its incidence is primarily attributed to routine serum calcium determination and measurement of calcium and parathyroid hormone during osteoporosis investigations. The Fourth International Workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism did not specifically focus on the global epidemiology of PHPT. This narrative review intends to fill this knowledge gap, particularly in the context of hypercalcemic PHPT. It is based on literature from 1980 to 2020, utilizing databases such as PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. Additionally, this section highlights recent advances in the pathophysiological aspects and genetics of PHPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, contributing to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms. A large portion of patients who present with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms at presentation if these are properly searched for. It is still not clear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, but some conservatively treated patients will develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcemia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The only definitive treatment is the surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid, and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured (defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH) after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite the low risk of complications with surgery, the often benign progress of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered. After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, medications, and age should be considered.

In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT.

### Thymoma and parathyroid adenoma: False-positive imaging and intriguing laboratory test results [^117HYoxq]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH)-secreting thymomas are an exceedingly rare entity. A PTH-secreting thymoma was discovered in the workup of a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism. A concomitant parathyroid adenoma was removed from the same patient. We present the intriguing clinical course and review the literature on this rare entity. In addition, we discuss the use of scanning with technetium Tc 99m sestamibi, the PTH assay, and cervical ultrasonography in the workup of a parathyroid adenoma.

- **Observations**: Scanning with technetium Tc 99m sestamibi demonstrated false-positive uptake of the mediastinal thymoma and false-negative uptake of the true cervical parathyroid adenoma. After removal of the thymoma, the parathyroid adenoma demonstrated appropriate uptake on a follow-up scan. After removal of the parathyroid adenoma, the hyperparathyroidism was cured.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Given the extremely rare incidence of a PTH-secreting thymoma with a concomitant parathyroid adenoma, we do not recommend alterations in the diagnostic algorithm for primary hyperparathyroidism. However, in this case, the need for two separate operations may have been avoided by obtaining an ultrasonogram to further explore the findings on the technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scan. We recommend that both studies be considered in unclear cases of primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Limitations of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT imaging scans in persistent primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Hq8Qw]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the predictive value of technetium 99m sestamibi single emission computed tomography (Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT) for localizing pathological parathyroid glands before a first parathyroidectomy (PTx) is 83–100%. Data are scarce in patients undergoing reoperative parathyroidectomy for persistent hyperparathyroidism. The aim of the present study was to determine the value of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT in localizing residual hyperactive parathyroid tissue in patients with persistent primary hyperparathyroidism after the initial excision of one or more pathological glands.

- **Method**: We retrospectively evaluated the localizing accuracy of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT scans in 19 consecutive patients with persistent PHPT who had a scan before reoperative parathyroidectomy. We used as controls 23 patients with sporadic PHPT who had a scan before initial surgery.

- **Results**: In patients with persistent PHPT, Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT accurately localized a pathological parathyroid gland in 33% of cases before reoperative parathyroidectomy, compared to 61% before first PTx for sporadic PHPT. The Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT scan accurately localized intra-thyroidal glands in 2 of 7 cases and a mediastinal gland in 1 of 3 cases either before initial or reoperative parathyroidectomy.

- **Conclusions**: Our data suggest that the accuracy of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT in localizing residual hyperactive glands is significantly lower before reoperative parathyroidectomy for persistent PHPT than before initial surgery for sporadic PHPT. These findings should be taken into consideration in the preoperative workup.

### Failure to diagnose and treat hyperparathyroidism among patients with hypercalcemia: Opportunities for intervention at the patient and physician level to increase surgical referral [^111Pk86F]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, but the reasons for these deficiencies have not been described. The purpose of this study was to identify reasons for underdiagnosis and undertreatment of hyperparathyroidism that could be addressed by targeted interventions.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified 3,200 patients with hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 10.5 mg/dL) who had parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels evaluated at our institution from 2011 to 2016. We randomly sampled 60 patients and divided them into three groups based on their PTH levels. Two independent reviewers examined clinical notes and diagnostic data to identify reasons for delayed diagnosis or referral for treatment.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 16.5 years, 68% were women, and 55% were white. Fifty percent of patients had ≥ 1 elevated calcium level that was missed by their primary care provider. Hypercalcemia was frequently attributed to causes other than hyperparathyroidism, including diuretics (12%), calcium supplements (12%), dehydration (5%), and renal dysfunction (3%). Even when calcium and PTH were both elevated, the diagnosis was missed or delayed in 40% of patients. For 7% of patients, a nonsurgeon stated that surgery offered no benefit; 22% of patients were offered medical treatment or observation, and 8% opted not to see a surgeon. Only 20% of patients were referred for surgical evaluation, and they waited a median of 16 months before seeing a surgeon.

- **Conclusion**: To address common causes for delayed diagnosis and treatment of hyperparathyroidism, we must identify and target specific areas for improvement at both the patient and physician levels.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in an adolescent presenting with genu valgus progressing to extensive bone disease; a case report [^114AUjnJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism in adolescents is rare compared to that of adults. While it is commonly recognized in adults with screening during the asymptomatic period, adolescents are commonly diagnosed when they are symptomatic. However, symptoms are usually generalized and non-specific due to hypercalcemia. These include bone pain, asthenia, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, and lethargy. In some parts of the world, bone disease, including fractures and deformities, as well as renal complications, have been commonly reported even in younger patients.

Though bone disease has been described as a presenting feature of primary hyperparathyroidism in adolescents, it is extremely uncommon for it to present with genu valgus. In fact, primary hyperparathyroidism is not considered in the diagnostic workup of an adolescent with genu valgus. There are several case reports of adolescents with primary hyperparathyroidism presenting with genu valgus; however, fractures have not been a common manifestation in them, and they were noted to have hypercalcemia at the time of presentation. We report an adolescent who initially presented with genu valgus and normocalcemia, progressing to severe bone disease with multiple fractures despite having mild hypercalcemia.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines; they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.
