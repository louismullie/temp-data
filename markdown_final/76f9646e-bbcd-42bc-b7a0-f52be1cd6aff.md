## Question

Vaginal pessaries

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vaginal pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse, specifically seeking a synthesis of the evidence and expert consensus on their use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what pessaries are and the strength of evidence supporting their use. Then, I should verify indications and who should be offered a pessary. Next, I will examine fitting strategies, including device selection and risk factors for failure. After that, I need to check management protocols for follow-up and self-care, and then address sexual activity considerations. I will now examine complication recognition and management, including vaginal estrogen and biopsy thresholds. Finally, I should consider special populations and training/system issues, and close with counseling points and practical recommendations anchored in guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm what a pessary is and how solid the evidence base is. Pessaries are silicone or polymeric intravaginal support devices that mechanically restore anatomy and relieve prolapse symptoms, with most data being observational and consensus-based rather than high-quality randomized trials, which means practice often relies on expert guidance where evidence is sparse [^115H3jai] [^111iWYXD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify who should be offered a pessary, and the consistent theme is that all symptomatic women should be offered a pessary among initial options, including those deferring surgery, those medically unfit, women planning pregnancy, and those already pregnant, with guidelines explicitly supporting pessaries as a first-line conservative option for POP and for preconception planning when prolapse is symptomatic [^11661tVx] [^1149yywH] [^111eqzBf] [^112GRL2b].

> Wait, let me verify contraindications and cautions before fitting. Active pelvic infection and undiagnosed vaginal bleeding should be addressed first, and conditions like vaginal mesh erosion, severe postradiation scarring, nonhealing ulcers, and severe vaginal infection warrant caution with shared decision-making and closer follow-up if a pessary is used [^112mq12x].

> Next, I should review fitting strategy. Let me think about the "smallest effective device" principle, where starting with a ring pessary is reasonable because rings are versatile across compartments and stages, and if a support pessary fails, a space-filling pessary such as Gellhorn, donut, or cube may succeed, acknowledging that device selection is largely experiential rather than trial-based [^115MubwG] [^114KWGbR].

> I need to ensure I incorporate risk factors for fitting failure. Prior hysterectomy, prior prolapse surgery, short vaginal length, large genital hiatus, high BMI, and stress urinary incontinence can reduce success, but I should double-check that even with these risks, a trial is still reasonable since failure simply pivots care toward surgery rather than precluding it [^115uS13Q] [^115pfLDf].

> Let me verify follow-up cadence. Most consensus statements recommend an initial check within 1–4 weeks after fitting because many failures occur early, then routine maintenance every 3–6 months for clinic-based care, whereas self-managing patients can extend to 6–12 month reviews, and importantly, extending intervals beyond 6 months may increase complications, so individualized plans should balance access and safety [^111hdYtV] [^11348LiA] [^114N39B7] [^116Ly8Pi].

> I will now examine self-management. Wait, I should confirm that self-care is acceptable and safe, and the TOPSY randomized trial supports that self-management is noninferior on quality of life and reduces complications compared with clinic-based care, with about half of patients able to learn and sustain self-care and improved cost-effectiveness, which argues for routine training offers where feasible [^116kNxfL] [^115jTsAr] [^1122jbxL].

> Next, I should review sexual activity considerations. I should confirm whether intercourse with a pessary is safe, and consensus allows that ring or dish pessaries may be left in place if comfortable, whereas space-filling devices like Gellhorn or cube are often removed for intercourse, and overall sexual function tends not to worsen and may improve in successful users [^1168mdjh] [^113JzHRk] [^112pa7vq].

> Let me consider complications systematically. Common issues include vaginal discharge in about 30% and superficial abrasions, while serious events such as erosion, granulation tissue, and fistula are rare and typically linked to neglect, so I should ensure a standardized epithelial injury classification is used and that we screen for epithelial changes at each visit [^116tJhSY] [^115PyXGT] [^115cLuoF] [^1122jbxL].

> Hold on, I should verify management of epithelial injuries. For erythema or superficial abrasion, reinsertion with counseling is acceptable, for erosion or ulceration I should remove the pessary for roughly 4 weeks and arrange reassessment, for granulation tissue I can consider chemical cautery or expectant management, and for any persistent or suspicious erosion beyond 4 weeks, biopsy should be considered to exclude neoplasia even though pessaries are not considered carcinogenic [^112K3TNV] [^115rXtPC] [^115cLuoF] [^115rbDpo].

> I need to check the role of vaginal estrogen. Therapeutic estrogen is reasonable in women with erosions or atrophic mucosa and may aid refitting, and while it may reduce discontinuation, evidence does not consistently show fewer abrasions, so I should discuss risks, benefits, and costs, especially when supplies are limited or expensive [^112NaLaT] [^1148hGSv].

> Let me reconsider device selection after an erosion. After healing, switching to a different size or type often improves tolerance, and I should document that strategy in the plan because repeated pressure at the same site risks recurrence [^114Hdty8] [^112cjWPh].

> Next, I should review special populations. In older adults, continuation at 1 year is higher but self-care can be challenging, so family involvement and clear maintenance plans are essential, and although pessaries are often first-line, a meaningful proportion ultimately proceed to surgery, so expectations should be set accordingly [^112eYTKz] [^115KB5KQ].

> For women of reproductive age or those planning pregnancy, I should confirm that pessaries are appropriate and can be used through conception and pregnancy, aligning with ACOG guidance on offering pessaries in symptomatic patients who wish to become pregnant, which supports fertility-sparing conservative management [^1149yywH].

> I will now examine urinary symptoms and voiding. Let me double-check that postvoid residual should be assessed when voiding dysfunction is suspected, as apical or anterior prolapse can impair emptying and pessary placement may unmask or alter urinary dynamics, so documenting PVR at baseline and with new symptoms is prudent [^112papV1].

> But wait, what about stress urinary incontinence? Pessaries can unmask occult stress incontinence, so I should counsel that new leakage may occur after prolapse support and that options like an incontinence dish or concurrent conservative therapy can be considered, balancing symptom trade-offs [^117Wjh2t].

> I should confirm system-level issues. Training and practice vary widely, many clinicians learn informally, and consensus calls for standardized competencies, with UK and North American surveys highlighting gaps and the need for formal curricula, which I should advocate locally to ensure safe, equitable access [^113bAiGi] [^1128k4U4] [^111iWYXD].

> Let me synthesize counseling points. I should explain that pessaries improve bulge and urinary symptoms in most users and enhance quality of life, that risks are generally low with adherence to follow-up, that discharge is common but often noninfectious, that self-management is feasible and cost-saving, and that device choice may need iteration over time as anatomy and preferences change [^113amfjc] [^116tJhSY] [^116kNxfL] [^112cjWPh].

> Finally, I need to ensure my practical recommendations align with guidelines. Offer a pessary to all symptomatic women, start with a ring and escalate to space-filling devices if needed, reassess within 1–4 weeks, schedule maintenance every 3–6 months for clinic-based care and 6–12 months for self-care, treat epithelial injuries with temporary removal and consider estrogen, and prioritize training pathways so more patients can self-manage safely and efficiently [^111eqzBf] [^11348LiA] [^114N39B7] [^116m9Ujn].

Pessaries are **silicone devices** inserted into the vagina to support pelvic organs in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) [^115H3jai] [^116m9Ujn]. They are a **first-line, non-surgical option** that improves symptoms and quality of life [^113amfjc], with fitting success rates of 41–96.6% and continuation rates of 21–97.7% at 1 year [^113m3KHm]. Pessaries are safe for long-term use [^111Gy9hR] with minimal complications when managed properly [^113m3KHm]; common issues include vaginal discharge, irritation, and rare erosions or infection [^116tJhSY] [^111G8VDV]. Self-management is feasible and reduces complications and costs [^116kNxfL], and sexual activity is generally safe with appropriate counseling [^1168mdjh]. Regular follow-up every 3–6 months [^11348LiA] is recommended, with vaginal estrogen for atrophic tissue and individualized care for high-risk patients [^112NaLaT] [^112mq12x].

---

## Types of pessaries

Pessaries come in **multiple shapes and sizes** [^115MubwG]; selection is individualized to prolapse type, severity, and patient anatomy:

| **Pessary type** | **Description** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Ring (with or without support) | Circular, flexible silicone ring | - Most common <br/> - Suitable for all prolapse types and stages [^115MubwG] |
| Gellhorn | Dome-shaped with a stem | - Severe prolapse <br/> - Particularly useful for posterior compartment defects [^114CrCKU] |
| Donut | Circular, space-filling device | - Severe prolapse <br/> - Useful for large vaginal vault defects [^notfound] |
| Cube | Soft, space-filling cube | - Severe prolapse <br/> - Requires frequent removal and cleaning [^111PkNMF] |
| Incontinence dish | Ring with a knob to support the urethra | Stress urinary incontinence [^1125Q6uh] |

---

## Indications for pessary use

Pessaries are indicated for women with symptomatic POP, particularly those who:

- Are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities or personal preference [^112Etweg].
- Desire fertility preservation or are pregnant [^1149yywH].
- Wish to delay or avoid surgery [^115jFrbm].
- Have recurrent prolapse after surgical repair [^114p7n5V].

---

## Benefits of pessary use

Pessaries provide **several clinical benefits**:

- **Symptom relief**: Significant improvement in prolapse symptoms, including vaginal bulge, urinary urgency, and stress incontinence [^113amfjc] [^113m3KHm].
- **Quality of life**: Enhanced quality of life and self-esteem, restoring daily function [^111eqzBf] [^116m9Ujn].
- **Non-surgical**: Minimally invasive alternative to surgery with reversible effects [^116m9Ujn] [^11661tVx].
- **Cost-effective**: Lower short-term costs compared to surgical interventions [^115Gbder] [^114bbvfp].

---

## Potential risks and complications

While generally safe, pessaries may cause **complications**, particularly without regular follow-up [^113m3KHm]:

- **Vaginal discharge**: Common, usually non-infectious [^116tJhSY].
- **Irritation and discomfort**: Minor irritation or discomfort may occur [^1152BzrB].
- **Erosions and ulcerations**: Rare, typically with prolonged use without maintenance [^115cLuoF].
- **Infection**: Rare, usually associated with poor hygiene or neglected pessaries [^notfound].
- **Impaired sexual function**: Generally not worsened; some report improvement [^112pa7vq] [^113JzHRk].

---

## Patient selection and fitting considerations

Successful pessary use depends on **careful patient selection and fitting**:

- **Anatomical factors**: Short vaginal length, large genital hiatus, and posterior compartment involvement may predict fitting failure [^113m3KHm] [^115pfLDf].
- **Patient factors**: Age, sexual activity, and previous pelvic surgery influence success and continuation rates [^113m3KHm] [^115uS13Q].
- **Fitting process**: Trial-and-error approach to find the smallest effective size and appropriate type [^112Etweg] [^115MubwG].

---

## Management and follow-up care

Regular follow-up is **essential** to ensure safety and efficacy:

- **Initial follow-up**: Within 1–4 weeks after fitting [^111hdYtV].
- **Routine maintenance**: Every 3–6 months for clinic-based care [^11348LiA] [^112de5zm].
- **Self-management**: Patients may remove, clean, and reinsert pessaries nightly to every 6 months, with annual clinician follow-up [^111ZCFde] [^114N39B7].
- **Vaginal estrogen**: Recommended for atrophic vaginal tissue to reduce irritation and erosion risk [^112NaLaT] [^115rXtPC].

---

## Impact on sexual function and quality of life

Pessaries **generally do not negatively impact sexual function** and may improve it by reducing prolapse symptoms and enhancing body image [^112pa7vq] [^113JzHRk]. Quality of life **significantly improves** with pessary use, with reductions in prolapse-related distress and improved daily function [^113amfjc] [^111eqzBf].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Pessaries are safe and effective during pregnancy, providing symptom relief without adverse fetal effects [^notfound].
- **Anticoagulant use**: Increased risk of vaginal bleeding; more frequent follow-up recommended [^111kfjMF].
- **High-risk patients**: Caution advised in patients with vaginal mesh erosion, severe scarring, or nonhealing ulcers [^112mq12x].

---

## Patient satisfaction and adherence

Patient satisfaction with pessaries is **high**, particularly when self-management is feasible [^112Etweg]. Adherence is influenced by comfort, ease of use, and the absence of significant complications [^113m3KHm].

---

Pessaries are a **safe, effective, and cost-efficient** conservative treatment for pelvic organ prolapse, offering significant symptom relief and quality-of-life improvements. Regular follow-up, appropriate patient selection, and self-management strategies are key to optimizing outcomes and minimizing complications [^113amfjc] [^116m9Ujn] [^113m3KHm] [^1134ojou] [^116kNxfL].

### Adherence to support pessary in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse: a retrospective study conducted among 1, 371 women [^114bbvfp]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a relatively common medical condition, and the prevalence increases with age. Studies indicate that approximately 30–40% of women suffer from POP to some extent. Symptoms include vaginal, defecatory, urinary, and sexual symptoms. Indication for treatment is based on the severity of symptoms and is individualized depending on prolapse stage and patient preference. The choice of treatment can be surgical or nonsurgical. Nonsurgical treatments involve pessaries, pelvic floor muscle exercise and vaginal estrogen treatment. Compared with surgery, a vaginal pessary is a cheap and minimally invasive treatment, and can be inserted by a health care professional and maintained by the patient. Although pessaries are effective in reducing POP-related symptoms, some women are not candidates for pessary use owing to personal preferences and complications such as erosions, discomfort, vaginal discharge, and improper pessary fitting. Although surgery has a high success rate in minimizing POP, it is associated with a re-operation rate of up to 30%. According to the clinical guidelines from the Danish Urogynecological Association, women should be offered pessary treatment before proceeding to surgery. The aim of this single-center retrospective descriptive study is to investigate the reasons for discontinuation of pessary use and assess factors associated with adherence to pessary treatment in women with POP.

Vaginal pessary use and management — research needs emphasize that many statements are primarily based on expert opinion and further research is needed, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and best practice guidelines for clinician follow-up protocols, self-care cleaning schedules, and office follow-up. Guidance gaps include reliance on manufacturers for cleaning and reuse/sterilization and a lack of standard protocols, and additional research on vaginal estrogen is needed, including studies on pessary-related vaginal lesions and the best frequency, duration, and form of vaginal estrogen. The page notes early work on the vaginal microbiome of pessary users but that it is yet to be determined how estrogen and other vaginal products may affect the microbiome, and it also cites a few case reports implicating the pessary as a cause of vaginal and cervical cancers. The authors raise needs to track patients lost to follow-up and to consider telehealth for interval management to reduce costs among select self-managing patients. Considerable discussion addressed classification of mechanical vaginal epithelial injuries, with consensus on terminology for 4 levels of vaginal tissue effects but little evidence for best treatment protocols, and research needs include when to use vaginal estrogen, when to use a pessary "holiday" and its duration, use of chemical cautery, follow-up time frames, and whether products such as ospemifene and prasterone offer benefits. Additional questions include whether newer pessary designs could reduce complications, such as the 3-dimensional printing technology described by Barsky et al, and whether patient factors such as medications, aging, or genetics can predict the risk of vaginal erosions.

### Vaginal pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence: a multiprofessional survey of practice [^116XB4nD]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Vaginal pessaries may offer symptomatic improvement for women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) or urinary incontinence (UI). This study aimed to investigate multidisciplinary perspectives on vaginal pessary use in clinical practice and to understand the service organisation of vaginal pessary care for women with these conditions.

Methods

A pretested, anonymous survey was e-mailed to members of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the Association for Continence Advice and the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Women's Health in the UK.

Results

A total of 678 respondents, from medical, nursing and physiotherapy professions, consented to survey participation and provided useable data (response rate 20.7%). Doctors were significantly more likely to report involvement in pessary care than nurses or physiotherapists. Respondents were optimistic about the success of pessary treatment; however, a lower proportion reported using pessaries for UI than for prolapse. The majority of respondents used ring pessaries and shelf pessaries, most recipients were older women, and commonly an indication for fitting a pessary was that the woman was unfit for surgery. More than 15% of respondents providing pessary care had not received training. Follow-up services for women with pessaries varied considerably.

Conclusions

The variation in pessary care delivery and organisation requires further study in order to maximise efficiency and effectiveness. The development of nurse- or physiotherapist-led models of care may be appropriate, but the effectiveness of such models requires testing. Furthermore, to potentially improve outcomes of pessary care, a greater understanding of the availability, content and process of training may be warranted.

### Self-management of vaginal pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse [^115jTsAr]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have demonstrated that self-managing vaginal pessaries is acceptable to many women and represents an improvement in experience in managing their prolapse symptoms compared with doctor management. In addition, self-management is cost effective both for the hospital trust delivering the service and the commissioners.

Q31 high-risk conditions for pessary use — caution is recommended as we recommend caution when considering pessary use in patients with vaginal mesh erosion, severe postradiation scarring, nonhealing ulcers, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, and severe vaginal infection; the writing group recommends that clinicians avoid using pessaries in women who have a history of these conditions; if a pessary is used in these patients, clinicians should inform patients of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to pessary use and consider more frequent follow-up; patients with undiagnosed vaginal bleeding or vaginal infection should be evaluated before pessary fitting, and if vaginal bleeding occurs after pessary placement, the clinician should evaluate all potential sources and may consider obtaining an endometrial biopsy or pelvic ultrasonography.

Abstract

Over the past 50 years, pessary use has increased in popularity and has become an essential pelvic organ prolapse (POP) management tool. However, evidence is lacking to define care standardization, including pessary fitting, routine maintenance, and management of pessary-related complications. This clinical consensus statement (CCS) on vaginal pessary use and management for POP reflects statements drafted by content experts from the American Urogynecologic Society and Society of Urologic Nurses and Associates. The purpose of this CCS is to identify areas of expert consensus and nonconsensus regarding pessary fitting, follow-up, and management of pessary complications to improve the safety and quality of care where evidence is currently limited. The American Urogynecologic Society and Society of Urologic Nurses and Associates' vaginal pessary for POP writing group used a modified Delphi process to assess statements that were evaluated for consensus after a structured literature search. A total of 31 statements were assessed and divided into 3 categories: (1) fitting and follow-up, (2) complications, and 3) quality of life. Of the 31 statements that were assessed, all statements reached consensus after 2 rounds of the Delphi survey. This CCS document hopefully serves as a first step toward standardization of pessary care, but the writing group acknowledges that improved research will grow the base of knowledge and evidence providing clinicians a foundation to manage pessary care effectively and confidently.

Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Nonsurgical management of pelvic organ prolapse with vaginal support pessaries — clinical role and guidance gaps are highlighted. Vaginal support pessaries are considered first-line treatment in the nonsurgical management of women with POP and have been demonstrated to improve quality of life by reducing bothersome symptoms; however, a recent Cochrane review demonstrated only 4 high-quality articles of efficacy. Physicians and advanced practice providers in various specialties in the United States fit and manage pessaries, and the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) and the Society of Urologic Nurses and Associates (SUNA) recommend that expert guidance and insight into pessary practices should be used when high-level evidence is insufficient. At present, guidance for pessary management has fallen to manufacturers and expert opinion, leading to significant variation in recommendations for care.

Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

AUGS–SUNA clinical consensus — clinic-based pessary maintenance for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) notes that the frequency of follow-up varies, with intervals ranging from every 3 months to 2 years. There is no evidence that shorter visit intervals improve long-term success rates or reduce the frequency of serious complications, and randomized trials reported that complication rates did not vary between 3- and 6-month follow-up and that 12 versus 24 weeks were equivalent. Based on the available evidence, the writing group recommends pessary maintenance visits every 3–6 months, considering the patient's history and pessary type, and in the Delphi survey 75% (6 participants) strongly agreed and 25% (2 participants) weakly agreed with this statement. The type of pessary used may influence follow-up interval recommendations, and cube pessaries may require closer follow-up because of the potential for vaginal erosions and bleeding.

### Vaginal pessaries for treatment of pelvic organ prolapse in elderly women [^11172CTs]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common clinical condition that is highly prevalent in the geriatric female population. The condition can have substantial negative influence on multiple symptom and quality-of-life parameters. There are various treatment options for POP, including observation, pessary placement, and surgical treatments with either vaginal reconstruction or colpocleisis resulting in vaginal vault closure. This review examines current literature about pessary use for treatment of POP in elderly women.

Recent Findings

Pessary use appears to be successful for many women and is often associated with improvements in various clinical parameters, including decreased sensation of vaginal bulge and enhanced quality of life. Some patients may experience improvements in bladder or bowel symptoms, although a small percentage may develop new urinary incontinence, constipation, or other defecation problems. Complications of pessary use are generally minor and can usually be successfully treated with targeted therapy such as vaginal estrogen supplementation. Continuity of clinical care is important to help maintain clinical success and prevent potential complications.

Summary

Pessaries are a viable conservative form of treatment for POP for many older women. Pessary use can lead to substantial improvements in quality of life and other clinical outcomes in geriatric patients.

### Prospective evaluation of outcome of vaginal pessaries versus surgery in women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse [^112Pt1o5]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of pessaries and surgery in women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse.

Methods

A total of 554 women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) were recruited and treated with either a vaginal pessary (n = 359) or surgery (n = 195). Using the validated Sheffield POP questionnaire, outcomes were evaluated and then compared at 1 year.

Results

At 1 year, the only significant difference between the two groups was increased frequency of intercourse in the surgery group (54% vs 46%; p = 0.028), which was not significant when controlled for age. There was a statistically significant improvement in prolapse, urinary, bowel, and sexual function in both pessary users and those treated surgically.

Conclusions

One year after treatment, women with POP report similar improvement in urinary, bowel, sexual function, and quality of life parameters when treated with pessary or surgical correction.

### Are older patients with prolapse likely to continue pessary use? A retrospective observational study [^115KB5KQ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

To review the outcomes and complications of vaginal prolapse management with pessaries in women aged 75 years or older, to ascertain whether pessaries are providing satisfactory long-term outcomes for older women.

Methods

A retrospective observational study was performed on women aged 75 years or older presenting to a tertiary Urogynaecology service with vaginal prolapse who opted for management with a vaginal pessary. Demographic and clinical data were collected by reviewing clinical files. The primary outcome was the proportion of women who opted for pessary management who later required prolapse surgery. Secondary outcomes included pessary complications and risk factors for failure. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were performed to analyse pessary failure.

Results

Of the 218 women who presented with prolapse, 78% opted for pessary management, and pessary fitting was successful in 84%. Sixty-nine percent of women who opted for initial pessary management underwent surgery later, with a mean time from pessary insertion to surgery of 21.6 months. Vaginal erosions were reported in 42% of pessary users. Risk factors for pessary failure were younger age and previous history of hysterectomy or prolapse surgery.

Conclusions

Although vaginal pessary use was the preferred first-line management choice for vaginal prolapse in most older women, surgery for prolapse was ultimately required in two-thirds of those conservatively managed. As three-quarters of older women presenting with prolapse had surgery as either a primary or secondary procedure; patients need to be advised of the high chance of requiring surgery at a later stage if they opt for pessary management.

Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

AUGS-SUNA joint clinical consensus statement — scope and methodology describes that the scope of this CCS is limited to pessaries used for the treatment of prolapse and that a panel of experts in pessary care from both the AUGS and SUNA membership was convened by the AUGS Publications Committee to draft a CCS regarding use and management of vaginal pessaries for POP; the purpose is to identify areas of expert consensus and nonconsensus regarding pessary fitting, follow-up, and management of pessary complications to improve the safety and quality of care where evidence is currently limited. The Vaginal Pessary Use and Management for Pelvic Organ Prolapse CCS topic was proposed by representatives from the SUNA Board of Directors to the AUGS Board of Directors as a means for the 2 organizations to collaborate on this important clinical topic, and this CCS was developed using established methods to reach consensus on pessary use for the nonsurgical treatment of POP. A call for applications for participation in the writing group was issued to the AUGS membership; applications, including conflicts of interest, were reviewed and a writing group chair was identified; SUNA and AUGS members were selected with input from the AUGS Publications Committee to ensure a wide range of expertise; a systematic review subcommittee was formed; and a consultant from the AUGS Publications Committee served as a resource and liaison, with administrative support provided by AUGS.

American Urogynecologic Society and Society of Urologic Nurses and Associates clinical consensus statement (CCS) on vaginal pessary use and management for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) describes background, purpose, and consensus methods and results. Over the past 50 years, pessary use has increased in popularity and has become an essential POP management tool, yet evidence is lacking to define care standardization for fitting, routine maintenance, and management of pessary-related complications. The purpose of this CCS is to identify areas of expert consensus and nonconsensus regarding pessary fitting, follow-up, and management of complications where evidence is limited. The writing group used a modified Delphi process after a structured literature search; a total of 31 statements were assessed and divided into 3 categories (fitting and follow-up, complications, and quality of life), and all statements reached consensus after 2 rounds of the Delphi survey.

### Pessary treatment for pelvic organ prolapse and health-related quality of life: a review [^111jKwiR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Pessaries have been used to treat women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) since the beginning of recorded history. This review aims to assess the effect of pessary treatment on the disease-specific, health-related quality of life in women with pelvic organ prolapse. After a Medline search using the Mesh term 'pessary' and critical appraisal, 41 articles were selected and used in this review. Pessaries are widely used to treat pelvic organ prolapse. It is minimally invasive and appears to be safe. Although there is evidence that the use of pessaries in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse is effective in alleviating symptoms and that patient satisfaction is high, the follow-up in many published papers is short, and the use of validated urogynaecological questionnaires is limited. Comparison with surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse is rare and not assessed in a randomised controlled trial.

### Pessaries (mechanical devices) for managing pelvic organ prolapse in women [^115H3jai]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem in women. About 40% of women will experience prolapse in their lifetime, with the proportion expected to rise in line with an ageing population. Women experience a variety of troublesome symptoms as a consequence of prolapse, including a feeling of 'something coming down' into the vagina, pain, urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms and sexual difficulties. Treatment for prolapse includes surgery, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and vaginal pessaries. Vaginal pessaries are passive mechanical devices designed to support the vagina and hold the prolapsed organs back in the anatomically correct position. The most commonly used pessaries are made from polyvinyl-chloride, polythene, silicone or latex. Pessaries are frequently used by clinicians with high numbers of clinicians offering a pessary as first-line treatment for prolapse. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2003 and last published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pessaries (mechanical devices) for managing pelvic organ prolapse in women; and summarise the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations of this intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 28 January 2020). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted the authors of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials which included a pessary for pelvic organ prolapse in at least one arm of the study.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed abstracts, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and carried out GRADE assessments with arbitration from a third review author if necessary.

Main Results

We included four studies involving a total of 478 women with various stages of prolapse, all of which took place in high-income countries. In one trial, only six of the 113 recruited women consented to random assignment to an intervention and no data are available for those six women. We could not perform any meta-analysis because each of the trials addressed a different comparison. None of the trials reported data about perceived resolution of prolapse symptoms or about psychological outcome measures. All studies reported data about perceived improvement of prolapse symptoms. Generally, the trials were at high risk of performance bias, due to lack of blinding, and low risk of selection bias. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for imprecision resulting from the low numbers of women participating in the trials. Pessary versus no treatment: at 12 months' follow-up, we are uncertain about the effect of pessaries compared with no treatment on perceived improvement of prolapse symptoms (mean difference (MD) in questionnaire scores -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.61 to 0.55; 27 women; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), and cure or improvement of sexual problems (MD -0.29, 95% CI -1.67 to 1.09; 27 women; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). In this comparison we did not find any evidence relating to prolapse-specific quality of life or to the number of women experiencing adverse events (abnormal vaginal bleeding or de novo voiding difficulty). Pessary versus pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT): at 12 months' follow-up, we are uncertain if there is a difference between pessaries and PFMT in terms of women's perceived improvement in prolapse symptoms (MD -9.60, 95% CI -22.53 to 3.33; 137 women; low-certainty evidence), prolapse-specific quality of life (MD -3.30, 95% CI -8.70 to 15.30; 1 study; 116 women; low-certainty evidence), or cure or improvement of sexual problems (MD -2.30, 95% -5.20 to 0.60; 1 study; 48 women; low-certainty evidence). Pessaries may result in a large increase in risk of adverse events compared with PFMT (RR 75.25, 95% CI 4.70 to 1205.45; 1 study; 97 women; low-certainty evidence). Adverse events included increased vaginal discharge, and/or increased urinary incontinence and/or erosion or irritation of the vaginal walls. Pessary plus PFMT versus PFMT alone: at 12 months' follow-up, pessary plus PFMT probably leads to more women perceiving improvement in their prolapse symptoms compared with PFMT alone (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.94; 1 study; 260 women; moderate-certainty evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, pessary plus PFMT probably improves women's prolapse-specific quality of life compared with PFMT alone (median (interquartile range (IQR)) POPIQ score: pessary plus PFMT 0.3 (0 to 22.2); 132 women; PFMT only 8.9 (0 to 64.9); 128 women; P = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence). Pessary plus PFMT may slightly increase the risk of abnormal vaginal bleeding compared with PFMT alone (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.69 to 6.91; 1 study; 260 women; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain if pessary plus PFMT has any effect on the risk of de novo voiding difficulty compared with PFMT alone (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.19; 1 study; 189 women; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if pessaries improve pelvic organ prolapse symptoms for women compared with no treatment or PFMT but pessaries in addition to PFMT probably improve women's pelvic organ prolapse symptoms and prolapse-specific quality of life. However, there may be an increased risk of adverse events with pessaries compared to PFMT. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women and measure clinically important outcomes such as prolapse specific quality of life and resolution of prolapse symptoms. The review found two relevant economic evaluations. Of these, one assessed the cost-effectiveness of pessary treatment, expectant management and surgical procedures, and the other compared pessary treatment to PFMT.

A retrospective cohort study of 69 women who developed pessary-related vaginal erosions found a greater likelihood for pessary continuation among women who used vaginal estrogen. Consensus was reached in the Delphi survey, with 62.5% (5 participants) strongly agreed and 12.5% (1 participant) were neutral with the statement.

### Self-management of vaginal pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse [^11589QAk]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition with a lifetime risk of surgery in the general female population of up to 19%. Vaginal pessaries are an effective way to manage prolapse symptoms and may be offered to women with symptomatic prolapse as an alternative to surgery. There is no data available for pessary changes in primary care, although Dr Foster data records over 46,000 pessary changes in hospitals in England during 2013. This clearly represents a significant use of healthcare resources as well as the personal and economic costs to women having to attend for an appointment. Reasons for declining or discontinuing pessary management include experience of discomfort at pessary changes, inconvenience of attending appointments, discharge, bleeding, and reduced sexual activityThese problems can be resolved with self-management as the woman is able to remove, clean, and insert the pessary at her convenience. At our institution over 300 pessary changes are performed each year.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) pessary fitting — device selection is summarized as follows: The best strategy is to try the smallest possible pessary that supports the prolapse, is comfortable, and is retained by the wearer. The ring pessary is the most commonly used pessary and can be used in women with all types and stages of prolapse; in 2 studies, 3 sizes of ring pessaries (#3, #4, and #5) accounted for most of the successful pessary fitting trials. Space-filling pessaries (Gellhorn, donut, or cube) are often successful in women who were unsuccessfully fitted with a support pessary (ring), and the severity of POP does not influence the likelihood of a successful pessary fitting trial. In the Delphi survey, 87.5% (7 participants) strongly agreed and 12.5% (1 participant) weakly agreed with this statement.

### The cube pessary: an underestimated treatment option for pelvic organ prolapse? Subjective 1-year outcomes [^111PkNMF]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition. The use of pessaries for conservative management of POP is widespread. However, there are little data on the use of cube pessaries. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether self-therapy with the use of vaginal cube pessaries in women with POP can be a well-tolerated, first-line treatment.

Methods

In a prospective case series, 87 women who suffered from symptomatic POP, stages II-IV, were instructed in self-treatment with a vaginal cube pessary. Differences were analyzed using Wilcoxon's rank sum test or Fisher's exact test.

Results

A pessary could be fitted in 84/87 patients (96.6%); 6 women were lost to follow-up. The remaining 78 patients (92.9%, median age 60 years) completed the study. Sixteen women (20.5%) chose not to continue with the pessary treatment. For these patients, general well-being decreased from a median numeric rating score (NRS) of 4.5 (3–6) to 2.0 (1–3, p < 0.001). In those who continued treatment, general well-being increased from a median NRS of 3.0 (2–5) to 8.0 (7–10, p < 0.001) after 1 year of use. The majority of patients (53) in the present study rated pessary self-care use as "very easy" or "easy" (85.5%). The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) was 2.0 (1–3) at follow-up examination. There were no complications or adverse effects of pessary use.

Conclusions

Conservative self-treatment with vaginal cube pessaries might be a feasible treatment option for women who suffer from POP.

AUGS–SUNA clinical consensus — Q6 self-care pessary management states that for women who manage their pessaries with self-care, recommended removal and cleaning intervals range from nightly to every 6 months. There are no clinical trials or guidelines for an optimal interval of pessary removal for women who self-manage their pessaries, and studies found that the frequency of pessary removal did not affect a patient's experience of using the pessary; patients should be encouraged to manage their pessaries based on their own preferences. A potential risk of removing too frequently (ie, nightly) is discomfort, whereas changing too infrequently (ie, every 3–6 months) risks increased discharge and odor, although some women have neither pain nor excessive discharge or odor. In the Delphi survey, 75% (6 participants) strongly agreed and 25% (2 participants) weakly agreed with this statement, and the writing group recommends counseling women to remove their pessaries as needed.

Q11. During office examinations, there is no benefit to routine vaginal cleaning, unless there is excess or abnormal vaginal discharge, bleeding, or odor; there are no clinical trials or guidelines regarding the use of cleansing agents in the vagina for women who wear a pessary, cleansing agents have not been shown to reduce pessary-related complications, and there is no evidence that cleansing the vagina during a pessary visit is helpful. Vaginal cleaning could potentially incur an additional outpatient office charge for the patient, several trials have failed to show a benefit of more frequent office visits in preventing vaginal discharge and infection, and if there is excess or abnormal vaginal discharge, the use of dry swabs is usually adequate with saline or water preferred to cleansing agents for use in the vagina; in the Delphi survey, 87.5% (7 participants) strongly agreed and 12.5% (1 participant) weakly agreed with this statement.

Management and follow-up

Evidence is lacking on the type of pessary that is chosen, or who should be responsible for cleaning and changing pessaries and how often this should be performed. Ideally, the physician can teach a patient how to remove and replace the pessary herself. This increases patients' autonomy, allowing her to use it and clean it when needed. In such a setting, follow-up could be on an annual basis. Patients who are not willing or able to manage pessary care themselves require more frequent doctors (or nurse practitioner) visits. There is a lack of evidence on whether a pessary should be used in combination with hormone replacement therapy or pelvic floor exercises. If HRT is prescribed, local HRT seems to be more beneficial in reducing side effects than systemic HRT or a combination of both. HRT is particularly used to prevent vaginal irritation and ulceration due to pressure of the pessary in an older and atrophic vagina. There is some evidence that local HRT plays a significant role in the initial success of fitting.

### Clinical effectiveness of vaginal pessary self-management vs clinic-based care for pelvic organ prolapse (TOPSY): a randomised controlled superiority trial [^116kNxfL]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fewer complications in the self-management group may be explained by these women having greater confidence in their abilities to remove and insert their pessary, to change it more frequently and use it for less time. One small randomised study identified that the rate of vaginal pessary complications was lower when pessary changes were more frequent, although not statistically so. Complications have also been linked to the duration of time the pessary is in situ.

Previous observational, longitudinal studies have found that 86.1% of women continue pessary use at 5 yearsand a link between complications and pessary discontinuation has been reported. This is in line with the current trial as 91.5% and 86.2% of self-management and clinic-based care women, respectively intended to continue pessary use after 18-month follow-up.

The UK Clinical Guideline for best practice in vaginal pessary use for prolapse recommends that women who are assessed to be willing and suitable should be offered self-management. This trial supports this recommendation to clinicians and policymakers, providing evidence that self-management does not negatively impact quality of life or patient safety compared to clinic-based care, but is cost-effective and associated with a reduced rate of complications.

Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms through which self-management reduces complication rates, and whether it leads to a reduction in pessary discontinuation. Research on models of pessary care in ethnic minority populations is also needed. A validated pessary complications questionnaire needs to be developed to enhance the rigor and consistency of future trials of pessaries. Future research is needed to focus on models of pessary self-management follow-up, for example, should a pessary review be woman-initiated or does it require to be planned at specific intervals? A 4-year follow-up is underway in this trial, and an implementation study planned, which will contribute data to address some of these gaps.

Introduction

Pelvic organ prolapse is the descent of one or more of the anterior vaginal wall, posterior vaginal wall, uterus or vaginal vault, with associated symptoms. Prolapse is a common problem, with studies suggesting that 30–40% of women have prolapse on examination, 5–10% report symptoms, and there is a 9.5% lifetime risk of prolapse surgery. Prolapse prevalence increases with age and presents a growing health problem. Women with prolapse report bothersome symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life and body image. Symptoms include a feeling of 'something coming down' or 'bulge' in the vagina, urinary, bowel and sexual symptoms and discomfort.

Prolapse can be treated conservatively or surgically. Up to 18.5% of women who have prolapse surgery may need a further prolapse repair procedureand the recent controversy around the use of surgical mesh has resulted in a focus on conservative treatment options. One conservative treatment option is vaginal pessary. The pessary is an inexpensive mechanical device that is inserted into the vagina to support the pelvic organs. Pessaries are used worldwide with two thirds of women initially choosing a vaginal pessary to treat prolapse symptoms.

For women who use a pessary as treatment for prolapse it is usually fitted at a gynaecological clinic, or occasionally at a GP surgery, and the woman returns approximately six-monthly for follow-up. However, having to return to clinic every six months may be inconvenient for women, and uninterrupted placement of a pessary may increase the risk of complications (e.g. discharge, erosion, bleeding). It may interfere with sexual intercourse, and the woman may require a review in clinic more frequently if the pessary is expelled or pessary complications are experienced (e.g. bleeding, vaginal discomfort). An alternative to clinic-based care is pessary self-management where a woman removes and reinserts the pessary herself, thus offering her more control to maintain and improve her own health. Research in other clinical domains suggests that self-management is beneficial because people improve their self-efficacy (confidence) to look after their own health. There is no evidence on the effectiveness of pessary self-management for women with prolapse. The current trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of self-management of a vaginal pessary on the pelvic floor-specific quality of life of women with pelvic organ prolapse when compared to clinic-based care.

### Role of pessaries in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113amfjc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the existing evidence on the efficacy of pessaries in improving quality of life when used for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse (POP).

Data Sources

We searched for the terms "pelvic organ prolapse" and "pessar/y/ies/ium or vaginal support device", and "safety or safe or outcome or complication or efficacy or effective or effectiveness" in PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL on March 16, 2020. A search was also performed on ClinicalTrials.gov, with no studies fitting our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Methods Of Study Selection

Studies that reported pretreatment and posttreatment mean scores and SDs after pessary treatment for standardized questionnaires were included. Studies performed in pediatric populations, pregnancy, and use of pessaries not for prolapse were excluded. Three reviewers independently screened studies.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Data abstraction was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Data were pooled for meta-analysis when reported by at least three studies. The primary study outcome was change in mean pretreatment and posttreatment questionnaire scores, which included those for the PFDI-20 (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory- Short Form 20), PFIQ-7 (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire - Short Form 7), and subscale POPIQ (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire Long Form). A random-effects model was used to combine estimates and capture between-study heterogeneity using the I²-statistic. Eight studies including 627 patients were included for systematic review. The mean (SD) age was 63.0 ± 12.2 years, and the majority of patients had stage III prolapse (48.1%) followed by stage II prolapse (43.2%) when reported. Although variable, the majority of studies conducted 3-month follow-up. A negative change in pretreatment and posttreatment scores was noted, signifying improvement after pessary use: PFDI-20 mean change -46.1 (95% CI -65.4 to -26.8); PFIQ-7 mean change -36.0 (95% CI -46.0 to -26.0); POPIQ-7 (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire-7) mean change -16.3 (95% CI -26.8 to -5.7). No significant heterogeneity was found.

Conclusion

Based on improvements in standardized questionnaire scores, pessaries are effective treatment options for POP.

### Effect of pessary cleaning and optimal time interval for follow-up: a prospective cohort study [^1122jbxL]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Having established that intervals do not matter for the most bothersome complaints, it still might be worthwhile to remove the pessary owing to a possible chance of lesions of the vaginal epithelium and subsequent epithelial overgrowth or fistula. Other studies showed that serious adverse events in women with pessary treatment were very rare and mostly due to longstanding neglect. In our study, we did not find any serious adverse events in patients with continued pessary use after 12 months.

Finally, our third question was which proportion of patients was willing and able to remove, clean and re-insert their pessary.

Almost half of patients were able to learn and continue self-management after 12 months. Comparable percentages were described in a study by Kearney et al. They showed that 65% of patients were able to learn self-management and that 47% continued self-management after 6 months' follow-up.

To implement the outcomes of our study into clinical practice and subsequently reduce health care costs, we recommend a routine follow-up visit not more frequently than at 9-month intervals in a symptomatic patient without self-management. We have not studied longer intervals and therefore we do not know whether serious complications would occur at larger intervals. In our opinion, there is no evidence for the need to check asymptomatic patients performing self-management. Individualized care and visits should be provided on the indication of complaints of increasing vaginal discharge (exclude or treat bacterial vaginosis), blood loss or (increasing) pain in all patients.

Q12. There may be a therapeutic benefit of pessaries in the prevention of prolapse progression, and although several small studies have evaluated this, data from these studies are insufficient to conclude that pessary use definitively helps to prevent prolapse progression; randomized controlled trials would be beneficial in providing evidence for improvement in pelvic organ prolapse (POP) with use of a pessary. In the Delphi survey, 37.5% (3 participants) strongly agreed and 50% (4 participants) weakly agreed with this statement, whereas 12.5% (1 participant) were neutral, and the writing group agreed that, based on collective experience, pessaries may help to prevent prolapse progression, but additional studies are needed.

### Where to for pelvic organ prolapse treatment after the FDA pronouncements? A systematic review of the recent literature [^115q3CDj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

With the publication of the updated US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communication in 2011 on the use of transvaginal placement of mesh for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) it is appropriate to now review recent studies of good quality on POP to assess the safety and effectiveness of treatment options and determine their place in management.

Methods

A systematic search for studies on the conservative and surgical management of POP published in the English literature between January 2002 and October 2012 was performed. Studies included were review articles, randomized controlled trials, prospective and relevant retrospective studies as well as conference abstracts. Selected articles were appraised by the authors regarding clinical relevance.

Results

Prospective comparative studies show that vaginal pessaries constitute an effective and safe treatment for POP and should be offered as first treatment of choice in women with symptomatic POP. However, a pessary will have to be used for the patient's lifetime. Abdominal sacral colpopexy is effective in treating apical prolapse with an acceptable benefit-risk ratio. This procedure should be balanced against the low but non-negligible risk of serious complications. The results of native tissue vaginal POP repair are better than previously thought with high patient satisfaction and acceptable reoperation rates. The insertion of mesh at the time of anterior vaginal wall repair reduces the awareness of prolapse as well as the risk of recurrent anterior prolapse. There is no difference in anatomic and subjective outcome when native tissue vaginal repairs are compared with multicompartment vaginal mesh. Mesh exposure is still a significant problem requiring surgical excision in approximately ≥ 10% of cases. The ideal mesh has not yet been found necessitating more basic research into mesh properties and host response. Several studies indicate that greater surgical experience is correlated with fewer mesh complications. In women with uterovaginal prolapse uterine preservation is a feasible option which women should be offered. Randomized studies with long-term follow-up are advisable to establish the place of uterine preservation in POP surgery.

Conclusion

Over the last decade treatment of POP has been dominated by the use of mesh. Conservative treatment is the first option in women with POP. Surgical repair with or without mesh generally results in good short-term objective and functional outcomes. However, basic research into mesh properties with host response and comparative studies with long-term follow-up are urgently needed.

### Pessaries for managing pelvic organ prolapse in women… [^116fJvxc]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are pessaries effective in treating pelvic organ prolapse in women. Evidence-Based Answer Pessaries combined with pelvic floor muscle training probably improve pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women and prolapse-specific quality of life compared with PFMT alone. However, the risk of adverse events may be higher.

1. Practice Pointers Pelvic organ prolapse is characterized by pelvic organs such as the uterus, bladder, or bowel protruding into the vagina because of pelvic floor muscle weakness. Common symptoms include a feeling of "something coming down, " vaginal or pelvic pain, urinary and/or bowel symptoms, and sexual difficulties, and these can significantly worsen patient quality of life.

2 About 40% of women older than 40 years are affected, 3 and the prevalence is expected to increase as the population ages. Treatment options include pessaries, PFMT, and surgery. Clinicians commonly offer pessaries as first-line treatment. The authors of this review aimed to determine the effect of pessaries in the management of pelvic organ prolapse. P = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence). Pessary plus PFMT may slightly increase the risk of abnormal vaginal bleeding. It is uncertain if pessaries improve pelvic organ prolapse symptoms compared with no treatment or PFMT alone. The above conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of small sample size. However, they are consistent with guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which supports use of a pessary alone or in conjunction with supervised PFMT for women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse.

4 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that symptomatic women be offered a pessary as an alternative to surgery, and that a pessary be considered as part of preconception care for symptomatic women who wish to become pregnant in the future. 5 Future high-quality trials should also measure other clinically relevant outcomes, such as perceived resolution of prolapse symptoms, patient-reported satisfaction, or psychological impact.

Vaginal pessary use with anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications — Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications (ie, warfarin, clopidogrel) may increase the risk of bleeding with pessaries but are not contraindicated with pessary use. There are no clinical trials or guidelines examining the potential risk of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications in women who wear pessaries, and the risk of vaginal bleeding related to pessary use in women who take anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications may be higher than average; however, there are no data to suggest that antiplatelet medications are contraindicated with pessary use. Consensus was reached in the Delphi survey, 62.5% (5 participants) strongly agreed, 25% (2 participants) weakly agreed and 12.5% (1 participant) was neutral with the statement. The writing group recommends that clinicians discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of using pessaries with patients who are using anticoagulant medications and consider more frequent follow-up when there is bleeding.

### A nationwide survey concerning practices in pessary use for pelvic organ prolapse in the Netherlands: identifying needs for further research [^112USkLA]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Results

After three requests, a total of 91 of 151 gynecologists (59%) in 63 of 80 hospitals (79%) had responded. In 98% of the responding hospitals a gynecologist with a special interest in urogynecology was employed. A written protocol for indication, insertion and follow-up of pessary treatment was available in 13% (Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of the hospitals of responding gynecologists

Pessary placement for the treatment of POP was proposed by 69% of respondents always, by 17% sometimes, and by 14% never. Prolapse of the anterior compartment and apical compartment were considered the most suitable indications for pessary treatment (99% and 96% of the respondents, respectively). Concerning the decision to start initial treatment with a pessary, 62% of the respondents stated that they were not influenced by the stage of prolapse, and 36% stated that patient age was a decisive factor, with younger patients being less likely to receive a pessary (Table 2).

Regarding the first follow up visit, 78 respondents (86%) stated that it was carried out by a gynecologist, 2% delegated this care to either the general practitioner (GP) or a nurse practitioner, and 12% stated that the patient could choose between the above professionals. If there were no patient complaints, 99% of respondents increased the interval between visits. Estrogens were prescribed routinely by 13% of respondents, only when vaginal atrophy was present by 73%, and when indications other than atrophy, for example irritation, were present by 9%; 5% of respondents never prescribed estrogens.

Hydroxyquinoline-based gel for pessary use — evidence and consensus are as follows: There is no evidence to support a beneficial effect of hydroxyquinoline-based gel for pessary use, and one clinical trial found no difference in the incidence of vaginal symptoms or desire to continue pessary use during the first 3 months between women who used hydroxyquinoline-based gel and those who did not; in the Delphi survey, 100% (8 participants) strongly agreed with this statement.

### Is hysterectomy or prior reconstructive surgery associated with unsuccessful initial trial of pessary fitting in women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse? [^114z7jfZ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

There is little data in the literature regarding the feasibility and limitations of pessary therapy after pelvic reconstructive surgery for symptom recurrence for treating urinary incontinence. Hysterectomy is an important risk factor for failure of pessary fitting. We aimed to evaluate the influence of these prior surgeries on subsequent initial trials of fitting a pessary.

Methods

Six hundred and twenty-nine women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) were included in a prospective cohort study from January 2014 to December 2015. All women had symptomatic stage ≥ 2 POP. During the study period, various types of pessaries were used for the fitting process.

Results

O the 629 women, 489 (77.7%) had neither hysterectomy nor reconstructive pelvic surgery, and 24 (3.8%) had hysterectomy for different indications. Initial pessary fitting was possible in all patients in both groups (100%) 116 (18.4%) had a total of 159 previous, predominantly vaginal, surgeries for POP, with or without vaginal hysterectomy. In 25/116 (21.5%) cases, initial fitting was impossible due to altered anatomy. After one surgery, the probability of failure was 18.8% (15/80) and after two 27.3% (9/33). Of the three women who had three or more surgeries, one failure occurred.

Conclusion

Surgery for POP is an important risk factor for an unsuccessful pessary fitting. It seems conclusive to recommend pessary treatment as a general first-line therapy for symptomatic POP, since after unsuccessful pessary treatment, women can still undergo surgery, whereas reversing treatment options might not always be feasible.

### Pessary treatment for pelvic organ prolapse and health-related quality of life: a review [^117UEgL1]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Pessary treatment is widely used for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. It can be considered a patient-friendly, minimally invasive treatment and appears to be safe. Most studies reported successful fitting trial over 85%. Risk factors responsible for unsuccessful pessary fitting are short vaginal length, a large genital hiatus, prior history of hysterectomy and prior surgical repairs of POP. The compartment and stage of POP have not been reported to have any influence on successful pessary fitting. Fifty percent to 80% of women who were initially successfully fitted continued to use pessary at 1 year. Continuation rates at greater than 5 years range from 14% to 48%. Consistent in most reports though are the improvements in both bulge and irritative bladder symptoms and the high satisfaction rates.

Sexual activity appears not to be a contraindication for pessary treatment; on the contrary, it seems to have a positive effect on sexual functioning. In comparison with POP surgery, 1-year outcomes in terms of prolapse symptoms, sexual functioning and quality of life seem similar with pessary use.

### What is hiding behind the pessary? [^111aYqS1]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Vaginal pessaries are routinely used for initial management of pelvic organ prolapse and for women who are poor surgical candidates. Serious complications of long-term use without routine follow-up include erosion into surrounding organs and the development of fistulas. It is unclear however, if long-term use and chronic irritation could potentially contribute to development or delay the diagnosis of vaginal or cervical cancers. A 72-year-old Caucasian woman with a vaginal pessary retained for 3 years, who presented with leukocytosis and coagulopathy, was discovered to have stage II vaginal adenosquamous carcinoma upon surgical pessary removal. Chronic irritation and lack of follow-up with pessary use may contribute to masking the development and delaying the diagnosis of vaginal cancer in women with risk factors. Pessary use requires frequent follow-up to prevent complications.

Q30 vaginal discharge with pessary use — although many women have vaginal discharge when using pessaries, it usually is not due to a vaginal infection; approximately 30% of women using a pessary will report bothersome vaginal discharge, and clinicians should inform patients that pessaries may cause additional vaginal discharge, which is not typically infectious and does not require treatment; if patients are significantly bothered by discharge, the clinician may consider obtaining vaginal or cervical swabs to test for infection or consider increasing the frequency of pessary removal to reduce vaginal discharge; there are several cohort studies that suggest frequent self-replacement of the pessary decreases the rate of vaginal discharge, and it is unclear if vaginal estrogen or hydroxyquinoline-based gel prevents these symptoms.

### Effect of pessary cleaning and optimal time interval for follow-up: a prospective cohort study [^115Gbder]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Whether a pessary will be chosen as first-line treatment depends on expectations about the effect, the likelihood of occurrence of side effects and patients' preferences and existing guidelines advising to try the least invasive option initially. Overall, in the Netherlands, this has resulted in high acceptance, with up to 98% of clinicians reporting use of pessaries in the management of POP and even 77% of gynaecologists reporting use of pessaries as first-line treatment.

With this widespread use of pessaries, it becomes even more relevant to optimise management protocols. In comparison with surgery, short-term costs of pessaries are lower. However, long-term costs are highly dependent on the need and frequency of follow-up visits. These follow-up visits involve removal and cleaning of the pessary, inspection of the vaginal wall and afterwards replacing the pessary. These visits can be a burden to patients. Equally important, we do not know whether these visits are effective in reducing pessary related side effects. Further, intervals between these follow-up visits vary widely and studies about the ideal length of such intervals are lacking. Nor is it known what proportion of patients is willing and able to learn how to clean and replace the pessary themselves.

To optimize treatment protocols and optimize the number of follow-up visits, we performed a prospective cohort study to evaluate whether or not cleaning a pessary has any effect on pessary-related symptoms such as vaginal discharge, vaginal irritation and pain. In addition, we evaluated if pessary-related side effects prior to the cleaning differ when the interval is significantly lengthened from 3 to 9 months.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) pessary — complications and care gaps are outlined as follows: Pessary complications include vaginal discharge, infection, abrasions, erosions/ulcerations, incarceration, and fistulas, with abrasions and erosions/ulcerations representing varying degrees of epithelial damage and the severity of epithelial injury described as ill-defined. At present, guidance for pessary management has fallen to manufacturers and expert opinion, leading to significant variation in recommendations for care. The lack of consistent data regarding strategies for treating complications, including altering pessary type and size, use and timing of local estrogen, or providing a pessary holiday, limits clinicians' ability to provide optimal care and counseling. With few data to guide practice, education gaps exist, including insufficient pessary education and comfort among obstetrics and gynecology residents, with most pessary education and practice knowledge achieved through on-the-job training and mentorship. High-quality, well-designed research trials are needed, and recommendations developed by the writing group may support efforts by providing consistent care guidelines and statements on pessary fitting and management while highlighting areas for further research.

Introduction

Pessaries have been used to treat women with pelvic organ prolapse since the beginning of recorded history. Hippocrates described reduction of vaginal prolapse by placing a halved pomegranate soaked in wine into the vagina (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Reduction of vaginal prolapse by placing a halved pomegranate soaked in wine into the vagina described by Hippocrates

A variety of devices has been described over time. Nowadays, most pessaries are made of silicone and are ring type pessaries with or without central support, Gellhorn pessaries and donut pessaries (Fig. 2). Pessaries are used in daily practice by more than 86% of gynaecologists and 98% of urogynaecologists. The ring with central support and the Gellhorn pessary are most frequently used and appear equally effective in relieving symptoms of genital prolapse and voiding dysfunction.

Fig. 2

It is not clear which patients particularly benefit most from pessary treatment, what the side effects are and whether the therapeutic effect is high enough to condone possible side effects. Most important is whether pessary treatment reduces urogenital bother symptoms and which impact it has on health-related quality of life. In the end, it is not the doctor's but the patient's opinion about the treatment that is most important. Health-related quality of life is one of the patient outcome measures (POM) and is measured and quantified in domain scores of validated urogynaecological questionnaires. The use of these validated questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life in surgery of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is well established. Although pessary treatment is widely used for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse as well, a (systematic) review on the quality of life following pessary treatment has not yet been published.

This review aims to assess the effects of pessary treatment on disease-specific health-related quality of life in women with POP.

### Abstract… [^114CrCKU]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Uses of the Pessary PELVIC SUPPORT DEFECTS The pessary is most commonly used in the nonsurgical management of pelvic support defects. Multiple vaginal deliveries can weaken the musculature of the pelvic floor. Hysterectomy or other pelvic surgery can predispose a woman to weakness of the pelvic floor, as can conditions that involve repetitive bearing down, such as chronic constipation, chronic coughing or repetitive heavy lifting. occurs when the fascial layers between the rectum and the vagina become weak. This weakening allows the rectum to herniate, causing a bulging of the posterior vagina. The patient may report having to manually reduce the rectocele before defecation. An enterocele is the herniation of the sigmoid colon into the upper posterior vaginal wall. An enterocele differs from a rectocele in that it is a true hernia, lined by peritoneum and usually containing small bowel.

TREATMENT OF VAGINAL PROLAPSE In patients with a mild cystocele, treatment using a ring with support, a dish with support, a Hodge with support or a donut pessary will suffice. To manage a large prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall, the Gellhorn pessary may be the best choice, although insertion and removal can be difficult. Inflatable and cube pessaries are also useful in patients with a larger cystocele. In patients with rectoceles and enteroceles, the use of a Gellhorn, donut, inflatable or cube pessary is usually required to provide the necessary support. INCONTINENCE PESSARIES The pessary compresses the urethra against the upper posterior portion of the symphysis pubis and elevates the bladder neck. This causes an increase in outflow resistance and corrects the angle between the bladder and the urethra so that Valsalva's maneuvers alone are not strong enough to cause leakage of urine.

Any style of pessary that can accomplish this will help with the management of stress urinary incontinence. In the patient with an improperly fitted ring pessary, the cervix and lower uterus can herniate through the open center of the ring and become incarcerated. If not recognized, this incarceration could lead to strangulation and necrosis of the cervix and uterus. 4 While vaginal cytology may reveal inflammatory changes, the presence of a pessary does not increase the patient's risk of developing vaginal cancer. 4.

Vaginal pessary use and management for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is outlined as a consensus effort to standardize care, describing a pessary as a silicone device used for symptomatic prolapse and addressing initial fitting, follow-up, and issue management, with a total of 31 statements agreed upon. The document characterizes a pessary as minimally invasive and cost-effective and notes that, when fitted correctly, it enhances quality of life (QoL), improves self-esteem, and restores daily function, while emphasizing that improved guidance is needed and existing data on fitting and management are of low quality. Evidence indicates that registered nurses, advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, physicians, and physiotherapists/physical therapists manage pessaries, yet there is no formal training program; best education practices include standards for mentorship, audiovisual instruction, and improving clinical prolapse models. The authors acknowledge potential unintentional bias due to limited quality research and call for higher quality research to build the evidence base, provide clinicians a stronger foundation for care, and enable concise educational protocols.

### A nationwide survey concerning practices in pessary use for pelvic organ prolapse in the Netherlands: identifying needs for further research [^113TUUZV]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition in adult women. For the relief of symptoms related to POP conservative treatment options include life-style advice, pelvic physiotherapy and pessary treatment. The aim of pessary treatment is to restore the anatomy of the visceral organs of the pelvic cavity by inserting a device into the vagina. The reported subjective cure rates vary between 60% and 80%. Many patients prefer this treatment over surgery, as it is unlikely to cause serious morbidity and normal activities can be continued. Successful pessary fitting and long-term success have been documented in up to 75% of women with symptomatic POP. The reason for the high proportion (80–85%) of gynecologists placing pessaries may be the ease with which they can be inserted and removed, their efficacy and the low complication rate.

Although large groups of women receive these devices, a national guideline regarding POP was not available in The Netherlands at the time of our survey. The proportion of patients made aware of this treatment option, which patients are most eligible for this treatment, and how long follow-up intervals should be were unknown. Ignorance concerning these issues may result in practice variation and suboptimal treatment of patients. Therefore, the aim of the present survey was to identify current practice and variation in practice concerning treatment with vaginal pessaries for POP.

### A service evaluation to determine where and who delivers pessary care in the UK [^113bAiGi]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Pessaries offer effective conservative management for symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and are frequently used in the UK. Previous publications have highlighted a lack of evidence-based pessary guidelines. There is also a dearth of evidence regarding who UK pessary practitioners are and the training received.

Methods

A Freedom of Information request was sent to 167 healthcare organisations in the UK. Requested information included the number of pessaries inserted or changed, the grade and profession of pessary practitioners and training requirements at the organisation.

Results

Responses were received from 128 organisations. One hundred and ten had provided information for practitioners managing pessaries. At 66% (72) of organisations, pessary care was provided by both doctors and nurses of varying grades. At 23% of organisations either solely doctors or solely nurses provided pessary care. At the remaining 9% there was a multidisciplinary approach to pessary care. At 3 hospitals, unregistered healthcare professionals provided pessary care. At the majority of organisations, respondents undertook supervised practise to gain skills in pessary management. Additional methods of training cited were learning through observation or achieving set competencies. Twenty-six percent received didactic training. At 21% of organisations there were no training requirements.

Conclusions

At most organisations, there was a multidisciplinary approach to pessary care. It is questionable whether unregistered healthcare professionals should be delegated responsibility for pessary care. A standardised approach to pessary practitioner training is advocated to ensure that women receive safe, evidence-based pessary care. The UK Clinical Guidance Group for the Use of Pessaries in Vaginal Prolapse is currently developing national evidence-based guidelines to support pessary practitioners in their practice, including training requirements.

### Examining pessary use and satisfaction in managing pelvic organ prolapse: results from a cross-sectional multicentre patient survey [^1143LbpE]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common clinical condition characterized by the downward descent of female pelvic organs into or through the vaginal canal, typically occurring due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. Common risk factors for POP include any conditions that increase the risk of global pelvic floor dysfunction, such as high vaginal parity, advanced age, obesity, previous pelvic surgeries and chronic constipation. Given that POP can involve a host of organs such as the bladder (cystocele), uterus (uterine prolapse) or rectum (rectocele), symptoms can vary widely from patient to patient. The most common symptoms include pelvic pressure or heaviness, the sensation of something coming out of the vagina, urinary or bowel incontinence, and incomplete emptying/evacuation. The prevalence of individuals with POP is expected to increase drastically given the aging population, warranting a more targeted approach towards managing and treating this condition.

Current guidelines outlining the management and treatment of POP highlight the use of conservative methods such as weight loss, dietary measures, physical activity and pelvic floor physiotherapy to address weakened muscles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) suggest that all women who are considering treatment for POP should be offered pessaries for symptom relief. As a conservative option, pessaries allow patients the option to maintain further fertility, and successfully improve overall quality of life. Up to 92% of women with varying stages of prolapse can be successfully fitted with a pessary and offering these before surgery could drastically improve patient outcomes.

Despite these positive qualities, many patients choose to discontinue pessary use and proceed with surgery for a number of different reasons. This study will explore (1) how pessaries are used in treating POP based on personal experience, (2) how we can improve pessary continuation in patients, and (3) what women with POP consider to be ideal pessary characteristics.

Vaginal epithelial changes and granulation tissue with pessary use — For vaginal epithelial changes (erythema, abrasion, erosion/ulceration, fistula) and granulation tissue related to pessary use, there are no definitive guidelines for management. Many studies show that vaginal epithelial changes occur during pessary use, and several studies suggest that decreased blood flow from the pessary leads to these injuries of the vaginal epithelium; necrosis by continuous pressure may form a vesicovaginal or rectovaginal fistula. Consensus was reached in the Delphi survey, 87.5% (7 participants) strongly agreed and 12.5% (1 participant) weakly agreed with this statement. The writing group recommends that clinicians assess the vaginal epithelium for changes during pessary care office visits, noting that some vaginal epithelial changes, such as erosion/ulceration and granulation tissue, require treatment by removing the pessary for a few weeks, and possibly using vaginal estrogen if not contraindicated; if these vaginal lesions fail to improve, then a biopsy may be necessary, and a pessary may be used again after the vagina has healed; patients should be informed when pessaries are placed that follow-up is necessary to reduce the risk of severe complications, and if the patient is unable to follow up, then clinicians should consider an alternate treatment option.

### Pessaries (mechanical devices) for pelvic organ prolapse in women [^115jFrbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse is common, with some degree of prolapse seen in up to 50% of parous women in a clinic setting, although many are asymptomatic. The use of pessaries (a passive mechanical device designed to support the vagina) to treat prolapse is very common, and up to 77% of clinicians use pessaries for the first line management of prolapse. A number of symptoms may be associated with prolapse and treatments include surgery, pessaries and conservative therapies. A variety of pessaries are described which aim to alleviate the symptoms of prolapse and avert or delay the need for surgery.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of pessaries (mechanical devices) for pelvic organ prolapse.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of trials (searched 13 March 2012), which includes searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE and handsearching of conference proceedings, and handsearched the abstracts of two relevant conferences held in 2011. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials which included a pessary for pelvic organ prolapse in one arm of the study.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts were assessed independently by two authors with arbitration from a third if necessary. Data extraction was completed independently for included studies by two review authors.

Main Results

To date there is only one published randomised controlled trial assessing the use of pessaries in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse.

Authors' Conclusions

The review authors identified one randomised controlled trial comparing ring and Gellhorn pessaries. The results of the trial showed that both pessaries were effective for the approximately 60% of women who completed the study with no significant differences identified between the two types of pessary. However, methodological flaws were noted in the trial, as elaborated under risk of bias assessment. There is no consensus on the use of different types of device, the indications nor the pattern of replacement and follow-up care. There is an urgent need for randomised studies to address the use of pessaries in comparison with no treatment, surgery and conservative measures.

### International urogynecology consultation chapter 3 committee 1-pessary management [^113m3KHm]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

This manuscript is part of the International Urogynecological Consultation (IUC) on Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP), Chapter 3, Committee 1 focusing on pessary management of POP.

Methods

A narrative review was conducted by an international, multi-disciplinary group of clinicians working in the field of pelvic health following a search of the literature using the MeSH terms "pelvic organ prolapse" OR "urogenital prolapse" OR "vaginal prolapse" OR "uterovaginal prolapse" AND "pessary" OR "support device" OR "intravaginal device". Relevant studies, as determined after review using the Covidence manuscript review platform, were included.

Results

A total of 540 articles were reviewed, of which 313 were included for this narrative review. The reported pessary fitting success rate ranges from 41% to 96.6%, and the continuation of successful use rate varied from 21% to 97.7%. The most likely predictors of unsuccessful fitting trials were previous POP surgery, previous hysterectomy, short vaginal length, wide genital hiatus, and posterior compartment involvement. Following successful pessary placement in individuals with POP, vaginal bulge and pressure resolved in over 90%. A significant improvement in obstructive voiding was reported in 40–97% of participants, urinary urgency in 38%, urgency urinary incontinence in 29–77%, and stress urinary incontinence in 9–45%. Older age and women who can self-manage the pessary care or had family support were factors associated with pessary continuation. Common reasons reported for discontinuation included expulsion, vaginal pain/discomfort, unwillingness to continue, erosions, desire for surgery, bleeding, symptoms not improved with pessary, and incontinence. More serious complications (fistula, bowel obstruction, pessary impaction, and vaginal cancer) are rare, and occur usually in older women in whom pessary maintenance has been neglected. There is no high-quality evidence to guide pessary choice. The current literature lacks studies specifically focused on determining the role of preventative measures, i.e., estrogen, pessary type/material as regards to pessary-associated complications (PACs). The review identified a lack of information about the relevant and required training and education (for healthcare professionals and patients) for pessary provision, use, and management.

Conclusions

There is a considerable body of published work on the use of pessaries for POP, including effectiveness, factors associated with success and failure, and complications. However, there is a dearth of published literature regarding how pessary types are selected by providers, how providers are trained, what defines competency in pessary provision, and what constitutes appropriate patient education related to pessary use and management.

### Do vaginal pessaries used to treat pelvic organ prolapse impact on sexual function? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112pa7vq]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is common and associated with sexual dysfunction. Vaginal pessaries are an effective treatment for POP, but their impact on sexual function is not well established. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to establish the impact of vaginal pessaries used for POP on female sexual function.

Methods

Systematic review of the literature following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and checklist. A comprehensive search was conducted across Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, Open Grey and Scopus Citation Database. Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies that assessed sexual function in women pre- and post-pessary treatment for POP were included, assessed for risk of bias and their results synthesised.

Results

A total of 1,945 titles and abstracts were screened, 104 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, 14 studies were included in the narrative analysis and 7 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggest that, in sexually active women, there is no evidence of a deterioration in sexual function and some evidence of an improvement.

Discussion

This review offers reassurance that in sexually active women who successfully use a pessary for treatment of their prolapse, there is no deterioration in sexual function. There is some evidence of an improvement in sexual function, but given the clinical heterogeneity in the studies included, caution should be taken in generalising these findings.

### Pessary use and management for pelvic organ prolapse [^112Etweg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Pessary is a low-risk and effective non-surgical treatment option for pelvic organ prolapse. Indications for pessary include symptomatic prolapse, if surgery is not desired or recommended, and use as a diagnostic tool to predict surgical outcomes. Evidence for pessary selection and management is incomplete so trial and error, expert opinion, and experience remain the best guides for use and management of the pessary. With proper training and understanding of pessary management, most patients can be successfully fitted and taught to manage the pessary either for short- or long-term relief of symptoms. Patient satisfaction is high making pessary an important tool in treating prolapse.

Q18 — management of pessary-related vaginal epithelial findings states that if erythema or an abrasion is identified during the pelvic examination, it is appropriate to reinsert the pessary; however, if an erosion/ulceration is identified, then the pessary should usually be removed and not reinserted, and the patient should be seen again for a pelvic examination in 4–6 weeks, and if a fistula is identified, then the pessary should be removed and arrangements made to care for the fistula. The writing group recommends watching vaginal erythema and granulation tissue over time and instructing women to call if vaginal bleeding develops, whereas women with erosions/ulcerations require closer follow-up, usually including removing the pessary temporarily to allow the area to heal, and for some it might be reasonable to cauterize the erosion/ulcer and replace the pessary. For most women with vaginal erosions/ulceration, the writing group recommends removing the pessary for 4 weeks, and in women with a pessary-related fistula the pessary should be removed and the fistula treated; in the Delphi survey, 37.5% (3 participants) strongly agreed and 50% (4 participants) weakly agreed with this statement, whereas 12.5% (1 participant) weakly disagreed.

### Effect of pessary cleaning and optimal time interval for follow-up: a prospective cohort study [^1152BzrB]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition in adult women. The prevalence of symptomatic POP in the general population is 11.4% (4–12.2%). Apart from pelvic floor muscle training, there are two other management options for POP; the use of a vaginal pessary and pelvic reconstructive surgery. As a non-surgical treatment option, vaginal pessaries are often used as first-line treatment in patients who do not want surgery, patients who are at a higher risk of surgical complications or in patients with recurrent POP. Reasons to start pessary therapy are reducing POP-related symptoms, preventing progression of prolapse and avoiding surgery.

Compared with surgery, advantages of pessary use are the low rate of complications and the immediate effectiveness. However, disadvantages also exist. The most frequently described side effects of pessaries are vaginal discharge (25–33%), vaginal irritation/pain (2–33%) and vaginal blood loss (6–46%). Rarely, cases of more serious adverse events of pessary use are described, such as fistula, hydronephrosis, urosepsis, incarceration and carcinoma. However, it must be noted that these serious adverse events are often due to longstanding neglect of pessaries.

AUGS–SUNA clinical consensus — Q7 follow-up for women performing self-care recommends that follow-up examination with their clinician is recommended every 6–12 months, with most doing this every 12 months. There are no clinical trials of the optimal visit interval for women who self-manage their pessaries; a survey of nurse providers recommended a follow-up visit every 3–12 months whereas a survey of AUGS members recommended an annual visit. The rate of self-care was 31% in a retrospective review of women using a pessary for POP, and some pessaries are less amenable to self-care removal and reinsertion (Gellhorn, shelf, and cube pessaries can be difficult even for clinicians to remove). The writing group recommends an annual office visit for those self-managing pessaries.

### Current trends in pessary management of vaginal prolapse: a multidisciplinary survey of UK practice [^1128k4U4]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Symptomatic vaginal prolapse affects 6–28% of women and significantly impacts their quality of life. Pessaries for prolapse are used by three-quarters of clinicians as a first-line treatment; however, current clinical use in the UK is unknown and there is a lack of clinical guidance or training. This study is aimed at informing the upcoming UK Clinical Guidance on best practice for the use of pessaries document.

Methods

A 19-question, anonymised, electronic survey was sent to members of the nine professional bodies delivering pessary care in the UK.

Results

Of 917 respondents, 403 (246 nurses, 134 doctors, 22 physiotherapists and 1 other profession) currently deliver pessary care. PVC/vinyl ring, silicone ring, Gellhorn and shelf pessaries are most popular, and are used frequently by 93% of respondents. Further pessary training was deemed necessary by 62% of those currently providing pessary care, and 70% of those who do not. The most highly rated method for previous and future training is shadowing another clinician. One in three respondents receive no ancillary support and nearly 1 in 7 (predominantly nurses) report the absence of cross-cover arrangements, leaving a gap in care provision.

Conclusions

Service provision, support and pessary training in the UK vary greatly. This calls for the standardisation of care, training and development of a national guideline. We present a clear rationale and need for a UK guideline on pessary management of vaginal prolapse and a standardised pessary training model for multi-professional use.

Superficial epithelial abrasion from pessary — If a patient has a superficial epithelial abrasion from the pessary, no changes to care are required, and chemical cautery/silver nitrate may be helpful if there is bleeding. There are no clinical trials or guidelines regarding best practices for managing superficial epithelial abrasions related to pessary use, so the writing group developed recommendations based on collective expertise and experience. Consensus was reached in the Delphi survey, 62.5% (5 participants) strongly agreed and 37.5% (3 participants) weakly agreed with the statement. The writing group recommends that if superficial epithelial changes occur from pessary use, no clinical changes are required; some clinicians suggest the use of chemical cautery, but recognize that there are no data to recommend its use, and the writing group suggests that practitioners use their best clinical judgment when determining the extent of the abrasion and consider removing the pessary as needed.

Vaginal estrogen in pessary users — conditional use and Delphi consensus are as follows: Vaginal estrogen may be considered for women who wish to optimize their long-term use of a pessary, and it is typically delivered as a cream or a tablet but also comes as an estrogen ring, with all of these usable concurrently with a pessary. However, several well-designed studies did not find a significant difference in the rate of pessary-related epithelial abrasions between women who used vaginal estrogen and those who did not, although one study found women who used vaginal estrogen were less likely to discontinue use of their pessaries. In the first Delphi survey, 75% (6 participants) strongly agreed and 25% (2 participants) weakly disagreed with this statement, and in the second Delphi survey, 87.5% (7 participants) strongly agreed and 12.5% (1 participant) weakly agreed after revising the wording. The writing group agreed that the data conflict with the cost-benefit ratio of vaginal estrogen, especially when cost is significant, and that regional differences in practice style, prescription costs, and patient attitudes can influence decisions on use.

### A 5-year prospective study of vaginal pessary use for pelvic organ prolapse [^111Gy9hR]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate prospectively the use of vaginal pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and to identify complications and reasons for discontinuing pessary use over a 5-year period.

Methods

A prospective observational study was conducted among all women with POP referred to the urogynecology clinic of a UK hospital between June 2002 and June 2005 who opted to use a vaginal pessary. Patients were followed-up for 5 years.

Results

Of the 246 women who chose to use a vaginal pessary, 187 successfully retained the pessary 4 weeks after insertion. Over a 5-year period, 36 (19.3%) of the 187 women were lost to follow-up. Of the 151 women included in the analysis, 21 (13.9%) discontinued use at some point after 4 weeks, whereas 130 (86.1%) used the pessary successfully over 5 years. Overall, 12.1% of the women experienced minor complications (6.9% pain or discomfort, 3.2% excoriation or bleeding, and 2.0% disimpaction or constipation). Most failures (73.8%) occurred within 4 weeks of pessary insertion. After cessation of pessary use, 70 (28.5%) of the 246 women chose surgery and 10 (4.1%) chose no further treatment.

Conclusion

If treatment of POP with a vaginal pessary is successful at 4 weeks, most women will continue to use the pessary over 5 years without a concomitant increase in complications.

### Parameters associated with unsuccessful pessary fitting for pelvic organ prolapse up to three months follow-up: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pfLDf]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Parameters related to obstetric history, e.g. number of pregnancies, deliveries and vaginal deliveries, were not found to be associated with unsuccessful pessary fitting. However, no study assessed the influence of prior vaginal delivery vs no prior vaginal delivery on pessary fitting failure. If pessaries are supported by the pelvic floor muscles, prior vaginal delivery (which can cause pelvic floor muscles damage) could be a risk factor for failure, even if POP mostly occurs in parous women. Being sexually active and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use are not associated with (un) successful pessary fitting. Therefore, a sexually active woman with POP can be encouraged to try this treatment option and prescribing HRT only in case of indication is confirmed to be good practice.

Interestingly, advanced POP stage (3–4) is not associated with unsuccessful fitting. Therefore, pessary treatment can be advised to women with any stage of POP. Predominant anterior, apical or posterior compartment POPs are also not associated with unsuccessful fitting. However, higher CRADI-8 scores (which assess colorectal symptoms) and solitary predominant posterior compartment POP (i.e. maximum POP stage only in the posterior compartment, while women with multiple predominant compartments being excluded) are associated with unsuccessful fitting. These results confirm that pessary treatment is less effective in relieving colorectal symptoms.

### Mechanical devices for pelvic organ prolapse in women [^114fz8Cm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse is common, with some degree of prolapse seen in up to 50% of parous women in a clinic setting although many are asymptomatic. A number of symptoms may be associated with prolapse and treatments include surgery, mechanical devices and conservative therapies. A variety of mechanical devices or pessaries are described which aim to alleviate the symptoms of prolapse and avert or delay the need for surgery.

Objectives

To determine the effects of mechanical devices for pelvic organ prolapse.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register (24 February 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2003), PREMEDLINE (15 January 2003), EMBASE (January 1996 to January 2003), CINAHL (January 1982 to February 2003), PEDro (October 2003), the UK National Research Register (Issue 3, 2003), Controlled Clinical Trials (April 2003) and ZETOC (April 2003). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials which included a mechanical device for pelvic organ prolapse in one arm of the study.

Data Collection and Analysis

No eligible, completed, published or unpublished randomised controlled studies were found, therefore no data collection or analysis was possible.

Main Results

There was a dearth of studies on the use of mechanical devices and no published reports of randomised trials were identified. One study on pessary usage was excluded as it was not a randomised trial.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials upon which to base treatment of women with pelvic organ prolapse through the use of mechanical devices/pessaries. There is no consensus on the use of different types of device, the indications, nor the pattern of replacement and follow-up care. There is an urgent need for randomised studies to address the use of mechanical devices in comparison with no treatment, surgery and conservative measures.

Sexual activity with pessaries — counseling and evidence: Ring and dish shape pessaries are less likely to obstruct penetrative sexual activity, but there is no research regarding sexual intercourse in women who use other types of pessaries; sexual activity and satisfaction were found to improve in women who used pessaries in 2 studies, and the International Society for Sexual Medicine cautions that not all pessaries can be worn during intercourse while noting benefits to self-confidence, body image, arousal, and satisfaction. In the Delphi survey, 75% (6 participants) strongly agreed and 25% (2 participants) weakly agreed with counseling, and the writing group recommends counseling women that sexual intercourse is safe to attempt with a pessary in place, but there are no data regarding the effects on their sexual partners.

### Self-management of vaginal cube pessaries may be a game changer for pelvic organ prolapse treatment: a long-term follow-up study [^114p7n5V]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Commonly, pessary use is considered a suitable treatment primarily for elderly women who are not eligible candidates for surgery or who do not wish to undergo surgery and for women who may yet bear children. In our current study, almost one third of the long-term cube pessary users were premenopausal (age ≤ 55 years), consistent with previously reported data. Our findings support the recommendation that self-managed vaginal pessaries should be among the treatment options primarily offered to premenopausal women with symptomatic POP. In our experience, the success of pessary self-management depends largely on patient willingness to adhere to the treatment plan and a good pessary-size fit.

Pessary therapy is often viewed as a means of delaying surgery. However, older age is associated with greater risks of anesthesia-related ASEs and postoperative recovery complications. Thus far, however, there are no available data addressing the question of whether delayed surgery for POP increases the risk of bad outcomes or complications.

In a previous study, we found that 21.5% of women who attempted a pessary fitting for POP recurrence after vaginal/pelvic floor reconstructive surgery could not be fitted successfully owing to surgically altered anatomy. The probability of failure was 18.8% after one surgery and 27.3% after two surgeries. Thus, it is important for gynecologists to be aware that surgery remains an option after first-line pessary therapy if it fails, whereas first-line surgery will preclude successful subsequent pessary use in a substantial minority of patients.

In a prior study we found that excess vaginal space is a marker of prolapse stage and a risk factor for POP recurrence. Our finding of common cube-pessary downsizing suggests that the intervention might actually improve POP in addition to relieving symptoms. That is, excess vaginal space, which correlates with the severity of an expanded genital hiatus, may become reduced with long-term cube-pessary use.

### Vaginal pessary for pelvic organ prolapse: a French multidisciplinary survey [^114b6ZC8]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective: Pessary fitting and follow-up for women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) can be performed by different health care practitioners (HCPs). We aimed to investigate knowledge and current practices among the main HCPs involved in pessary use in France. Materials and Methods: We sent an electronic questionnaire about pessary use to the members of eight French learned societies between April and October 2020. Results: During the study period, 1017 HCPs responded to the questionnaire: 712 (70.0%) were doctors, 208 (20.4%) physiotherapists, 95 (9.3%) midwives, and 7 (0.6%) nurses. Of the respondents, 69.1% claimed to be comfortable with pessary fitting and follow-up, and 54.1% think that a pessary can be offered as a first-line treatment in the management of POP. However, 60.1% reported that the main indications for pessaries were "older women", 71.3% for women with contraindications to surgery, and 60.5% for women waiting for surgery. 23.9% do not prescribe local estrogen therapy with a pessary for postmenopausal women. The main pessaries used are the ring and cube types (63.7 and 57.5%, respectively). Wide introitus (53.3%), difficulties of use (56.3%), a short vagina (41.4%), and major unmasked urinary incontinence (47.2%) are considered to be the main risk factors for pessary failure. The most common complications related to pessaries reported by the patients are vaginal discharge (48.6%) and pain or discomfort (40.6%). Up to 43.4% of respondents considered that a follow-up visit every 3–6 months was optimal. The need for training ranged from 42.8% for nurses to 65.2% for general practitioners. Conclusions: This national multidisciplinary survey revealed that HCPs in France are on the whole comfortable with pessaries and mainly prescribe the ring and cube form. Even if opinion about pessaries appears to be changing, HCPs would welcome additional training to improve knowledge and practices.

### Self-management of vaginal pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse [^114NQCGx]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Problem

While there is evidence that vaginal pessaries are a valid treatment option for pelvic organ prolapse there is very little data regarding the optimal management pathway for women using pessaries. Women in North America are routinely taught how to change their own pessary. A survey by the American Urogynaecological Society in 2000 reported 57% of its members taught women self-management. However, practice in the UK is very different; a recent multi-professional survey reported that only 17% of health care professionals offer the option of pessary self-managementThis means that most women in the UK attend a healthcare professional for a pessary change every six months. This represents a significant use of healthcare resources. Women are not being offered the option of self-managing their condition and are obliged to attend appointments for pessary changes. This is one of the factors that may contribute to women deciding to opt for surgical management.

Previous spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a strong risk indicator for recurrent preterm birth (PTB). Cervical cerclage is an accepted intervention to prevent recurrent PTB in high risk patients. Cervical pessary might be a less invasive alternative. The objective of this study is to determine whether a cervical pessary is non-inferior to cerclage in the prevention of recurrent PTB.

Methods

We performed an international, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial in 21 hospitals between March 2014 and December 2022. We included singleton pregnancies with an indication for cerclage based on either multiple previous sPTBs < 34 weeks or with a previous sPTB < 34 weeks and an asymptomatic mid-trimester short cervix (≤ 25 mm). Randomisation was 1:1, stratified by centre and indication, to cervical pessary or vaginal cerclage. Primary outcome was PTB < 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included (s)PTB rates, obstetric, and maternal outcomes and a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes including perinatal mortality and severe neonatal morbidity. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Treatment effect was expressed as relative risk (RR), absolute risk difference (aRD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sample size was calculated at 400 participants with a non-inferiority margin for pessary of 10%, meaning that non-inferiority is proven if the upper limit of the CI of the risk difference is < 10%. Trial registration at ICTRP: NL-OMON26958.

Findings

We randomised 261 participants to pessary (n = 133) or cerclage (n = 128). After the third interim analysis (n = 228 participants), recruitment was halted due to safety concerns and the apparent challenge in establishing non-inferiority of pessary treatment. PTB < 32 weeks occurred in 44/130 cases after pessary vs 30/125 cases after cerclage (33.8% vs 24.0% aRR 1.4, 95% CI 0.95–2.1, p = 0.09, aRD 9.8% 95% CI -1.2 to 20.9). The composite of adverse perinatal outcomes occurred in 42 cases after pessary compared to 29 cases in cerclage (32.2% vs 23.2%; RR 1.4 95% CI 0.93–2.1 p = 0.1) and consisted mainly of perinatal death (22.3% vs 14.4% RR 1.5 95% CI 0.9–2.6 p = 0.1).

Interpretation

Non-inferiority of cervical pessary compared to cerclage in preventing recurrent PTB < 32 weeks was not proven. Cerclage is the recommended treatment.

Vaginal erosion from pessary — If a patient develops an erosion from a pessary, clinical management requires a risk/benefit discussion regarding continued use of the pessary. There are multiple case reports that alert clinicians to the risk of vaginal erosions or fistula formation if pessaries are neglected, and clinicians should emphasize the importance of regular follow-up to assess the integrity of the vaginal epithelium. There are limited data to predict who is at risk of vaginal erosions and, therefore, all patients should have a vaginal examination during their follow-up visits. Consensus was reached in the Delphi survey, 87.5% (7 participants) strongly agreed and 12.5% (1 participant) weakly agreed with the statement. The writing group recommends that clinicians discuss the risk and benefits of continuing pessary use in patients with a known history of vaginal erosions, noting that regarding the next step, 3 options are presented, in Q24 (use of vaginal estrogen), Q25 (temporary removal of the pessary), and Q26 (change to a smaller pessary or to a different pessary shape).

Complications of pessary use — classification of vaginal epithelial changes is as follows: There are 4 levels of effects of the pessary on vaginal tissue, and vaginal epithelial changes from pessaries can be classified as either (1) erythema, (2) abrasion, (3) erosion/ulceration, or (4) fistula. It is well understood that pessaries have the potential to cause vaginal injury, yet there is currently no standardized system for naming or grading these injuries.
