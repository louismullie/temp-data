## Question

35. **La ecografía transfontanelar de un recién nacido prematuro asfixiado señala**: "sangrado que compromete la matriz germinal sin agrandamiento de los ventriculos laterales". ¿A qué grado de hemorragia intraventricular corresponde?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which Papile grade corresponds to a cranial ultrasound showing germinal matrix hemorrhage without ventricular enlargement in a preterm infant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the Papile classification and its exact grade definitions. Then, I should verify how ventricular size and parenchymal involvement change the grade. Next, I will match the described findings to the correct grade. Finally, I should consider clinical implications and confirm there are no modifiers that would reclassify this case.

> Let me first confirm the Papile grading framework. The Papile classification defines four grades: Grade 1 is hemorrhage confined to the germinal matrix, Grade 2 is intraventricular hemorrhage without ventricular dilatation, Grade 3 is intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation, and Grade 4 is parenchymal hemorrhage, which is actually a periventricular hemorrhagic infarction rather than an extension of IVH per se, although it is often grouped with severe IVH in outcomes literature.

> Wait, let me verify the key discriminators. The progression from Grade 1 to Grade 2 hinges on extension into the lateral ventricles, and the progression to Grade 3 requires ventricular dilatation; Grade 4 reflects parenchymal involvement and is not simply more ventricular blood. Importantly, the original Papile schema and contemporary pediatric summaries align on these boundaries, so I should not overcall ventricular involvement if the report explicitly states no ventricular enlargement and no parenchymal bleed.

> Now, I will examine the specific findings. The ultrasound shows bleeding involving the germinal matrix with no ventricular enlargement; there is no mention of intraventricular extension or parenchymal hemorrhage. Hold on, I should verify that this pattern fits Grade 1 rather than Grade 2; yes, because Grade 2 requires intraventricular extension even if the ventricles are not dilated, and here there is no documented intraventricular blood, so this remains confined to the germinal matrix.

> I should double-check for any modifiers that could shift the grade. If there were subtle intraventricular blood without frank ventriculomegaly, that would be Grade 2; if there were ventricular enlargement, that would be Grade 3; if there were parenchymal hemorrhage, that would be Grade 4. But the report explicitly excludes ventricular enlargement and parenchymal involvement, so none of those modifiers apply here.

> Conclusion: This corresponds to Papile Grade 1 intraventricular hemorrhage, defined as germinal matrix hemorrhage without extension into the ventricles and without ventricular dilatation. I need to ensure follow-up ultrasound is planned because a subset of Grade 1 hemorrhages can evolve, but the current classification based on the described imaging is Grade 1 [^114uwmuR].

La descripción corresponde a **hemorragia de grado I** según la clasificación de Papile, definida como sangrado confinado a la matriz germinal sin extensión ventricular ni ventriculomegalia. Esta es la forma más leve de hemorragia intraventricular en prematuros y suele tener un mejor pronóstico que los grados superiores, aunque requiere seguimiento con ecografía serial para detectar posibles complicaciones [^111WeVDP] [^113VH1V8].

## Clasificación de Papile para hemorragia intraventricular

La clasificación de Papile, ampliamente utilizada en la práctica clínica, **categoriza la HIE en prematuros en cuatro grados** según la extensión y severidad del sangrado:

| **Grado** | **Descripción** |
|-|-|
| Grado I | Hemorragia confinada a la matriz germinal sin extensión ventricular ni ventriculomegalia. |
| Grado II | Hemorragia intraventricular sin ventriculomegalia. |
| Grado III | Hemorragia intraventricular con ventriculomegalia. |
| Grado IV | Hemorragia intraparenquimatosa asociada a infarto periventricular. |

---

Según esta clasificación, el caso descrito — sangrado en la matriz germinal sin agrandamiento ventricular — **corresponde claramente al grado I** [^112cEoss] [^114uwmuR].

---

## Implicaciones clínicas y pronóstico

La hemorragia de grado I suele tener un **pronóstico favorable**, con menor riesgo de secuelas neurológicas graves en comparación con los grados II-IV. Sin embargo, aun así conlleva un riesgo aumentado de complicaciones menores y requiere seguimiento estrecho con ecografías seriales para monitorizar la evolución y descartar progresión o complicaciones como hidrocefalia posthemorrágica [^111WeVDP] [^113VH1V8].

---

## Manejo clínico y seguimiento

El manejo de la hemorragia de grado I es principalmente de **observación y soporte**:

- **Monitorización clínica**: Evaluación neurológica regular y control del perímetro cefálico.
- **Ecografía serial**: Repetir la ecografía transfontanelar según el protocolo institucional (generalmente a los 7 y 28 días de vida) para detectar cambios o complicaciones [^113VH1V8].
- **Soporte nutricional y respiratorio**: Según la condición general del neonato y la presencia de otras comorbilidades asociadas.

---

## Conclusión

La ecografía transfontanelar que muestra sangrado en la matriz germinal sin agrandamiento ventricular **corresponde a una hemorragia intraventricular de grado I** según la clasificación de Papile. Este hallazgo representa la forma más leve de HIE en prematuros y generalmente tiene un buen pronóstico, aunque requiere seguimiento cuidadoso para descartar complicaciones futuras [^112cEoss] [^114uwmuR].

Germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH-IVH) remains a serious problem in the very and extremely preterm infant. This article reviews current methods of diagnosis, treatment and neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants with low-grade and severe GMH-IVH. We conclude that there is still no consensus on timing of intervention and treatment of infants with GMH-IVH, whether or not complicated by post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. The discrepancies between the studies underline the need for international collaboration to define the optimal strategy for these infants.

Intra-ventricular hemorrhage (IVH) occurs predominantly in very low birth weight premature infants. Survivors of severe IVH frequently experience long-term consequences including major neurological deficits. Advances in neonatal and obstetric care in the last decades, have led to a steady decline in mortality and in the incidence of IVH. However, significant improvements in the survival rates small premature infants have led to an increase in the population of newborns prone to IVH. The pathogenesis of IVH is multifactorial. Prematurity of the germinal matrix, fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, hypoxic ischemic cerebral injury and developmental hemostatic abnormalities of newborns are important risk factors. The following manuscript will address the epidemiology and pathogenesis of IVH and review studies regarding potential pro-coagulant therapy.

Methods

Baseline demographic data

All preterm newborns who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the level III maternity wing at Rouen University Hospital between January 2000 and December 2013 and who had a neonatal IVH were included in the study. Infants with major malformations or syndromes, including central nervous system defects, congenital cardiopathies, gastrointestinal defects, and chromosomal abnormalities, were excluded. Maternal and neonatal information from birth to death or hospital discharge were collected in the medical charts and included gender, gestational age, birth weight, head circumference (HC), administration of antenatal magnesium sulfate and steroids, placement of a shunt for PHH and the type of device used, timing of surgery, the occurrence of meningitis and IVH grade.

IVH was defined on the basis of Papile's criteria on cranial ultrasound (cUS) performed in all preterm newborns during the first week of life in the absence of clinical signs according to the following criteria: Grade 1: hemorrhage confined to the germinal matrix, Grade 2: extension of hemorrhage into lateral ventricles without ventricular dilatation, Grade 3: ventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation, Grade 4: parenchymal hemorrhage. Patients with isolated grade 1 IVH were excluded from the study because it is a frequent situation in preterm child before 30 weeks of gestation (WG) and grade 1 IVH are not associated with PHH witout intraventricular bleeding.

The primary outcome was the rate of PHH in preterm newborns with neonatal IVH. Secondary criteria were neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of corrected age considering motor impairment such as cerebral palsy or sensorial disorders, risk factors for impaired clinical evolution at 2 years and predictive factors of evolution to PHH.

Key Points

Question

What are the occurrence and temporal distribution of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in very preterm neonates during the first week of life?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis including 64 studies and 9633 preterm neonates found that the overall prevalence of IVH in preterm neonates has not changed significantly over the past 20 to 40 years. However, IVH earlier than 6 hours of life has been reduced to less than 10% of all IVH events.

Meaning

These data suggest that although preventive measures have been implemented, IVH has occurred later but its prevalence has not been reduced.

### Routine neuroimaging of the preterm brain [^116HCXKG]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Routine neuroimaging of the preterm brain — time of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) occurrence and gestational age risk — is characterized by very early onset and strong association with lower gestational age. The overwhelming majority of IVH in the preterm infant occurs within the first 3 days of life, with approximately 50% of hemorrhages within the first 5 hours and approximately 70% within the first 24 hours; by 7 days, 95% of IVH will have occurred, with a small percentage at 7 to 10 days. The average age of IVH development was 2 days, ventriculomegaly was apparent by 3 days of age, and temporizing neurosurgical procedures were performed 3 weeks after IVH development. Risk for severe IVH is associated with gestational age ≤ 30 weeks' gestation, with the highest risk in infants born at < 24 weeks' gestation, whereas infants born at > 30 weeks' gestation have a low risk unless additional clinical risk factors are present. In a study of 303 infants born at < 30 weeks' gestation, no asymptomatic infants required clinical intervention solely on the basis of screening ultrasonography performed at 7 to 14 days.

Discussion

In this study, based on the long-term outcomes of 122 newborns with neonatal IVH, we report a PHH rate of 18%. Our result is concordant with data in the literature in which the PHH rate varies between 20 and 35%. Risk factors for PHH were high IVH grade and increased HC at diagnosis.

In a recent study based on the outcomes of 97 infants with neonatal IVH, the PHH rate was of 35%, and the first significant risk factor for PHH was the grade of the initial bleeding. In this series, all infants with a permanent VPS had an initial bleeding grade of III or IV on the Papile classification. In our series, 6 of the 22 infants requiring VP shunt had an initial hemorrhage grade of 2 while most studies limited their inclusion criteria to grade 3 and 4. In another study based on 42 infants with IVH and a PHH rate of 26%, the risk factors for onset of PHH were high IVH grade, late onset (later than 1 week after birth) of bleeding and < 30 WG. The absence of a direct relationship between gestational age at birth and PHH could be due to confounding factors and a higher mortality rate in extreme preterm births. We observed that a HC > + 2 SD at diagnosis was a risk factor for shunt dependence. This observation emphasizes the need for early management of PHH before the onset of ependyma lesions leading to a loss of compliance of the ventricles.

The type of CSF derivation device was not a discriminant risk factor for shunt dependence in our cohort. According to current data in the literature, two devices are recommended: the ventriculo subgaleal shunt and the ventricular access device. The use of CSF washing was the subject of an important publication in the year 2003. The outcomes of this technique were discordant: a higher incidence of secondary bleeding but better neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2-year follow-up. According to a recent meta-analysis, there is not a sufficient level of evidence to recommend this strategy. Studies have been conducted to find an alternative to these strategies with the use for example, of iron chelator on animal models, to decrease inflammatory response and prevent the onset of hydrocephalus. These strategies could be applied to patients at risk of developing PHH. CSF biomarkers could be of interest to predict the onset of PHH in these young patients. For example, in a recent study, Morales et al. demonstrated a strong association between the CSF level of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ventricular size.

### Intraventricular hemorrhage among very low birth weight infants in a South African cohort: a retrospective study of trends&short-term outcomes [^116xigzJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. It has been estimated that about one-third of preterm infants are affected by IVH with the highest incidence in infants born less than 26 weeks' gestation, with risk being inversely proportional to gestational age. The prevalence of IVH in studies in sub-Saharan Africa has ranged from 16.2 to 34.2%. The global incidence of severe IVH has been reported as ranging from 5 to 52%.

Premature infants have an inherent risk of IVH due to poor cerebral autoregulation and fragile germinal matrix vasculature. This risk is compounded by a complex interplay of prenatal and postnatal factors. Multiple prenatal and postnatal factors have been implicated including: mode of delivery, lack of antenatal steroids and magnesium sulphate, chorioamnionitis, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis and hemodynamic instability. Most germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhages (GM-IVH) occur within the first week of life and clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to saltatory presentation with insidious onset of symptoms or catastrophic bleed with acute deterioration. Radiologic classification is based on the extent of bleed into the ventricles, the presence of ventricular dilatation and parenchymal hemorrhage. Two widely used classifications are the Papile or Volpe classifications and most outcomes have been predicted based on these classifications.

Despite improving survival of preterm infants, mortality from IVH remains high, ranging from 30 − 60%. About 50% of survivors with IVH develop cerebral palsy, cognitive deficits, behavioral disorders, posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD), or a combination of these outcomes with some degree of neurodevelopment abnormalities reported in even less severe forms of IVH.

IVH has severe and irreversible sequalae and management is supportive; hence prevention is crucial. Factors protective against IVH include administration of antenatal steroids; prompt transfer of pregnant women in preterm labor to a tertiary facility; and optimization of delivery room practices such as maintaining normothermia, ensuring adequate ventilation, and avoiding hypotension.

Unfortunately, these protective factors and practices may not always be readily available in resource limited settings which may increase the incidence of IVH in such settings. This study aimed to characterize risk factors associated with severe IVH in very low-birthweight (VLBW) infants in Johannesburg, South Africa. We strive to further guide modification of existing neonatal protocols for management and prevention of severe IVH.

### Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and neurodevelopmental outcomes in a context of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage: an institutional experience in 122 preterm children [^114zAR4Y]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We conducted a study on 122 patients with a neonatal IVH. Among the 77 surviving patients at 2 years, 22 (18%) required a permanent VP shunt. Clinical evolution was favorable in 38 of the 77 survivors (49.4%). The risk factors for shunt dependence and impaired neurodevelopment were IVH grade and increased head circumference. We emphasize the need for close follow-up of these infants and early surgery in case of hydrocephalus. Among surviving patients, close attention must be given to neurodevelopment because of the risk of long-term consequences associated with this pathology. The development of biomarkers and medical therapeutic strategies may help to predict PHH and reduce its consequences.

Regarding surgical interventions for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, intraventricular hemorrhage, AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend minimally invasive intraventricular hemorrhage evacuation with neuroendoscopy plus external ventricular drainage, with or without thrombolytic use, to improve functional outcomes and reduce permanent shunt dependence in patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH of < 30 mL volume and intraventricular hemorrhage requiring external ventricular drainage.

### Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and neurodevelopmental outcomes in a context of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage: an institutional experience in 122 preterm children [^115f5A5V]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Concerning mortality, we report a rate of 36.9% defined as the rate of mortality during the 2 years of follow-up. In our study, risk factors for mortality were low gestational age at birth and high IVH grade. This rate is concordant with data in the literature. Death was due to extra neurological causes in more than 50% of cases because of the onset of other complications inherent to prematurity (nosocomial infections, enterocolitis.) of children with a PHH.

Concerning motor outcomes at 2 years, 43 patients had a GMFCS ≥ 2. Risk factors for negative evolution were high IVH grade on ultrasound and increased cranial circumference at the time of hydrocephalus management. In a serie of 95 patients, De Vries et al. reported motor impairment in 22% of patients with a PHH. In another study based on 6000 patients, of the 40% who reached 2-year survival, 14% presented cerebral palsy. The prognosis was worse in patients with permanent VP shunt. In a previous study with 400 patients, the rate of motor impairment was 23%. As in our study, all these retrospective studies observed that the rate of cerebral palsy was elevated if we compared them to the rate of cerebral palsy in the cohorts of preterm infants regardless of the presence or absence of IVH. However it was mentionned in several studies that the higher the grading of IVH, the higher the risk of cerebral palsy. This observation may help to explain the reduced cerebral volume and impaired developmental outcomes in patients with IVH.

### Global incidence proportion of intraventricular haemorrhage of prematurity: a meta-analysis of studies published 2010–2020 [^113ix5Dj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate differences and calculate pooled incidence of any intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), severe IVH (Grade III/IV, sIVH) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement in preterm infants across geographical, health and economic regions stratified by gestational age (GA).

Design

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched between 2010 and 2020. Studies reporting rates of preterm infants with any IVH, sIVH and VPS by GA subgroup were included. Meta-regression was performed to determine subgroup differences between study designs and across United Nations geographical regions, WHO mortality strata and World Bank lending regions. Incidence of any IVH, sIVH and VPS by GA subgroups < 25, < 28, 28–31, 32–33 and 34–36 weeks were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

Of 6273 publications, 97 met inclusion criteria. Incidence of any IVH (37 studies 87993 patients) was: 44.7% (95% CI 40.9% to 48.5%) for GA < 25 weeks, 34.3% (95% CI 31.2% to 37.6%) for GA < 28 weeks, 17.4% (95% CI 13.8% to 21.6%) for GA 28–31 weeks, 11.3% (95% CI 7.3% to 17.0%) for GA32-33 weeks and 4.9% (95% CI 1.4% to 15.2%) for GA 34–36 weeks. Incidence of sIVH (49 studies 328562 patients) was 23.7% (95% CI 20.9% to 26.7%) for GA < 25 weeks, 15.0% (95%CI 13.1% to 17.2%) for GA < 28 weeks, 4.6% (95% CI 3.5% to 6.1%) for GA 28–31 weeks, 3.3% (95% CI 2.1% to 5.1%) for GA 32–33 weeks and 1.8% (95% CI 1.2% to 2.8%) for GA 34–36 weeks. Europe had lower reported incidence of any IVH and sIVH relative to North America (p < 0.05). Proportion of VPS across all GA groups was 8.4% (95% CI 4.7% to 14.7%) for any IVH and 17.2% (95% CI 12.2% to 26.2%) for sIVH. Heterogeneity was high (I² > 90%) but 64%-85% of the variance was explained by GA and study inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

We report the first pooled estimates of IVH of prematurity by GA subgroup. There was high heterogeneity across studies suggesting a need for standardised incidence reporting guidelines.

### Antithrombin for the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm infants [^112pFoFk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth remains the major risk factor for the development of intraventricular hemorrhage, an injury that occurs in 25% of very low birth weight infants. Intraventricular hemorrhage is thought to be venous in origin and intrinsic thromboses in the germinal matrix are likely to play a triggering role. Antithrombin, a glycoprotein synthesized in the liver, is the major plasma inhibitor of thrombin thus modulating blood coagulation. Very low birth weight newborn infants have low levels of antithrombin and the risk of developing intraventricular hemorrhage is increased by the presence of hypercoagulability in the first hours of life. The administration of anticoagulants such as antithrombin may offset the increased risk of developing intraventricular hemorrhage. Anticoagulants may also reduce the risk of developing parenchymal venous infarct, a condition known to complicate intraventricular hemorrhage.

Objectives

To assess whether the prophylactic administration of antithrombin (started within the first 24 hours after birth) reduces the incidence of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo, no treatment, or heparin.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2015), MEDLINE (1996 to 22 November 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 22 November 2015), and CINAHL (1982 to 22 November 2015). No language restrictions were applied. We searched the abstracts of the major congresses in the field (Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand and Pediatric Academic Societies) from 2000 to 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and cluster trials comparing the administration of early, i.e. within the first 24 hours of life, antithrombin in very preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks, any birth weight).

Data Collection and Analysis

For each of the included trials, two authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, antithrombin formulation (plasma-derived or recombinant), mode of administration, and duration of therapy, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are intraventricular hemorrhage and severe intraventricular hemorrhage.

Main Results

Two randomized controlled trials, for a total of 182 infants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Both trials compared antithrombin with placebo. We found no significant differences in the rates of intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.30, CI 95% 0.87 to 1.93, typical RD 0.09, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.23; 2 studies, 175 infants; I² = 18% for RR and I² = 42% for RD) and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.04, CI 95% 0.55 to 1.94; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.12; 2 studies, 175 infants; I² = 0% for RR and I² = 0% for RD). Among secondary outcomes, we found no significant differences in terms of neonatal mortality (typical RR 2.00, CI 95% 0.62 to 6.45; typical RD 0.04, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.12; 2 studies, 182 infants; I² = 46% for RR and I² = 61% for RD) and in the other specified outcomes, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The quality of the evidence supporting these findings is limited due to the imprecision of the estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

The administration of antithrombin seems not to reduce the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm infants. Limited evidence is available on other clinically relevant outcomes. Given the imprecision of the estimate, the results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of antithrombin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.

Preterm infants are at risk for perinatal complications, including germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and subsequent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH). This review summarizes the current understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, management, and outcomes of IVH and PHH in preterm infants.

Methods

The MEDLINE database was systematically searched using terms related to IVH, PHH, and relevant neurosurgical procedures to identify publications in the English medical literature. To complement information from the systematic search, pertinent articles were selected from the references of articles identified in the initial search.

Results

This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology and pathophysiology of IVH and PHH, primarily using evidence-based studies. Advances in obstetrics and neonatology over the past few decades have contributed to a marked improvement in the survival of preterm infants, and neurological morbidity is also starting to decrease. The incidence of IVH is declining, and the incidence of PHH will likely follow. Currently, approximately 15% of preterm infants who suffer severe IVH will require permanent CSF diversion. The clinical presentation and surgical management of symptomatic PHH with temporary ventricular reservoirs (ventricular access devices) and ventriculosubgaleal shunts and permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunts are discussed. Preterm infants who develop PHH that requires surgical treatment remain at high risk for other related neurological problems, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and cognitive and behavioral delay. This review highlights numerous opportunities for further study to improve the care of these children.

Conclusions

A better grasp of the pathophysiology of IVH is beginning to impact the incidence of IVH and PHH. Neonatologists conduct rigorous Class I and II studies to advance the outcomes of preterm infants. The need for well-designed multicenter trials is essential because of the declining incidence of IVH and PHH, variations in referral patterns, and neonatal ICU and neurosurgical management. Well-designed multicenter trials will eventually produce evidence to enable neurosurgeons to provide their smallest, most vulnerable patients with the best practices to minimize perioperative complications and permanent shunt dependence, and most importantly, optimize long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Association of intraventricular hemorrhage and death with tocolytic exposure in preterm infants [^114uwmuR]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of IVH

Intraventricular hemorrhage and white matter damage were diagnosed based on cranial ultrasonography (cUS) examination findings, which were collected prospectively during hospitalization until discharge or death. At all the participating centers, qualified neonatologists or radiologists performed cUS. In France, each preterm infant undergoes 1 or 2 cUSs in the first week of life and a weekly cUS during the following 3 weeks as standard practice. The examinations occur less frequently afterward (every 2 weeks). According to the Papile classification, grade I IVH refers to germinal layer hemorrhage; grade II, IVH without ventricular dilatation; grade III, IVH with primary ventricular dilatation; and grade IV, cases of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, referring to large unilateral parenchymal hyperdensity or large unilateral porencephalic cyst possibly caused by ischemic and hemorrhagic infarctions. A composite variable was built for cerebral hemorrhages resulting in 4 mutually exclusive classes. When several cerebral lesions were successively observed, the most severe lesion was considered.

Outcome Measures

In both analyses, the primary outcome was defined as the composite criteria of death and/or IVH. The 4 secondary outcomes were death, IVH, a composite outcome of death and/or grades III to IV IVH, and 3 classes of IVH severity that included no IVH, grade I or II IVH, and grade III or IV IVH. The death criteria included death during labor, in the maternity ward, or in the neonatal intensive care unit. For the IVH criteria, we excluded deaths during labor and in the maternity ward.

### The insertion and management of external ventricular drains: an evidence-based consensus statement: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^113yATV8]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

External ventricular drain (EVD) insertion — hemorrhage incidence and trial criteria — shows wide variability, with rates reported as low as 0%, or as high as 41%. In a cohort where immediate post-procedure CT was performed, Kakarla et al. evaluated 346 patients and found 3.8% tract hemorrhages and 1.5% extra-axial or intraventricular hemorrhages, with an overall hemorrhage rate of 5%. Ehtisham reported 29 EVD placements with six instances of drain-tract bleeding, and hematoma volumes measured as between less than 1–5 cm³. Maniker described 160 patients with CT mostly within eight hours and none after 24 h; hemorrhage was seen in 33%, and 28% had "typically" small (up to 4 cm³) or punctate intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Gardner evaluated 188 insertions with neuroimaging within 48 h; 41% (n = 77) had new hemorrhage, including 13 detected only after catheter removal. In a small randomized controlled trial of patients with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) treated via EVD, asymptomatic bleeding was seen in 5/24 of the rtPA group and 2/24 of placebo, while symptomatic bleeding occurred in 6/24 rtPA and 1/24 placebo patients. In the interim CLEAR III experience, enrollment required stability on CT performed at least 6 h after placement with thresholds of 5 mL increased hematoma volume or 5 mm diameter expansion, and follow-up CTs at 24 and 72 h after last dose plus 30 and 365 days; of 250 patients, 42 (16.8%) had new or increased bleeding, six were symptomatic, only three of these six were catheter tract hemorrhages, and three patients had asymptomatic bleeding noted after EVD insertion but before enrollment. Across sources, symptomatic hemorrhage rates were reported at 0.7% in a systematic review and 2.4% in interim CLEAR III rtPA data, and the literature suggests very low rates of clinically significant hemorrhage related to EVD insertion.

### Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and neurodevelopmental outcomes in a context of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage: an institutional experience in 122 preterm children [^114jZyLL]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a frequent complication in extreme and very preterm births. Despite a high risk of death and impaired neurodevelopment, the precise prognosis of infants with IVH remains unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate and predictive factors of evolution to post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) requiring a shunt, in newborns with IVH and to report their neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age.

Methods

Among all preterm newborns admitted to the department of neonatalogy at Rouen University Hospital, France between January 2000 and December 2013, 122 had an IVH and were included in the study. Newborns with grade 1 IVH according to the Papile classification were excluded.

Results

At 2-year, 18% (n = 22) of our IVH cohort required permanent cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) derivation. High IVH grade, low gestational age at birth and increased head circumference were risk factors for PHH. The rate of death of IVH was 36.9% (n = 45). The rate of cerebral palsy was 55.9% (n = 43) in the 77 surviving patients (49.4%). Risk factors for impaired neurodevelopment were high grade IVH and increased head circumference.

Conclusion

High IVH grade was strongly correlated with death and neurodevelopmental outcome. The impact of an increased head circumference highlights the need for early management. CSF biomarkers and new medical treatments such as antenatal magnesium sulfate have emerged and could predict and improve the prognosis of these newborns with PHH.

Intraventricular antimicrobial therapy in healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis — evidence and agent selection includes that intraventricular vancomycin was shown to be safe and efficacious, and intraventricular aminoglycosides were also shown to be effective; when intraventricular gentamicin was combined with intravenous monotherapy there were no relapses. In a study of 34 consecutive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infections in 30 children, high-dose intraventricular antimicrobial therapy sterilized CSF cultures in 100% of 26 children treated for 3 days or longer. Successful uses include intravenous and intraventricular quinupristin/dalfopristin for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, intraventricular teicoplanin in 7 patients with staphylococcal neurosurgical shunt infections, and intraventricular daptomycin in CSF shunt and drain infections caused by methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and resistant enterococci. Intraventricular colistin (usually formulated as colistimethate sodium) and polymyxin B have been used for gram-negative ventriculitis and meningitis; however, these agents should be reserved for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms. Intraventricular amphotericin B deoxycholate may be required for Candida shunt infections that fail to respond to parenteral therapy and shunt removal.

### Multilocular hydrocephalus: ultrasound studies of origin and development [^113715Zv]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Multilocular hydrocephalus is a complication of neonatal hydrocephalus. Its main feature is the presence of multiple cysts inside the ventricles, which requires a specific therapeutic approach. The case of a preterm infant with intracranial hemorrhage grade II-III and central nervous system infection is reported. The cysts developed at the subependymal layer in the posterior area of the patient's thalamus. Their growth and development were charted by ultrasound imaging for several weeks. These types of cysts may grow to occupy the totality of the lateral ventricles, isolating the temporal horns. Of all the reviewed pathogenic mechanisms, we support the hypothesis of an inflammatory vasculitis at the subependymal level, with the subsequent infarct giving rise to the cysts. The osmotic pressure within the cavities, rather than intraventricular fluid, would account for the enlargement of the cysts.

### Severe intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants: comparison of risk factors and short-term neonatal morbidities between grade 3 and grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage [^115aXMJR]. American Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (without parenchymal involvement) and grade 4 IVH (with parenchymal involvement) are often combined into description of a single entity, usually "severe" IVH, despite different long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Although risk factors for severe IVH have already been well described, it is not known if these risk factors and associated short-term neonatal morbidities are different for grade 3 and grade 4 IVH, and indeed, this clustering of grade 3 and grade 4 IVH into severe IVH precludes further delineation of the potential risk and protective factors that can be altered to reduce the incidence of grade 4 IVH, which is presumably associated with worse outcome compared with grade 3 IVH. We sought to characterize and compare commonly cited risk factors and associated short-term neonatal morbidities between grade 3 and grade 4 IVH in very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. We performed a retrospective review of VLBW (birth weight < 1500 g) infants with severe IVH born between January 2001 and March 2007. Fifty-nine (10.5%) of 562 infants surviving beyond 3 days of age had severe IVH as recorded on routine cranial sonography during the first 7 to 10 days of life, 28 had grade 3, and 31 had grade 4 IVH. Infants with grade 4 IVH were younger [gestational age (weeks), grade 4 IVH versus grade 3 IVH: 25.5 ± 1.7 versus 26.7 ± 1.7, p = 0.02) and weighed less at birth [birth weight (g), grade 4 IVH versus grade 3 IVH: 860 ± 214 versus 1007 ± 253, p = 0.03) compared with infants with grade 3 IVH. Other commonly cited clinical factors that alter the risk for severe IVH, including mode of delivery, pregnancy-induced hypertension, premature and/or prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal fever, maternal bleeding, prenatal steroid administration, maternal magnesium sulfate therapy, 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores, need for delivery room resuscitation (epinephrine and chest compressions), surfactant therapy, presence of refractory hypotension, evidence of early onset culture-proven sepsis, use of high-frequency ventilation, presence of pneumothorax, and hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, were similar between infants with grade 3 and grade 4 IVH. Carbon dioxide tensions (minimum PaC₂, maximum PaCO₂, mean PaCO₂, standard deviation of PaCO₂, and coefficient of variation of PaCO₂) in infants receiving mechanical ventilation during first 3 postnatal days were also not statistically dissimilar. To determine the variables differentiating grade 3 from grade 4 IVH in the study population, logistic regression analysis confirmed only the independent association of gestational age (odds ratio [OR] 0.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5 to 0.9, P = 0.012) and maternal magnesium sulfate therapy (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.9, P = 0.04) with the development of grade 4 IVH. Short-term neonatal morbidities were also similar between infants with grade 3 and grade 4 IVH. Among VLBW infants, the risk of a grade 4 versus grade 3 IVH increases with declining gestational age, but does not appear to be related to other commonly cited clinical factors. This information may be useful for prognostication and may improve the quality of parental counseling.

### Neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage and hospitalization in childhood [^116oVacT]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intraventricular hemorrhage is a serious neonatal complication associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the relationship with other childhood morbidities is unclear. We sought to assess the association of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage with the risk of morbidity up to 12 years of age.

Methods

We analyzed a cohort of 794,384 infants born between 2006 and 2016 in Quebec, Canada, with 4,269,579 person-years of follow-up. The exposure was grade I to IV intraventricular hemorrhage in the neonatal period. The main outcome measure was childhood hospitalization by cause of admission. In adjusted Cox regression models, we estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of intraventricular hemorrhage with future childhood hospitalization.

Results

Infants with intraventricular hemorrhage had a higher incidence of childhood hospitalization than infants without hemorrhage (23.8 vs. 5.7 per 100 person-years). Compared with those with no hemorrhage, infants with intraventricular hemorrhage had 1.56 times the risk of hospitalization (95% confidence interval, 1.43–1.70). The risk was 2.81 times higher for grade III/IV hemorrhage (95% confidence interval, 2.23–3.53). Intraventricular hemorrhage at term was associated with 3.19 times the risk of hospitalization (95% confidence interval, 2.55–4.00), whereas preterm intraventricular hemorrhage was associated with 2.06 times the risk before 28 weeks (95% confidence interval, 1.75–2.42) and 1.87 times the risk between 28 and 36 weeks (95% confidence interval, 1.68–2.08), compared with no hemorrhage at term. Primary reasons for hospitalizations included central nervous system, ophthalmologic, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular disorders.

Conclusions

Intraventricular hemorrhage, especially of higher grades and in term neonates, is a predictor of future risk of hospitalization in childhood.

### Occurrence and time of onset of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm neonates: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^112p4mkB]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review and meta-analysis found that although the occurrence of IVH in preterm infants did not change over time, the time of onset of IVH shifted toward later in life. The very early presentation of IVH now accounts for less than 10% of all IVH events, decreasing 4-fold (35% vs 9%) in the years 2007 to 2023 compared with 1981 to 2006. However, the overall occurrence of any grade IVH and severe IVH has remained unchanged.

Several factors play a role in the development of IVH, including antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal events. Although IVH is an acute event, the exact time of onset is unknown, as IVH is clinically silentin most events, and in many places, the first cranial ultrasonography is performed beyond the third postnatal day. Some experts consider that IVH occurring before 12 hours of life may be associated with antepartum or intrapartum events, whereas those occurring after 12 hours of life are often associated with other postnatal factors. Accordingly, the time of the onset of IVH is critical information that can help clinicians better understand the relationship between certain risk conditions and IVH and assess the value of preventive intervention.

Current recommendations on the timing and frequency of cranial ultrasonography do not support the diagnosis of the exact time of onset of IVH. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends neurosonography in preterm infants within 7 days of birth. Of the 64 articles studied, 56 studies, performed cranial ultrasonography within 24 HOL, and all 64 articles conducted cranial ultrasonography within 72 HOL. Some experts have emphasized the importance of detecting the onset of IVH by performing cranial ultrasonography several times during the first week rather than only once on days 7 to 10, arguing that this allows a better delineation of the timing of injury and identification of antecendence.

### Occurrence and time of onset of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm neonates: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^117BawdQ]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that the overall prevalence of IVH did not change significantly over the past 20 to 40 years; however, the very early presenting form of IVH declined substantially. Less than 10% of all IVH in preterm infants occurred before 6 hours of life. These data suggest that recently implemented preventive measures have the potential to postpone rather than reduce IVH in very preterm infants.

### Neuroendoscopic lavage for the management of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in preterm infants: safety, effectivity, and lessons learned [^112Hx2YE]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Treatment of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in preterm infants is a matter of debate among pediatric neurosurgeons. Neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL) has been proposed as a suitable technique for the management of this pathology. The authors present their experience with 46 patients treated with NEL after germinal matrix hemorrhage, describe their technique, and analyze the outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients affected by grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) treated with NEL was performed. Nonmodifiable risk factors such as gestational age, weight at birth, modified Papile grade, and intercurrent diseases were reviewed. Safety analysis was performed, evaluating the incidence of postoperative complications. Effectivity was measured using radiological (frontal horn index and white matter injury), CSF biochemical (proteins, blood, and cellularity), and clinical variables. Permanent shunt rate and shunt survival were analyzed. The motor outcome was measured using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) at 18–24 months, and the neurocognitive outcome was evaluated according to the grade of adaptation to schooling.

Results

Forty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were treated with a single NEL in 21 cases, 2 lavages in 13 cases, and 3 lavages in 12 cases. The mean gestational age at birth was 30.04 weeks, and the mean weight at birth was 1671.86 g. Hyaline membrane disease was described in 4.8% of the cases, hematological sepsis in 43.47%, persistent ductus arteriosus in 23.9%, and necrotizing enterocolitis in 10.9% of the cases. Modified Papile grade III and IV IVHs were observed in 60.9% and 39.1% of the cases, respectively. Postoperative infection was diagnosed in 10 of the 46 cases, CSF leak in 6, and rebleeding in 3. The mean frontal horn index decreased from 49.54 mm to 45.50 mm after NEL. No white matter injury was observed in 18 of 46 patients, focal injury was described in 13 patients, and diffuse bilateral white matter injury was observed in 15 patients. All CSF biochemical levels improved after lavage. The shunt rate was 58.7%, and shunt survival at 1 year was 50%. GMFCS grades I, II, III, IV, and V were observed in 44.74%, 21.05%, 2.63%, 15.79%, and 15.79% of patients, respectively. Good neurocognitive results were observed in 53.3% of the cases.

Conclusions

Neuroendoscopic lavage was a suitable alternative for the management of IVH in preterm infants in our series. Good motor and neurocognitive results were achieved by this technique, and the permanent shunt rate was reduced compared with historical controls.

### Primary care framework to monitor preterm infants for neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood [^111WeVDP]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia — risk stratification indicates that intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) contribute to increased neurodevelopmental risk, with higher grades conferring greater risk. Grade II to IV IVH confers a very high risk of severe developmental disability, particularly when grade IV IVH, bilateral disease, or need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting is present, and the prevalence of CP in infants with a history of grade III to IV IVH is significantly greater than gestational age-matched controls with additional risks for ID, hearing loss, and vision impairment. Although grade I to II IVH is associated with less risk than grade III to IV IVH, it still carries a very high risk (greater than 10 times the GPP) for CP and hearing loss. Cystic periventricular leukomalacia has been associated with a very high risk of CP and ID, and PVL is described as resulting from hypoperfusion with periventricular focal necrosis, cystic formation, or diffuse white matter injury.

### Low-grade intraventricular hemorrhage and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24–42 months of age [^1119mbJj]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infants with high-grade (III-IV) intraventricular hemorrhage have been reported to have worse neurodevelopmental outcomes than those without, but outcomes of infants with low-grade (I-II) intraventricular hemorrhage are mixed. We sought to compare neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants with low-grade intraventricular hemorrhage to those with no intraventricular hemorrhage. This is a retrospective cohort study of very preterm (≤ 32 weeks' gestation) infants evaluated between 24 and 42 months chronologic age using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd edition, to determine neurodevelopmental outcomes. Linear regression was used to control for potential confounders. There was no difference in outcome scores between groups when controlling for confounding variables. Infants with low-grade intraventricular hemorrhage, however, had higher rates of enrollment in early intervention services (64% vs 49%, P = 0.023). Low-grade intraventricular hemorrhage itself may not significantly increase the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment through the first 3 years of life considering other conditions of prematurity.

### Prevalence of intraventricular hemorrhage and associated factors to in premature babies in selected teaching hospitals in Rwanda [^112bFbGv]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, presented statistics underscore the necessity for focused research and interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) by tackling the maternal and neonatal care factors that play a role in its development. This approach is essential for countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2, which seeks to lower neonatal mortality rates to 12 per 1,000 live births and to further decrease neonatal morbidities, including IVH.

The Papile classification system, introduced in 1978, categorizes IVH into grades 1 to 4, with grades 1 and 2 indicating milder forms and grades 3 and 4 indicating more severe involvement. Severe IVH is associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes, such as cerebral palsy and developmental delays, and increases the economic burden on families due to extensive medical care and high cost of prolonged neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stays.

Technological advancements in neonatal care have improved survival rates for preterm infants but when not well utilized can introduce risks for IVH, such as those associated with invasive procedures like umbilical catheterization, suction and intubation. Despite improvements in care, the incidence of IVH remains a significant concern. To address this issue, further research is needed to identify effective preventive strategies and optimize the management of preterm infants at risk for IVH. Additionally, enhancing training for healthcare providers on the risks associated with invasive procedures may help reduce the incidence of severe IVH.

In Rwanda, at least 35,000 babies are born prematurely each year, with 2,600 children under five dying from complications related to preterm birth. A 2022 study by Bankundiye and colleagues. found a 17% prevalence of IVH among extremely low birth weight infants in selected teaching hospitals. However, this study had methodological limitations and focused uniquely on extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, leaving a gap in understanding the prevalence and risk factors of IVH among all preterm infants. Therefore, to address this gap, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of IVH in premature babies and contributing factors in selected teaching hospitals in Kigali. By providing comprehensive data, this research seeks to inform the development of effective preventive strategies and interventions to improve health outcomes for preterm infants in Rwanda.

### Routine neuroimaging of the preterm brain [^1136ut1j]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Preterm IVH and periventricular white matter injury — gestational age gradients, cohort rates, and risk factors are detailed. A multicenter database "demonstrated an overall 24.6% incidence of IVH and an 8.1% rate of severe IVH, defined as grade III or IV among more than 50 000 VLBW infants". In another survey, "63% of infants born at 22 to 23 6/7 weeks' gestation had IVH, with 36% demonstrating severe IVH", decreasing to "14% of infants whose gestational age at birth was 30 to 31 6/7 weeks having any IVH and 1.4% having a severe grade". Among extremely preterm infants, "no significant difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months" was found between those "with and without these low-grade hemorrhages" in a study "of 1472 infants born at less than 27 weeks' gestational age". For white matter injury, "Most cystic PVL occurs in infants born between 26 and 30 weeks' gestational age", while "Periventricular hemorrhagic infarcts (PVHIs)… occur mainly in infants born at < 26 weeks' gestation and occur infrequently in infants born beyond 30 weeks' gestation". Developmentally, the germinal matrix "decreases in size from 2.5 mm in the 24-week preterm infant to involution at about 36 weeks' gestational age", and "the more moderate and late preterm infants (those born between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks' gestation) are at less risk for significant intracranial injury". In moderately preterm infants "born between 29 and 33 weeks' gestation, 60% of a cohort of 7021 infants underwent cranial imaging, and 15% of these 4184 infants had ultrasonographic abnormalities", with rates of "severe IVH and cystic PVL" of "1.7% and 2.6%, respectively". Risk factors "such as abnormal neurologic examination… increased the chance of detecting an abnormality by fourfold" in "infants born at 33 to 36 weeks' gestational age", and in a similar cohort "infants born at > 30 weeks' gestation" with significant abnormalities typically had "clinically significant events… which warranted the cranial ultrasonographic investigations".

### Neurodevelopmental outcomes of premature infants with intraventricular hemorrhage across a lifespan [^112FeWhr]. Seminars in Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurodevelopmental impairment rates remain high among extremely preterm and very low birth weight infants. This review describes the rates of brain injury and neuro-developmental impairment at 2,3 years, early school age, adolescence, and young adulthood for survivors with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Former preterm infants with a history of high-grade IVH are at the greatest risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. There is variability, however, in definitions of brain injury, methods for assessing brain injury, and definitions of adverse outcomes among multicenter networks. Despite differences in methods described in publications, perinatal grade III-IV intraventricular hemorrhage, post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, and white matter injury are consistently associated with increased rates of adverse motor and cognitive outcomes in the first 2,3 years of life, at early school age, in adolescence and early adulthood. Effects of socioeconomic status on outcomes, however, increase with the increasing age of the child. In summary, although preterm survivors of IVH are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes across a lifetime, there is evidence that social and environmental factors contribute to recovery over time.

Counsel individuals on the use of other prevention measures (e.g., knowledge of partner HIV-1 status, testing for STIs condom use). Inform individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior.
APRETUDE should be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-1 negative [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undiagnosed HIV-1 infection who are taking only APRETUDE, because APRETUDE alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV-1 treatment; therefore, care should be taken to minimize the risk of initiating or continuing APRETUDE before confirming the individual is HIV-1 negative.
If recent (< 1 month) exposures to HIV-1 are suspected or clinical symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection are present, use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.
When using APRETUDE for HIV-1 PrEP, HIV-1 testing should be repeated prior to each injection of APRETUDE, and upon diagnosis of any other STIs.
If an HIV-1 test indicates possible HIV-1 infection, or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following an exposure event, additional HIV testing to determine HIV status is needed. If an individual has confirmed HIV-1 infection, then the individual must be transitioned to a complete HIV-1 treatment regimen.
Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from frequent visits and counseling to support adherence.

### Intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm children: mortality and neurodevelopment at age 5 [^116XPd3W]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objectives were to describe mortality and causes of death in children with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and to study neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Methods

The study was a secondary analysis of the French national prospective and population-based cohort EPIPAGE-2. Children were recruited in 2011. A standardized assessment was conducted at age 5. Children born before 32 weeks' gestation and admitted to a NICU were eligible. Exposure was IVH defined by the Papile classification. Main outcomes were mortality, causes of death, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5.

Results

Among the 3468 children included, 578 (16.7%) had grade 1 IVH, 424 (12.2%) grade 2 IVH, and 114 (3.3%) grade 3 IVH; 144 (4.1%) had intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). Mortality was 29.7% (36 of 114) for children with grade 3 IVH and 74.4% (109 of 144) for those with IPH; 67.6% (21 of 31) and 88.7% (86 of 97) of deaths, respectively, were because of withholding and withdrawing of life-sustaining treatment. As compared with no IVH, low-grade IVH was not associated with measured neurodevelopmental disabilities at age 5. High-grade IVH was associated with moderate and severe neurodevelopmental disabilities, reduced full-scale IQ, and cerebral palsy.

Conclusions

Rates of neurodevelopmental disabilities at age 5 did not differ between children without IVH and those with low-grade IVH. For high-grade IVH, mortality rate was high, mostly because of withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, and we found a strong association with overall neurodevelopmental disabilities in survivors.

### Occurrence and time of onset of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm neonates: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^116z86Dn]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has been described to typically occur during the early hours of life (HOL); however, the exact time of onset is still unknown.

Objective

To investigate the temporal distribution of IVH reported in very preterm neonates.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched on May 9, 2024.

Study Selection

Articles were selected in which at least 2 cranial ultrasonographic examinations were performed in the first week of life to diagnose IVH. Studies with only outborn preterm neonates were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted independently by 3 reviewers. A random-effects model was applied. This study is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. The Quality in Prognostic Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The overall occurrence of any grade IVH and severe IVH among preterm infants was calculated along with a 95% CI. The temporal distribution of the onset of IVH was analyzed by pooling the time windows 0 to 6, 0 to 12, 0 to 24, 0 to 48, and 0 to 72 HOL. A subgroup analysis was conducted using studies published before and after 2007 to allow comparison with the results of a previous meta-analysis.

Results

A total of 21 567 records were identified, of which 64 studies and data from 9633 preterm infants were eligible. The overall rate of IVH did not decrease significantly before vs after 2007 (36%; 95% CI, 30%-42% vs 31%; 95% CI, 25%-36%), nor did severe IVH (10%; 95% CI, 7%-13% vs 11%; 95% CI, 8%-14%). The proportion of very early IVH (up to 6 HOL) after 2007 was 9% (95% CI, 3%-23%), which was 4 times lower than before 2007 (35%; 95% CI, 24%-48%). IVH up to 24 HOL before and after 2007 was 44% (95% CI, 31%-58%) and 25% (95% CI, 15%-39%) and up to 48 HOL was 82% (95% CI, 65%-92%) and 50% (95% CI, 34%-66%), respectively.

Conclusion and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that the overall prevalence of IVH in preterm infants has not changed significantly since 2007, but studies after 2007 showed a later onset as compared with earlier studies, with only a small proportion of IVHs occurring before 6 HOL.

### Association between early echocardiography screening of low systemic blood flow and intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants: a multicenter cohort study [^116koEkz]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early echocardiography screening of low systemic blood flow reduces intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants.

Study Design

Prospective multicenter study in preterm infants below 33 weeks of gestational age at nine neonatal units. Five units performed early echocardiography screening for low systemic blood flow and guided clinical management (exposure group) and 4 units did not (control group). Our main outcome was ≥ grade II intraventricular hemorrhage or death within the first 7 days of life. The main analysis used the inverse probability of treatment weighting.

Results

Three hundred and thirty-two preterm infants (131 in the exposure group and 201 in the control group) were included. Exposure to early echocardiography screening was associated with a significant reduction in ≥ grade II intraventricular hemorrhage or early death [odds ratio 0.285 (95% CI: 0.133–0.611); p = 0.001].

Conclusions

Early echocardiography screening for low systemic blood flow may reduce the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants.

### Recommendations for measuring HIV reservoir size in cure-directed clinical trials [^114N8uGj]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Therapeutic strategies are being clinically tested either to eradicate latent HIV reservoirs or to achieve virologic control in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Attaining this goal will require a consensus on how best to measure the numbers of persistently infected cells with the potential to cause viral rebound after antiretroviral-therapy cessation in assessing the results of cure-directed strategies in vivo. Current measurements assess various aspects of the HIV provirus and its functionality and produce divergent results. Here, we provide recommendations from the BEAT-HIV Martin Delaney Collaboratory on which viral measurements should be prioritized in HIV-cure-directed clinical trials.

### Ventriculo-peritoneal shunting devices for hydrocephalus [^116ckh2c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydrocephalus is a common neurological disorder, caused by a progressive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the intracranial space that can lead to increased intracranial pressure, enlargement of the ventricles (ventriculomegaly) and, consequently, to brain damage. Ventriculo-peritoneal shunt systems are the mainstay therapy for this condition, however there are different types of shunt systems.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of conventional and complex shunt devices for CSF diversion in people with hydrocephalus.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2020 Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020); Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to February 2020); Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS) (1980 to February 2020); ClinicalTrials.gov; and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials of different types of ventriculo-peritoneal shunting devices for people with hydrocephalus. Primary outcomes included: treatment failure, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Due to the scarcity of data, we performed a Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) incorporating GRADE for the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six studies with 962 participants assessing the effects of standard valves compared to anti-syphon valves, other types of standard valves, self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves and external differential programmable pressure valves. All included studies started in a hospital setting and offered ambulatory follow-up. Most studies were conducted in infants or children with hydrocephalus from diverse causes. The certainty of the evidence for most comparisons was low to very low. 1. Standard valve versus anti-syphon valve Three studies with 296 randomised participants were included under this comparison. We are uncertain about the incidence of treatment failure in participants with standard valve and anti-syphon valves (very low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves (range 0 to 1.9%) and anti-syphon valves (range 0 to 2.9%) (low certainty of the evidence). Mortality may be similar in those with standard valves (0%) and anti-syphon valves (0.9%) (RD 0.01%, 95% CI -0.02% to 0.03%, low certainty of the evidence). Ventricular size and head circumference may be similar in those with standard valves and anti-syphon valves (low certainty of the evidence). None of the included studies reported the quality of life of participants. 2. Comparison between different types of standard valves Two studies with 174 randomised participants were included under this comparison. We are uncertain about the incidence of treatment failure in participants with different types of standard valves (early postoperative period: RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.27; at 12 months follow-up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.92, very low certainty of the evidence). None of the included studies reported adverse events beyond those included under "treatment failure". We are uncertain about the effects of different types of standard valves on mortality (range 2% to 17%, very low certainty of the evidence). The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. 3. Standard valve versus self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valve One study with 229 randomised participants addressed this comparison. The incidence of treatment failure may be similar in those with standard valves (42.98%) and self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves (39.13%) (low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves (range 0 to 1.9%) and those with self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves (range 0 to 7.2%) (low certainty of the evidence). The included study reported no deaths in either group in the postoperative period. Beyond the early postoperative period, the authors stated that nine patients died (no disaggregated data by each type of intervention was available, low certainty of the evidence). The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. 4. External differential programmable pressure valve versus non-programmable valve One study with 377 randomised participants addressed this comparison. The incidence of treatment failure may be similar in those with programmable valves (52%) and non-programmable valves (52%) (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24, low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with programmable valves (6.19%) and non-programmable valves (6.01%) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.15, low certainty of the evidence). The included study did not report the effect of these interventions on mortality, quality of life or head circumference. Ventricular size reduction may be similar in those with programmable valves and non-programmable valves (low certainty of the evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Standard shunt valves for hydrocephalus compared to anti-syphon or self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves may cause little to no difference on the main outcomes of this review, however we are very uncertain due to the low to very low certainty of evidence. Similarly, different types of standard valves and external differential programmable pressure valves versus non-programmable valves may be associated with similar outcomes. Nevertheless, this review did not include valves with the latest technology, for which we need high-quality randomised controlled trials focusing on patient-important outcomes including costs.

### Prevalence of intraventricular hemorrhage and associated factors to in premature babies in selected teaching hospitals in Rwanda [^113M8yA7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The total number of premature infants admitted to the NICUs of RMH and KFH over the three years was 416, among whom, 52.2% were male (217), and 47.8% were female (199). This sample included only those infants who met the inclusion criteria of being born 37 weeks before gestation and having complete medical records, including cranial ultrasound results.

IVH prevalence and grading within this subset

A quarter of the sample presented IVH. Grade I IVH was the most prevalent, 12.7% of all cases. IVH was identified in 25.0% of the total sample, equating to 104 babies. Among these 104 neonates diagnosed with IVH, the distribution across the various grades was as follows: grade 1 in 12.7% (53 neonates), grade 2 in 6.0% (25 neonates), grade 3 in 2.9% (12 neonates), and grade 4 in 3.4% (14 neonates).

Intraventricular Infusion of Intraventricular Electrolytes

Administer the Intraventricular Electrolytes provided after BRINEURA infusion is complete.

Use aseptic technique when preparing the Intraventricular Electrolytes syringe for infusion. Label one sterile syringe "Intraventricular Electrolytes" and attach the syringe needle. Remove the yellow flip-off cap from the Intraventricular Electrolytes Injection vial. Withdraw 2 mL of Intraventricular Electrolytes. Discard the remaining unused portion.
Attach the syringe to the extension line (see Figure 6).
Place the syringe containing Intraventricular Electrolytes into the syringe pump and program pump to deliver at an infusion rate of 1.25 or 2.5 mL per hour (Table 1). Set the pump volume limit to deliver 2 mL. Set the occlusion alarm setting to alert at pressure ≤ 281 mm Hg. See syringe pump operating manual for details. Do not deliver as a bolus or manually.
Initiate infusion of Intraventricular Electrolytes at a rate of 2.5 mL per hour.
Periodically inspect the infusion system during the infusion for signs of leakage or delivery failure.
When the Intraventricular Electrolytes infusion is complete, detach and remove the empty syringe from the pump and disconnect from the infusion line.
Remove the port needle. Apply gentle pressure and bandage the infusion site per institution standard of care.

Dispose of the infusion components, needles, unused solutions and other waste materials in accordance with local requirements.

### El enfoque de orientación cognitiva al desempeño ocupacional diario en discapacidades con origen en la infancia [^113sHjQ3]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recomendación 3. Generalización y transferencia

La evidencia actual respalda la capacidad del enfoque CO‐OP para facilitar la adquisición de habilidades y su aplicación inmediata. Aunque la transferencia no se midió en todos los estudios, se ha demostrado que es uno de los elementos clave que diferencia al enfoque CO‐OP de otras intervenciones. Sugerimos el uso de un cuarto y posiblemente quinto objetivo para medir el efecto de la transferencia de la intervención a objetivos no entrenados.

El uso de análisis económicos de salud para captar los beneficios de la intervención más allá de los objetivos entrenados podría abordar una brecha significativa en el conocimiento para respaldar los servicios clínicos y la financiación de programas.

Además, se necesitan estudios longitudinales para examinar la sostenibilidad de estas habilidades a lo largo del tiempo y su transferibilidad a tareas no entrenadas y nuevos entornos. La evaluación de resultados a largo plazo ayudará a comprender el mantenimiento de las mejoras logradas con la intervención y si se justifican sesiones adicionales en el futuro.

### International variation and trends of intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm infants [^116ANWEm]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We identified significant variation in grade 3 or 4 IVH rates and composite outcome rates of grade 3 or 4 IVH or death between 10 international neonatal networks, despite similar population characteristics. Previous studies regarding grade 3 or 4 IVH generally focus on singular country's outcomes, stratified by other measures such as birthweight. Previous meta-analysis has reported on IVH variation between different countries, with the range of grade 3 or 4 IVH rate between 6 and 22%. Reports from the USA predominate the amalgamated study data and high heterogeneity in the included population characteristics and time period amongst studies from other countries limits interpretations. Our study fills a data gap by comparing IVH rates internationally with harmonized definitions. The large sample size allows for stratification of outcomes by GA. Rates of grade 3 or 4 IVH were higher at lower GA across all networks which reaffirms low GA as a significant risk factor for all IVH.

In a meta-analysis of 2010–2020 publications, Lai et al. reported the international incidence of grade 3 or 4 IVH of 23.7% for < 25 weeks' GA, 15% for < 28 weeks' GA, 4.6% for 28–31 weeks' GA, 3.3% for 32–33 weeks and 1.8% for 34–36 weeks' GA. Our study builds upon these data by further refining the data into smaller GA groups. For example, in ANZNN the rate of IVH grade IV in all < 30 weeks' GA infants (as typically reported) was 5%, masked by the large proportion of higher gestation infants. Indeed, this rate was 23.8% in the 22–23 weeks' GA group and 11.8%, 3.9%, and 1.4% in the 24–25 weeks, 26–27 weeks, and 28–29 weeks' GA groups, respectively.

Adult external ventricular drain (EVD) placement duration and infection risk — There is a positive association between the duration of catheterization and infection, with evidence of increasing risk in the first week after catheter placement; after 1 week the evidence is contradictory, with studies suggesting the risk plateaus, increases, or decreases. One analysis found no difference in infection rates between greater than 5 days and greater than 10 days, and although data are inconsistent, available data suggest an EVD should stay in place for the minimum time necessary and be removed as early as the clinical situation allows.

### Syringomyelia secondary to posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in a preterm infant [^113j9uK8]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Syringomyelia is often associated with hydrocephalus, especially in Chiari malformations, but it has never been described as a complication of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after preterm birth. We report on a premature infant who presented this exceptional association. He was born at 29 weeks of gestational age and suffered a grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage. Progressive ventricular dilatation developed despite repeated lumbar punctures, and a ventricular reservoir had to be inserted for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Two weeks later he presented a flaccid, areflexic paralysis of his left upper limb. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a remarkable tetraventricular hydrocephalus and a cervical hydrosyringomyelia expanding from the C(5) to T(1) segments. After shunt surgery, the cephalic perimeter stabilized, and the infant began to move his arm. On follow-up, a minimal paresis of the left hand persisted. This case highlights an unreported outcome of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. In this context, syringomyelia should be included in the differential diagnosis of any infant with who presents segmental signs of acute or progressive onset.

For more information about side effects, see the section " What are the possible side effects of TRUVADA? "

Other important information for people who take TRUVADA to help reduce their risk of getting human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, also called pre-exposure prophylaxis or "PrEP":

Before taking TRUVADA to reduce your risk of getting HIV-1 infection:

You must be HIV-1 negative to start TRUVADA. You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV-1 infection.
Do not take TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP unless you are confirmed to be HIV-1 negative.
Some HIV-1 tests can miss HIV-1 infection in a person who has recently become infected. If you have flu-like symptoms, you could have recently become infected with HIV-1. Tell your healthcare provider if you had a flu-like illness within the last month before starting TRUVADA or at any time while taking TRUVADA. Symptoms of new HIV-1 infection include:
tiredness
fever
joint or muscle aches
headache
sore throat
vomiting or diarrhea
rash
night sweats
enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin

While you are taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP:

TRUVADA does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to reduce the risk of getting STIs.
You must stay HIV-negative to keep taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP.
Know your HIV-1 status and the HIV-1 status of your partners.
Ask your partners with HIV-1 if they are taking anti-HIV-1 medicines and have an undetectable viral load. An undetectable viral load is when the amount of virus in the blood is too low to be measured in a lab test. To maintain an undetectable viral load, your partners must keep taking HIV-1 medicines every day. Your risk of getting HIV-1 is lower if your partners with HIV-1 are taking effective treatment.
Get tested for HIV-1 at least every 3 months or when your healthcare provider tells you.
Get tested for other STIs such as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. These infections make it easier for HIV-1 to infect you.
If you think you were exposed to HIV-1, tell your healthcare provider right away. They may want to do more tests to be sure you are still HIV-1 negative.

Do not miss any doses of TRUVADA. Missing doses increases your risk of getting HIV-1 infection.
If you do become HIV-1 positive, you need more medicine than TRUVADA alone to treat HIV-1. TRUVADA by itself is not a complete treatment for HIV-1.
If you have HIV-1 and take only TRUVADA, over time your HIV-1 may become harder to treat.

### International variation and trends of intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm infants [^113KsvmK]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We identified GA specific variation in grade 3 or 4 IVH rates in 11 high-income countries. Substantial variation of grade 3 or 4 IVH or death among networks could be partly accounted for by the considerable difference in survival after severe IVH. There is a significant decrease in IVH and death rates in all networks during this study period. These data can act as a tool for benchmarking and further studies to evaluate differences in health system, infrastructure, resources, and clinical practices and to identify and benchmark clinical practices that are associated with lower rates of grade 3 or 4 IVH. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcome data are needed to quantify the impact of this observed variation of grade 3 or 4 IVH rates.

### Development of an integrated risk scale for prediction of shunt placement after neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage [^115z74uh]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, particularly following premature birth. Even after the acute phase, posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus is a long-term complication, frequently requiring permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement. Currently, there are no risk classification methods integrating the constellation of clinical data to predict short- and long-term prognosis in neonatal IVH. To address this need, the authors developed a two-part machine learning approach for predicting short- and long-term outcomes after diagnosis of neonatal IVH. Integrating both maternal and neonatal characteristics, they developed a binary classifier to predict short-term mortality risk and a clinical scale to predict the long-term risk of VPS placement.

Methods

Neonates with IVH were identified from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart administrative claims database. Matched maternal and childbirth characteristics were obtained for all patients. The primary endpoints of interest were short-term (30 day) mortality and long-term VPS placement. Classification of short-term mortality risk was evaluated using 5 different machine learning approaches and the best-performing method was validated using a withheld validation subset. Prediction of long-term shunt risk was performed using a multivariable Cox regression model with stepwise variable selection, which was subsequently converted to an easily applied integer risk scale.

Results

A total of 5926 neonates with IVH were identified. Most patients were born before 32 weeks' gestation (67.2%) and with low birth weight (81.2%). Empirical 30-day mortality risk was 10.9% across all IVH grades and highest among grade IV IVH (34.3%). Among the neonates who survived > 30 days, actuarial 12-month postdiagnosis risk of shunt placement was 5.4% across all IVH grades and 31.3% for grade IV IVH. The optimal short-term risk classifier was a random forest model achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.882 with important predictors ranging from gestational age to diverse comorbid medical conditions. Selected features for long-term shunt risk stratification were IVH grade, respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and maternal preeclampsia or eclampsia. An integer risk scale, termed the Shunt Prediction After IVH in Neonates (SPAIN) scale, was developed from these 4 features, which, evaluated on withheld cases, demonstrated improved risk stratification compared with IVH grade alone (Harrell's concordance index 0.869 vs 0.852).

Conclusions

In a large cohort of neonates with IVH, the authors developed a two-pronged, integrated, risk classification approach to anticipate short-term mortality and long-term shunt risk. The application of such approaches may improve the prognostication of outcomes and identification of higher-risk individuals who warrant careful surveillance and early intervention.

Outcome definitions

Primary outcome

PHH was defined as clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure, including increased HC > + 2 Standard Deviation (SD), bulging anterior fontanel, splayed cranial sutures, strabismus, decline in neurological examination, poor feeding, lethargy, and irritability accompanied by progressive ventricular dilation noted on serial cUS requiring CSF shunt.

Secondary outcomes

Mortality rate was assessed during the two years of follow-up.

Gross motor function was assessed at 24 months of corrected age by the five level Palisano's Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) performed by trained neuropediatricians at Rouen University Hospital. GMFCS ≥ 2 indicated adverse motor evolution.

Language development was assessed by the association of words at 24 months of corrected age using the MacArthur questionnaire. Adverse language development was defined as the absence of words association at the age of 24 months.

Severe visual impairment was defined as bilateral acuity < 0.3. Deafness was defined as bilateral permanent hearing loss requiring amplification.

Statistical analyses

Unadjusted comparisons of neonatal characteristics, IVH grading and patients care between positive and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes were made using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical data and two-sided t-tests for continuous data. Significant univariate variables were included in the multivariate logistic regression model and excluded in a forward stepwise fashion by least-significant variable until all included variables had p < 0.05.

Ethical approval

All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

### International variation and trends of intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm infants [^117Ucn7x]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We aimed to investigate international variation in gestational age (GA) specific severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) rates, among infants of < 30 weeks' GA from the neonatal networks of 11 high-income countries/region.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of outcomes of grade 3/4 IVH rates and composite of g3/4 IVH or death in GA groups of 22–23, 24–25, 26–27, and 28–29 weeks infants admitted to networks of Australia and New Zealand, Canada, Finland, Israel, Italy (Tuscany), Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Their risk adjusted trends across 3 epochs (2007–11, 2012–15, and 2016–19) were also evaluated.

Results

Outcomes of 165,329 infants (median GA 27 weeks, birthweight 950 g) were analyzed. Overall, the lowest grade 3/4 IVH rate was observed in Japan (6.4%) and the highest in Israel (16.1%). The overall gestation-specific rate of IVH grade 3/4 were 25.8%, 18.6%, 9.0%, and 3.8% and composite outcome of grade 3/4 IVH/death rates 52.2%, 33.6%, 15.6%, and 6.7% for the 22–23, 24–25, 26–27, and 28–29 weeks' GA groups, respectively. These inter-network variations were greater at lower GA. In epoch comparisons, almost all networks showed significant decreases in GA specific composite outcome rates, particularly in the 26–27 week' GA group. Japan and Canada demonstrated significant decreases in each GA group while Spain demonstrated significant decreases in each GA group except for 22–23 weeks' gestation.

Conclusions

Rates of grade 3/4 IVH and composite outcome rates varied internationally and have decreased over time. Identification of the driving factors behind variations may allow for opportunities for practice review and improvement.

### Intracranial mesenchymal tumor, FET:: CREB fusion-positive in the lateral ventricle [^115CvXYS]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The type of surgical resection (en bloc vs. piecemeal) could influence the chance of CSF dissemination. Even though we have no data for this particular tumor, given its rarity, data exists for parenchymal brain metastases showing that the risk of local recurrence and of LMD are increased by a piecemeal removal. However, during removal of an intraventricular tumor, a piecemeal approach is often needed to do the resection with acceptable levels of safety, given the tumor's proximity to the ventricular walls and the various nerve tracts that run adjacent to them. If the risk of CSF dissemination is considered high despite the extent of resection, craniospinal irradiation may be the preferred adjuvant approach. However, more clinical data is needed to guide treatment decisions in patients with this tumor type.

Sloan et al. reported the clinical outcomes for 20 patients diagnosed as intracranial myxoid mesenchymal tumor with FET::CREB fusion. Clinical behavior includes local recurrences, dissemination, or metastasis, with better outcomes in patients who have gross total resection. Adjuvant radiotherapy can be an option for locally recurrent and incompletely resected tumors. In our case, even though the patient had a gross total resection, the tumor recurred after 3 years. Additional investigation is needed to fully elucidate the behavior of this entity.

### Combination anti-HIV-1 antibody therapy is associated with increased virus-specific T cell immunity [^115d7suN]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 but requires lifelong medication due to the existence of a latent viral reservoir 1,2. Potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represent a potential alternative or adjuvant to ART. In addition to suppressing viremia, bNAbs may have T cell immunomodulatory effects as seen for other forms of immunotherapy 3. However, this has not been established in individuals who are infected with HIV-1. Here, we document increased HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8 + T cell responses in the peripheral blood of all nine study participants who were infected with HIV-1 with suppressed blood viremia, while receiving bNAb therapy during ART interruption 4. Increased CD4 + T cell responses were detected in eight individuals. The increased T cell responses were due both to newly detectable reactivity to HIV-1 Gag epitopes and the expansion of pre-existing measurable responses. These data demonstrate that bNAb therapy during ART interruption is associated with enhanced HIV-1-specific T cell responses. Whether these augmented T cell responses can contribute to bNAb-mediated viral control remains to be determined.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1166x3xB]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Updated recommendations for HIV laboratory diagnosis state that laboratories should conduct initial testing for HIV with an FDA-approved antigen/antibody combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen, and no further testing is required for specimens that are nonreactive on the initial immunoassay. Specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result should be tested with an FDA-approved antibody immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies, and reactive results on both the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV antibodies, undifferentiated. If the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay is reactive and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is nonreactive or indeterminate, specimens should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT); a reactive HIV-1 NAT with a nonreactive differentiation immunoassay indicates laboratory evidence for acute HIV-1 infection, a reactive HIV-1 NAT with an indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates the presence of HIV-1 infection confirmed by HIV-1 NAT, and a negative HIV-1 NAT with nonreactive or indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates a false-positive result on the initial immunoassay. Laboratories should use this same testing algorithm, beginning with an antigen/antibody combination immunoassay, for serum or plasma specimens submitted after a reactive (preliminary positive) rapid HIV test; Exception: As of April 2014, data are insufficient to recommend use of the FDA-approved single-use rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay as the initial assay in the algorithm.

### Advanced cranial ultrasound: transfontanellar Doppler imaging in neonates [^113h6siP]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

We know that many cerebral lesions are of circulatory origin and it is now important to study cerebral hemodynamics by pulsed and color Doppler ultrasonography. The revolution in the imaging of vascular physiology, the diagnosis, and the prognostic evaluation of vascular disease are not based on morphological sonographic studies but on the Doppler techniques that can display cerebral vessels in the neonate. The results of the hemodynamic investigation in 491 newborns aged from 32 weeks of gestation to 9 months by means of pulsed and color Doppler are reported. Normal values of the resistive index, peak systolic, end-diastolic, and time-averaged velocities in seven different vessels are determined. Some pathological examples are presented. Doppler techniques play a major role in the diagnosis, follow-up, and management of brain damage, whether ischemo-hemorrhagic, infectious, or developmental or tumoral, and of pericerebral collections.

Conclusions

Our results, taken together, show that Tfh support productive HIV-2 infection and represent a key HIV-2 reservoir. Thus, HIV-2 infection of Tfh provides a unique model to identify host factors playing a role in the natural control of HIV-2 replication and to further investigate the generation of HIV nAbs.

### Paediatric cranial ultrasound: assessment of the preterm brain [^113VH1V8]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

A discussion of normal radiological anatomy is beyond the scope of this article and can be found elsewhere. In our institution, screening of asymptomatic premature neonates born at or before 32 weeks of gestational age consists of CUS examinations at days 1, 7, and 28 of life. The first study, on day 1, aims to identify intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH). The second study, on day 7, assesses for increased echogenicity of the periventricular white matter, suggesting periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). It can also monitor the evolution of IVH identified on the day 1 ultrasound or detect interval haemorrhage. The third study, at day 28, is the most sensitive for cystic PVL and also evaluates for post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) in the setting of prior IVH.

### XIII consenso SIBEN sobre traslado neonatal: establecer protocolos estructurados para el proceso del traslado neonatal podría mejorar los desenlaces [^1174SRj3]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

La centralización de los partos de alto riesgo en los hospitales con el más alto nivel de atención es fundamental para ampliar el margen de seguridad materno-neonatal y mejorar los desenlaces. Por lo tanto, es altamente recomendable trasladar oportunamente a las pacientes gestantes portadoras de embarazos de alto riesgo y/o con amenazas de parto pretérmino a centros de atención terciaria, sin embargo, no siempre es posible anticipar los riesgos antenatalmente, lo cual resulta en la necesidad de trasladar a neonatos en estado crítico. Lamentablemente, la movilización de los recién nacidos compromete aún más su estado de salud, especialmente en los países latinoamericanos. El presente trabajo resume los resultados del XIII Consenso Clínico de SIBEN de Traslado Neonatal, en el cual colaboraron 65 miembros de SIBEN, neonatólogos y licensiados en enfermería de 14 países de Iberoamérica, que participaron activamente durante el 2022, antes, durante y después de la reunión presencial que se llevó a cabo en Mérida, Yucatán, México el 12 de noviembre del 2022.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1166CBsE]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — reactive results on the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies, undifferentiated. Available evidence is insufficient to recommend specific additional testing, without clinical follow-up, for specimens that are dually reactive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies on the differentiation immunoassay. Specimens that are reactive on the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and nonreactive or indeterminate on the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT). A reactive HIV-1 NAT result and nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay result indicates laboratory evidence for acute HIV-1 infection. A reactive HIV-1 NAT result and indeterminate HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay result indicates the presence of HIV-1 antibodies confirmed by HIV-1 NAT. A negative HIV-1 NAT result and nonreactive or indeterminate HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay result indicates a false-positive result on the initial immunoassay. HIV-1 NAT results can distinguish acute HIV-1 infection from false-positive initial immunoassay results in specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody immunoassay and a nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay result. HIV-1 NAT does not detect HIV-2, and no HIV-2 NAT is FDA-approved. Available evidence is insufficient to recommend testing for acute HIV-2 infection after a nonreactive HIV-1 NAT result.

### Low concentrations of HIV-1 DNA at birth delays diagnosis, complicating identification of infants for antiretroviral therapy to potentially prevent the establishment of viral reservoirs [^114TKMdU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Among infants exposed to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), detection of viral infection at birth was increased by 39% (95% confidence interval, 19%-47%) by increasing DNA input from dried blood spots into polymerase chain reaction. Infants with low concentrations of HIV-1 at birth may be the best target population to evaluate whether immediate antiretroviral therapy can prevent long-term infection.
