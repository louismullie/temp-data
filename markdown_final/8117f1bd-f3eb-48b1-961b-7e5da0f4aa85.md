## Question

What happens when there is elevated HCG in ruling out molar pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what happens when there is elevated hCG in the context of ruling out molar pregnancy, including how to interpret the result and what steps to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the hCG result with appropriate assays and consider pitfalls like the hook effect. Next, I will integrate ultrasound findings with hCG dynamics. After that, I need to check for alternative explanations of elevated hCG. Then, I should outline management if molar pregnancy is suspected, including evacuation and histopathology. Finally, I will define post-evacuation hCG surveillance and when to diagnose post-molar GTN, and close with counseling on contraception and future pregnancy planning.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because I need to ensure I am not anchoring on a single lab value. Elevated hCG alone does not diagnose molar pregnancy; I should correlate with symptoms such as first-trimester bleeding, hyperemesis, uterine size greater than dates, or signs of hyperthyroidism, and with risk factors like extremes of maternal age or prior molar pregnancy, while remembering that modern first-trimester diagnosis has shifted presentations earlier and reduced classic late complications even though the risk of post-molar GTN remains unchanged [^115Zx3MP] [^116jyUaD].

> Wait, let me verify the hCG assay and result before I jump to conclusions. I should use a quantitative serum hCG assay that detects all clinically relevant isoforms, including intact hCG, free β-subunit, nicked forms, and hyperglycosylated hCG, and I should use the same platform throughout follow-up to avoid inter-assay variability. If the value seems discordant with the clinical picture, I must consider the high-dose hook effect, which can cause falsely low or even negative results at very high hCG concentrations, and I should request serial dilutions or a different assay to unmask the true value [^114HHAvp] [^1178AV8V] [^116jXJoc].

> Next, I should review imaging, because ultrasound is pivotal in the differential. I will now examine transvaginal ultrasound for features such as a "snowstorm" pattern, absence of a fetus in complete mole, or focal cystic spaces with a fetus in partial mole, while remembering that early first-trimester moles may be subtle and that ultrasound sensitivity is lower for partial moles. If ultrasound is nondiagnostic and hCG is above the discriminatory zone, I should still not rely on hCG alone and must integrate clinical judgment and repeat imaging as gestation advances [^115Zx3MP] [^116zyq8f] [^115TWAXW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about molar pregnancy just because hCG is high. I need to check for alternative explanations of elevated hCG, including multiple gestation, hyperreactio luteinalis, retained products of conception, ectopic pregnancy, pituitary hCG in perimenopausal patients, familial hCG syndrome, assay interference such as heterophilic antibodies or biotin, and exogenous hCG exposure from fertility treatments. If the clinical story and imaging do not fit, I should double-check with urine hCG, serial dilutions, or a different assay to exclude phantom hCG before labeling the patient as GTD [^111qB2Rr] [^1113NBs8] [^115mNjtN] [^114HHAvp].

> If molar pregnancy remains suspected, I should confirm the diagnosis with uterine evacuation and histopathology, and I need to ensure the tissue is sent to a center with expertise in trophoblastic disease and, when available, molecular genotyping to distinguish complete from partial mole. I should avoid biopsy of suspected trophoblastic lesions due to hemorrhage risk and plan suction curettage under ultrasound guidance with appropriate cannula size, consideration of oxytocin to reduce blood loss, and Rh immune globulin for Rh-negative patients, while reserving hysterectomy for those who have completed childbearing or for select indications [^113pX79n] [^116jyUaD] [^1117V1TT].

> After evacuation, I should confirm that hCG monitoring is instituted promptly, because this is the cornerstone of detecting persistent disease. Let me think about the cadence: obtain a baseline hCG within 48 hours post-evacuation, then measure every 1–2 weeks until normalization, and continue surveillance afterward according to mole type and time to normalization. For partial mole, many guidelines accept two normal values about 4 weeks apart or a single confirmatory normal value 1 month after the first normal, whereas for complete mole, I should continue monthly checks for 6 months from evacuation if hCG normalizes within 56 days, or for 6 months from the first normal if normalization takes longer than 56 days, given the higher risk of late GTN in the latter group [^117CjSdt] [^111L1rRd] [^116d38kr] [^113WoQao].

> I should double-check the criteria for diagnosing post-molar GTN so I do not miss or overcall disease. Post-molar GTN is diagnosed when hCG plateaus for four consecutive values over 3 weeks or rises by at least 10% for three values over 2 weeks, or when there is histologic choriocarcinoma or metastatic disease; if GTN is diagnosed, I need to stage and risk-stratify using FIGO/WHO scoring, obtain chest imaging and pelvic ultrasound, and avoid biopsy of suspected lesions due to bleeding risk, proceeding to single-agent chemotherapy for low-risk disease and multiagent regimens for high-risk disease [^1155ppQh] [^113JQddB] [^115VFawv].

> But wait, what if hCG normalizes quickly — does that change surveillance? I should confirm that rapid normalization portends lower risk of late GTN. Indeed, women whose hCG returns to normal within 56 days after complete mole have a markedly lower risk of subsequent GTN than those who normalize later, which supports tailoring the intensity of follow-up and shared decision-making about duration, while still adhering to guideline minimums and ensuring reliable contraception during surveillance to avoid confounding hCG interpretation [^113WoQao] [^1122LQ5J] [^112t5amv].

> Next, I should review contraception and future pregnancy planning, because I need to ensure patients do not conceive during surveillance. Reliable contraception is essential during hCG follow-up, and combined oral contraceptives are acceptable and may even facilitate hCG interpretation by suppressing LH; after remission, future pregnancies are generally associated with normal outcomes, though I should arrange an early first-trimester ultrasound in subsequent pregnancies to screen for recurrent molar disease and avoid unnecessary placental histology if the pregnancy is otherwise normal [^1115EPz2] [^1162yDNL] [^115przLo].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, reference-aware approach: elevated hCG raises suspicion but does not diagnose molar pregnancy. I should verify the assay, consider the hook effect, correlate with ultrasound and clinical features, exclude alternative causes, confirm with histopathology when suspected, and implement guideline-concordant post-evacuation hCG surveillance to detect GTN early, adjusting intensity to mole type and time to normalization while maintaining contraception and counseling on future pregnancy planning [^116jyUaD] [^117CjSdt] [^114HHAvp].

When hCG is elevated and molar pregnancy is suspected, **ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool** [^115Zx3MP] [^112wBFhC]; a characteristic "snowstorm" or "grape-like" appearance with no viable fetus strongly suggests molar pregnancy, while normal ultrasound with appropriate hCG rise makes molar pregnancy unlikely. If ultrasound is inconclusive, **serial hCG trends** can help: molar pregnancies often show disproportionately high or rapidly rising hCG, whereas normal pregnancies follow expected doubling every 48–72 hours in early gestation [^1143nGXz]. Persistent or unexplained elevated hCG warrants further evaluation for gestational trophoblastic disease or other causes [^113221BS] [^114oqJf1].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated hCG

- **Normal pregnancy**: hCG rises rapidly in early gestation, typically doubling every 48–72 hours, peaking around 8–10 weeks, then declining and plateauing [^111qB2Rr].

- **Molar pregnancy**: hCG is often markedly elevated (> 100,000 IU/L) due to excessive trophoblastic proliferation, and may be disproportionate to gestational age [^115Zx3MP].

- **Other causes**: Elevated hCG can also occur with multiple gestation, ectopic pregnancy, recent pregnancy loss, or certain tumors [^111qB2Rr] [^112x3pWf] [^1113NBs8].

---

## Diagnostic approach to elevated hCG

### Step 1: clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should include a detailed history of **menstrual history, symptoms, and prior pregnancies** (including miscarriages or abortions) [^notfound]. The physical examination should assess uterine size, adnexal masses, and signs of hyperemesis or hyperthyroidism [^notfound].

---

### Step 2: quantitative hCG measurement

Quantitative hCG measurement should use a **serial assay** to track trends; molar pregnancies often show rapid, disproportionate rises [^1143nGXz]. Interpret results in clinical context, as hCG alone cannot reliably distinguish molar from non-molar pregnancies [^notfound].

---

### Step 3: transvaginal ultrasound

Transvaginal ultrasound is the **primary imaging modality** [^115Zx3MP] [^113221BS]. Typical findings include a "snowstorm" or "grape-like" uterine pattern with no viable fetus, and cystic changes in the placenta with an enlarged uterus [^111DNshY]. Early first-trimester moles may appear nonspecific, so expertise is important [^111DNshY].

---

### Step 4: histopathological examination

Histopathology provides **definitive diagnosis** by distinguishing complete mole (androgenetic diploid, no fetal tissue) from partial mole (triploid, fetal tissue present) [^113pX79n] [^115Zx3MP]. Molecular genotyping can improve classification and prognostic assessment [^116yZFAn].

---

## hCG trends and patterns in molar pregnancy

| **Parameter** | **Complete molar pregnancy** | **Partial molar pregnancy** |
|-|-|-|
| hCG level | Markedly elevated (> 100,000 IU/L) | Moderately elevated (5,000–50,000 IU/L) |
| hCG trend | Rapid, disproportionate rise | Moderate rise, may be closer to normal pregnancy |
| Ultrasound findings | - Snowstorm appearance <br/> - No viable fetus | - Placental cystic changes <br/> - Fetal tissue may be present |

---

## Limitations and pitfalls in hCG interpretation

- **Hook effect**: Very high hCG can cause false-negative or falsely low results on some assays; use dilution or alternative assays if suspected [^1178AV8V] [^116jXJoc].

- **Assay variability**: Different assays detect hCG isoforms differently; use consistent, validated assays [^114HHAvp].

- **Phantom hCG**: Heterophilic antibodies can cause false positives; confirm with urine hCG or alternative assays [^112cqvNd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **RCOG 2021**: Use ultrasound as primary diagnostic tool; confirm with histopathology; monitor hCG until normalization [^113pX79n].

- **SOGC 2021**: Serial hCG monitoring after evacuation until three consecutive normal values; tailor surveillance to risk [^112DqRpr].

- **NCCN 2019**: Use hCG assays detecting all isoforms; monitor until three normal values, then periodically for 6–12 months [^116stspK].

---

## Management of confirmed molar pregnancy

- **Uterine evacuation**: Suction curettage is preferred; hysterectomy if fertility is not desired [^1117V1TT].

- **Post-evacuation surveillance**: Serial hCG every 1–2 weeks until normal, then monthly for 6–12 months [^115przLo].

- **Contraception**: Use reliable contraception during surveillance to avoid confounding hCG interpretation [^115przLo].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence risk

Prognosis is **excellent**, with cure rates approaching 100% for low-risk disease and high overall survival for high-risk disease [^116jyUaD]. Recurrence risk is about 1–2% after a single molar pregnancy and rises with multiple moles; offer genetic counseling if recurrent [^1162yDNL].

---

Elevated hCG alone does not diagnose molar pregnancy; **ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool**, with histopathology providing definitive diagnosis. Serial hCG trends and clinical context guide management, and surveillance after evacuation is essential to detect persistent disease.

The serial measurement of serum hCG concentrations is an important clinical tool used to differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies. At hCG values below which ultrasonography can be diagnostic, the comparison of a patient's hCG dynamics to those of established expected curves of rise or fall can aid the clinician in determining when to follow expectantly and when to intervene. Still, this method has some limitations and should never supersede clinical judgment based on symptoms or signs.

Gestational trophoblastic disease — after uterine evacuation and in the absence of persistent intrauterine disease, we recommend clinicians provide access to all available contraceptive options utilizing a person-centered approach (GRADE 1A). For individuals with persistently elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels or evidence of intrauterine disease who request an intrauterine device, we suggest shared decision-making with the individual and their oncologist (GRADE 2C). The 2024 CDC MEC categorizes GTD with concern for persistent or recurrent intrauterine disease as an unacceptable risk (category 4) for copper and LNG IUD initiation; when a hydatidiform molar gestation is suspected, any contraceptive method can safely be initiated immediately after uterine evacuation.

Background

Analysis of serum beta-hCG aids diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine pregnancies, ectopic gestations, and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. beta-hCG concentrations are specific for trophoblastic tissue, thus are rarely questioned.

Cases

An 18-year-old nullipara had bleeding and a positive beta-hCG. Ultrasound identified no pregnancy. She passed tissue and stopped bleeding. Serum beta-hCG remained elevated despite uterine curettage and three courses of methotrexate. Results of urine beta-hCG were negative, as was reference laboratory serum assay. A 31-year-old nullipara had a spontaneous abortion, but serum beta-hCG remained elevated. Uterine curettage found secretory endometrium, yet elevated serum beta-hCG persisted. Urine beta-hCG was negative, as was reference laboratory serum assay.

Conclusion

Patients with histories incongruent with serum beta-hCG findings should have urine beta-hCG analysis.

### Qualitative β-hCG urine assays may be misleading in the presence of molar pregnancy: a case report [^112wBFhC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy and the diagnosis is usually confirmed with a markedly elevated beta-hCG and a "snowstorm" appearance on pelvic ultrasound. Patients frequently present with a positive pregnancy test, vaginal bleeding, nausea and vomiting. A 23-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with a history of 7 weeks of intermittent vaginal bleeding and 1 h of peri-umbilical abdominal pain. She reported that 7 weeks before this visit she was diagnosed with a miscarriage. The bedside qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test that we performed was negative, but the quantitative serum hCG was markedly elevated. Ultrasound and operative findings confirmed the diagnosis of molar pregnancy. We conclude that rapid urine qualitative hCG assays may not be reliable in the presence of markedly elevated hCG levels found in molar pregnancy.

1 INTRODUCTION

Women experiencing vaginal bleeding and/or pelvic pain in the first trimester are referred to Early Pregnancy Units (EPUs) for clinical examination and ultrasound assessment to determine pregnancy status. The differential diagnosis may encompass pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), an ongoing or failing intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), ectopic pregnancy, or molar pregnancy.PUL describes a situation where the pregnancy test is positive, but there is no visual pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound. With trained sonographers using high‐quality ultrasonography, the PUL rate is generally less than 15%.PUL is a provisional diagnosis that will eventually become reclassified as an early IUP (35%–40%), failing pregnancy (44%–69%), or ectopic pregnancy (8%–14%).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) threshold of 1500 IU/L, above which a high‐quality ultrasound examination, performed by a trained sonographer, should detect an intrauterine pregnancy. This applies to a singleton pregnancy in a woman with a normal body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) and a normal uterus without fibroids. The provenance of hCG thresholds cited in clinical guidelines is unclear. They are likely based on older hCG radioimmunoassays, which are no longer routinely used in diagnostic laboratories and in which hCG concentrations may differ significantly from modern, high‐throughput immunoassays.

Serial hCG monitoring is frequently requested in PUL, as the change in hCG concentrations over a 48‐h period can help to predict a developing ectopic pregnancy. According to clinical practice guidelines, a rise in hCG of greater than 63% within 48 h indicates an ongoing pregnancy, whereas a decline of over 50% suggests a failing pregnancy. If the change falls between these thresholds, women are classified as being at higher risk for ectopic pregnancy and require prompt medical review. Logistic regression models can further classify PUL cases as low or high risk based on the hCG ratio between 0 and 48 h.

4.3 Human chorionic gonadotropin monitoring

For GTN monitoring, an hCG assay that detects all forms of hCG, including beta‐ hCG, core hCG, C‐terminal hCG, nicked‐free beta, beta core, and preferably the hyperglycosylated forms, should be used when possible. A persistently low hCG level needs continuous monitoring as some may progress to GTN with rising hCG levels. To exclude a false‐positive result, retesting with another assay or measuring urine hCG may be used.

4.4 Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after non‐molar pregnancy

Although approximately 75% of GTNs arise after a molar pregnancy, the remainder can occur after a spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or, more rarely, a term pregnancy. In addition to abnormal postpartum vaginal bleeding, clinical presentations can include bleeding from metastatic sites such as the liver, spleen, intestines, lung, or brain. Pulmonary symptoms and neurological signs may also occur, particularly in cases of metastasis to the spine or brain.GTNs should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients with atypical presentations. Measurement of serum hCG should be part of the diagnostic workup. In cases of suspected post‐term pregnancy GTN, imaging studies should include contrast‐ enhanced pelvic and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest computed tomography (CT), and abdominal CT or MRI.

### Surveillance for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia following molar pregnancy: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^116DyGoQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Historically, published guidelines for care after molar pregnancy recommended monitoring human chorionic gonadotropin levels for the development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia until normal and then for 6 months after the first normal human chorionic gonadotropin. However, there are little data underlying such recommendations, and recent evidence has demonstrated that gestational trophoblastic neoplasia diagnosis after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization is rare.

Objective

We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for surveillance for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization after complete and partial molar pregnancy.

Study Design

A Markov-based cost-effectiveness model, using monthly cycles and terminating after 36 months/cycles, was constructed to compare alternative strategies for asymptomatic human chorionic gonadotropin surveillance after the first normal (none; monthly testing for 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; or every 3-month testing for 3, 6, and 12 months) for both complete and partial molar pregnancy. The risk of reduced surveillance was modeled by increasing the probability of high-risk disease at diagnosis. Probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from peer-reviewed literature, with all cost data applicable to the United States and adjusted to 2020 US dollars. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year ($/quality-adjusted life year) with a $100,000/quality-adjusted life year willingness-to-pay threshold.

Results

Under base-case assumptions, we found no further surveillance after the first normal human chorionic gonadotropin to be the dominant strategy from both the healthcare system and societal perspectives, for both complete and partial molar pregnancy. After complete mole, this strategy had the lowest average cost (healthcare system, $144 vs maximum $283; societal, $152 vs maximum $443) and highest effectiveness (2.711 vs minimum 2.682 quality-adjusted life years). This strategy led to a slightly higher rate of death from gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (0.013% vs minimum 0.009%), although with high costs per gestational trophoblastic neoplasia death avoided (range, $214,000 to > $4 million). Societal perspective costs of lost wages had a greater impact on frequent surveillance costs than rare gestational trophoblastic neoplasia treatment costs, and no further surveillance was more favorable from this perspective in otherwise identical analyses. No further surveillance remained dominant or preferred with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of < $100,000 in all analyses for partial mole, and most sensitivity analyses for complete mole. Under the assumption of no disutility from surveillance, surveillance strategies were more effective (by quality-adjusted life year) than no further surveillance, and a single human chorionic gonadotropin test at 3 months was found to be cost-effective after complete mole with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $53,261 from the healthcare perspective, but not from the societal perspective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $288,783).

Conclusion

Largely owing to the rare incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization after molar pregnancy, prolonged surveillance is not cost-effective under most assumptions. It would be reasonable to reduce, and potentially eliminate, current recommendations for surveillance after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization after molar pregnancy, particularly among partial moles. With any reduction in surveillance, patients should be counseled on symptoms of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and established in routine gynecologic care.

### Navigating pregnancy testing in chronic pain management for women of reproductive age [^1113NBs8]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

False Positives

False-positive pregnancy test results can arise in a variety of clinical scenarios. One common situation involves biochemical pregnancies, such as those occurring after miscarriage, abortion, or delivery, where human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) remains detectable in the bloodstream before it has fully cleared. Another cause is the use of exogenous hCG in fertility treatments or performance-enhancing doping, with the hormone remaining traceable for up to two weeks after injection. Certain tumors can also secrete hCG, leading to elevated levels in individuals who are not pregnant. In perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, the pituitary gland may produce hCG, contributing to false-positive results in this population. Test interference is another consideration — high doses of biotin, for example, can distort serum-based assay results, although this typically does not affect urine tests, which remain negative in such cases. Lastly, familial hCG syndrome, a rare inherited condition, can lead to persistently elevated hCG levels, creating a clinical picture that mimics pregnancy despite the absence of gestation.

A false negative may expose a fetus to teratogenic interventions, while a false positive could prevent a patient from receiving potentially beneficial therapies due to fetal risk. Pregnancy testing is a critical tool for early pregnancy detection, but given the above limitations clinicians must interpret results with a nuanced understanding of timing and hormone dynamics.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^1175JVd5]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Complete and partial hydatidiform moles are abnormal conceptions affecting 1800 women each year in the UK (about 220 000 women globally a year) or about 1–3 per 1000 pregnancies. A complete hydatidiform mole is an androgenetic diploid conception lacking maternal nuclear DNA but with two paternal sets of chromosomes. A partial hydatidiform mole is a triploid pregnancy with one maternal and two paternal chromosomal contributions. Molar pregnancies result in aggressive abnormal placental (trophoblast) development that typically causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy. Some molar pregnancies might be undetected because of early spontaneous abortions, but when an abnormal pregnancy suggestive of a molar pregnancy is detected on an early pelvic ultrasound, suction uterine evacuation is usually performed. Histological examination of the evacuated material is essential to make a diagnosis of complete hydatidiform mole, partial hydatidiform mole, or non-molar pregnancy loss. All patients with a histologically confirmed complete or partial hydatidiform mole should then undergo serial measurements of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels to ensure no regrowth of residual trophoblastic tissue has occurred. Persistence of trophoblastic tissue occurs in about 15% of complete hydatidiform moles and 0.5–1% of partial hydatidiform moles where levels of hCG might increase or plateau over at least two or three consecutive values, respectively, indicating the onset of malignant change, also known as postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Early detection is important so that subsequent treatment can achieve a nearly complete cure rate. Almost all postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasias will occur before serum levels of hCG have normalised after uterine evacuation, but in a few cases, malignancy can occur after the first normal hormone value.

### Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113JQddB]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Hydatidiform mole — persistent post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is indicated when human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels plateau for 4 consecutive values over 3 weeks or rise ≥ 10% for 3 values over 2 weeks, or when there is histopathologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT)/epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT), and/or presence of metastatic disease. Staging includes H&P (including pelvic exam), imaging, and determining FIGO stage and prognostic score, with risk stratification defined as low-risk GTN (< 7 prognostic score) and high-risk GTN (≥ 7 prognostic score or Stage IV). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia — post-evacuation hCG follow-up and contraception: The NCCN Panel recommends hCG assay monitoring every 1 to 2 weeks until levels have normalized, defined as three consecutive normal assays, and following initial normalization, consider hCG measurement every 3 months for 6 months; patients should also use contraception and oral contraceptive pills are preferred for at least 6 months. Once normalized, recurrent elevation of hCG has been reported in < 1% of patients, and a study noted that normalization beyond 56 days after uterine evacuation had a 3.8-fold higher risk of post-molar GTN; the occurrence of GTN after normalization is rare after the recommended 6 months of post-normalization hCG monitoring.

Conclusions

In this study, we showed that the overall risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia in patients whose hCG levels had returned to normal in < 56 days was low (posterior median 0.06%), which supports the idea that surveillance protocols can safely change to one confirmatory normal hCG value in this patient group. In those whose hCG levels return to normal in ≥ 56 days, figure 2 provides information for adequate counselling on the risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia over time and will inform shared decision making with patients and providers. Future research is needed to estimate the cost effectiveness and psychological effect of new follow-up recommendations.

Women with invasive mole or choriocarcinoma are stratified into low or high risk GTN categories based on the Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging and modified WHO prognostic scoring system (tables 2 and 3).

Table 2
Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for GTN

Table 3
World Health Organization modified prognostic scoring system for GTN

The FIGO scoring system is endorsed by all international GTD guidelines and is based on three main measures: post-evacuation hCG concentration, presence of metastatic disease, and histopathological diagnosis. A doppler pelvic ultrasound should be performed to confirm the absence of a pregnancy and ascertain the size of any intrauterine tumour. Chest x ray as opposed to computed tomography is the preferred imaging modality for detection of pulmonary metastases. Some centres consider a hCG concentration of 20 000 IU/L or more, four weeks after uterine evacuation as an indication for immediate chemotherapy but this recommendation has not been adopted by FIGO. Genomics might also be incorporated into future updates to the FIGO scoring system to reflect the critical role of molecular genotyping in identifying the antecedent pregnancy for GTN.

### Diagnosis and management of molar pregnancies [^116KvNu1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Complete and partial molar pregnancies arise from abnormal fertilization with marked proliferation of syncytiotrophoblasts. Earlier diagnosis has reduced the frequency of severe medical complications at presentation; however, the risk of progression to gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) has remained unchanged. Initial assessment should include serum hCG measurement after physical examination, laboratory testing for organ dysfunction, and Doppler ultrasound. Following uterine evacuation, pathologic assessment can distinguish complete from partial moles or non-molar gestations. Close surveillance is essential for the timely diagnosis of GTN. Cure rates and subsequent obstetrics outcomes are excellent, but all patients should be referred for psychologic support and expert level care.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gestational trophoblastic disease - NCCN, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation (hydatidiform mole), NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain the following workup for patients with hydatidiform mole:

- history and physical examination

- **Imaging**: Pelvis ultrasound; CXR; If the CXR is positive for metastases, obtain chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT with contrast and brain MRI with or without contrast, and manage as GTN after initial uterine evacuation

- quantitative hCG assay; If hCG is elevated with no evidence of disease on imaging, consider the possibility of LH crossover, pituitary hCG, or phantom hCG. Consult with laboratory medicine or pathology to test for phantom hCG with serial dilution study or comparison of serum to urine hCG

- CBC differential and platelet count

- liver, renal, and thyroid function tests, and chemistry profile

- blood type and screen; Administer Rho(D) immune globulin if Rh negative.

### Negative urine pregnancy test in a molar pregnancy: is it possible? [^1178AV8V]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A urine pregnancy test is commonly used to detect pregnancy and is based on finding intact β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) molecules in the urine by an immunoassay system. However, the significantly large amount of β-hCG in molar pregnancy may paradoxically lead to a false-negative result due to a phenomenon known as the 'high dose hook effect'. A case of molar pregnancy with negative urine pregnancy test but very high serum β-hCG is reported. Every obstetrician should be aware of this limitation in the presence of a high index of suspicion of gestational trophoblastic disease but negative urine pregnancy test.

### Curious phenomenon of' hook effect' in invasive mole [^116jXJoc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Gestational trophoblastic disease is a group of pregnancy-related trophoblastic tumours. Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia refers to its invasive and malignant forms: invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumour and epithelioid trophoblastic tumour. Patients exhibit elevated beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β hCG) levels, sometimes exceeding 100000 mIU/mL. When the serum levels of hCG surpass 500 000 mIU/mL, there is a possibility of encountering a phenomenon called 'hook effect' which causes erroneously low or negative value when using the immunometric hCG assays that are presently available in the commercial market. We present a rare case involving a female in mid-30s with an invasive molar pregnancy presenting with bleeding, an abdominal mass, hypertension and hyperthyroidism. Despite a negative urine β hCG test, her serum hCG, after dilution, was recalculated to over 850 000 mIU/mL. MRI confirmed invasive mole. Post-hysterectomy, she received methotrexate chemotherapy. Her β hCG normalised after two cycles, and she remains disease-free for 14 months.

### State-of-the-art workup and initial management of newly diagnosed molar pregnancy and postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia [^116jyUaD]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). Medium credibility.

Gestational trophoblastic disease refers to a series of interrelated tumors arising from the placenta, including benign molar pregnancies as well as the malignant conditions termed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). GTN most commonly follows a molar pregnancy but may develop after any gestation. The wide availability of first trimester ultrasound and serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurement has changed the presentation of molar pregnancy in recent decades from a second trimester to a first trimester disease, such that most patients have few symptoms at diagnosis. With identification of molar pregnancy at earlier gestations, accurate diagnosis increasingly relies on expert histopathology coupled with ancillary molecular and genetic techniques. However, earlier diagnosis has not changed the risk of postmolar GTN. Although most molar pregnancies are treated with dilation and curettage, hysterectomy may be appropriate in select cases when future fertility is not desired. After treatment of molar pregnancy, close surveillance with serial hCG monitoring is essential to diagnose GTN and identify the need for chemotherapy. Physicians following hCG levels should understand the performance characteristics of the test, including common causes of false-positive and false-negative results. After a diagnosis of postmolar GTN is made, selection of single-agent or multiagent chemotherapy depends on accurate assignment of the clinical stage and risk stratification by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) prognostic scoring system. Surgical treatment of postmolar low-risk GTN, including both second uterine curettage and hysterectomy, may decrease subsequent need for or duration of chemotherapy. Cure rates for postmolar low-risk GTN approach 100%, and subsequent pregnancy outcomes for patients reflect those of the general population.

Discussion

Principal findings

The overall risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normalisation of hCG levels was low (0.2%), with most patients receiving a diagnosis after the current six month hCG surveillance protocol. Moreover, we confirmed that the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was 3.6-fold lower in those whose hCG levels returned to normal in < 56 days than in those with normalisation of hCG levels in ≥ 56 days (posterior medians 0.06%, 95% credible interval 0.01% to 0.14% v 0.22%, 0.15% to 0.31%), with a posterior relative risk of 0.25 (0.06 to 0.72). We have provided an overview of how the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia evolves over time (figure 2), which could be used to estimate the risk in individual patients.

Objectives

This review was undertaken to describe current understanding of the natural history of molar pregnancy and persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) as well as recent advances in their management.

Materials and Methods

Recent literature related to molar pregnancy and GTN was thoroughly analyzed to provide a comprehensive review of the current knowledge of their pathogenesis and treatment.

Results

Studies in patients with familial recurrent molar pregnancy indicate that dysregulation of parentally imprinted genes is important in the pathogenesis of complete hydatidiform mole (CHM). CHM is now being diagnosed earlier in pregnancy in the first trimester changing the clinical presentation and making the histologic appearance more similar to partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) and hydropic abortion. While the classic presenting symptoms of CHM are less frequent, the risk of developing GTN remains unchanged. Flow cytometry and immunostaining for maternally-expressed genes are helpful in distinguishing early CHM from PHM or hydropic abortion. Patients with molar pregnancy have a low risk of developing persistent GTN after achieving even one non-detectable hCG level (hCG < 5 mIU/ml). Patients with persistent low levels of hCG should undergo tests to determine if the hCG is real or phantom. If the hCG is real, then further tests should determine what percentage of the total hCG is hyperglycosylated hCG and free beta subunit to establish a proper diagnosis and institute appropriate management. Patients with non-metastatic GTN have a high remission rate with many different single-agent regimens including methotrexate and actinomycin D. Patients with high-risk metastatic GTN require aggressive combination chemotherapy in conjunction with surgery and radiation therapy to attain remission. After achieving remission, patients can generally expect normal reproduction in the future.

Conclusion

Our understanding of the natural history and management of molar pregnancy and GTN has advanced considerably in recent years. While most patients can anticipate a high cure rate, efforts are still necessary to develop effective new second-line therapies for patients with drug-resistant disease.

### Gestational trophoblastic disease: current evaluation and management [^116d38kr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hysterectomy is an alternative to suction D&E for molar evacuation in selected patients who do not wish to preserve childbearing (Box 2), especially in women older than the age of 40 years, because these patients have a higher risk of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Usually the adnexa may be preserved, even if theca lutein cysts are present. Hysterectomy reduces the risk of malignant postmolar sequelae to approximately 3–5% compared with approximately 15–20% after evacuation by D&E. Because hysterectomy does not eliminate the possibility of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia these patients should also be monitored postoperatively with serial hCG levels.

Surveillance After Molar Evacuation

Serial quantitative serum hCG determinations should be performed after molar evacuation using one of several commercially available assays capable of detecting β-hCG to baseline values (less than 5 milli-international units/mL). For monitoring patients with gestational trophoblastic disease, an hCG assay that can detect all forms of hCG is needed because these neoplasms often secrete abnormal forms of hCG. Free beta, nicked-free beta, C-terminal hCG, beta core and hyperglycosylated hCG should be detectable by the assay. Ideally, serum hCG levels should be obtained within 48 hours of molar evacuation and followed every 1–2 weeks while elevated.

The rationale for recommending an interval of monitoring after normalization of hCG value is to identify patients who develop postmolar malignant gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after achieving normal hCG values. Although rare instances of long latent periods preceding postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia have been reported, almost all episodes of malignant sequelae occur within 6–12 months of evacuation. After normalization of hCG has been confirmed with a second hCG value, the risk of developing postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is extremely small.

### Gestational trophoblastic disease… [^113ihwzX]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

GTD can simulate pregnancy, because the uterus may contain fetal tissue, albeit abnormal. This tissue may grow at the same rate as a normal pregnancy, and produces chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone which is measured to monitor fetal well-being. While GTD overwhelmingly affects women of child-bearing age, it may rarely occur in postmenopausal women. Cause Two main risk factors increase the likelihood for the development of GTD: 1) The woman being under 20 years of age, or over 35 years of age, and 2) previous GTD. Although molar pregnancies affect women of all ages, women under 16 and over 45 years of age have an increased risk of developing a molar pregnancy. Hydatidiform moles are abnormal conceptions with excessive placental development. Conception takes place, but placental tissue grows very fast, rather than supporting the growth of a fetus. Partial hydatidiform moles have a fetus or fetal cells.

They are triploid in origin, containing one set of maternal haploid genes and two sets of paternal haploid genes. They almost always occur following dispermic fertilisation of a normal ovum. Malignant forms of GTD are very rare. About 50% of malignant forms of GTD develop from a hydatidiform mole. Diagnosis Cases of GTD can be diagnosed through routine tests given during pregnancy, such as blood tests and ultrasound, or through tests done after miscarriage or abortion. Vaginal bleeding, enlarged uterus, pelvic pain or discomfort, and vomiting too much are the most common symptoms of GTD. But GTD also leads to elevated serum hCG. Since pregnancy is by far the most common cause of elevated serum hCG, clinicians generally first suspect a pregnancy with a complication. However, in GTD, the beta subunit of hCG is also always elevated. Therefore, if GTD is clinically suspected, serum beta hCG is also measured.

The initial clinical diagnosis of GTD should be confirmed histologically, which can be done after the evacuation of pregnancy in women with hydatidiform mole. However, malignant GTD is highly vascular. If malignant GTD is suspected clinically, biopsy is contraindicated, because biopsy may cause life-threatening haemorrhage. Women with persistent abnormal vaginal bleeding after any pregnancy, and women developing acute respiratory or neurological symptoms after any pregnancy, should also undergo hCG testing, because these may be signs of a hitherto undiagnosed GTD. There might be some signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism as well as an increase in the levels of thyroid hormones in some patients. The proposed mechanism is attaching hCG to TSH receptors and acting like TSH weakly. Treatment Treatment is always necessary. The treatment for hydatidiform mole consists of the evacuation of pregnancy.

Evacuation will lead to the relief of symptoms, and also prevent later complications. Suction curettage is the preferred method of evacuation. Hysterectomy is an alternative if no further pregnancies are wished for by the female patient. Hydatidiform mole also has successfully been treated with systemic methotrexate. Follow up Follow up is necessary in all women with gestational trophoblastic disease, because of the possibility of persistent disease, or because of the risk of developing malignant uterine invasion or malignant metastatic disease even after treatment in some women with certain risk factors. The use of a reliable contraception method is very important during the entire follow up period, as patients are strongly advised against pregnancy at that time.

### Postmenopausal pregnancy? Evaluation of elevated hCG in a 59-year-old woman [^115Cam8p]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Slightly elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can be a normal finding in postmenopausal women. We report a case of a 59-year-old woman with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding who presented with a concern for pregnancy after developing nausea and vomiting a few weeks after unprotected intercourse. Although pregnancy was extremely unlikely, hCG was obtained in order to reassure the patient since she reported that her mother conceived at the age of 60. Serum hCG was positive, prompting concern for malignancy versus pregnancy. Stable serum hCG levels, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone and negative transvaginal ultrasound ruled out both malignancy and pregnancy. Positive serum pregnancy test and hCG elevation was attributed to normal postmenopausal state.

In an observational series over 10 years including 544 patients undergoing second uterine evacuation, following repeat curettage 68% had no further evidence of disease or chemotherapy requirements, while chemotherapy requirement was more likely with histologic confirmation of persistent trophoblastic disease and urinary hCG in excess of 1500 IU/L at the time of second evacuation. Repeat surgical treatment or single-agent systemic therapy should be followed by hCG monitoring every 2 weeks until the patient has 3 consecutive normal assays, then monthly for 6 to 12 months; for persistent hCG elevation, follow GTN chemotherapy recommendations, and for presence of metastatic disease or histopathologic diagnoses such as choriocarcinoma or PSTT/ETT, follow the GTN algorithms stratified by risk group/prognostic score.

5 TREATMENT

5.1 Molar pregnancy

Assessment of the patient's clinical condition is essential, and any medical complications should be promptly identified and treated to avoid obstetric near‐miss events. Conventional suction evacuation — or manual aspiration in settings without electronic equipment — remains the preferred method for uterine evacuation, ideally performed under ultrasound guidance. A 7–12 suction cannula is recommended for evacuation, and an intravenous oxytocin infusion may be initiated at the start of the procedure and continued for several hours postoperatively to promote uterine contractility and reduce blood loss. When available, hysteroscopic resection of residual tissue can serve as a complementary approach. Rh‐negative women should receive Rh immune globulin at the time of molar evacuation. Improved outcomes are achieved through the careful use of appropriate equipment and techniques, access to blood products, close intraoperative monitoring, and early recognition and mangement of complications. A second curettage yields controversial results, and should not be routinely performed. However, it may be used in selected cases with uterine bleeding and ultrasound findings suggestive of molar remains in the endometrial cavity. For patients who have completed childbearing, hysterectomy with ovarian preservation is a viable alternative to suction curettage. Medical induction of labor and hysterotomy are not recommended for molar evacuation, as these approaches are associated with increased maternal morbidity and the development of post‐molar GTNs.

Prophylactic chemotherapy at the time of or immediately after molar evacuation is associated with a reduction of 3%–8% in the incidence of post‐molar GTNs. However, it should be limited to special situations in which the risk of post‐molar GTN is much greater than normal or where adequate hCG follow‐up is not possible.

Follow‐up hCG monitoring every 1–2 weeks is essential for the timely diagnosis and management of post‐molar GTNs. If testing is carried out at 2‐week intervals and a rise or plateau in hCG levels is detected, next sample should be obtained after 1 week. On the other hand, post‐molar GTN rarely occurs after hCG levels have spontaneously returned to normal, which allows for a shortened follow‐up period in most women. Hence, for a PHM, a single confirmatory hCG test 1 month after initial normalization is recommended. For a CHM, monthly hCG monitoring should continue for 6 months after hCG normalization. Hormonal contraception is considered safe during post‐molar follow‐up period.

### Controversies in family planning: persistently elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels after aspiration abortion [^111U8FxD]. Contraception (2018). Low credibility.

Low but rising serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels occur infrequently after an induced abortion. Because this scenario rarely occurs after suction aspiration, clinicians may have higher suspicion for an uncommon diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes both common and uncommon diagnoses, such as incomplete abortion, heterotopic or ectopic pregnancy, a new intrauterine pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The etiology of this presentation may be unclear, especially in the absence of abnormal bleeding or pain which would suggest incomplete abortion, or when significant time has passed since the procedure. We describe two cases of an uncommon presentation of retained products of conception after aspiration abortion in which hCG levels were low but rising.

Conclusion

The prognosis for women after a molar pregnancy is excellent but some uncertainty remains around the cause of GTD, the risk factors that contribute to malignant transformation, and the optimum surveillance period. The increased use of molecular genotyping has improved the diagnostic accuracy of GTD classification, which is critical for prognostic stratification. Further work is needed to standardise hCG assays and identify those assays that are most appropriate for use in oncology. At this time, no effective prognostic biomarker is available to specifically identify those few women who will develop malignancy after molar pregnancy and require chemotherapy.

The treatment options for GTN over the past decade have improved considerably with most women now cured and salvage treatment pathways available for those who develop chemoresistance. As our understanding of GTD evolves, we might identify more sensitive biomarkers to detect disease progression earlier and to reduce the lengthy surveillance period, which impacts future pregnancy planning. Identification of women with GTD is of paramount importance because this disorder is highly curable.

### Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115przLo]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Hydatidiform mole monitoring and follow-up — After initial treatment, perform H&P 1 month after initial treatment, obtain hCG assay every 1–2 weeks until normalized, and use systemic hormonal contraception (oral contraceptives for at least 6 months preferred). With normal hCG levels for 3 consecutive assays, consider hCG assay every 3 months for 6 months. With persistent hCG elevation (plateau or rise), proceed to persistent post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) (HM-2). Oral contraceptives are preferred over intrauterine devices (IUDs) because they suppress endogenous LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which may interfere with hCG measurement at low levels, and a formal follow-up program allows for early detection of GTN and limits exposure to combination chemotherapy. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^111UML12]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

We have previously shown that the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after hCG levels return to normal in patients with a partial hydatidiform mole is low (0.03%, n = 3 of 9586 patients) and therefore, we recommended one confirmatory normal value before stopping hCG monitoring. In contrast, for a complete hydatidiform mole, we noted a slightly higher risk of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after hCG levels had returned to normal (0.24%, n = 20 of 8400 patients) which decreased from one in 839 (0.12%) patients at four months to one in 1677 (0.06%) patients at 12 months after the first normal hCG value. In keeping with previous data, patients with a complete hydatidiform mole who achieved normalisation of hCG levels in < 56 days had a significantly lower risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia than those with normal levels in ≥ 56 days (one in 1159 (0.09%) v one in 308 (0.32%) patients, odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.88, P = 0.03). Consequently, patients with a complete hydatidiform mole seemed to need longer monitoring if hCG levels returned to normal in ≥ 56 days from the date of uterine evacuation. In the UK, hCG monitoring is continued for six more months after the first normal hCG value in these patients, whereas those with normal hCG levels in < 56 days are monitored for only six months from the date of molar evacuation. Globally, many other centres monitor patients with a complete hydatidiform mole for several months after a normal hCG level.

Prolonged monitoring after normalisation of hCG levels after uterine evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole can cause considerable distress for patients and delay their ability to attempt another pregnancy. Patients report disruption of their wellbeing by feelings of anxiousness (47%), depression (27%), and distress (70%) because of receiving a diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease. Hence, we thought it might be possible to shorten the duration of hCG monitoring when hCG levels had returned to normal after a complete hydatidiform mole, particularly in those who achieved their first normal value in < 56 days. Here, in a larger cohort of patients from two trophoblastic disease centres, we reviewed the relative risk of malignant transformation over time in patients with a complete hydatidiform mole who had normal hCG levels in < 56 and ≥ 56 days.

Patients and methods

Patient database and selection

The electronic database of the Trophoblastic Disease Centre at Charing Cross Hospital in London was reviewed for all cases of GTT following molar pregnancies treated between 2000 and 2009. The patients included in this series all had a prior uterine evacuation, confirmed molar histology, met the Charing Cross Hospital guidelines for treatment and had a follow-up of at least 1 year after the completion of therapy.

The guideline indications for treatment after a molar pregnancy include the following components: heavy PV bleeding, rising hCG levels over a 2- to 4-week period, an hCG plateau of 4 weeks or longer, or a serum hCG level > 20 000 IU l⁻¹ more than 4 weeks after evacuation. Patients meeting these criteria were then assessed according to the FIGO scoring system as shown in Table 1, and grouped as either low risk (0 to 6) or high risk (> 6;).

Pre-treatment assessment

All patients were assessed clinically with a Doppler ultrasound scan of the pelvis, a chest X-ray (CXR) and an updated serum hCG level. On the basis of this assessment, patients were given a prognostic score according to the FIGO scoring system.

All patients with pulmonary metastases visible on the CXR went on to have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and a brain MRI scan.

Pregnancy — epidemiology and etiologies of hyperthyroidism indicate that hyperthyroidism due to GD occurs in 0.5%–1.0% of women in the reproductive age range, and 0.1%–0.2% are treated with antithyroid drugs (ATD) during pregnancy. Excluding patients with TSH suppression or gestational thyrotoxicosis during the first trimester, GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. Hyperthyroidism caused by a hCG-producing molar pregnancy or a choriocarcinoma presents with a diffuse hyperactive thyroid similar to GD, but without eye signs and without TRAb being detectable in serum, with serum hCG higher than expected, and the cause can be identified by obstetrical investigation.

Clinical overview

Women with a molar pregnancy usually present with irregular vaginal bleeding in the first trimester. An ultrasound scan can identify most CHMs (88%) but only detects some PHMs (56%), presenting a diagnostic challenge. Although sonography might be suggestive of a molar pregnancy, histopathological examination of the products of conception is the gold standard for the diagnosis of molar pregnancy. In CHM, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) might be inappropriately high and reach concentrations of more than 100 000 IU/L (table 1). A review of 180 cases presenting to the New England Trophoblastic Disease Centre over a 20 year period showed a reduction in the gestational age at diagnosis of CHM from 12 weeks to 9 weeks gestation. Earlier diagnosis of GTD has led to changes in clinical presentation with women now rarely presenting with anaemia, hyperemesis, pre-eclampsia, or hyperthyroidism.

The diagnosis of GTN is largely based on a combination of obstetric history and elevated concentrations of hCG. After molar pregnancy, plateaued or rising hCG concentrations are indicative of GTN. All forms of GTN (excluding PSTT and ETT) are highly vascular and a biopsy is not recommended because of the risk of a life threatening haemorrhage. Identification of the origin of choriocarcinoma can be challenging and genetic profiling can help to differentiate gestational from non-gestational choriocarcinoma, with non-gestational choriocarcinoma having a worse prognosis.

Obstetric management of molar pregnancy involves uterine evacuation and histopathological examination of the products of conception. Follow-up serum or urine hCG monitoring is done until hCG values return to within the normal range. hCG is an ideal biomarker for GTD surveillance as its concentration accurately reflects disease burden. Most women with molar pregnancy do not require further treatment following uterine evacuation of the products of conception. However, some women develop disease persistence and progress to malignant disease requiring chemotherapy or further surgical intervention.

### Gestational choriocarcinoma… [^117AT5nP]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Gestational choriocarcinoma can happen during and after any type of pregnancy event, though risk of the disease is higher in and after complete or partial molar pregnancies. Risk of disease may also be higher in those experiencing pregnancy at younger or older ages that average, such as below 15 years old or above 45 years old. Those with gestational choriocarcinoma may experience abnormal vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and have high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, in addition to history of molar pregnancy or other metastatic cancer. A combination of history, symptoms, human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and imaging can be used in the diagnosis process, with ultrasonography being commonly used to image.

Approximately 50% of those with gestational choriocarcinoma have experienced molar pregnancy, approximately 25% developed the disease after a regular, term pregnancy, and other situations have included history of ectopic pregnancy, where the pregnancy does not occur in the uterus. There are generally three levels of risk: low risk, high risk, and ultrahigh risk. The primary form of treatment is chemotherapy with one or more agents. Duration can go upwards of six weeks following the return of human chorionic gonadotropin levels to the normal range. Depending on the risk of gestational trophoblastic disease development, such as in certain people with mole pregnancies, chemotherapy has been used in a preventative manner in the past. Elevated or rising human chorionic gonadotropin can be a sign of gestational choriocarcinoma, though it is also used as a biomarker in other types of gestational trophoblastic diseases.

It is useful not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring disease progression, treatment response, and potential of recurring gestational choriocarcinoma. Causes Gestational choriocarcinoma is the most aggressive form of trophoblastic tumor; it most commonly arises from certain fertilization defects, such as molar pregnancy, which results in increased level of growth factors and uncontrolled proliferation of trophoblasts in the uterus. Statistics from clinical cases have shown that GC is associated with any pregnancy events, with 50% of GC arise from hydatidiform moles, 25% from gestation, and 25% from abortion or tubal pregnancy.
- Maternal age. This is one of the two well-established risk factors for GC. Many studies have shown that the risk of developing GC increased very rapidly in gestational women older than 40 years old.
- Prior history of complete hydatidiform mole. This is another well-established risk factor for GC.

It has been showed that the risk of having GC after a complete hydatidiform mole is significantly higher than after a live birth.
- Others risk factors such as reproductive factors, use of oral contraceptives, diet and environmental factors were also reported. But because of data inconsistency, such associations are still questionable. For example, there is a case-control study showed that there's a significant association of GC in women having more than 5 births. But other studies had showed no association when corrected for age. Pathogenesis At the cellular level, any abnormalities in the placental trophoblastic proliferation could potentially contribute to molar pregnancy and tumor development. There are three different types of trophoblasts: cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and intermediate trophoblasts. Each of them possesses distinct specialized functions to support a developing embryo.

### Advances in the diagnosis and early management of gestational trophoblastic disease [^113zVWNL]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

An update to the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists clinical guidelines for GTD in 2021 recommends registration of all affected women with a GTD centre as a minimum standard of care. The Irish clinical guidelines endorse this recommendation and advise centralisation of hCG measurement in a quality assured laboratory using an oncology approved assay. All guidelines recommend hCG monitoring of women after molar pregnancy to enable early detection of disease persistence.

A large retrospective UK study of 20 000 women who had hCG monitoring after a molar pregnancy found the risk of GTN after hCG normalisation was 0.25% for CHM and 0.03% for PHM. A systematic review of 19 independent studies reported a slightly higher risk of GTN (0.35%) after hCG normalisation in CHM. Another study found that prolonged hCG surveillance particularly after PHM is not cost-effective given the rarity of GTN. Consequently, the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists guidelines recommend a shorter hCG surveillance period after PHM with monitoring complete after two normal hCG values are obtained, one month apart. Complete moles require a longer surveillance period reflecting their higher risk of GTN. In CHM cases where hCG normalisation occurs within 56 days (eight weeks), women have hCG monitoring for a total of six months after uterine evacuation. However, when hCG normalisation occurs beyond 56 days, women require hCG monitoring for six months after normalisation (figure 7). Another update in the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists guideline concerns women who did not require chemotherapy after molar pregnancy. These women no longer require a hCG test or histopathological examination of their placental tissue after future normal pregnancies.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^115v2uw9]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Policy Implications

Our findings support the idea that in patients whose hCG levels return to normal in < 56 days, current UK and international practice could be changed to reduce monitoring protocols to one confirmatory normal hCG sample, to match current practice for partial hydatidiform moles. A recent Markov model based, cost effectiveness analysis in complete hydatidiform moles also suggested that it would be reasonable to reduce or potentially stop hCG monitoring after hCG levels have returned to normal.

For women whose hCG levels return to normal in ≥ 56 days after a complete hydatidiform mole, how long should surveillance continue? Our study provides information for patients and clinicians to help determine what this interval should be. The risk data in figure 2 could be shared with patients for a personalised decision based process to decide when they feel it would be safe to stop hCG monitoring. In the UK, we have currently decided to continue offering up to six months of hCG monitoring after normalisation of hCG levels for these patients, but we might revise this approach after patient feedback. Clearly, many factors need to be considered in the decision process for affected women, including their reproductive plans and age, and whether a delayed diagnosis might result in a worse outcome. Although the absolute risk of recurrence remains low, patients need to be educated on the importance of seeking medical care even after completion of follow-up if they have abnormal bleeding or other concerning symptoms. A time interval of > 2.8 years from the antecedent presumed causative pregnancy was found to correlate with worse outcomes in high risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Fortunately, in our cohort, six of 31 patients had a diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia > 2.8 years after their initial complete hydatidiform mole, but this finding did not affect survival. We saw a trend for the need for much more aggressive combination chemotherapy, rather than chemotherapy with one drug, in patients who developed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia many months or years after their complete hydatidiform mole.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia — initial evaluation and workup (unless previously done) includes H&P, repeat CBC differential and platelet count, repeat liver/renal/thyroid function tests/chemistry profile, imaging, hCG assay, determination of FIGO stage and prognostic score, and histopathologic assessment; if visible lesions are seen in the lower genital tract, do NOT biopsy due to risk of hemorrhage. When hCG is elevated with no evidence of disease on imaging, consider the possibility of LH crossover or phantom hCG and consult with laboratory medicine/pathology to test for phantom hCG with serial dilution study or comparison of serum to urine hCG; if hCG is elevated at a low level that is stable over time (and false positive hCG ruled out), quiescent GTN is possible, and close follow-up, rather than immediate treatment may be considered. Consider consultation with a clinician or center with expertise in management of gestational trophoblastic diseases, and note that all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) — presentation and initial workup includes that post-molar GTN can present with irregular bleeding after molar treatment, enlarged/irregular uterus, and bilateral ovarian enlargement, though these signs may be absent in choriocarcinoma after normal pregnancies; metastatic lesions are often hemorrhagic and may have neurologic or pulmonary symptoms; ETT and PSTT typically present with irregular uterine bleeding after a prior pregnancy. Workup includes history/physical with metastatic imaging, brain MRI (preferred), and pelvic ultrasound or MRI; visible lower genital tract lesions should not be biopsied due to hemorrhage risk. The NCCN Panel recommends repeat CBC differential with platelets; liver, renal, and thyroid function testing; and hCG assay; if hCG is elevated without imaging evidence of disease, consider LH crossover or phantom hCG; if hCG is persistently low-level and stable, quiescent GTN is possible and close follow-up rather than immediate treatment may be considered. GTN should be staged and scored using FIGO; staging is based on location/extent: stage I uterine-confined, stage II genital extension/metastasis, stage III lung metastasis, and stage IV non-pulmonary distant metastases.

### Etiology, natural history, and management of recent advances in molar pregnancy [^114AAC1m]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Molar pregnancy is a rare reproductive anomaly that globally affects 1:1,000–1,500 pregnancies. It is caused by aberrant fertilization and can be associated with medical complications or progress to postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Molar pregnancy presents with two distinct entities, complete and partial hydatidiform mole, which differ in their clinical, genetic, and prognostic aspects. Maternal age and history of molar pregnancy are the main risk factors for the occurrence of molar pregnancy. Early diagnosis of molar pregnancy by ultrasonography is associated with a decrease in medical complications but not decreased postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. After the diagnosis of a presumed molar pregnancy, patients should be referred to an expert with experience taking care of molar pregnancy or to a reference center for uterine evacuation and postmolar follow-up, which facilitates early diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Weekly human chorionic gonadotropin measurement is essential to confirm remission and to identify cases of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia that will require further treatment. To maintain the reliability of this tumor marker, hormonal contraception is indicated during postmolar follow-up. The postmolar follow-up should extend for 1 month and from 3 to 6 months after remission in cases of partial and complete hydatidiform mole, respectively. The reproductive outcomes after molar pregnancy are comparable with those of the general population, except for the higher occurrence of recurrent molar pregnancy, affecting 1.0–2.0% of subsequent pregnancies. The considerable psychosocial repercussions of molar pregnancy require a multidisciplinary approach to minimize the repercussions of this disease on mental health.

### Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization following molar pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116nUHh3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia following complete and partial molar pregnancy after reaching normal human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels to guide evidence-based follow-up recommendations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, POPLINE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to November 2018, using the intersection of "gestational trophoblastic disease", "molar pregnancy", and "human chorionic gonadotropin" themes.

Methods Of Study Selection

Search results were screened to identify cohort studies of molar pregnancy reporting gestational trophoblastic neoplasia development, with at least 6 months of intended normal hCG follow-up.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Two reviewers independently identified articles for inclusion. Data were extracted using a standardized form. For meta-analysis, cumulative incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, with CIs by the Agresti-Coull method, and pooled risk ratios (RRs) comparing complete and partial mole were calculated. Among the 19 eligible studies that reported adequate data for inclusion in the primary meta-analysis, we found low incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normal hCG level following both complete mole (64/18,357, 0.35%, 95% CI 0.27–0.45%), and partial mole (5/14,864, 0.03%, 95% CI 0.01–0.08%). There was a significantly higher risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after complete compared with partial molar pregnancy (RR 4.72, 95% CI 1.81–12.3, P = 0.002). Among gestational trophoblastic neoplasia cases after normal hCG level following complete mole, 89.6% occurred when the time from evacuation to normalization was 56 days or longer, and 60.7% were diagnosed beyond the commonly recommended 6-month surveillance interval. Sensitivity analyses, including those limiting to studies at low risk of bias, did not significantly affect results. We found an overall incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia of 15.7% for complete mole (1,354/8,611, 95% CI 15.0–16.5%) and 3.95% for partial mole (221/5,593, 95% CI 3.47–4.50%).

Conclusion

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia development after normal hCG level following molar pregnancy is rare. Recommendations for frequency and duration of hCG follow-up can be minimized to lessen burden on patients and informed by the type of molar pregnancy and time interval from uterine evacuation to hCG normalization.

In the largest study reported from the United Kingdom, Coyle and associates followed more than 20,000 women with hydatidiform moles after evacuation. For partial moles, the risk of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was 1:3,195 after normalization of hCG; it was 1:406 for complete moles. The risk of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia dropped rapidly during the first 6 months of monitoring. Women with complete mole where hCG normalized more than 56 days after evacuation had a 3.8-fold increased higher risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normalization of hCG. They recommended that hCG monitoring could be stopped for partial moles after a confirmatory hCG, but recommended continuing to monitor complete moles for 6 months. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) also recommends confirming hCG normalization with a second value and discontinuing monitoring for partial moles, but to continue monthly monitoring for 6 months after complete mole. Others have suggested shortening the surveillance period for complete moles after confirming a normal hCG value with two hCG values. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network practice guidelines for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia recommends monitoring with two hCG values at 3-month intervals after three consecutive normal hCG values.

Pregnancies that occur within 12 months after molar evacuation are usually normal gestations. However, an early pregnancy obscures the interpretation of hCG values during monitoring. For this reason, reliable contraception is recommended during hCG surveillance. Several studies, including a randomized study performed by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, established that moderate-low dose oral contraceptives do not increase the incidence of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and significantly decrease intercurrent pregnancies during postmolar surveillance, compared with barrier contraception.

After completion of surveillance documenting remission, pregnancy can be encouraged. Patients with prior partial or complete mole have a 1–2% incidence of a second mole in subsequent pregnancies. All future pregnancies should be evaluated by a first-trimester obstetric ultrasound examination. The risk of repetitive molar pregnancies increases substantially if a woman has had two or more prior moles. Women with consecutive molar pregnancies should undergo germline genetic testing for mutations in NLRP7 and KHDC3L, because these mutations are identified in more than half of such women. Assisted reproduction techniques with the use of donor eggs are recommended for future pregnancies if mutations are identified.

Gestational trophoblastic disease — hydatidiform mole (HM), invasive mole, and choriocarcinoma epidemiology and progression are detailed: HM results from abnormal fertilization and is categorized as complete or partial. The majority of complete moles (80%) arise via duplication of a single sperm's haploid genome, with the remaining 20% due to dispermy. Post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) develops in about 15% to 20% of complete moles and in 1% to 5% of partial moles; the reported incidence of GTN after molar pregnancy is 18% to 29%. Approximately 15% of invasive moles metastasize to the lung or vagina, and persistent elevated human chorionic gonadotropin after molar evacuation most often leads to diagnosis of invasive mole. Choriocarcinoma occurs after various pregnancy events — HM (50%), term or preterm gestation (25%), or tubal pregnancy or abortion (25%) — and approximately 2% to 3% of HMs progress to choriocarcinoma.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study characteristics

In total, 61 women were recruited to the study including women with PUL, suspected ectopic pregnancies, and confirmed molar pregnancy. Some cases of PUL evolved into viable/nonviable IUP with the cohort ultimately consisting of women with intrauterine pregnancy/pregnancy of uncertain viability (n = 10, 16.4%), PUL (n = 9, 14.8%), ectopic pregnancy (n = 8, 13.1%), miscarriage (n = 29, 47.5%), molar pregnancy (n = 3, 4.9%), and retained pregnancy tissue (n = 2, 3.3%). The three participants undergoing follow up for molar pregnancy had their results (< 5, 13, and 23 IU/L) confirmed using a CE‐marked total β‐hCG assay for oncology (Cobas® Elecsys). The median age of study participants was 33 years (interquartile range, 30–36 years) with a minimum to maximum maternal age of 20–40 years. The mean gestational age was 7 weeks (± 2.4 SD), covering periods when the gestational sac (5 weeks), fetal pole (~6 weeks), and fetal heartbeat (~6–7 weeks) are typically visible on transvaginal ultrasound examination.

### Advances in the diagnosis and early management of gestational trophoblastic disease [^1161JHpt]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Women with low risk disease (score of ≤ 6) without metastatic disease are offered single drug chemotherapy or hysterectomy. Whereas women with high risk disease (score of ≥ 7) are offered multidrug chemotherapy, ideally under the supervision of an expert in GTD management. In the event of drug resistance or disease related complications, surgery can be considered. Women with ultra-high risk disease (score of > 12) generally present with liver or brain metastases and require specialist multidisciplinary care. An adjustment to the FIGO scoring system is required to identify women at low risk who become resistant to single drug chemotherapy to enable them be treated at the outset with multidrug chemotherapy.

Women treated with chemotherapy after a molar pregnancy are advised to avoid pregnancy for at least a year when the risk of relapse is greatest (3%) and an increase in hCG concentration might prevent early detection of disease recurrence. Advice on safe contraception after a molar pregnancy can be found in national fertility guidelines. A systematic review found no evidence for an association between oral contraceptive use during follow-up after a mole and the incidence of GTN. Moreover, a Brazilian retrospective cohort study found no association between hormonal contraceptive use during molar pregnancy follow-up or GTN treatment and the risk or severity of GTN, nor did it postpone the normalisation of hCG concentrations. In a retrospective review of 1532 women with gestational trophoblastic tumours who were treated with chemotherapy, 230 became pregnant within 12 months of finishing chemotherapy and five of these women relapsed. However, the relapse rate in women following chemotherapy was not higher in those women who became pregnant within the first year. This study also reported that single drug chemotherapy had no effect on fetal outcomes but that multidrug chemotherapy might have a transient effect on fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage.

Importantly, all guidelines recommend that GTN should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all women who present with irregular vaginal bleeding after pregnancy and that serum hCG measurement should be included in the diagnostic investigations.

### Markedly elevated β-hCG levels in a normal singleton gestation with hyperreactio luteinalis [^111qB2Rr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the trophoblast early in pregnancy and peaks at a level of approximately 100,000 IU/liter around the ninth week of gestation. Abnormally high levels are usually noted in association with multiple gestation, molar gestation, and specific ovarian or gestational malignancies.

Cases

A multiparous patient in the second trimester was referred for evaluation after a maternal triple marker screen was incalculable due to a beta-hCG level of 2.1 million IU/L. Targeted sonography revealed bilateral complex adnexal masses with a solid component of the left ovary, a normal fetus, and normal placenta. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy at 18 weeks' gestational age. A left oophorectomy was performed. Pathology confirmed hyperreactio luteinalis. The remainder of the pregnancy was remarkable for preterm labor and delivery at 35 weeks' gestational age. At delivery, the hCG level was noted to be 24,210 IU/L, and the fetus and placenta were normal.

Conclusion

Markedly elevated hCG levels rarely occur in normal singleton pregnancy and can be associated with hyperreactio luteinalis. When noted, a work-up to evaluate possible malignancy, molar gestation, and multiple gestation should be pursued.

### Low risk of relapse after achieving undetectable HCG levels in women with complete molar pregnancy [^115pee5W]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies occur in approximately 1 of 1,000 conceptions. After uterine evacuation of the trophoblastic tissue, women are followed up with serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements. Patients are considered to have attained remission when their hCG level spontaneously declines to an undetectable level and remains there during a 6-month follow-up period. This standard effectively detects all disease recurrence; however, it is resource intensive, delays child bearing, and is subject to significant noncompliance. Our objective was to determine the risk of disease recurrence after hCG spontaneously declines to undetectable levels.

Methods

We used a database from the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center to analyze hCG levels in patients with complete molar pregnancies.

Results

Among 1,029 women with complete molar pregnancy and complete data, 15% developed persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The rate of persistent neoplasm among those whose hCG level fell spontaneously to undetectable levels was 0.2% (2/876, 95% confidence interval 0–0.8%). No women developed persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after their hCG level fell to undetectable levels using an assay with a sensitivity of 5 mIU/mL (n = 82, 95% confidence interval 0–4.5%).

Conclusion

Based on our experience with women with complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies whose hCG values spontaneously fell to undetectable levels after molar evacuation, we conclude that the risk of recurrent neoplasm after hCG levels fall to less than 5 mIU/mL approaches zero.

### Postevacuation hCG levels and risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia in women with complete molar pregnancy [^114deshM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Women diagnosed with complete hydatidiform molar pregnancy are at 15% to 28% risk of developing persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) requiring further management with chemotherapy. Our objective was to develop human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) criteria that establish a patient's risk of developing persistent GTN or achieving remission from their baseline risk within a few weeks of molar evacuation.

Methods

We used a database from the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center to analyze hCG levels from 1,029 women with complete molar pregnancies. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 1973 to 2001.

Results

Women whose hCG level declined below 50 mIU/mL during their follow-up were found to be at no more than 1.1% risk for developing persistent GTN, irrespective of when this level was reached. Women whose hCG levels was below 200 mIU/mL in the fourth week after evacuation (59.8% of all women), or below 100 mIU/mL in the sixth week after evacuation (65.8% of all women), had a risk of persistence below 9%. hCG levels above 2,000 mIU/mL in the fourth week after evacuation (13.3% of women) were associated with a 63.8% risk of developing persistent disease.

Conclusion

These data may allow clinicians to evaluate the risk of persistence that their patients with complete molar pregnancy have based on early hCG results after molar evacuation. In the fourth week after molar evacuation, 59.8% of women may be counseled that their risk of developing persistent GTN is substantially reduced from their baseline, whereas 13.3% of women may be warned that their risk of developing persistent GTN is greater than 50%.

### What is the optimal duration of human chorionic gonadotrophin surveillance following evacuation of a molar pregnancy? A retrospective analysis on over 20, 000 consecutive patients [^1124P2nU]. Gynecologic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the risk of developing post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (pGTN) beyond the first normal human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in women who have had a complete (CHM) or partial molar pregnancy (PHM) and to re-evaluate the current UK Hydatidiform mole hCG surveillance guidelines.

Methods

The Charing Cross Hospital Trophoblast Disease Centre database was screened to identify all registered cases of hydatidiform mole (HM) between 1980 and 2009.

Results

We identified 20,144 cases of HM, comprising 8400 CHM, 9586 PHM, and 2158 cases of unclassified hydatidiform mole (UHM). Twenty-nine cases (20 CHM, 3 PHM and 6 UHM) developed pGTN after the first normal hCG. For CHM the risk of pGTN at the point of hCG normalisation was 1 in 406, and fell rapidly in the first six months of monitoring. For PHM the risk of pGTN at the point of hCG normalisation was 1 in 3195. Women with CHM where hCG normalisation occurred beyond 56days after uterine evacuation of molar tissue were found to have a 3.8-fold higher risk of pGTN.

Conclusions

Our results show that pGTN can occur after hCG normalisation following PHM but the risk is extremely low. Women with CHM have a comparatively higher risk of pGTN after hCG normalisation. Those with CHM where hCG normalises within 56days have a lower risk of pGTN. We have revised the current UK hCG surveillance protocol for PHM to a single additional confirmatory normal urine hCG measurement one month after first normalisation. The protocol for CHM remains unchanged.

### Gestational trophoblastic disease: current evaluation and management [^113YsrMh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Gestational trophoblastic disease is a spectrum of interrelated disease processes originating from the placenta (Box 1). Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia refers to lesions that have the potential for local invasion and metastasis. Before the development of sensitive assays for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and effective chemotherapy, mortality from all forms of malignant gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was substantial.

Box 1.

Currently, most women can be cured, and their reproductive function can be preserved, but it is important that the initial management and follow-up of patients be timely and appropriate. Practicing obstetrician–gynecologists are most likely to be involved in the care of women with hydatidiform moles. They should be able to manage this disease, including making the diagnosis of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and evaluating the patient's risk status to allow appropriate referral for treatment. Obstetrician–gynecologists may be consulted for patients who have an unclear diagnosis associated with an elevated hCG level and should be able to direct evaluation for "phantom hCG" and malignant gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

Estimates for the incidence of various types of gestational trophoblastic disease vary. In the United States, hydatidiform moles are observed in approximately 1 in 600 therapeutic abortions and 1 in 1,000–1,200 pregnancies. Women at the extremes of reproductive life are at increased risk, especially those older than age 45 years. Approximately 15–20% of patients will be treated for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after evacuation of complete hydatidiform mole. Gestational choriocarcinoma occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000–40,000 pregnancies. Approximately 50% of choriocarcinomas present after term pregnancies, 25% after molar pregnancies, and the remainder after other gestational events. – Although much rarer than hydatidiform mole or gestational choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumors and epithelioid trophoblastic tumors can develop after any type of pregnancy.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia — diagnostic criteria for post-molar GTN and baseline evaluation: Post-molar GTN is typically diagnosed by hCG surveillance, and the NCCN Guidelines use FIGO criteria as meeting one or more of the following after treatment for HM, as indicated by hCG monitoring and WHO scoring: hCG levels plateau for 4 consecutive values over 3 weeks or hCG levels rise ≥ 10% for 3 values over 2 weeks. Assessment and staging should include history and physical examination (including pelvic exam), FIGO stage and prognostic score, pelvic ultrasound, and imaging (chest x-ray or [C/A/P] CT), with pelvic ultrasound used to confirm the absence of pregnancy, measure uterine size, and delineate tumor volume and vasculature.

4 CLINICAL PRESENTATION, INVESTIGATIONS, AND DIAGNOSIS

4.1 Molar pregnancy

Patients usually present with second trimester vaginal bleeding. As diagnosis is often made in the first trimester with ultrasound examination, complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum, pre‐eclampsia, and hyperthyroidism are less and less common. If there is vaginal passage of the gestational product, vesicles may be seen.

The typical honeycomb appearance of a complete mole is rarely seen, especially in the first trimester. Typically, there is absence of fetal parts and cystic appearance of the placenta. Hence, molar pregnancies should be diagnosed on histologic examination after evacuation for a spontaneous abortion or a suspected molar pregnancy.

4.2 Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia

Postmolar GTN is usually diagnosed by hCG surveillance without symptoms. At the FIGO Gynecology Oncology Committee meeting in 2000, the definition of postmolar GTN based on hCG level changes, histology, and specific investigations was agreed (Box 1 and 2).

Box 2

4.3 Human chorionic gonadotropin monitoring

For monitoring of GTN, an hCG assay that can detect all forms of hCG including beta‐hCG, core hCG, C‐terminal hCG, nicked‐free beta, beta core, and preferably the hyperglycosylated forms, should be used when possible. A persistently low hCG level needs continuous monitoring as some may progress to GTN with rising hCG levels. To exclude a false‐positive result, retest with another assay kit or a test for urine hCG may be used.

4.4 Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after nonmolar pregnancy

As only about 50% of GTN follows molar pregnancy, the rest can occur after a spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or a term pregnancy. Aside from postpartum abnormal vaginal bleeding, other clinical presentations can include bleeding from metastatic sites such as the liver, spleen, intestines, lung, or brain, pulmonary symptoms, and neurological signs from spine or brain metastasis.GTN should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unusual presentations and serum hCG should be performed as part of the workup of such patients.

### Surveillance without chemotherapy in a woman with recurrent molar pregnancy [^1141nsNM]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 27-year-old fouth gravida patient with previous two partial molar pregnancies and one missed abortion underwent a suction evacuation for partial molar pregnancy at 9 weeks of gestation. She was followed up with serum HCG values. Though the HCG level reduced from a pre-evacuation value of 1 40 223–31 157 mIU/ml 1 week post procedure, the levels continued to be positive in low titres 6 months after suction evacuation. The management options were discussed with the patient and a decision was taken to continue surveillance with serial HCG titres. HCG levels normalised after 11 months without the need for chemotherapy.

Biochemical diagnosis

hCG is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family that includes three pituitary hormones: luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and thyroid stimulating hormone. These hormones are heterodimers that share a common alpha (α) subunit but have a unique hormone specific beta (β) subunit. hCG is a heterogenous molecule with many different isoforms produced by complex post-translational modification. In early pregnancy (three weeks gestation), hyperglycosylated hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta to promote growth and differentiation. The main hCG variants found in serum or urine include intact hCG (α and β) along with fragments of nicked hCG, nicked hCGβ, and hCGβ core fragment. These five biologically active hCG isoforms are clinically relevant in gestational trophoblastic disease.

Human chorionic gonadotrophin assays

Most commercial immunoassays were developed for the detection of hCG in early pregnancy. Total hCG assays detect intact and free β-subunit but will not necessarily detect all isoforms secreted in GTD. There is no international standardised hCG assay approved for use in women with GTD. Ideally hCG should be monitored with an assay that detects all hCG isoforms in equimolar amounts.GTD reference centres should have access to at least two hCG assays, one for primary analysis and another for confirmatory diagnosis. Several factors contribute to the variability in hCG assays including assay calibration, analyte specificity, and antibody heterogeneity. In the absence of centralised hCG monitoring, hCG should be measured using the same assay and analytical platform throughout follow-up to avoid inter-assay variability.

In molar pregnancy, hCG is monitored postoperatively until normalisation is achieved. However, no consensus exists on what constitutes as normalisation because this term is assay dependent and can depend on the functional sensitivity of the assay and confidence interval used to define normality. Thus, the surveillance period can be prolonged in women monitored in a centre using a normal reference range of less than 1 IU/L as opposed to the commonly quoted reference range of less than 5 IU/L.

### Low risk of relapse after achieving undetectable HCG levels in women with partial molar pregnancy [^113GdzzS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) for women with partial molar pregnancy whose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels fall spontaneously to undetectable levels using a sensitive hCG assay.

Methods

We analyzed data from the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center to estimate the risk of GTN among 284 women with partial molar pregnancy and at least 6 months of gonadotropin follow-up.

Results

None of the 238 women with complete gonadotropin follow-up and a spontaneous decline in serum hCG levels to undetectable levels subsequently developed GTN (95% confidence interval 0–1.6%).

Conclusion

If these results are replicated at other institutions with longstanding experience managing partial molar pregnancies, it may be reasonable to abbreviate clinical follow-up for women with partial molar pregnancy whose serum hCG levels spontaneously decline to an undetectable level.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^116yeE4h]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Comparison with other studies

As previously reported, and similar to the findings in this study, the overall risk of developing GTN following hCG normalization is low. Monitoring of hCG levels after evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole previously lasted for two years. Most current guidelines (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics), however, indicate that surveillance should continue for up to six months after normalisation of this hormone. In some countries, including the UK, if normalisation of hCG levels occurs in < 56 days, follow-up is reduced to six months from the date of evacuation.

5 TREATMENT

5.1 Molar pregnancy

Suction evacuation and curettage, ideally performed under ultrasound guidance, is the preferred method of evacuation of a molar pregnancy independent of uterine size if maintenance of fertility is desired. It is recommended that a 12–14 mm suction cannula be used and that an intravenous oxytocin infusion may be started at the onset of suction curettage and may be continued for several hours postoperatively to enhance uterine contractility and decrease blood loss. Because the risk of bleeding increases with uterine size, blood for transfusion should be available when the uterus is greater than 16 weeks in gestational size. Rh immune globulin should be given to Rh‐negative women at the time of molar evacuation as RhD factor is expressed on the trophoblast. Judicious use of appropriate evacuation equipment and techniques, access to blood products, careful intraoperative monitoring, and early recognition and correction of complications results in improved outcomes. If there is no persistent bleeding, a second evacuation is usually not needed.

Hysterectomy is an alternative to suction curettage if childbearing is complete. In addition to evacuating the molar pregnancy, hysterectomy provides permanent sterilization and decreases the need for subsequent chemotherapy by eliminating the risk of local myometrial invasion as a cause of persistent disease. Medical induction of labor and hysterotomy are not recommended for molar evacuation since these methods increase maternal morbidity and the development of postmolar GTN requiring chemotherapy.

Prophylactic administration of either methotrexate or actinomycin D chemotherapy at the time of or immediately following molar evacuation is associated with a reduction in the incidence of postmolar GTN to 3%–8%. However, it should be limited to special situations in which the risk of postmolar GTN is much greater than normal or where adequate hCG follow‐up is not possible.

Follow‐up hCG monitoring every 1–2 weeks is essential for early diagnosis of and management of postmolar GTN. On the other hand, postmolar GTN rarely occurs after the spontaneous return of hCG levels to normal, allowing for a shortened follow‐up period for most women. Hence, a single additional confirmatory normal hCG measurement 1 month after first hCG normalization is recommended for a PHM and monthly hCG measurements should be obtained for only 6 months after hCG normalization for a CHM. Termination of pregnancy is not indicated if accidental pregnancy occurs during surveillance after the hCG level has returned to normal. In addition, data now show that it is safe to recommend oral contraceptives.

### Abnormally elevated serum hCG in a patient with end-stage renal disease seeking abortion: to be expected or a cause for concern? A case report [^116KPuYP]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

A patient with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis was referred to our abortion clinic with a concern for molar pregnancy. By 12 weeks, her human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was over 500,000. A review of the literature demonstrates that elevated hCG should be expected in this population and should not alter care.
