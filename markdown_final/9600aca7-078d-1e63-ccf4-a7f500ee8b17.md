## Question

Toujeo vs lantus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences between Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 U/mL) and Lantus (insulin glargine 100 U/mL), including pharmacology, efficacy, hypoglycemia, dosing, special populations, and practical prescribing guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic distinctions that drive clinical effects. Then, I should verify comparative efficacy and noninferiority margins. Next, I will examine hypoglycemia outcomes by diabetes type and population. After that, I need to check dosing conversions and titration principles. I will then review special populations and device considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight key caveats and monitoring needs, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacologic differences, because these underpin everything else. Toujeo is a 3-fold concentrated formulation of insulin glargine that forms a smaller subcutaneous depot with slower, more uniform microprecipitate dissolution, yielding a flatter, longer pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile with less peak-to-trough fluctuation and intra-subject variability compared with Lantus, which has a more pronounced peak and somewhat shorter duration at the same unit dose, although both are basal insulins with 24-hour activity in many patients [^115AMNWM].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical implication of that pharmacology on potency, because this affects switching. On a unit-to-unit basis, Toujeo has lower glucose-lowering effect than Lantus; in clamp studies, the 24-hour glucose-lowering effect of Toujeo 0.4 U/kg was about 27% lower than the same dose of Lantus, and in trials, patients typically require roughly 10–18% more Toujeo units to match Lantus control, with the FDA explicitly advising that when switching from Lantus to Toujeo, expect to need a higher daily dose to maintain the same level of glycemic control [^111isE9T] [^113Vm5ms] [^111fUKZ4] [^115AMNWM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy; I should confirm noninferiority. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that Toujeo achieves HbA1c reductions noninferior to Lantus across type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with noninferiority margins of 0.4% consistently met, and fasting plasma glucose improvements are comparable when both are titrated to target, confirming that the efficacy difference is not clinically meaningful despite the higher unit dose requirement with Toujeo [^113Vm5ms] [^111fUKZ4] [^112JWJi7].

> I will now examine hypoglycemia, since this is the key clinical differentiator. In type 2 diabetes, Toujeo reduces nocturnal and overall hypoglycemia versus Lantus, with meta-analytic risk reductions around 20–30% for nocturnal events and smaller but significant reductions in overall hypoglycemia; this benefit is most pronounced in insulin-experienced patients and during the titration period, and is consistent across EDITION and related analyses [^112JWJi7] [^111LzCZ1] [^116HPP96]. In type 1 diabetes, results are mixed; some trials show fewer nocturnal events early with Toujeo, but overall annualized hypoglycemia rates are generally similar to Lantus, so the hypoglycemia advantage is less consistent in T1D than in T2D [^112JWJi7] [^117EySup].

> Let me think about dosing and switching, because this is where errors occur. When converting from Lantus to Toujeo, I should confirm that a unit-for-unit switch will under-treat; indeed, starting Toujeo at the same unit dose as Lantus typically leads to higher fasting glucose initially, and the FDA advises expecting to need more Toujeo units, with trial data showing about 11–18% higher mean doses across T2D studies and about 18% higher in T1D, so I should plan closer monitoring and titration during the first weeks after switching [^113Vm5ms] [^111fUKZ4] [^1137ZzJ1]. Conversely, when switching from Toujeo to Lantus, the Lantus label recommends starting Lantus at 80% of the Toujeo dose to mitigate hypoglycemia risk, which I should remember to apply in practice [^113r9kzd].

> Next, I should review special populations and practical constraints. In older adults, Toujeo's lower hypoglycemia risk is attractive, and real-world data in seniors show improved or maintained glycemic control with low hypoglycemia rates after switching, aligning with ADA's emphasis on minimizing hypoglycemia in this group; I need to ensure conservative titration and frequent monitoring in geriatric patients [^1137VP55] [^114RtfwC]. In renal and hepatic impairment, both insulins require cautious dosing and glucose monitoring, but there is no specific dose adjustment algorithm for either product beyond individualized titration and vigilance for hypoglycemia, so I should monitor more frequently and adjust slowly in CKD or liver disease [^114RtfwC] [^111QwB1w]. For pediatrics, Toujeo is indicated for children 6 years and older, and in T1D youth, HbA1c outcomes are noninferior to Lantus with similar safety, supporting its use when clinically appropriate [^111PugVG] [^115Ppv4u].

> I should double-check device and pen considerations, because they affect usability and dose delivery. Toujeo is available in SoloStar (1-unit steps, max 80 units/injection) and Max SoloStar (2-unit steps, max 160 units/injection), the latter useful for patients requiring higher daily doses; when switching pen types, round odd-unit doses up or down by 1 unit to match dial increments, and remember that the dose counter displays actual Toujeo units with no conversion needed, which simplifies teaching [^116BUzxy] [^117KJWfF]. Let me verify that the smaller injection volume with Toujeo can reduce injection burden at higher doses; yes, delivering the same units in one-third the volume can improve comfort and may support adherence in some patients, though this is a practical rather than efficacy advantage [^115AMNWM].

> But wait, what about cost and access; I need to check real-world pricing dynamics. Although list prices are similar, net prices for Toujeo have often been slightly lower than Lantus after rebates, and competition from biosimilars and other basal insulins has compressed net prices across the class; however, payer formularies and patient out-of-pocket costs vary, so I should confirm coverage and co-pay before recommending a switch, especially since Toujeo may not be preferred on all formularies despite its PK advantages [^116oPYhq] [^111zfYxz].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should ensure it aligns with the evidence. Choose Toujeo when hypoglycemia risk is a priority, particularly in type 2 diabetes, in older adults, in those with prior nocturnal hypoglycemia, or when a smoother basal profile is desired; anticipate needing about 10–20% more units than Lantus and plan proactive titration and monitoring during the transition. Choose Lantus when cost, formulary access, or established familiarity are paramount, recognizing that efficacy is comparable and that careful titration still yields excellent control; if switching from Toujeo to Lantus, reduce the dose by about 20% to mitigate hypoglycemia risk and titrate to effect [^112JWJi7] [^113Vm5ms] [^113r9kzd].

> I should confirm key caveats and monitoring steps so I don't miss safety issues. Both insulins can cause hypoglycemia, and Toujeo's longer onset and steady-state accumulation mean early under-treatment can occur if I don't titrate promptly; monitor fasting glucose closely for the first 1–2 weeks after switching, educate on hypoglycemia recognition and treatment, and review injection technique and site rotation to avoid lipodystrophy-related variability; in insulin-naive patients, start conservatively and titrate every 3–4 days to a fasting glucose target per individualized goals [^1137ZzJ1] [^116BUzxy] [^114TMqr6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and reference-aligned. Toujeo and Lantus have the same active ingredient but different PK/PD profiles; Toujeo offers comparable HbA1c control with a meaningful reduction in nocturnal and overall hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes, at the trade-off of requiring a modestly higher unit dose and careful switching strategy; in type 1 diabetes, efficacy is similar and hypoglycemia differences are less consistent, so agent selection should be individualized based on hypoglycemia risk, access, and patient preference, with explicit dose-adjustment plans and close follow-up during transitions [^112JWJi7] [^113Vm5ms] [^115AMNWM].

Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 U/mL) and Lantus (insulin glargine 100 U/mL) have the same active ingredient but differ in concentration and pharmacokinetics. Toujeo provides a **flatter, more stable profile** with less nocturnal hypoglycemia [^112JWJi7] and a longer duration of action (> 24 hours) [^115AMNWM], but requires about 10–18% more units than Lantus to match glycemic control [^113Vm5ms] [^111fUKZ4]. Both are indicated for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with similar HbA1c outcomes [^112JWJi7]; choose Toujeo for patients with hypoglycemia risk or who need stable basal coverage, and Lantus when cost or familiarity is prioritized.

## Pharmacological differences

| **Parameter** | **Toujeo (gla-300)** | **Lantus (gla-100)** |
|-|-|-|
| Concentration | 300 U/mL | 100 U/mL |
| Duration of action | > 24 hours | ~24 hours |
| PK/PD profile | Flatter, more stable | More peaked, less stable |
| Intra-subject variability | Lower | Higher |

---

Toujeo's higher concentration slows absorption and prolongs action, yielding a **smoother, more predictable profile** with less day-to-day variability [^115AMNWM] [^115t4ixh].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **HbA1c control**: Noninferior to Lantus in T1D and T2D [^112JWJi7] [^113Vm5ms].
- **Fasting glucose**: Similar reductions with both [^113Vm5ms].
- **Dose requirement**: Toujeo needs ~10–18% more units than Lantus for equivalent control [^113Vm5ms] [^111fUKZ4].

---

## Hypoglycemia risk

Toujeo significantly reduces **nocturnal hypoglycemia** versus Lantus in T2D [^112JWJi7] [^111LzCZ1]; in T1D, hypoglycemia rates are comparable overall, with less nocturnal hypoglycemia early in therapy [^112JWJi7] [^117EySup].

---

## Patient populations

Both are indicated for adults with T1D/T2D; Toujeo is also approved for **pediatrics ≥ 6 years** [^111PugVG] [^115Ppv4u]. Toujeo is especially beneficial for patients with **hypoglycemia risk**, **nocturnal hypoglycemia**, or those needing **stable basal coverage** [^112JWJi7] [^115mRkVL].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Injection volume**: Toujeo delivers the same units in one-third the volume, which may improve comfort at higher doses [^115AMNWM] [^114JGtqt].
- **Pen devices**: Toujeo SoloStar/Max SoloStar offer 1–2 unit steps and higher max doses per injection [^116BUzxy] [^117KJWfF].
- **Cost**: Similar list prices; net prices vary by payer and region [^116oPYhq] [^111zfYxz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines consider both appropriate; **individualize** based on hypoglycemia risk, comorbidities, and patient preference [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Feature** | **Toujeo (gla-300)** | **Lantus (gla-100)** |
|-|-|-|
| Concentration | 300 U/mL | 100 U/mL |
| Duration | > 24 hours | ~24 hours |
| PK/PD profile | Flatter, more stable | More peaked |
| Hypoglycemia | Lower nocturnal risk | Higher nocturnal risk |
| Dose requirement | 10–18% higher | Lower |
| Approval | Adults and pediatrics ≥ 6 years | Adults |

---

Toujeo and Lantus have similar HbA1c efficacy, but Toujeo offers a **smoother profile** with less nocturnal hypoglycemia at the cost of requiring more units; select Toujeo for patients prioritizing hypoglycemia avoidance or stable basal action, and Lantus when cost or familiarity is key.

### Comparative clinical efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) versus insulin glargine 100 U / mL in type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^112JWJi7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of glargine-U100 (Lantus/Gla-100) with glargine-U300 (Toujeo/Gla-300) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Materials and Methods

A literature search on Gla-300/Gla-100 in diabetes management was conducted using the MEDLINE/Embase/Cochrane databases from inception to 10 January 2021. Eligible studies considered for inclusion were parallel-design, randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The random-effects model was applied for interpretation of the results.

Results

Of 5348 records screened, 592 were assessed for eligibility and 15 RCTs were considered for data extraction and meta-analysis (T2D [N = 10; n = 7082]; T1D [N = 5; n = 2222]). In patients with T1D, all safety parameters were comparable between Gla-100 and Gla-300. In T2D, statistically significant differences were observed in favour of Gla-300 over Gla-100 for nocturnal and total hypoglycaemia. For efficacy parameters, a statistically and clinically significant difference favouring Gla-100 in basal insulin dose requirement was observed for both T2D and T1D. Change in HbA1c showed a statistically but not clinically significant reduction with Gla-100 compared with Gla-300 in T1D. Statistically significant but clinically less relevant differences favoured Gla-300 for control of body weight in T1D and T2D and Gla-100 for fasting blood glucose in T2D.

Conclusions

Gla-100 and Gla-300 had comparable efficacy and safety profiles in both T1D and T2D populations. Gla-300 showed a lower risk of nocturnal and total hypoglycaemia, significant in insulin-experienced/exposed patients with T2D. Patients on Gla-300 required significantly more units of insulin daily than the Gla-100 group to achieve equivalent efficacy.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The efficacy of TOUJEO given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with TOUJEO titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of TOUJEO than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were White, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when TOUJEO was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

### In silico examination of initiation of long-acting insulin analogs toujeo compared to lantus under 3 dosing titration rules in virtual type 2 diabetes subjects [^117PBGLA]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the benefits and clinical necessity of insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes (T2D), healthcare providers are reluctant to initiate insulin, and patients are reluctant to start it for several reasons, one of these being the complexity of insulin treatment. Patients and their healthcare providers can benefit from titration algorithms (TAs) or rules that assist with the initiation and titration of insulin, performing the calculations that are needed to safely initiate and conservatively adjust.

Methods

The primary objective for this in silico study was to examine the effectiveness of 3 dose TAs (1–3) for optimization of basal insulin glargine (Gla-100 and Gla-300). In the simulations, 100 virtual subjects with T2D were included (50% men, age 62 ± 3 years, HbA1c 8.1% ± 2.9%, body weight 94 ± 16 kg). Subjects were studied under each TA (TA1 and TA2 fasting blood glucose [FBG] targets 90–130 mg/dL, TA3 FBG target 110–150 mg/dL). Initial dose of both insulins was based on 0.2 U/kg body weight. During 3 months, subjects reported their FBG to the LTHome web-based dose guidance system with a rules engine to safely guide long-acting insulin titration and maintenance. Subjects followed dose recommendations to reach designated FBG target ranges.

Results

All subjects reached stable doses under all TAs with both Gla-100 and Gla-300 insulin, and 93 or more of the 100 subjects, depending on the assigned TA, achieved the target FBG range within the 3-month simulation for all TAs. Mean FBG was lowered (Gla-100: 155 ± 40 to 118 ± 11 mg/dL with TA1 and TA2 and 132 ± 12 mg/dL for TA3; Gla-300: 125 ± 14 with TA1 and TA2 and 134 ± 15 mg/dL with TA3). Calculated HbA1c improved from 8.1% ± 2.9% to 7.1% ± 2.5% for TA1 and TA2 and 7.5% ± 2.5% for TA3, a reduction of 0.9% and 0.6% over 3 months for both insulins. Three subjects on Gla-100 and one subject on Gla-300 experienced mild hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

All TAs delivered safe dose recommendations with minimal hypoglycemia, leading to a stable glucose control in the majority of subjects.

14.3 Clinical Studies in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a 26-week open-label, controlled study (Study C, n = 804), adults with type 2 diabetes were randomized to once-daily treatment in the evening with either TOUJEO or LANTUS. Short-acting mealtime insulin analogues with or without metformin were also administered. The average age was 60 years. The majority of patients were White (92%) and 53% were male; 20% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 36.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 11% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

In two open-label, controlled studies (n = 1670), adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to either TOUJEO or LANTUS once daily for 26 weeks as part of a regimen of combination therapy with noninsulin antidiabetic drugs. At the time of randomization, 808 patients were treated with basal insulin for more than 6 months (Study D) and 862 patients were insulin-naive (Study E).

In Study E, the average age was 58 years. The majority of patients were White (78%) and 58% were male; 29% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 33 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 15% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

Safety Outcomes Trial

No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of TOUJEO have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to TOUJEO.

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN (Hazard Ratio [95% CI] for MACE; 1.02 [0.94, 1.11]).

In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.99 [0.88, 1.11]) or death from cancer (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.94 [0.77, 1.15]) was also similar between treatment groups.

Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The efficacy of TOUJEO was evaluated in a 26-week, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (Study B) in 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal.

The mean age of the trial population was 13 years; 31% were < 12 years of age, 69% were ages ≥ 12 years of age. The mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Of the 463 pediatric patients, 51% were male, 92% were White, 3% were Black or African American, and 30% were Hispanic or Latino. The mean baseline BMI percentile was 68.32.

At week 26, the difference in HbA1c reduction from baseline between TOUJEO and LANTUS was 0.02% with a 95% confidence interval (-0.16%; 0.20%) and met the prespecified noninferiority margin (0.3%). The results are presented in Table 5.

2.4 Switching to LANTUS from Other Insulin Therapies

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to LANTUS from other insulin therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

When switching from:

Once-daily TOUJEO (insulin glargine 300 units/mL) to once-daily LANTUS (100 units/mL), the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is 80% of the TOUJEO dosage that is being discontinued.
Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS, the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued.
Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS, the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued.

Regarding the use of insulin glargine SC (also known as Lantus, Toujeo, Toujeo MAX) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis:

- Reduce dose.
- Reduce dose by 50%.
- Dose adjustments should generally follow the indication-specific recommendations as described in the adult dosing section but titrated more gradually; in patients experiencing hypoglycemia, consider more aggressive dose reductions (eg, by 25% to 40%) depending on severity.

2.3	Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of TOUJEO may take five days to fully manifest and the first dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When initiating TOUJEO, monitor glucose daily.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily.

2.4	Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to TOUJEO from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage.
When switching patients to TOUJEO, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Onset of Action

The pharmacodynamic profiles for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as a single dose of 0.4, 0.6, or 0.9 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes showed that on average, the onset of action develops over 6 hours post dose for all three single doses of TOUJEO.

Single-Dose Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. On a unit-to-unit basis, TOUJEO had a lower maximum (GIRmax) and 24-hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC0–24) compared to LANTUS. The overall glucose lowering effect of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was 12% of the glucose lowering effect of an equivalent dose of LANTUS. Glucose lowering at least 30% of the effect of a single 0.4 U/kg dose of LANTUS was not observed until the single dose of TOUJEO exceeded 0.6 U/kg.

Multiple Once-Daily Dose Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics of TOUJEO after 8 days of daily injection was evaluated in 30 patients with type 1 diabetes. At steady state, the 24-hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC0–24) of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was approximately 27% lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The glucose lowering effect of a TOUJEO dose increased with each daily administration.

The pharmacodynamic profile for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as multiple once-daily subcutaneous injections of 0.4 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 1.

5.2	Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen

Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site

Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia, and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed.

Changing to TOUJEO from other Insulin Therapies

On a unit-to-unit basis, TOUJEO has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to TOUJEO from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. Higher doses of TOUJEO were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The onset of action of TOUJEO develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of TOUJEO before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating TOUJEO monitor glucose daily, titrate TOUJEO as described in this prescribing information, and adjust coadministered glucose-lowering therapies per standard of care [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

### New insulin glargine 300 U / mL versus glargine 100 U / mL in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin and oral antihyperglycaemic drugs: glucose control and hypoglycaemia in a randomized controlled trial (EDITION JP 2) [^111P6im1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

While type 2 diabetes can initially be controlled in most people with lifestyle modification and oral antihyperglycaemic drug (OAD) treatment, disease progression often leads to a requirement for insulin therapy 1. Nevertheless, a number of barriers may reduce adherence to insulin regimens, and patients and physicians might be wary of intensifying therapy because of fear of hypoglycaemia 2, 3, which probably contributes to the inadequate glycaemic control that is observed in many people 3. The global prevalence of diabetes is increasing rapidly, including in Japan, where changing lifestyles have led to a rapid rise in type 2 diabetes over the last few decades 4, 5, 6. There is considerable need, therefore, for improved management strategies that can help to reduce the burden attributable to diabetes.

Since the market authorization of insulin glargine 100 U/ml [Gla‐100 (Lantus ®; Sanofi, Paris, France)] in 2000 (Gla‐100 was licensed in Japan in 2003), long‐acting basal insulin analogues have had a considerable positive impact on diabetes management 7. Nevertheless, quality of life for people with diabetes might be further improved by therapies that can achieve and maintain glycaemic control, lower hypoglycaemia risk and increase injection interval flexibility. New insulin glargine 300 U/ml (Gla‐300) may help to address these needs; studies in both Japanese and Western populations 8, 9 have shown more stable and prolonged pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with Gla‐300 versus Gla‐100, and persistence of glycaemic control beyond 24 h in people with type 1 diabetes. Gla‐300 was licensed in the USA, Europe and Japan in 2015 (as Toujeo ® in the USA and Europe; as Lantus ® XR in Japan).

The phase IIIa EDITION programme compared Gla‐300 with Gla‐100 in several different populations, and has shown that Gla‐300 is as effective as Gla‐100 in achieving glycaemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In addition, a lower hypoglycaemia risk was observed over 6 months in multinational type 2 diabetes populations treated with Gla‐300 combined with mealtime insulin (EDITION 1) or OAD(s) (EDITION 2), and in insulin‐naïve people (EDITION 3) 10, 11, 12. The present study, EDITION JP 2 (NCT01689142), investigated the efficacy and safety of Gla‐300 versus Gla‐100 in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes who were already using basal insulin and OAD(s).

### Basal insulin regime change from lantus to toujeo resulted in fewer hypoglycaemic episodes in a 28-year-old man with diabetes mellitus [^111WZG3D]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

An active 28-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus reported a reduced number of hypoglycaemic episodes following change in basal regime insulin glargine from U100 Lantus to U300 Toujeo. Consequently, an improved quality of life was also reported. Flash-based glucose monitoring was utilised to record 24-hour continuous glucose levels throughout two comparable 60-day periods before and after the change in regimen. Low blood glucose was most likely between 03:00 and 08:00. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes (≤ 3.9mmol/L) reduced by an average of 2.5 episodes per week. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes (≤ 2.9mmol/L) reduced to an average of 0.4 per week, down from 1.5 per week. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes reduced in frequency and severity. Furthermore, nocturnal hypoglycaemia episodes occurred in a more predictable time window. This was especially important in the reported reduction of impact on the patient's quality of life, as the episodes tended to be associated with anxiety and low mood. Patient education needed to facilitate this change was minimal, and benefits to the patient were great, including decreased sleep disturbances and reduced risk of associated anxiety symptoms.

### Commentary to "Differential effect of hypoalbuminemia on hypoglycemia on type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin glargine 300 U / mL and insulin degludec" by kawaguchi et al. diabetes therapy 2019 [^111CDuBw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

"For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL) expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control".

"At steady state, the 24 h glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC 0–24) of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was approximately 27% lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS".

Given that degludec and glargine U100 have been shown to produce parity in HbA 1c in numerous trials at equivalent unit doses, it follows that degludec will have a greater unit potency than glargine U300. This has indeed been confirmed in glucose clamp studies. Assuming that the disparity between glargine U300 and degludec is similar to that between glargine U300 and U100, insulin-naïve patients who commenced the cross-over study on the same unit dose of glargine U300 as of degludec would have effectively commenced on a dose with approximately 27% less glucose-lowering potency. Similarly, previous insulin users switching unit-for-unit from, for example, NPH insulin or glargine U100 to degludec would have maintained an equivalent dose, whereas those switching to glargine U300 would, in effect, have received a substantial dose reduction by 27%. Admittedly, the minimum 10-day titration period would have gone some way to mitigating this dose difference, but this interval is short and would have allowed only a few titration steps. In the second period of the study, patients were crossed over unit-for-unit and the dose left unchanged, so those switching from degludec to glargine U300 would have, in effect, had a 27% dose reduction, whereas those switching from glargine U300 to degludec would have had a substantial dose increase, in effect by 37%.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design and participants

EDITION 1, 2 and 3 (NCT01499082, NCT01499095, NCT01676220) were multicentre, randomized (1:1), open‐label, two‐arm, parallel‐group, phase IIIa studies. 14, 15, 16 Briefly, eligible participants were aged ≥ 18 years with T2DM and receiving the following: EDITION 1, basal (≥ 42 U/d) and prandial insulin therapy ± metformin for ≥ 1 year; EDITION 2, basal insulin therapy (≥ 42 U/d) in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs; EDITION 3, oral antidiabetic drugs received for ≥ 6 months before screening and insulin‐naïve. People with severe, unstable or end‐stage renal disease (CKD stage 5, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2) were excluded. Participants were randomized (1:1) to once‐daily evening injections of Gla‐300 (Toujeo; Sanofi, Paris, France) or Gla‐100 (Lantus, Sanofi), titrated to a fasting self‐monitored plasma glucose target of 4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L (80‐100 mg/dL); sulphonylurea use was not allowed.

In the present post hoc analysis, study populations were pooled and results assessed across two renal function subgroups, according to baseline eGFR (calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation): ≥ 15 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage 3‐4, indicating mild‐to‐moderate renal impairment) and ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (indicating preserved renal function).

### Association of patient profile with glycemic control and hypoglycemia with insulin glargine 300 U / mL in type 2 diabetes: a post hoc patient-level meta-analysis [^111LzCZ1]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (Type 2 DM) is a heterogeneous disease, with a population that exhibits diverse clinical and biological characteristics. Current recommendations for the management of Type 2 DM encourage a patient-centered approach, such that less stringent glycemic targets (e.g. glycated hemoglobin [HbA 1c] < 64 mmol/mol [8.0%]) may be considered on an individual basis, to take into account, for example, factors such as polypharmacy, comorbidities, frailty, renal disease, and reduced life expectancy found to be associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia. To most appropriately individualize treatments and glycemic targets, it is important to understand how the characteristics of each individual might affect the outcomes of treatment. Studies investigating potential predictors of response have highlighted several demographic and clinical factors that may influence the effectiveness of particular diabetes therapies, as well as the attainment of glycemic targets.

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300; Toujeo ®; Sanofi S. A. Paris, France) is a long-acting basal insulin analog with prolonged and more stable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles than insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100; Lantus®; Sanofi S. A.). The EDITION program included three multinational clinical studies that compared the efficacy and safety of Gla-300 to those of Gla-100 in different populations of people with Type 2 DM. In the individual EDITION studies and a post hoc, patient-level meta-analysis, Gla-300 provided comparable glycemic control to Gla-100 with fewer hypoglycemia events over 6 months of treatment. Change in body weight was low in both treatment groups, with slightly less weight gain in patients receiving Gla-300.

Product-Specific Trends

The list price ($24.65) of the new product Toujeo, introduced in 2015, closely matched the 2016 list price ($24.71) of the originator Lantus; however, its net price was slightly lower ($12.92 for Toujeo vs $14.56 for Lantus) (Figure 1). The list and net prices of Tresiba were higher than the list and net prices of Lantus and insulin detemir throughout the study period. Basaglar, the product that is bioequivalent to Lantus, had a lower list price than Lantus ($21.50 vs $24.87) in 2017. The net price of Basaglar ($10.92) was slightly lower than the net price of Lantus ($12.79) in 2017, but the net price of Lantus was reduced to match that of Basaglar by 2019 ($9.95 vs $9.99, respectively).

Trends in List Prices, Net Prices, and Discounts for Long-Acting Insulin Analogues

List prices were estimated as mean reimbursement rates in Medicare Part D per 100 insulin units. Net prices were estimated as the difference between list prices and commercial discounts and represent the prices faced by Part D and private plans after rebates. The insulin glargine Toujeo was approved in February 2015, insulin degludec (Tresiba) in September 2015, and the insulin glargine Basaglar in December 2015. As explained in the Methods, prices and discounts of new products are not reported for the first year after market entry (drugs approved in the first half of a calendar year) or 2 years after market entry (drugs approved in the second half of a calendar year) to mitigate how inventory variation may have affected the data, which is why data for Toujeo are first reported in 2016 and data for insulin degludec and Basaglar are first reported in 2017. Outcomes are expressed per 100 insulin units. The dashed line indicates approval for Toujeo, insulin degludec, and Basaglar.

The phase IIIa EDITION programme has shown that Gla‐300 is as effective as Gla‐100 in achieving glucose control in multinational populations with type 1 or 2 diabetes 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 without raising any safety concerns. In Western populations with type 2 diabetes, it was shown that glycaemic control was accompanied by a reduction in hypoglycaemia risk with Gla‐300 versus Gla‐100 15, 17, 19. In a multinational type 1 diabetes population (EDITION 4), comparable glycaemic control was observed, but with no difference in annualized rates of hypoglycaemia, except during the first 8 weeks of treatment, when the rate of nocturnal confirmed [≤ 3.9 mmol/l (≤ 70 mg/dl)] or severe hypoglycaemia was lower with Gla‐300 than with Gla‐100 16. In addition, a study in people with type 1 diabetes that used continuous glucose monitoring showed more stable 24‐h glucose levels and lower glucose variability, with lower annualized rates of nocturnal confirmed [< 3.0 mmol/l (< 54 mg/dl)] or severe hypoglycaemia with Gla‐300 than with Gla‐100 20. In both of these studies in type 1 diabetes, the same efficacy and safety was observed with Gla‐300, regardless of injection time (morning versus evening) 16, 20. Gla‐300 was licensed in the USA, Europe and Japan in 2015 (as Toujeo ® in the USA and Europe and as Lantus ® XR in Japan). In the present study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of Gla‐300 versus Gla‐100 in Japanese adults with type 1 diabetes already using basal and mealtime insulin.

2 METHODS

2.1 Trial design

EDITION 2, EDITION 3 and EDITION JP 2 were multicentre, randomized, open‐label, two‐arm, parallel‐group, phase 3a studies in different populations of adults with T2DM (NCT01499095, NCT01676220, NCT01689142) and have been described previously. 6, 8, 10 In EDITION 2 and EDITION JP 2, participants must have used basal insulin treatment (≥ 42 U/d in EDITION 2) for more than 6 months, in combination with non‐insulin antihyperglycaemic agents within the previous 4 weeks. For the EDITION 2 trial, exclusion criteria included recent (within the past 2 months) use of sulphonylureas. In the EDITION JP 2 trial, concomitant sulphonylurea and/or glinide treatment was permitted, with doses adjusted if at least two symptomatic or at least one severe hypoglycaemic episode(s) occurred. Overall, 63% of participants in the EDITION JP 2 trial received sulphonylureas and/or glinides, with a similar proportion of participants in the Gla‐300 (62%) and Gla‐100 (64%) groups. 11 Participants in the EDITION 3 trial were insulin‐naïve and were required to have used non‐insulin antihyperglycaemic agents for at least 6 months before screening; if participants were receiving sulphonylureas/glinides, these medications were discontinued.

Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive once‐daily injections of Gla‐300 (Toujeo, Sanofi, Paris, France) using a modified SoloSTAR (Sanofi) pen‐injector in the EDITION 2 trial or a modified Tactipen (Sanofi) injector in the EDITION 3 and JP 2 trials, or Gla‐100 (Lantus, Sanofi) using a SoloSTAR pen. Basal insulin was titrated, seeking a pre‐breakfast SMPG target of 4.4–5.6 mmol/L (80–100 mg/dL).

Basal insulin injections were to be administered in the evening, defined as the time immediately before the evening meal until bedtime, at the same time every day. All participants recorded time of injection.

Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of patients randomized to LANTUS and standard care respectively at end of study. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years (range: 8 days to 7.9 years). The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the study was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the LANTUS and standard care group respectively. The median dose of LANTUS at end of study was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to LANTUS were using LANTUS at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the LANTUS group than in the standard care group.

Overall, the incidence of major adverse CV outcomes was similar between groups (see Table 14). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

In the ORIGIN study, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) or death from cancer (Table 15) was similar between treatment groups.

However, with Gla-300, the incidence and event rate for confirmed hypoglycemia (< 3.0 mmol/L) at any time of the day were significantly reduced by 37% and 43% compared to IDeg during the titration phase.

For the evaluation of efficacy and safety, randomized controlled trials (RCT) remain the "gold standard", and are pivotal for regulatory bodies in the drug approval process. Nonetheless, the intensive monitoring and education provided during the RCTs are not always representative of daily clinical practice. A gap has been identified between efficacy in RCTs and effectiveness in real-world data for GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors. Limited resources and poor medication adherence in the real world may largely account for this finding. Thus, the external validity of results obtained from RCTs needs to be confirmed in a "real-life" setting such as non-interventional trials. Non-interventional observational studies with less restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria can include broader populations of patients and offer an important tool to better assess the real-world effectiveness of a drug. Retrospective real-world evidence gathered with Gla-300 has already demonstrated a glucose control improvement along with a lower risk for hypoglycemia as compared to other basal insulins. In this study we aimed to prospectively investigate the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 in patients with T2D in Switzerland after 6 and 12 months in real-life conditions. The results for the German study cohort were recently presented at the 78 th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association.

Baseline Characteristics of the Patients Stratified by Endpoint HbA 1c

Patients were stratified according to an endpoint HbA 1c level of either < 7.0% or ≥ 7.0%. Among them, 1019 patients (55.2%) reached HbA 1c < 7.0% and 828 patients (44.8%) did not. Patient demographics and characteristics of the two groups at baseline are shown in Table 1. Patients with an endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were younger (55.10 ± 11.16 vs 57.90 ± 10.61 years; P < 0.001) and had lower baseline BMI (24.94 ± 2.94 vs 25.34 ± 3.58 kg/m 2; P < 0.05), shorter mean duration of diabetes (6.05 ± 5.60 vs 9.14 ± 6.49 years; P < 0.001), and lower baseline HbA 1c (7.34 ± 1.16% vs 8.28 ± 1.06%; P < 0.001) and FPG (7.60 ± 1.87 vs 8.70 ± 2.19 mmol/L; P < 0.001) than patients with an endpoint HbA 1c of ≥ 7.0%. The HbA 1c < 7.0% group also had a lower proportion of patients with diabetes complications (36.2% vs 45.4%; P < 0.001) and comorbidities (57.2% vs 63.6%; P < 0.01). A lower proportion of female patients achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% compared with those who achieved HbA 1c ≥ 7% (41.3% vs 47.7%; P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients with an endpoint HbA 1c of < 7.0% received a markedly lower dose of premixed insulin prior to treatment switch (0.41 ± 0.14 vs 0.46 ± 0.16 U/kg/day; P < 0.001). There was also a difference in the number OADs taken at baseline between patients who achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% and those who did not (P < 0.001); a higher proportion of patients who achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% took only one OAD at baseline (63.6% vs 49.3%).

Conclusion

In patients with type 2 diabetes, switching basal insulin to Gla-300 improves glycemic control, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia and no weight gain. These results confirm the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 in a real-world setting and show that Gla-300 is a suitable therapy option in Switzerland for patients with diabetes.

### Insulin matters: a practical approach to basal insulin management in type 2 diabetes [^115a2C9j]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

How to Dose?

There are several important concepts to remember when dosing basal insulin: (a) the starting dose will be wrong; (b) there is no maximal insulin dose; (c) titration of insulin dose is the key. Each of these concepts needs to be explicitly discussed and understood by the patient in order for titration to be successful. Despite 92% of physicians agreeing that "insulin intensification is an essential element of diabetes management", 30% of primary care physicians "never or rarely" personally intensified insulin (vs 4% of specialists) in the multinational survey MODIFY. Interestingly, in a recent multinational survey, HCPs generally preferred a gradual and safe approach to titration to avoid hypoglycemia whereas patients are frustrated by time to reach goal. It is therefore important to manage the patient's expectations.

The starting dose for basal insulin recommended by this panel is 10 U/day. The dose should be incrementally increased on a regular basis using target FBG as the determinant for dose adjustments. At initiation, educating patients that many people will need at least 40–50 units of basal insulin to achieve target FBG is useful for goal setting and behavior shaping. This may help mitigate patient fear/reluctance to up-titrate.

Box 1A details the recommendations by the panel for basal insulin dose and titration.

### Cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113sx4p4]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Scenario Analyses

Two new basal insulin analogues have recently entered the market, IGlar U300 (Toujeo ®) and IGlar biosimilar (Abasaglar ®). Given that they are new to the market, there are currently no head-to-head data for them versus IDeg. However, scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of IDeg versus these comparators using available data and plausible assumptions.

IDeg versus Abasaglar ®

This scenario analysis assumed that Abasaglar ® has the same efficacy and safety as IGlar U100 (Lantus ®). However, Abasaglar ® is a biosimilar and is not identical to IGlar U100, and EMA approval does not involve any assessment or recommendation regarding interchangeability. The price of Abasaglar ® is 15% lower than that of IGlar U100 (Lantus ®), so this scenario reflected a 15% reduction in the price of IGlar U100, with no change in any other parameters.

Plain Language Summary

The phase III clinical trial reported here compared two similar basal insulin products, namely, Lilly insulin glargine (Basaglar ®) and a reference insulin glargine product (Lantus ®), used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Some patients were using basal insulin prior to entry, and others were insulin naïve. The main racial groups were Asian (48% of the study population), White (46%), and African American (6%). Patients were recruited from India, Korea, Taiwan, Russia, Turkey, the USA, and Puerto Rico. Efficacy and safety measures were acquired over 24 weeks. The main efficacy measures evaluated blood glucose, including glycated hemoglobin, an indicator of blood glucose levels over approximately 3 months, and self-monitored blood glucose taken at several time points over the course of the day. Safety measures included incidence and rate of low blood sugar, incidence of adverse events, and incidence and levels of insulin antibodies. Dose and weight assessments were also obtained. In general, the two treatments provided similar results for these measures. Only one result showed a statistically significant difference between treatments, namely, the reduction in premorning meal self-monitored blood glucose was greater in patients on Lantus ® at 24 weeks. To further evaluate this finding, we analyzed treatment effects on this measure across different sets of patient subgroups. No significant differential treatment effects were observed. Considering this and other results, the difference was not expected to be clinically meaningful. Findings from this study extend the body of evidence from other trials supporting the similarity of these two insulin glargine products.

2.3 Converting to LANTUS from other insulin therapies

If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate- or
long-acting insulin to a regimen with LANTUS, the amount and timing of
shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be
adjusted.

If transferring patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS,
the recommended initial LANTUS dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being
discontinued.
If transferring patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS,
the recommended initial LANTUS dose is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being
discontinued. This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

1 INTRODUCTION

Reducing the number of daily basal insulin injections for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can lower the burden of disease management, potentially leading to improved treatment adherence and persistence, 1 which may be associated with better long‐term blood glucose control, improved health resource utilization, and reduced costs. 2, 3 Long‐acting basal insulin analogues, such as insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100; Lantus; Sanofi, Paris, France) or detemir, have improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, with longer duration of action than neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, 3, 4 allowing many people with T2DM to adopt a once‐daily regimen 3, 4; however, a substantial proportion of individuals using basal insulin still inject at least twice daily. 3, 5 Potential reasons for this may include a perceived, or real, risk of hypoglycaemia with shorter‐acting basal insulins, 2, 6, 7 the desire to adjust daytime and night‐time basal insulin doses, and reducing the injection site discomfort associated with higher volume injections. 8

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla‐300; Toujeo; Sanofi) has a prolonged pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile compared with Gla‐100, with low variability and high reproducibility, resulting in more predictable and evenly distributed glucose‐lowering activity beyond 24 hours. 9, 10 This extended and more stable coverage may enable more people currently administering multiple daily basal insulin injections to minimize the number of basal injections. The EDITION 1 to 3 trial programme assessed the efficacy and safety of Gla‐300 in T2DM, and demonstrated similar glycaemic control vs Gla‐100 with less hypoglycaemia. 11 This post hoc analysis of EDITION 1 and 2 has explored the effect of switching to once‐daily therapy on outcomes with Gla‐300 and Gla‐100 in the subgroup of participants previously receiving twice‐daily basal insulin injections.

### A multicentre, UK, retrospective, observational study to assess the effectiveness of insulin glargine 300 units / mL in treating people with type 1 diabetes mellitus in routine clinical practice (SPARTA) [^111p9W1P]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insulin glargine 300 units/ml [U300 (Toujeo ®); Sanofi, Paris, France] is a second‐generation, once‐daily basal insulin analogue 1. Because of its distinct formulation, U300 has a discrete pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile when compared with insulin glargine 100 units/ml [U100 (Lantus ®); Sanofi] 2, 3. The higher concentration of U300 generates a precipitate with a smaller surface area after subcutaneous injection compared with U100, resulting in a steadier and extended glargine release, and leading to a smoother pharmacokinetic profile and longer duration of action 1, 2, 3.

The use of U300 in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus is supported by results from two phase III randomized controlled trials: EDITION 4 and EDITION JP 1 4, 5; however, no participants from the UK were included in these randomized controlled trials, and there is no real‐world evidence regarding the use and utility of U300 in Type 1 diabetes in UK clinical practice.

The present study was designed to provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of U300 in people with Type 1 diabetes across the UK over a 6‐month observation period.

Why Should I Choose a Second-Generation Insulin Analogue?

Pharmacology

Second-generation basal insulin analogues insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Toujeo ®) and insulin degludec (Tresiba ®) have been developed to address clinical needs for a stable predictable basal insulin response beyond 24 h. These insulin analogues are characterised by different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100), a first-generation basal insulin analogue commonly used in type 2 diabetes, and insulin detemir.

Second-generation basal insulins have a comparatively longer duration of action (> 24 h), less glycaemic fluctuation (more even 24 h distribution) and less intrapatient and interpatient variability. These pharmacological differences have important implications for practice.

Supportive Clinical Trial Evidence

A comprehensive collection of clinical trials comparing Gla-300 to current insulins, oral hypoglycaemic agents and in a variety of populations has been done (EDITION studies). These are multinational trials with a range of patient populations. The 'average' patient was aged 57–60 years, 52–57% being male with an HbA1c of 8.1–8.6%.

EDITION 1, 2 and 3 demonstrated lower rates of hypoglycaemic events and particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia, positively comparing Gla-300 to Gla-100. EDITION 4 demonstrated comparable HbA1c levels between the two insulins but the eventual insulin Gla-300 dose was 0.62 U/kg/day compared to 0.53 U/kg/day for Gla-100.

An independent meta-analysis comparing the EDITION and the BEGIN programmes involving degludec (IDeg) suggested that, despite reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), IDeg was associated with less improvement in HbA1c versus Gla-100 with a hypoglycaemia benefit only evident at night. Gla-300 showed similar HbA1c reduction to Gla-100 with lower risk of hypoglycaemia both at night and any time of the day.

Similarly, in a review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with Gla-300 and IDeg in patients with both type 1 and 2 diabetes, the study showed that a large number of patients succeeded in meeting HbA1c targets but also had less hypoglycaemic events with both insulins versus first-generation insulin glargine 100 U/mL.

14.1	Overview of Clinical Studies

The efficacy of Insulin Glargine, U-300 given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with Insulin Glargine, U-300 titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. Insulin Glargine, U-300 and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were White, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with Insulin Glargine, U-300 used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when Insulin Glargine, U-300 was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

5.3	Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin, including TOUJEO. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving, or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, in patients using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.

The long-acting effect of TOUJEO may delay recovery from hypoglycemia compared to shorter-acting insulins.

Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia

The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulation. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of TOUJEO may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia

Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, do not administer TOUJEO intravenously, intramuscularly or in an insulin pump, or dilute or mix TOUJEO with any other insulin products or solutions.

### Switching to insulin glargine 300 units / mL in real-world older patients with type 2 diabetes (DELIVER 3) [^1137VP55]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was 9.7% in 2013 to 2016. 1 Of these people, ~12 million were aged ≥ 65 years, resulting in a prevalence of diabetes in this age group of 25%. 2 Diabetes was estimated to be associated with direct medical costs of US $237 billion in the USA in 2017; > 60% of this cost was for those aged ≥ 65 years. 3

Older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an elevated risk of hypoglycaemia compared with younger adults. 4, 5 Not surprisingly, hypoglycaemia has been associated with increased healthcare resource utilization and hospitalizations. 6 Additionally, among older adults with T2D, hypoglycaemia has been associated with cognitive decline, dementia, falls, accidents and fractures. 7, 8, 9, 10 Therefore, the American Diabetes Association recommends that treatments for older adults with T2D should focus on minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia. 11 Treatments with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia may also lead to better adherence. 12

To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, glycaemic goals for older adults are less strict than for younger adults, ranging from < 7.5% (for otherwise healthy individuals) and from < 8.5% (for those with complex/poor health), 13 compared with < 7% for younger adults. 11, 13 The first‐line pharmacologic treatment for older adults with T2D is metformin; other options include oral dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors, sodium glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists and basal insulin. 11

First‐generation basal insulins include insulin glargine 100 units/mL (Gla‐100; Lantus 14) and insulin detemir (IDet; Levemir 15). Insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Gla‐300; Toujeo 16), a second‐generation basal insulin, has a more stable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile and a longer duration of action than Gla‐100, leading to lower within‐day variability and better day‐to‐day reproducibility. 17, 18 In the EDITION randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there was a comparable to lower risk of hypoglycaemia with Gla‐300 than with Gla‐100 in adults with T2D. 19, 20, 21, 22 Similar results have recently been reported in the SENIOR RCT, which enrolled patients aged ≥ 65 years with T2D. 23

2.2	General Dosing Instructions

TOUJEO is available in 2 single-patient-use prefilled pens:
The TOUJEO SoloStar prefilled pen contains 450 units of insulin glargine. It delivers doses in 1-unit increments and can deliver up to 80 units in a single injection.
The TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen contains 900 units of insulin glargine. It delivers doses in 2-unit increments and can deliver up to 160 units in a single injection. It is recommended for patients requiring at least 20 units per day.
When changing between TOUJEO SoloStar and TOUJEO Max SoloStar, if the patient's previous dose was an odd number, the dose should be increased or decreased by 1 unit to match the dose increments dialable on each prefilled pen.
The dose counter of the TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen shows the number of units of TOUJEO to be injected and no conversion is required.
Inject TOUJEO subcutaneously once a day at the same time of day.
During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Individualize and titrate the dosage of TOUJEO based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal.
Titrate the dose of TOUJEO no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days.
Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

14.3	Clinical Studies in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a 26-week open-label, controlled study (Study C, n = 804), adults with type 2 diabetes were randomized to once-daily treatment in the evening with either Insulin Glargine, U-300 or LANTUS. Short-acting mealtime insulin analogues with or without metformin were also administered. The average age was 60 years. The majority of patients were White (92%) and 53% were male; 20% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 36.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with Insulin Glargine, U-300 used 11% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

In two open-label, controlled studies (n = 1670), adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to either Insulin Glargine, U-300 or LANTUS once daily for 26 weeks as part of a regimen of combination therapy with noninsulin antidiabetic drugs. At the time of randomization, 808 patients were treated with basal insulin for more than 6 months (Study D) and 862 patients were insulin-naive (Study E).

### Ease of use of the insulin glargine 300 U / mL pen injector in insulin-Naïve people with type 2 diabetes [^114JGtqt]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Long-acting basal insulin analogs, including insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100, Lantus ®, Sanofi, Paris, France), have been mainstays of diabetes treatment since their introduction more than 10 years ago. The efficacy and long-term safety of Gla-100 is well documented. - Once-daily insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300; Toujeo ®, Sanofi, Paris, France) has been approved for use in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Gla-300 has been shown to have more stable, prolonged pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles compared with Gla-100, resulting in comparable glycemic control with less hypoglycemia versus Gla-100 in people with type 2 (T2DM) - and type 1 diabetes. Gla-300 contains the same active ingredient as Gla-100and provides the same number of units but in one-third of the volume.

Gla-100 is usually administered using the disposable (prefilled) SoloSTAR ® insulin pen (Sanofi, Paris, France). Because of the difference in volume between Gla-100 and Gla-300, this injector pen required modification to allow accurate Gla-300 administration. In addition, certain features have been enhanced to improve the experience of users. The Gla-300 SoloSTAR injector pen (Sanofi, Paris, France) provides accurate delivery of Gla-300, with low injection force. An initial survey suggested that both pen users and health care professionals who train people with diabetes in how to use pen devices find the Gla-300 injector pen easy to use.

This phase 3b study further investigated the ease of use/ease of learning of the Gla-300 injector pen, as well as treatment satisfaction, glycemic control, reliability, and safety of the device in insulin- and pen-naïve people with T2DM.

12	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous LANTUS is approximately the same as that for human insulin. Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of LANTUS or NPH insulin. The median time between subcutaneous injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to > 24 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for LANTUS.

The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration of LANTUS was similar. The time course of action of insulins, including LANTUS, may vary between patients and within the same patient.

After subcutaneous injection of LANTUS in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin.

Elimination

Metabolism

A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin, M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation.

Specific Populations

Age, Race, Body Mass Index, and Gender

Effect of age, race, body mass index (BMI), and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine has not been evaluated. However, in controlled clinical studies in adults (n = 3,890) and a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients (n = 349), subgroup analyses based on age, race, BMI, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between LANTUS and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Improved glycemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) in patients with type 2 diabetes: real-world effectiveness in Switzerland [^115u2WtU]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus remains a major challenge for physicians and care providers. In 2017, 1 in 11 adults was estimated to suffer from diabetes, and the global prevalence is expected to rise to over 600 million patients in 2045, the majority of whom will be affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D). In recent years, a considerable number of treatment options have emerged, allowing for individualized care and improving clinical outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes.

However, despite new antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptor agonists that have been shown to improve glycemic control, disease progression often ultimately necessitates the initiation of an insulin regimen. Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Toujeo ®, Sanofi–Aventis) is a basal insulin analog with improved properties, including more stable and smoother pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL and insulin degludec 100 U/mL. In the EDITION phase III program, these properties translated into an unaltered efficacy in terms of HbA1c reduction but with less hypoglycemia vs. Gla-100. Notably, in EDITION 2, patients with T2D on basal insulin supported oral therapy who switched to Gla-300 showed a 27% risk reduction for any hypoglycemia from baseline to month 6. Furthermore, patients with Gla-300 experienced significantly less weight gain than patients with Gla-100. These results suggested a relevant treatment benefit for patients with T2D uncontrolled on basal insulin supported oral therapy who switched to Gla-300, as hypoglycemia and weight gain are important barriers to insulin therapy initiation, adherence, and intensification.

Characteristics of Patients Unable to Achieve Target HbA 1c Stratified by Endpoint FPG

Further analysis of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% was conducted according to whether or not they were able to achieve an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (Table 4). The majority of patients unable to achieve target HbA 1c also failed to reach an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (74.5% vs 25.5%). Patients with an endpoint FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L had significantly lower endpoint HbA 1c (7.60 ± 0.88% vs 7.90 ± 0.89%; P < 0.0001), baseline FPG (8.01 ± 1.82 vs 8.97 ± 2.25 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), endpoint FPG (5.46 ± 0.57 vs 8.01 ± 2.32 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), baseline 2-h PPG (11.67 ± 3.09 vs 12.81 ± 3.86 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), endpoint 2-h PPG (9.24 ± 2.66 vs 10.89 ± 2.68 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), BMI (24.12 ± 3.04 vs 25.76 ± 3.67 kg/m 2; P < 0.0001), dose of endpoint insulin glargine in U/day (16.42 ± 6.15 vs 18.39 ± 6.62 U/day; P = 0.0002), and baseline dose of premixed insulin in U/day (29.78 ± 9.28 vs 32.33 ± 11.55 U/day; P = 0.0013) than patients with an endpoint FPG of > 6.1 mmol/L. Other characteristics such as age, baseline HbA 1c, duration of diabetes, dose of endpoint insulin glargine in U/kg/day, and baseline dose of premixed insulin in U/kg/day were similar between both groups.

2.2	General Dosing Instructions

TOUJEO is available in 2 single-patient-use prefilled pens:
TOUJEO SoloStar contains 450 units of TOUJEO U-300. It delivers doses in 1-unit increments and can deliver up to 80 units in a single injection.
TOUJEO Max SoloStar contains 900 units of TOUJEO U-300. It delivers doses in 2-unit increments and can deliver up to 160 units in a single injection. It is recommended for patients requiring at least 20 units per day.
When changing between TOUJEO SoloStar and TOUJEO Max SoloStar, if the patient's previous dose was an odd number, the dose should be increased or decreased by 1 unit to match the dose increments dialable on each prefilled pen.
The dose counter of the TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen shows the number of units of TOUJEO to be injected and no conversion is required.
Inject TOUJEO subcutaneously once a day at the same time of day.
During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Individualize and titrate the dosage of TOUJEO based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal.
Titrate the dose of TOUJEO no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days.
Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### The effectiveness of insulin glargine 300 U / mL among type 2 diabetes patients: analysis of a real-world data in Israel [^113gj4Y1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive metabolic condition characterized by insulin resistance and decreased beta‐cell function. 1 Patients with T2DM suffer from either one or several metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity, increased endogenous glucose output, compromised insulin action and insulin secretion dysfunction. 2, 3, 4 This condition places patients at an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarctions, stoke and elevated blood pressure along with many other potential health impediments. 5, 6

The reduction of functional insulin‐producing beta cells contributes to the development and progression of T2DM. 7, 8 As the nature of this condition is progressive and as beta‐cell activity declines, a glycaemic control and medication regimen should be re‐evaluated routinely and adjusted based on patient characteristics. As T2DM advances, the endogenous insulin may be insufficient to achieve the desired glycaemic control. Based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommendations, once the glycaemic control is insufficiently achieved by using other antihyperglycaemic agents, the intensification with insulin should be considered and should not be delayed. 9, 10 Treatment with insulin has the advantage of being highly effective in reducing blood glucose levels as mono‐therapy or in combination with any other agents, especially in severe hyperglycaemia when blood glucose levels reach ≥ 300 mg/dL or HbA 1c ≥ 10%. 11

Physicians and patients may be reluctant in initiating insulin therapy, where such a delay could increase the risk of long‐term glycaemic complications that may lead to micro and macro‐vascular complications. 12, 13 Although good glycaemic control is related to a lower risk for micro and macro‐vascular complications, fear of the short‐term outcome of hypoglycaemia is associated with delayed insulin initiation and no or low adherence to insulin treatment. 14

In June 2016, insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla‐300; Toujeo ®), a longer‐acting second generation basal insulin analogue, was introduced in Israel. This insulin is a new formulation of insulin glargine with a more stable and prolonged glucose lowering effect compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100; Lantus ®).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption and Bioavailability. After subcutaneous injection of
insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin
serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a
relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced
peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Serum insulin concentrations were thus
consistent with the time profile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin
glargine.

After subcutaneous injection of 0.3 Units/kg insulin glargine in patients
with type 1 diabetes, a relatively constant concentration/time profile has been
demonstrated. The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh
subcutaneous administration was similar.

Metabolism. A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin
glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the
subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar
to that of insulin, M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). Unchanged

the effect of age, race, and gender on the pharmacokinetics of LANTUS is not
available. However, in controlled clinical trials in adults (n = 3890) and a

on age, race, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between
insulin glargine and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Improved glycemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) in patients with type 2 diabetes: real-world effectiveness in Switzerland [^1113ZbmU]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300, Toujeo ®) is a long-acting, once-daily basal insulin with improved — more stable and smoother — pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100) and insulin degludec (IDeg). These properties have been shown to translate into an effective HbA1c reduction with the advantage of a lower risk of hypoglycemia in randomized controlled trials of Gla-300 versus Gla-100. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 under real-world conditions in Switzerland.

Methods

The prospective, observational, open-label, multicenter study TOP-2 explored the effectiveness of Gla-300 in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled (HbA1c 7.5–10%) on their previous basal insulin in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The primary endpoints were the percentages of patients achieving a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L after 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, and insulin dose as well as hypoglycemia incidence and safety. Here we report the results for the Swiss patient cohort after 12 months of treatment with insulin glargine 300 U/mL.

Results

The 62 patients (33 men) had a mean age of 65 years, a mean diabetes duration of 14 years, a mean body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m 2, and were mainly switched from Gla-100 (44%) to Gla-300. The most common concomitant oral anti-diabetes therapy was metformin (65%). The mean individual HbA1c target chosen by the investigators was 7.4%. After 12 months of therapy, Gla-300 significantly reduced mean HbA1c from 8.2% to 7.6% (p < 0.0001). Likewise, Gla-300 significantly reduced mean FPG from 9.1 mmol/L to 7.4 mmol/L (p < 0.0001). At study end, 32% of patients achieved FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, 55% achieved FPG ≤ 7.2 mmol/L, and 57% achieved their individual HbA1c target. Gla-300 was uptitrated to a mean dose of 40 units per day. Symptomatic hypoglycemia incidence after 12 months was low at 9.7% and a rate of 0.23 events per patient year. Body weight remained stable and was not significantly altered during the study.

Conclusion

Upon switching basaI insulin to Gla-300, overall glucose control significantly improved and glycemic targets were achieved with a low rate of hypoglycemia in T2D patients under real-world conditions in Switzerland.

Introduction

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300, Toujeo ®) is a long-acting, once-daily basal insulin with improved-more stable and smoother-pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100) and insulin degludec (IDeg).

8.5 Geriatric Use

In controlled clinical studies, 30 of 304 (9.8%) TOUJEO-treated patients with type 1 diabetes and 327 of 1242 (26.3%) TOUJEO-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age, among them 2.0% of the patients with type 1 and 3.0% of the patients with type 2 diabetes were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of TOUJEO have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.

Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when TOUJEO is administered to geriatric patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Studies (14)].

8.6	Renal Impairment

The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of TOUJEO has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for TOUJEO in patients with kidney impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of TOUJEO has not been studied. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for TOUJEO in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Efficacy and safety of MK-1293 insulin glargine compared with originator insulin glargine (lantus) in type 2 diabetes: a randomized, open-label clinical trial [^111AqBSp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy and safety of MK-1293 insulin glargine (Mk-Gla) and Lantus (Sa-Gla) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Materials and Methods

This Phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, 24-week clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02059187) enrolled 531 participants with T2DM (HbA1c ≤ 11.0%) either eligible for or currently taking basal insulin (≥ 10 U/day). Participants were randomized 1:1 to once-daily Mk-Gla (n = 263) or Sa-Gla (n = 263). Titration of insulin was guided by a fasting plasma glucose (FPG)-based dosing algorithm. The primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of change from baseline in HbA1c (margin of 0.40% [4.4 mmol/mol]) with Mk-Gla versus Sa-Gla after 24 weeks. The primary safety objective was anti-insulin antibody development after 24 weeks.

Results

For Mk-Gla and Sa-Gla, the least squares (LS) mean HbA1c change from baseline (95% CI) was -1.28 (-1.41, -1.15)% (-14.0 [-15.4, -12.6] mmol/mol) and -1.30 (-1.43, -1.18)% (-14.2 [-15.6, -12.8] mmol/mol). The LS mean HbA1c difference (Mk-Gla minus Sa-Gla) was 0.03 (-0.12, 0.18)% (0.3 [-1.4, 1.9] mmol/mol), meeting non-inferiority and equivalence (secondary objective) criteria. Insulin doses, FPG, and seven-point plasma glucose profiles were similar between groups. Safety and tolerability, including anti-insulin antibody responses, hypoglycaemia, adverse events and body weight, were similar between insulins. The efficacy and safety of Mk-Gla and Sa-Gla were similar both in participants who were insulin-treated or insulin-naïve at baseline.

Conclusions

Mk-Gla and Sa-Gla demonstrated similar efficacy and safety over 24 weeks of treatment in people with T2DM.

### Estimated changes in insulin prices and discounts after entry of new insulin products, 2012–2019 [^111zfYxz]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Our findings are of relevance because policy making to address cost-related insulin access has been hampered by insufficient knowledge of the net price of insulin and its association with patient out-of-pocket costs, resulting in policy proposals that have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as increasing the cost of insulin. Overall, our analysis confirms that insulin products are highly rebated and that net prices faced by payers increased at a slower pace than list prices from 2012 to 2019. Before competition, however, increasing discounts were not able to offset increases in list prices, meaning that list price growth resulted in higher net prices.

Our net price estimations revealed commercial strategies across insulin markets. Net prices of long-acting legacy insulin products Lantus and insulin detemir (Levemir) decreased after classwide competition owing to the introduction of biosimilar Basaglar, as well as Toujeo and insulin degludec (Tresiba), in 2015. At launch, Sanofi priced high-strength insulin glargine Toujeo at a lower net price than legacy insulin glargine Lantus even as it was reducing the net price of Lantus. This strategy, acknowledged by Sanofi to the Senate Finance Committee, aimed to encourage insurers to induce switches from Lantus to Toujeo, ostensibly to avoid automatic substitution of Lantus with forthcoming interchangeable biosimilars (first approved in 2021). Novo Nordisk priced insulin degludec (Tresiba) at a higher list and net price compared with legacy insulin detemir (Levemir), which likely reflects its ultralong duration of action unmatched by other products. However, by 2018, the net price of insulin degludec (Tresiba) had decreased below the net price of insulin detemir (Levemir) in 2014, suggesting intense competition in the crowded long-acting insulin market. The introduction of noninterchangeable insulin glargine Basaglar in 2015 was followed by decreases in net prices faced by payers across the entire class of long-acting insulin products. Although Toujeo has a lower net price than Basaglar, it has not captured as much market share as Basaglar (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1), which may reflect insurers' concern about switching patients to a formulation that will not face biosimilar competition for a longer period. Together, the change in trajectory of net prices of long-acting insulin products after competition suggests that competition resulted in lower net prices, likely reducing overall insulin spending.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The pharmacokinetic profiles for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. The median time to maximum serum insulin concentration was 12 (8–14), 12 (12–18), and 16 (12–20) hours, respectively. Mean serum insulin concentrations declined to the lower limit of quantitation of 5.02 µU/mL by 16, 28, and beyond 36 hours, respectively.

Steady-state insulin concentrations are reached by at least 5 days of once-daily subcutaneous administration of 0.4 U/kg to 0.6 U/kg doses of TOUJEO over 8 days in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

After subcutaneous injection of TOUJEO, the intra-subject variability, defined as the coefficient of variation for the insulin exposure during 24 hours, was 21.0% at steady state.

Elimination

After subcutaneous injection of TOUJEO in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B-chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). The in vitro activity of M1 and M2 were similar to that of human insulin.

Specific Populations

Pediatrics

Population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for TOUJEO based on concentration data of its main metabolite M1 using data from 75 pediatric patients (6 to < 18 years of age) with type 1 diabetes. The findings with regard to the effect of body weight on systemic exposure of M1 are generally consistent with findings in adults.

Elderly, Race, Sex, and Obesity

Effect of age ≥ 65, race, and sex on the pharmacokinetics of TOUJEO has not been evaluated. When weight is taken into account as a covariate on clearance, BMI is not an additional covariate.

### Real-world effectiveness and safety of insulin glargine 300 U / mL in insulin-Naïve people with type 2 diabetes: the ATOS study [^111SyXbV]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The HbA1c target achievement in the ATOS was similar to that seen in the observational DELIVER Naïve (25% at < 7%) and DELIVER Naïve-D (24% at < 7%) real-world studies. However, target achievement in ATOS at 6 months was lower than that observed in TOUJEO-1 (33%). Of note, this difference in HbA1c target achievement between ATOS and TOUJEO-1 was attenuated at 12 months (ATOS: 45% versus TOUJEO-1: 50%), highlighting that titration in the ATOS might have been gradual but continued over the full 12-month study period.

Interestingly, HbA1c reductions observed at month 6 in ATOS were generally comparable to those observed in the EDITION 3 and BRIGHT RCTs (LS mean changes in HbA1c were −1.50% in ATOS, −1.42% in EDITION 3 and −1.64% in BRIGHT). Similar results were seen for LS mean FPG reductions (ATOS −3.4 mmol/L, EDITION −3.4 mmol/L and BRIGHT −3.5 mmol/L). This suggests that lower HbA1c reductions may be achieved in real-world studies as in RCTs (as reported previously for studies on anti-hyperglycaemic drugs), perhaps owing to the broader clinical profiles of participants included in real-world studies, along with more rigorous participant compliance in RCTs. This is encouraging given that the FPG targets used for titration in the treat-to-target EDITION 3 and BRIGHT RCTs were likely more stringent than the locally applicable titration targets used in the ATOS. HbA1c reductions in the ATOS at month 6 were also similar to those observed in the DELIVER Naïve (−1.52%) and the DELIVER Naïve-D (−1.67%) real-world studies but were slightly greater than that observed in the TOUJEO-1 study (−1.02%) at month 6. Similarly, FPG reductions seen in the ATOS were also greater than those reported in the TOUJEO-1 real-world evidence (RWE) study at month 6 (−2.5 mmol/L). Of note, HbA1c and FPG reductions at 12 months were also greater for the ATOS than for TOUJEO-1.

### Insulin glargine (Toujeo) [^11541sgJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6)]. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can be treated with oral glucose. Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns, or physical activity level may be needed. More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately.

### Insulin glargine (insulin glargine U-300) [^1138EQcG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Study D, the average age was 58.2 years. The majority of patients were White (94%) and 46% were male; 33% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 34.8 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with Insulin Glargine, U-300 used 12% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

In Study E, the average age was 58 years. The majority of patients were White (78%) and 58% were male; 29% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 33 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with Insulin Glargine, U-300 used 15% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

### Efficacy and safety of LY2963016 insulin glargine in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes previously treated with insulin glargine [^116D4PGg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy ofinsulin glargine and Lantus ® insulin glargine, products with identical primary amino acid sequences, were assessed in subgroups of patients with type 1 (, n = 452) or type 2 diabetes (, n = 299) reporting prestudytreatment in 52‐week open‐label (‐1) and 24‐week double‐blind (‐2) studies. At randomization, patients transitioned from their prestudyto equivalent doses ofor. Primary efficacy (change in glycated haemoglobin from baseline to 24 weeks), other efficacy and select safety outcomes ofwere compared with those of. Continuous data were analysed using analysis of covariance, categorical data by Fisher's exact test, and treatment comparisons for hypoglycaemia by Wilcoxon test. No statistically significant treatment differences were identified for efficacy and safety outcomes except for weight change, overall incidence of detectable insulin antibodies, and serious adverse events. These differences were neither consistently observed across both studies nor observed in the total study populations, and their magnitude suggests they were not clinically meaningful.andshow similar efficacy and safety profiles in patients reporting prestudytreatment.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^117JWpdD]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately three-quarters (74.5%) of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% in this study also failed to achieve FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L. The lack of adequate FPG control in patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% is not surprising given the increased contribution of fasting hyperglycemia to poorly controlled T2DM. Considering their high FPG levels, these patients would have a lower tendency to experience hypoglycemia. Our analysis also showed that the incidence of hypoglycemia did not increase in patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0% compared with patients achieving endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% (P = 0.6889), even though patients in the ≥ 7.0% group were older, with a longer duration of diabetes, and a higher proportion of complications and comorbidities. The average endpoint insulin glargine dose for patients who failed both HbA 1c and FPG targets was 0.26 ± 0.09 U/kg/day, which was approximately 40% lower than the doses (0.4–0.5 U/kg/day) required to achieve adequate glycemic control while maintaining a low risk of hypoglycemia reported by other studies. This indicates that there is still potential for up-titration of the dose of insulin glargine in patients who failed to reach both glycemic targets. Hence, further up-titration of the insulin glargine dose in patients who failed to reach both HbA 1c and FPG targets may not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and improve the likelihood of achieving adequate FPG control and therefore target HbA 1c.

### The evolution of insulin and how it informs therapy and treatment choices [^113N5bSf]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The more concentrated insulins, insulin glargine U-300 (Toujeo ®) and human insulin U-500R, are not bioequivalent to their U-100 counterparts. The comparative PK and PD profiles of U-100 and U-300 insulin glargine formulations are discussed above (Fig. 10A and 10B). U-500R insulin is the most concentrated insulin on the market today, with a 5-times higher concentration compared to U-100 human regular insulin. The PK and PD profiles for 2 doses each of U-100R and U-500R insulins are shown in Fig. 17. The time to peak action was similar for both formulations at the 50-unit and 100-unit doses; however, the peak action was lower and the overall duration of action was prolonged for U-500R. Both U-100R and U-500R formulations had a similar onset of action of less than 15 minutes with both doses. Given the similar onset and peak action to U-100R, the U-500R formulation provides prandial (mealtime) coverage while its extended duration of action provides basal insulin properties. This attribute facilitates the use of U-500R as insulin monotherapy, which was tested and shown to significantly improve HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on high doses of U-100R therapy (> 200 units/day). While total insulin exposure (AUC insulin and G tot) was not statistically different between U-500R and U-100R, supporting unit dose equivalency (equipotency), they are not bioequivalent and have different time-action profiles (Fig. 17). When starting a person on U-500R, dose at initiation should be determined based on current and targeted glycemic goals to optimize safety and efficacy.

### Insulin glargine (insulin glargine U-300) [^1136cJJy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety Outcomes Trial

No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of Insulin Glargine, U-300 have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to Insulin Glargine, U-300.

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN (Hazard Ratio [95% CI] for MACE; 1.02 [0.94, 1.11]).

In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.99 [0.88, 1.11]) or death from cancer (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.94 [0.77, 1.15]) was also similar between treatment groups.

### Usability of the gla-300 injection device compared with three other commercialized disposable insulin pens: results of an interview-based survey [^112sbjwP]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

New insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300; Toujeo ®), recently approved for use in the United States and in Europe, has more stable and prolonged pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared with glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100; Lantus ®). In clinical practice this translates into a comparable glucose-lowering effect and reduced risk of hypoglycemia. – To deliver Gla-300, the well-known and widely used SoloSTAR ® pen has been adapted, allowing accurate delivery of insulin units in one-third of the volume compared with Gla-100.

To evaluate the perceptions of people with diabetes (users; 26 with type 1 and 228 with type 2 diabetes) and health care professionals with experience in prescribing insulin pens and training insulin pen users (trainers; n = 190) about the usability of the Gla-300 SoloSTAR, we conducted an interview-based survey in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, comparing this device with three other commercialized disposable insulin pens: Gla-100 SoloSTAR (Sanofi, Paris, France), FlexPen ® (Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark), and KwikPen™ (Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN).

10	OVERDOSAGE

Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6)].

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns or exercise may be needed.

More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia.

Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately.

### Initiation of insulin glargine in suboptimally controlled patients with type 2 diabetes: sub-analysis of the AT.LANTUS trial comparing treatment outcomes in subjects from primary and secondary care in the UK [^112R6UFV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

The AT.LANTUS study compared insulin glargine initiation and titration using one of two algorithms in suboptimally controlled subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on a primary outcome of severe hypoglycaemia. Secondary outcomes included other categories of hypoglycaemia, glycaemic control, weight changes and insulin dose. Here, we report the results of a subanalysis of the trial, which investigated whether insulin glargine can be initiated and titrated as effectively in primary [general practitioner (GP)] as secondary (hospital) care in patients with T2DM in the UK.

Methods

The main study was a multicentre (n = 611), multinational (n = 59), open-label, 24-week randomized trial in 4,588 suboptimally controlled subjects with T2DM. Insulin glargine was titrated to target fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels of ≤ 5.5 mmol/l according to algorithm 1 (clinic-driven titration) or algorithm 2 (patient-managed titration). In this substudy, 819 subjects (GP, n = 215; hospital, n = 604) from 57 primary and 130 secondary care centres were included in the subanalysis; subjects were switched to once-daily insulin glargine from baseline treatments that consisted primarily of oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) (38%) only or premixed insulin ± OAD (23%).

Results

Both the GP and the hospital groups of subjects experienced a low incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (< 1%), with significant decreases in HbA1c levels (-0.51 and -0.95% respectively; p < 0.001), large reductions in FBG levels (-2.72 and 3.0 mmol/l respectively; p < 0.001) and modest weight gain of 1 and 1.2 kg respectively (p < 0.05). With the exception of absolute reductions in HbA1c and reductions in basal and prandial insulin made on switching to insulin glargine, there were few significant differences in subjects managed in primary compared with secondary care.

Conclusions

This study shows that despite differences in diabetes duration and baseline glycaemic control, an insulin glargine-based therapy can be safely and effectively initiated in a diverse range of suboptimally controlled subjects with T2DM in both primary and secondary care settings in the UK. Rates of hypoglycaemia were low and consistent with the results of the main study. Absolute reductions in HbA1c were greatest in the secondary care setting, but similar levels of glycaemic control were achieved in both groups due to differences in baseline HbA1c. In the patients managed in primary care, there was an overall reduction in prandial and basal insulin used when switching to a basal insulin regimen and a lack of titration of prandial insulin. Therefore, the role of prandial insulin, its initiation and titration, appears to be an area that requires more focus in primary care.

### Evaluation of immunogenicity of LY2963016 insulin glargine compared with lantus® insulin glargine in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus [^11148wf6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Because the development of antibody responses can differ in patients with T1DM versus those with T2DM, immunogenicity was studied separately and results are presented separately. As expected, a greater proportion of patients with T1DM (ELEMENT‐1) had detectable antibodies to insulin glargine at baseline and throughout the study relative to patients with T2DM (ELEMENT‐2). This finding is consistent with reports that patients with T1DM, a disease characterized by an autoimmune condition 14, are more likely to have pre‐existing anti‐insulin antibodies 15 and exhibit different immune responses from those with T2DM 16. Within each study, antibody levels (percent binding) were similar between the treatment groups with no statistically significant differences at any visit or at the 52‐week (ELEMENT‐1) or 24‐week (ELEMENT‐2) endpoints in the total study population. The majority of patients [ELEMENT‐1: 320 patients (60.2%); ELEMENT‐2: 634 patients (86.8%)] had no detectable antibodies throughout the studies or changes in total insulin antibody level that ranged from antibody‐negative at baseline to a maximum percent binding value within 0.26–1.26% during the study.

### Differences in bioactivity between human insulin and insulin analogues approved for therapeutic use-compilation of reports from the past 20 years [^115j9MAK]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2011). Low credibility.

In order to provide comprehensive information on the differences in bioactivity between human insulin and insulin analogues, published in vitro comparisons of human insulin and the rapid acting analogues insulin lispro (Humalog ®), insulin aspart (NovoRapid ®), insulin glulisine (Apidra ®), and the slow acting analogues insulin glargine (Lantus ®), and insulin detemir (Levemir ®) were gathered from the past 20 years (except for receptor binding studies). A total of 50 reports were retrieved, with great heterogeneity among study methodology. However, various differences in bioactivity compared to human insulin were obvious (e.g. differences in effects on metabolism, mitogenesis, apoptosis, intracellular signalling, thrombocyte function, protein degradation). Whether or not these differences have clinical bearings (and among which patient populations) remains to be determined.

### Insulin glargine (Toujeo) [^116WUXpf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with TOUJEO. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for TOUJEO with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.

In the TOUJEO adult program, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to administer a resuscitative action. In the pediatric program, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with semiconsciousness, unconsciousness, coma and/or convulsions in a patient who had altered mental status and could not assist in his own care, and who may have required glucagon or intravenous glucose.

The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 1 diabetes receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6.6% at 26 weeks. The incidence of hypoglycemia with a glucose level less than 54 mg/dL with or without symptoms was 77.7% at 26 weeks.

The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6% at 26 weeks and the incidence of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self-monitored or plasma glucose value less than 54 mg/dL regardless of symptoms was 80.3%.

The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 2 diabetes was 5% at 26 weeks in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen, and 1.0% and 0.9% respectively at 26 weeks in the two studies where patients received TOUJEO as part of a basal-insulin only regimen. The incidence of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self-monitored or plasma glucose value less than 54 mg/dL regardless of symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving TOUJEO ranged from 9% to 44.6% at 26 weeks and the highest risk was again seen in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen.

Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control

Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy.

### Efficacy and safety of MK-1293 insulin glargine compared with originator insulin glargine (lantus) in type 1 diabetes: a randomized, open-label clinical trial [^1141Zbrf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy and safety of MK-1293 insulin glargine (Mk-Gla; 100 U/mL) with originator insulin glargine, Lantus (Sa-Gla), in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

Materials and Methods

This phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, 52-week study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02059161) enrolled 508 people with T1DM (HbA1c ≤ 11.0%; 97 mmol/mol) taking basal and prandial insulin. Participants were randomized 1:1 to once-daily Mk-Gla (n = 245) or Sa-Gla (n = 263). Dose titration of basal insulin was by a pre-breakfast plasma glucose dosing algorithm. The primary efficacy objective was assessment of the non-inferiority of HbA1c change from baseline (margin of 0.40% [4.4 mmol/mol]) for Mk-Gla compared with Sa-Gla over 24 weeks. The primary safety objective was assessment of anti-insulin antibody development over 24 weeks.

Results

The least squares (LS) mean HbA1c change from baseline at week 24 was -0.62 (95% CI -0.79, -0.45)% (-6.8 [-8.7, -4.9] mmol/mol) and -0.66 (-0.82, -0.50)% (-7.2 [-9.0, -5.4] mmol/mol) for Mk-Gla and Sa-Gla. The LS mean HbA1c difference was 0.04 (-0.11, 0.19)% (0.4 [-1.2, 2.0] mmol/mol) for Mk-Gla minus Sa-Gla, meeting the primary and secondary objective criteria for non-inferiority and equivalence. Week 24 mean insulin glargine dose for Mk-Gla and Sa-Gla was 0.46 and 0.48 U/kg, respectively. Similarity of HbA1c response and basal insulin dose trajectory persisted over the 52 weeks. Safety and tolerability, including anti-insulin antibody responses, hypoglycaemia, adverse events and body weight, were similar between insulins over the 52-week study duration.

Conclusions

Mk-Gla and Sa-Gla exhibited similar efficacy and safety over 52 weeks in people with T1DM. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02059161.

### Estimated changes in insulin prices and discounts after entry of new insulin products, 2012–2019 [^111izgGR]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study Sample

In this longitudinal study, we categorized insulin products available from 2012 to 2019 into 3 groups: (1) long-acting insulin analogues, including insulin glargine (Lantus, Toujeo, and Basaglar), insulin detemir (Levemir), and insulin degludec (Tresiba); (2) short-acting insulin analogues, including insulin lispro (Humalog and Admelog) and insulin aspart (Novolog and Fiasp); and (3) human insulin products, including Novolin and Humulin. Insulin products were categorized at the product level instead of the national drug code level because net sales data are reported only at the brand-name level. Therefore, we did not separately categorize formulations of a product (eg, Humulin N vs Humulin Mix).

Data Sources

We used 5 data sources: (1) net sales and total units from SSR Health; (2) Medicare Part B and Part D 5% claims; (3) Medicare Part D prescriber use files; (4) Medicare and Medicaid spending dashboards; and (5) the 340B covered entity database. The institutional review board at the University of California, San Diego deemed this study exempt from the need for informed consent because only deidentified data were used in analyses. Data analyses were performed from June 1, 2022, to October 31, 2022. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

### Cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113qvfEh]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

IDeg versus IGlar U300 (Toujeo ®)

IGlar U300 is a concentrated insulin glargine product (300 units/ml) for once-daily use for the treatment of T1DM and T2DM in adults. With the IGlar U300 prefilled pen, the maximum dose per injection is 80U. IGlar U300 has a flatter and more prolonged (up to 36 h) profile of insulin concentration and glucose-lowering activity compared with IGlar U100 at the same dose. IGlar U300 is not bioequivalent to IGlar U100 and they are not directly interchangeable. An approximately 10–18% higher dose is required when patients are switched from IGlar U100 to IGlar U300.

In clinical trials, IGlar U300 was non-inferior to IGlar U100 in terms of HbA 1c reduction in T1DM, T2DM BOT and T2DM B/B. In T1DM, there was no significant difference in hypoglycaemia (severe, nocturnal or overall) between IGlar U300 and IGlar U100; in T2DM BOT there was no significant difference in severe or nocturnal hypoglycaemia but a significantly lower rate of overall hypoglycaemia with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100; and in T2DM B/B there was no significant difference in severe or overall hypoglycaemia but a significantly lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100. In all three patient groups, the total daily basal insulin dose was higher with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100; by 17.5% in T1DM, 17% in T2DM BOT and 10% in T2DM B/B.

### State substitution laws and uptake of an interchangeable insulin biosimilar [^116NHgSn]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective analysis of pharmacy claims in the MarketScan commercial claims data, spanning November 2020 to November 2022 (eMethods in Supplement 1). Institutional review board approval was waived because we analyzed deidentified patient-level data that were fully compliant with HIPAA (US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines for reporting observational studies.

The study population included commercially insured enrollees who were younger than 65 years and had at least 1 fill for a highly prescribed long-acting insulin glargine (Lantus [Sanofi]) or its substitutes, interchangeable biosimilar insulin glargine-yfgn (Semglee [Mylan Pharmaceuticals]) and a noninterchangeable insulin glargine (Basaglar [Lilly]) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), in the 12-month period before and after November 16, 2021, when interchangeable insulin glargine-yfgn was launched (insulin glargine-yfgn was initially launched as a noninterchangeable biosimilar in June 2020). We included the noninterchangeable substitute, which was approved as a follow-on biologic to the highly prescribed insulin glargine, because it is widely considered a biosimilar in clinical practice. We excluded Toujeo (Sanofi; another branded insulin glargine) from the denominator because our focus was on understanding the extent to which state laws may influence the substitution of the highly prescribed insulin glargine with insulin glargine-yfgn (the other branded insulin glargine cannot be substituted with insulin glargine-yfgn).

### Dosing of insulin glargine in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^115cobjQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by insulin resistance and declining beta-cell function, often leading to a requirement for insulin therapy to maintain good glycemic control and prevent diabetes-associated complications. Adequate insulin dosing is crucial to the achievement of good glycemic control with minimal hypoglycemia, and dose titration immediately following insulin initiation is needed to ensure its success. Insulin may be initiated as an add-on therapy to oral treatment using a single evening basal insulin dose and titrating according to fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels (with an ideal target of < 5.5 mmol/L [< 100 mg/dL] to achieve glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < 7%).

Objective

This review investigated options for, and clinical efficacy of, titration algorithms of insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Articles from peer-reviewed journals were identified through searches of MEDLINE (years: 2000–2006). Search terms included insulin glargine, titration, algorithm, and type 2 diabetes. Studies were assessed and included in this review if they provided information regarding the method of dose titration of insulin glargine used.

Results

A total of 12 studies were identified and included in this review. In the 24-week Treat-to-Target study, in which 756 patients were randomized to receive either insulin glargine or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, once-daily using a simple titration regimen (titration of daily insulin dose by 0–2, 2, 4, or 6–8 IU if mean fasting plasma glucose over the 3 previous days was ≥ 5.6- < 6.7, ≥ 6.7- < 7.8, ≥ 7.8- < 10.0 or ≥ 10 mmol/L [≥ 100- < 120, ≥ 120- < 140, ≥ 140- < 180, or ≥ 180 mg/dL], respectively, in the absence of plasma glucose < 4.0 mmol/L [< 72 mg/dL]) more patients reached HbA1c ≤ 7% without nocturnal hypoglycemia with insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (33.2% vs 26.7%; P < 0.05). In the 24-week AT.LANTUS (A Trial comparing LANTUS Algorithms to achieve Normal blood glucose Targets in subjects with Uncontrolled blood Sugar) study, 4961 patients were randomized to receive insulin glargine with either clinic-managed (as in the Treat-to-Target study) or patient-managed dose titration (increase insulin dose by 2 IU every 3 days in the absence of blood glucose < 4.0 mmol/L [< 72 mg/dL]). Greater reductions in HbA(1c) were found with patient- versus clinic-managed titration (-1.22% vs -1.08%; P < 0.001), and fewer patients experienced hypoglycemia with clinic-managed titration (29.8% vs 33.3%; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The results from the studies discussed in this review suggest that adequate titration of the insulin dose, either by physicians or by patients, can help patients reach treatment goals, including HbA(1c) < 7% and FBG < 5.5 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). The choice between algorithms may depend on clinical circumstance and a patient's willingness and ability to become more involved in management of therapy.

### Immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of biosimilar insulin glargine (gan&lee glargine) compared with originator insulin glargine (lantus) in patients with type 1 diabetes after 26 Weeks treatment [^114wBkRG]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Gan & Lee insulin glargine (GL Glargine) with that of the originator insulin glargine (Lantus) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

Methods

This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, equivalence study. Five hundred seventy-six subjects with T1DM were randomized 1:1 to receive either GL Glargine or Lantus treatment for 26 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage of subjects in each treatment group who developed treatment-induced anti-insulin antibody after baseline and up to visit week 26, which was evaluated using a country-adjusted logistic regression model. The study also compared the changes in glycated hemoglobin, and adverse events including hypoglycemia.

Results

The percentage of subjects positive for treatment-induced anti-insulin antibody by Week 26 was 25.8% in the GL Glargine treatment group and 25.3% in the Lantus treatment group, with a 90% confidence interval (-5.4, 6.5) of the difference in proportions that fell completely between the similarity margins (-11.3, 11.3). The least squares mean difference between treatment groups for changes in glycated hemoglobin was -0.08 (90% confidence interval: -0.23, 0.06), and the other immunogenicity and safety profiles were comparable.

Conclusion

GL Glargine demonstrated similar immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety compared to Lantus over 26 weeks in patients with T1DM.

A 3-fold concentrated version of insulin glargine was developed to prolong the duration of action when the results of 2 preliminary studies showed less diurnal variation in glucose-lowering activity with U-300 compared to the same dose of U-100 glargine. Insulin glargine U-300 (300 U/mL) was approved by the FDA in 2015 and marketed as Toujeo ® (Sanofi S/A). The higher concentration of glargine delivered in the same volume further slows the dissolution of the glargine precipitate in the SC space, leading to a better basal insulin. The PK and PD profiles of the U-100 and U-300 formulations of insulin glargine are shown in Fig. 10A. The concentrated U-300 insulin glargine profile has a lower peak and a longer duration of action compared to U-100 insulin glargine at the same U/kg dose. The glucose-lowering effects of U-300 insulin glargine at steady state appear to be lower than U-100 insulin glargine at the same dose level (Fig. 10A). In a study in type 1 diabetes, subjects needed 17.5% more U-300 than U-100 insulin glargine for the same glycemic control. In studies in type 2 diabetes, subjects needed an average of 12% more U-300 than U-100 insulin glargine for the same glycemic effect. Conversely, it is recommended that up to a 20% dose reduction may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when switching from U-300 to U-100 insulin glargine. In addition, dose-dependent kinetics were observed with U-300 insulin glargine in people with type 1 diabetes, which is consistent with the mechanism described (Fig. 10B).

### More similarities than differences testing insulin glargine 300 units / mL versus insulin degludec 100 units / mL in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes: the randomized head-to-head BRIGHT trial [^112mFpns]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Gla-300) versus insulin degludec 100 units/mL (IDeg-100) in this first head-to-head randomized controlled trial.

Research Design and Methods

BRIGHT (NCT02738151) was a multicenter, open-label, active-controlled, two-arm, parallel-group, 24-week, noninferiority study in insulin-naive patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomized 1:1 to evening dosing with Gla-300 (N = 466) or IDeg-100 (N = 463), titrated to fasting self-monitored plasma glucose of 80–100 mg/dL. The primary end point was HbA 1c change from baseline to week 24. Safety end points included incidence and event rates of hypoglycemia.

Results

At week 24, HbA 1c improved similarly from baseline values of 8.7% (72 mmol/mol) in the Gla-300 group and 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) in the IDeg-100 group to 7.0% (53 mmol/mol)-least squares mean difference -0.05% (95% CI -0.15 to 0.05) (-0.6 mmol/mol [-1.7 to 0.6])-demonstrating noninferiority of Gla-300 versus IDeg-100 (P < 0.0001). Hypoglycemia incidence and event rates over 24 weeks were comparable with both insulins, whereas during the active titration period (0–12 weeks) the incidence and rate of anytime (24-h) confirmed hypoglycemia (≤ 70 and < 54 mg/dL) were lower with Gla-300. Both insulins were properly titrated and exhibited no specific safety concerns.

Conclusions

Gla-300 and IDeg-100 provided similar glycemic control improvements with relatively low hypoglycemia risk. Hypoglycemia incidence and rates were comparable with both insulins during the full study period but lower in favor of Gla-300 during the titration period. The choice between these longer-acting basal insulins may be determined by factors such as access and cost, alongside clinical considerations.

### Efficacy and safety of LY2963016 insulin glargine versus insulin glargine (lantus) in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes: a phase III, randomized, open-label, controlled trial [^116Svvq5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The primary analysis of change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 24 was conducted using a likelihood‐based, mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) approach, treating the data as missing at random (MAR) in the FAS. The MMRM model evaluated the change from baseline HbA1c as the dependent variable with treatment assignment, entry use of insulin secretagogues (SU, meglitinide, neither), visit, and interaction between visit and treatment as fixed effects, baseline HbA1c as a covariate and a random effect for patient. The primary treatment comparison was least squares (LS) mean change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks for LY IGlar versus IGlar using an NIM of 0.4%. If the +0.4% NIM was met, then a gated secondary comparison of IGlar versus LY IGlar at a NIM of −0.4% was conducted; if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in LS mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 for IGlar versus LY IGlar was more than −0.4% then IGlar was declared non‐inferior to LY IGlar. In this case, LY IGlar was therefore considered to have equivalent efficacy to IGlar. This gate‐keeping procedure controlled the family‐wise type 1 error rate at a one‐sided.025 level.

Analysis of continuous secondary efficacy and safety measurements used the same MMRM model as the primary efficacy analyses with the baseline response variable added as a covariate in the FAS population. Continuous laboratory measures were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. For categorical measures, Fisher's exact test was used.

A subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate change in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 24 using a MMRM for the following subgroups: baseline HbA1c level (< or ≥ 8.5%), use of insulin secretagogues (SU, meglitinide, neither), BMI (< or ≥ 28 and 24 kg/m 2), age (< or ≥ 65 years), sex and kidney function assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (normal or increased [≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m 2], mild reduction [60–89 mL/min/1.73m 2] and moderate reduction [30–59 mL/min/1.73m 2]).
