## Question

what is it called when someone is not taking medications as prescribed becauise they dont know

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the correct term is for not taking medications as prescribed because the patient does not know how or why to take them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching terminology for not taking medications as prescribed. Then, I should verify the standard subtypes of nonadherence and which one fits a lack of knowledge or understanding. Next, I will check whether health literacy or communication failures are considered part of that subtype. Finally, I will confirm the precise terminology and provide a concise, accurate answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the umbrella term. Not taking medications as prescribed is termed medication nonadherence, which encompasses both unintentional and intentional reasons for not following the regimen, with unintentional nonadherence often arising from practical or knowledge-related barriers rather than a deliberate decision to stop therapy [^d4c87cde] [^5a885bff].

> Wait, let me verify the subtypes. Contemporary frameworks consistently divide nonadherence into unintentional versus intentional causes. Unintentional nonadherence includes forgetting, complexity, and — critically — lack of understanding or knowledge about dosing, timing, or the purpose of therapy, whereas intentional nonadherence reflects a conscious decision not to follow treatment based on beliefs or concerns [^d4c87cde] [^21f39232] [^f361542d].

> Hold on, I should confirm the specific label for knowledge-related nonadherence. The correct term is unintentional nonadherence, and within that, a lack of understanding is often described as a mistake-type error in the human factors literature, where patients misapply knowledge or do not comprehend instructions, leading to dosing errors or nonuse despite intending to follow therapy [^f361542d] [^d4c87cde].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with health literacy. Low health literacy is a major driver of unintentional nonadherence because it impairs the ability to obtain, process, and understand medication instructions; thus, knowledge deficits are a proximal cause, and low health literacy is a distal contributor, both falling under the unintentional nonadherence umbrella in clinical and policy discussions [^9069b74c] [^d4c87cde] [^2b59418f].

> Let me reconsider the terminology one more time to avoid overgeneralization. While "knowledge-deficit nonadherence" or "unintentional nonadherence due to misunderstanding" are descriptive phrases, the standard, accepted clinical term is unintentional nonadherence, with the mechanism explicitly tied to limited understanding, forgetfulness, or practical barriers rather than a deliberate choice to deviate from therapy [^d4c87cde] [^21f39232].

> Final answer: Not taking medications as prescribed because the patient does not know how or why to take them is called unintentional nonadherence, reflecting a knowledge or comprehension barrier rather than a deliberate decision not to follow treatment [^d4c87cde] [^f361542d].

---

The correct term for not taking medications as prescribed because of lack of knowledge is **unintentional nonadherence** [^d4c87cde] (also called **unintentional noncompliance**). This reflects **practical barriers** such as misunderstanding instructions, forgetfulness, or limited health literacy [^9069b74c], rather than a deliberate decision not to follow treatment [^21f39232]. Unintentional nonadherence is common and often correctable with clear, tailored education [^8ce8a04a], simplified regimens [^5a885bff], and adherence supports [^c4c610fa].

---

## Definitions and terminology

- **Unintentional nonadherence**: Occurs when patients do not follow treatment due to practical barriers (e.g. misunderstanding instructions, forgetfulness, limited health literacy) [^d4c87cde] [^f361542d].

- **Intentional nonadherence**: Occurs when patients consciously decide not to follow treatment, often due to beliefs, concerns, or side effects [^21f39232] [^d4c87cde].

- **Health literacy**: The capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions [^9069b74c]; low health literacy is a key driver of unintentional nonadherence [^d4c87cde].

---

## Prevalence and impact

Unintentional nonadherence is **highly prevalent** across chronic conditions, with rates often exceeding 30% [^06c5bc86] and reaching 50% or more in some populations [^c4c610fa]. It leads to **substantial clinical consequences**, including increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs [^5a885bff] [^3c33ab77].

---

## Factors contributing to unintentional nonadherence

| **Category** | **Factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-related | - Limited health literacy [^9069b74c] <br/> - Forgetfulness [^f99bd6be] <br/> - Cognitive impairment [^bb9fae00] <br/> - Language barriers [^c585ca83] |
| Medication-related | - Complex regimens [^1f1d890e] <br/> - Multiple medications [^328bbbe5] <br/> - Confusing instructions [^d4c87cde] |
| Healthcare system-related | - Inadequate patient education [^8ce8a04a] <br/> - Poor provider-patient communication [^e956b533] <br/> - Limited access to care [^d4c87cde] |

---

## Clinical implications

Unintentional nonadherence **significantly impairs** disease control, increases healthcare utilization, and drives up costs [^5a885bff] [^3c33ab77]. It is especially concerning in chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and asthma, where adherence is critical to outcomes [^2b59418f] [^0937b6f1] [^de70aa28].

---

## Strategies to address unintentional nonadherence

Effective interventions include:

- **Patient education**: Clear, tailored, and culturally sensitive education improves understanding and adherence [^e9b8e513] [^67922525].

- **Regimen simplification**: Reducing pill burden and dosing frequency improves adherence [^5a885bff] [^1f1d890e].

- **Adherence supports**: Reminders, pill organizers, and digital tools (e.g. apps, text messages) help patients remember and follow regimens [^5a885bff] [^648a7f23].

- **Enhanced communication**: Shared decision-making and teach-back techniques improve patient understanding and engagement [^e60a95ed] [^5b978243].

---

## Conclusion

Not taking medications as prescribed due to lack of knowledge is termed **unintentional nonadherence**. It is common, preventable, and often reflects practical barriers such as limited health literacy or complex regimens. Addressing it with education, simplification, and adherence supports can improve outcomes and reduce costs [^5a885bff] [^c4c610fa].

### Can asthma control be improved by understanding the patient's perspective? [^06c5bc86]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Patient adherence to treatment and other aspects of self-management

Patients may not take the medications they have been prescribed, contributing to poor disease control. Regardless of age, gender and socioeconomic status of patients, and type and severity of disease, non-adherence rates of over 30% have consistently been noted across chronic illnesses and with even higher rates of nonadherence to inhaled corticosteroids. Non-adherence may be lower for more complex regimens, but significant non-adherence remains even when the frequency of dosing is reduced. Furthermore, providing clear information – although essential – is not enough to guarantee adherence.

Nonadherence is best thought of as a variable behaviour, rather than a trait characteristic: most people are nonadherent some of the time. Nonadherence can have both intentional and unintentional causes. Unintentional nonadherence arises from capacity and resource limitations that prevent patients from implementing their decisions to follow treatment recommendations and involves individual constraints (e.g. poor inhaler technique, problems remembering doses etc) and aspects of their environment (e.g. problems of accessing prescriptions, cost, competing demands etc). Intentional nonadherence arises from the beliefs, attitudes and expectations that influence patients' motivation to begin and persist with the treatment regimen.

Understanding Medication Nonadherence

Medication adherence is a complex behavior influenced by factors along the continuum of care, relating to the patient, providers, and health systems. Patient-related factors include unintentional factors, which often worsen with increasingly complex medication regimens (e.g. forgetting to take medication or obtain refills, or inadequate understanding of dose or schedules); and intentional factors (e.g. active decision to stop or modify a treatment regimen based on ability to pay, beliefs and attitudes about their disease, medication side effects, and expectations for improvement) (Figure). Additional patient-related barriers include lack of engagement in treatment decisions, impaired cognition (e.g. related to aging or disease), substance abuse, depression, and other mental health conditions. Provider-related factors include barriers to communicating with patients and their caregivers, complex dosing regimens, and limited coordination of care among multiple providers. Health care system and service delivery factors include limited access to an appropriate provider for prescriptions or refills, restricted drug coverage, high costs and copayments, unclear medication labeling and instructions, limited availability of culturally appropriate patient education materials, and inadequate provider time to review benefits, risks, and alternatives to prescribed medications.

### Helping patients follow prescribed treatment: clinical applications [^c73970c5]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Low adherence to prescribed medical regimens is a ubiquitous problem. Typical adherence rates are about 50% for medications and are much lower for lifestyle prescriptions and other more behaviorally demanding regimens. In addition, many patients with medical problems do not seek care or drop out of care prematurely. Although accurate measures of low adherence are lacking for many regimens, simple measures, such as directly asking patients and watching for appointment nonattendance and treatment nonresponse, will detect most problems. For short-term regimens (≤ 2 weeks), adherence to medications is readily achieved by giving clear instructions. On the other hand, improving adherence to long-term regimens requires combinations of information about the regimen, counseling about the importance of adherence and how to organize medication taking, reminders about appointments and adherence, rewards and recognition for the patient's efforts to follow the regimen, and enlisting social support from family and friends. Successful interventions for long-term regimens are all labor-intensive but ultimately can be cost-effective.

### Vital signs: disparities in antihypertensive medication nonadherence among Medicare part D beneficiaries-United States, 2014… [^bdc47493]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

- Nonadherence, or not following a health care professional's instructions concerning taking their prescribed blood pressure medicine, is a well-known reason for uncontrolled high blood pressure and an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes and increased health care costs.
- In this study, 26. 3% Medicare Part D beneficiaries aged ≥ 65 years using blood pressure medicine were considered nonadherent. Abstract Introduction: Nonadherence to taking prescribed antihypertensive medication regimens has been identified as a leading cause of poor blood pressure control among persons with hypertension and an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes. CDC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services analyzed geographic, racial-ethnic, and other disparities in nonadherence to antihypertensives among Medicare Part D beneficiaries in 2014.

Medication nonadherence, or not following a health care professional's instructions concerning taking prescribed antihypertensives, is a leading reason for poor blood pressure control among persons treated for hypertension, a strong risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes, and a cause of excessive health care costs. The reasons for nonadherence to chronic disease medications, including antihypertensives, are numerous and complex. They include factors involving the patients, their health care professionals, and the policies and procedures of health systems and payers. Nonadherence was measured using the proportion of days covered metric, which represents the percentage of days a beneficiary had access to the prescribed medication from the date of the first antihypertensive fill through the end of 2014 or the beneficiary's death in 2014.

¶¶ To align with current standards, beneficiaries with a PDC < 80% were considered nonadherent. Approximately 300, 000 beneficiaries in this study had only one filled prescription within a class; in general, up to one fourth of prescriptions for newly prescribed antihypertensives are never filled. Third, nonadherence might be overestimated among beneficiaries who switched antihypertensive classes based on their clinician's recommendation or sometimes directly purchased low-priced generic antihypertensives without involvement of their prescription drug plan, but were considered nonadherent.

### Enhancing patient understanding of medication risks and benefits [^e719428c]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Guidelines for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) endorse a treat‐to‐target strategy using disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with achieving clinical remission (or at least low disease activity) as the primary target. A major issue in implementing treat‐to‐target principles in practice, however, involves patient reluctance to escalate therapy when their symptoms are tolerable despite the presence of active disease. This reluctance is understandable, because the potential benefits associated with DMARDs may be accompanied by serious risks. Obtaining accurate, personally relevant information about these risks is challenging. Although the US Food and Drug Administration requires that patients receive a medication guide with most DMARDs, research suggests that many patients have difficulty understanding the information that the guides contain. This is likely due to both design issues (e.g. nonadherence to plain language guidelines) and the prevalence of limited health literacy/numeracy skills among patients.

### Determinants of patient adherence to an aerosol regimen [^1a8683ae]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Patient adherence with prescribed inhaled therapy is related to morbidity and mortality. The terms "compliance" and "adherence" are used in the literature to describe agreement between prescribed medication and patient practice, with "adherence" implying active patient participation. Patient adherence with inhaled medication can be perfect, good, adequate, poor, or nonexistent, although criteria for such levels are not standardized and may vary from one study to another. Generally, nonadherence can be classified into unintentional (not understood) or intentional (understood but not followed). Failing to understand correct use of an inhaler exemplifies unintentional nonadherence, while refusing to take medication for fear of adverse effects constitutes intentional nonadherence. There are various measures of adherence, including biochemical monitoring of subjects, electronic or mechanical device monitors, direct observation of patients, medical/pharmacy records, counting remaining doses, clinician judgment, and patient self-report or diaries. The methods cited are in order of more to less objective, although even electronic monitoring can be prone to patient deception. Adherence is notoriously higher when determined by patient self-report, compared to electronic monitors. A general lack of adherence with inhaled medications has been documented in studies, and adherence declines over time, even with return clinic visits. Lack of correct aerosol-device use is a particular type of nonadherence, and clinician knowledge of correct use has been shown to be imperfect. Other factors related to patient adherence include the complexity of the inhalation regimen (dosing frequency, number of drugs), route of administration (oral vs inhaled), type of inhaled agent (corticosteroid adherence is worse than with short-acting beta2 agonists), patient awareness of monitoring, as well as a variety of patient beliefs and sociocultural and psychological factors. Good communication skills among clinicians and patient education about inhaled medications are central to improving adherence.

### Post-visit patient understanding about newly prescribed medications [^8ce8a04a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Good patient understanding of basic medication-related information such as directions for use and side effects promotes medication adherence, but information is lacking about how well patients understand basic medication-related information after their office visits.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to investigate post-visit patient understanding about newly prescribed medications.

Design

Secondary mixed methods analysis comparing patient survey responses about newly prescribed medications to information conveyed by physicians during office visits (from audio recordings of office visits).

Participants

Eighty-one patients aged 50 and older who discussed newly prescribed medications during an outpatient office visit.

Main Measures

Accurate patient identification of medication dose, number of pills, frequency of use, duration of use, and potential side effects.

Key Results

The 81 patients in this study received 111 newly prescribed medications. For over 70% of all newly prescribed medications, patients correctly identified the number of pills, frequency of use, duration of use, and dose, regardless of whether the physician mentioned the information during the office visit. However, for 34 of 62 medications (55%) for which side effects were not conveyed and 11 of 49 medications (22%) for which physicians discussed side effects, patients reported that the medication lacked side effects. Analysis of transcribed office visits showed that potential reasons for this finding included failure of physicians to mention or to use the term "side effects" during visits, the prescription of multiple medications during the visit, and lack of patient engagement in the conversation.

Conclusions

Many patients correctly identified information related to directions for taking a newly prescribed medication, even without physician counseling, but when physicians failed to convey potential medication side effects, many assumed that a medication had no side effects. It may be sufficient for physicians to provide written information about medication directions and dosing, and tailor their limited time to discussing medication side effects.

### Adherence to cardiovascular medications: lessons learned and future directions [^ac8d542f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 50% of patients with cardiovascular disease and/or its major risk factors have poor adherence to their prescribed medications. Finding novel methods to help patients improve their adherence to existing evidence-based cardiovascular drug therapies has enormous potential to improve health outcomes while potentially reducing health care costs. The goal of this report is to provide a review of the current understanding of adherence to cardiovascular medications from the point of view of prescribing clinicians and cardiovascular researchers. Key topics addressed include: (1) definitions of medication adherence; (2) prevalence and impact of non-adherence; (3) methods for assessing medication adherence; 4) reasons for poor adherence; and 5) approaches to improving adherence to cardiovascular medications. For each of these topics, the report seeks to identify important gaps in knowledge and opportunities for advancing the field of cardiovascular adherence research.

### Advancing the science and practice of medication adherence [^7f4e4bb8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Medication adherence remains a significant unmet challenge for optimizing patient outcomes. Recent advances in the conceptualization, measurement, and support of medication adherence offer fresh opportunities to make a meaningful impact on adherence-related behavior and outcomes. These advances emphasize the multifaceted and dynamic nature of medication adherence, provide novel methods for monitoring medication adherence in clinical care, and articulate a set of multilevel strategies to more effectively improve and sustain medication adherence. Here, we offer recommendations for how clinicians can better engage with, and benefit from, these innovations to improve patient medication adherence and associated treatment outcomes.

### Interventions for enhancing medication adherence [^43742571]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

People who are prescribed self administered medications typically take only about half their prescribed doses. Efforts to assist patients with adherence to medications might improve the benefits of prescribed medications.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the effects of interventions intended to enhance patient adherence to prescribed medications for medical conditions, on both medication adherence and clinical outcomes.

Search Methods

We updated searches of The Cochrane Library, including CENTRAL (via http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cochranelibrary/search/), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO (all via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO), and Sociological Abstracts (via ProQuest) on 11 January 2013 with no language restriction. We also reviewed bibliographies in articles on patient adherence, and contacted authors of relevant original and review articles.

Selection Criteria

We included unconfounded RCTs of interventions to improve adherence with prescribed medications, measuring both medication adherence and clinical outcome, with at least 80% follow-up of each group studied and, for long-term treatments, at least six months follow-up for studies with positive findings at earlier time points.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted all data and a third author resolved disagreements. The studies differed widely according to medical condition, patient population, intervention, measures of adherence, and clinical outcomes. Pooling results according to one of these characteristics still leaves highly heterogeneous groups, and we could not justify meta-analysis. Instead, we conducted a qualitative analysis with a focus on the RCTs with the lowest risk of bias for study design and the primary clinical outcome.

Main Results

The present update included 109 new RCTs published since the previous update in January 2007, bringing the total number of RCTs to 182; we found five RCTs from the previous update to be ineligible and excluded them. Studies were heterogeneous for patients, medical problems, treatment regimens, adherence interventions, and adherence and clinical outcome measurements, and most had high risk of bias. The main changes in comparison with the previous update include that we now: 1) report a lack of convincing evidence also specifically among the studies with the lowest risk of bias; 2) do not try to classify studies according to intervention type any more, due to the large heterogeneity; 3) make our database available for collaboration on sub-analyses, in acknowledgement of the need to make collective advancement in this difficult field of research. Of all 182 RCTs, 17 had the lowest risk of bias for study design features and their primary clinical outcome, 11 from the present update and six from the previous update. The RCTs at lowest risk of bias generally involved complex interventions with multiple components, trying to overcome barriers to adherence by means of tailored ongoing support from allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered intense education, counseling (including motivational interviewing or cognitive behavioral therapy by professionals) or daily treatment support (or both), and sometimes additional support from family or peers. Only five of these RCTs reported improvements in both adherence and clinical outcomes, and no common intervention characteristics were apparent. Even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements in adherence or clinical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Across the body of evidence, effects were inconsistent from study to study, and only a minority of lowest risk of bias RCTs improved both adherence and clinical outcomes. Current methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. The research in this field needs advances, including improved design of feasible long-term interventions, objective adherence measures, and sufficient study power to detect improvements in patient-important clinical outcomes. By making our comprehensive database available for sharing we hope to contribute to achieving these advances.

### Adherence to therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes [^b213949f]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

It is evident from many studies that type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease and pharmacologic treatment is essential to maintain glycemic control and reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Even though adherence to medications leads to beneficial outcomes, it is often poor. There are numerous reasons for poor adherence including age, social and psychological factors, education and a lack of understanding of the long-term benefits of treatment, the complexity of the medication regimen, cost of medication and negative treatment perceptions. Poor communication between doctor and patient, adverse outcomes such as weight gain and hypoglycemia, and failure of clinicians to modify medications appropriately can also affect adherence. New innovative methods are needed to assist those patients who fail in their medication compliance. Measures to increase patient satisfaction and counteract a lack of adherence must be multifactorial; strategies should include a reduction in the complexity of the prescription regimen, educational initiatives, improved doctor–patient communication, reminder systems and reduced costs.

The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

3.4.1 Terminology

The commonly used term "compliance" has been increasingly replaced in recent times by the term "adherence". Both are defined as the 'cooperation of the patient with the recommendations given by the doctor'. However, the former is more passive ("I am taking the medication"), while the latter implies the active part of the patient in the process ("I am taking the medication exactly as you told me").

"Persistence" is defined as the length of time during which the patient is taking the medication as prescribed.

Finally three terms should be mentioned:

– "White coat compliance" means that the patient's adherence rises a week before the consultation and drops quickly afterwards
– "Dyscompliance" is used when physical problems of a patient, like arthritis, lead to difficulties in correctly applying a therapy
– "Alliance" is a special form of adherence meaning that the people around the patient ensure the correct application of the medication

3.4.2 Measured Adherence

Despite easier medication schemes (for example drugs which require application once- daily) and more information for the patients about the disease, the rate of non-adherence has remained almost the same over the last 25 years; between 30%-70%.

It is important to mention that the patients themselves overestimate their adherence and persistence rate (GAPS).

3.4.3 Factors Associated with Non-Adherence

Four groups of factors encountered as common obstacles to glaucoma medication adherence have been described:

Situational / environmental (for example a major event in the patients life, unsteady life-style with many travels)
Medication (for example costs of the drugs, side effects, complicated dosing regimen)
Patients (for example comorbidity, poor understanding of the disease)
Provider (for example lacking communication with the doctor)

Other influencing factors:

– Gender (men are more likely to be non adherent)
– Stage of the disease (patients with a less advanced disease tend to be less adherent)

3.4.4 Types of Non-Adherence

Every patient is different and there are several types of non-adherence.

– Failure to take the medication as prescribed (including under- and overdosing, inadequate doses and wrong timing of dosages)
– Failure to use the correct medication (including the application of the wrong medication or the self administration of not prescribed drugs)
– Failure to apply the medication correctly (including incorrect self administration of the medication)
– Failure to continue applying the medication (including problems with side-effects, issue of costs and missed refills)

### Medication adherence: its importance in cardiovascular outcomes [^2dbd4c54]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Medication adherence usually refers to whether patients take their medications as prescribed (eg, twice daily), as well as whether they continue to take a prescribed medication. Medication nonadherence is a growing concern to clinicians, healthcare systems, and other stakeholders (eg, payers) because of mounting evidence that it is prevalent and associated with adverse outcomes and higher costs of care. To date, measurement of patient medication adherence and use of interventions to improve adherence are rare in routine clinical practice. The goals of the present report are to address (1) different methods of measuring adherence, (2) the prevalence of medication nonadherence, (3) the association between nonadherence and outcomes, (4) the reasons for nonadherence, and finally, (5) interventions to improve medication adherence.

### EHealth in the future of medications management: personalisation, monitoring and adherence [^b03cbdb4]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Up to half of medicines prescribed for long-term conditions are not taken as recommended. An estimated US$375 billion per year could be saved with improved medication adherence, which could prove to be one of the most effective interventions for improving health outcomes. Reasons for non-optimal use of medicines are multifactorial and may be related to patient, therapy, disease or health system issues. Numerous studies have aimed to improve medication adherence by addressing factors such as health literacy, lack of motivation or understanding, trust in the physician, health behaviour, cognitive factors such as forgetfulness, and others.

With regards to the patient, barriers to effective medicines management in chronic illnesses are multifactorial; medication adherence can be intentional or unintentional. Unintentional non-adherence arises due to several inter-related factors, including inability to keep up with medication dosing schedules, long duration and complexity of medication regimens, miscommunication, and capacity limitations such as physical disabilities and financial constraints. Intentional non-adherence is a more complex problem and involves patients choosing not to take their medications as prescribed due to various behavioural, attitudinal and socioeconomic reasons. Several interventions have shown to improve medication adherence, but most at best by only 10 percentage points. Very few interventions have been implemented at a large scale as these interventions are typically complex, labour intensive and costly.

We conducted a literature review on topics related to eHealth and medicines management on PubMed. Conference proceedings and national guidelines were also searched. This paper is not a systematic review of literature, but a summarised discussion of eHealth in the patients' medicines management journey. In this discussion, we explore the role that eHealth (the use of a wide range of information and communication technologies for health) (Table 1) could play in primary care, outpatient and community medicines management, focusing on how more personalisation and more intelligent monitoring could lead to greater adherence (Fig. 1).

### Patients' perspective of barriers and facilitators to taking long-term controller medication for asthma: a novel taxonomy [^c585ca83]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Communication

The themes classified within this domain referred to the exchange of information between the patient and his or her physician. Language limitations referred to the fact that some instructions related to the disease and its management, including medication (e.g. dose, regimen), were given by physicians in a language (French or English) in which patients were not fluent. The lack of a clear understanding led patients to be reluctant to take the prescribed medication.

Medication adherence was also hindered by three communication barriers directly related to the diagnosis of asthma. The misbelief or lack of a clear diagnosis was reported by patients who, misguided by doubts concerning their diagnosis, refused to take long-term controller medication. According to them, a clear diagnosis of the disease resolved this barrier because once they were informed of their condition they could proceed accordingly. Other patients reported that their physicians had diagnosed them with asthma, but due to a lack of formal or objective assessment of disease severity (e.g. a respiratory function test), the severity of the disease remained unclear to them. Receiving a formal or objective assessment of disease severity was a clear facilitator; patients who took repeated lung function tests over time explained that they could more easily ascertain the impact of medication on their response to therapy. A third barrier was the insufficient explanation of the condition and its management in which patients hesitated to take medication when instructions on how to manage the disease were deficient. Conversely, sufficient explanation of the condition and its management improved reported adherence to asthma controller medication because patients felt knowledgeable enough to manage their asthma.

Disagreement concerning the prescription and the management plan was reported by patients who acknowledged that they needed to take long-term controller medication, but disagreed or were uncomfortable with either the prescribed dose, or the frequency, or the modality (e.g. inhalers vs. pills). Patients' concerns and hesitations were dissipated when an agreement on the prescription and the management plan was reached as a result of negotiation with their physicians. Adapting the information provided to the patients' needs was also a key facilitator. Patients reported the need for all explanations to be in lay language to accept the disease and to have a better understanding of the role of medications.

### Why do patients with obesity discontinue glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues? [^4b042c02]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Obesity medications (OMs) play a growing role in managing the disease of obesity by helping to regulate the homeostatic control of adipocyte mass. Although these medications are becoming increasingly popular and improve health, their long‐term weight loss maintenance depends on adherence.

The therapeutic potential of GLP‐1 receptor agonists is promising for various non‐communicable diseases. However, there is still limited real‐world evidence regarding their long‐term benefits and potential adverse outcomes in diverse populations. Despite increasing access and popularity, the long‐term success of pharmacotherapy for obesity relies heavily on patient adherence.

Extensive database studies on OM usage indicate that adherence, meaning patients consistently taking their medications as directed for more than 90 days, falls to 10%–25%. Improving this short stay time may require adopting chronic disease management models. Lifestyle interventions, including better nutrition and exercise, are cornerstones to improving health in people with the disease of obesity.

The terms compliance, adherence and concordance are often confused. Adherence is more specific and collaborative than compliance when discussing how well patients follow their prescribed medication regimens. Concordance emphasizes the relationship between the patient and the prescriber, focusing on a shared understanding where the patient or caregiver takes responsibility for proper medication usage. Medication adherence is evaluated through three key stages. First, initiation occurs when a patient takes the first dose of a prescribed medication. Second, implementation refers to how accurately the patient follows the prescribed dosing schedule from the first to the final dose. Third, persistence indicates the overall duration during which the patient consistently takes the medication until treatment is discontinued. In this study, we examined the duration of OM use and the barriers affecting patient adherence using real‐world data.

### I believe, therefore I do [^ecd12765]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

What follows from this theory is that to change someone's behavior (e.g. convincing a patient to take a prescription drug that will lead to improved outcomes, if taken as directed) one must either change the patient's beliefs or understand them sufficiently to ensure that the intervention one is prescribing fits with the patient's beliefs. Beliefs are ultimately an interpretation of the known world. Exploring the patient's interpretation — understanding the underlying beliefs — can help the physician uncover misconceptions and false interpretations of events that may stand in the way of adhering to a therapy that could be effective, if used correctly. Thus, a physician working in partnership with an activated patient is more likely to recommend a treatment plan that fits with patient's health beliefs, which in turn improves the likelihood that the patient will follow through with the treatment plan, thereby leading to better long term outcomes.

Some have suggested that the lack of readily deployable interventions to activate patients has held back the full implementation of the chronic care model. The ever growing burden of chronic diseases on health care expenditures makes these issues all the more urgent. What then can be done to increase patient activation? Although patient consultations haven't necessarily gotten shorter in recent decades, what has increased is the number of issues a physician has to cover in the same amount of time.–This could understandably lead one to wonder how physicians could possibly fit an assessment of a patient's health beliefs to this already overcrowded agenda.

As noted by Street and Haidet a number of interventions have been developed and tested that could be used efficiently before a consultation to activate patients. And a systematic review of activation interventions for patients with diabetes found that interventions targeting patients were generally more effective and efficient than interventions targeting physician behavior.

### Characteristics of adults aged 18–64 who did not take medication as prescribed to reduce costs: United States, 2021… [^8fc52c0c]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

This report examines the characteristics of adults aged 18–64 who took prescription medication in the past 12 months and did not take medication as prescribed due to cost. Cost-saving measures included skipping doses, taking less medication than prescribed, or delaying filling a prescription. Keywords: prescription drugs, nonadherence, medical expenses, National Health Interview Survey. The percentage of adults taking prescription drugs who did not take medication as prescribed to reduce costs was higher among those with disabilities and those reporting fair or poor health. NOTES: Adults who did not take medication as prescribed were defined as those who reported taking prescription medications in the last 12 months and responded "yes" to at least one of the following: "During the last 12 months, were any of the following true for you: 1) Skipped medication doses to save money; 2) Took less medication to save money; 3) Delayed filling a prescription to save money". NOTES: Adults who did not take medication as prescribed were defined as those who reported taking prescription medications in the last 12 months and responded "yes" to at least one of the following: "During the last 12 months, were any of the following true for you: 1) Skipped medication doses to save money; 2) Took less medication to save money; 3) Delayed filling a prescription to save money". Summary In 2021, of the 57. 9% of adults aged 18–64 who took prescription drugs at any time in the past 12 months,
9. 2 million adults reported not taking medications as prescribed due to cost, employing such strategies as skipping doses, taking less than the prescribed dose, or delaying filling a prescription. Definitions Did not take medication as prescribed to reduce costs: Based on a positive response to any of the following questions, "During the past 12 months, are any of the following true for you. 1) You skipped medication doses to save money; 2) You took less medication to save money; and 3) You delayed filling a prescription to save money. " Adults were asked these questions only if they reported taking medication prescribed by a doctor or other health care provider during the past 12 months.

### Patient education and adherence to aerosol therapy [^b7e2ca6b]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Nonadherence to prescribed medications results in disease instability and poor clinical control, with increases in hospital admissions, emergency room visits, school/work absenteeism, morbidity, and mortality. Poor patient adherence to therapy can be due to lack of cognition, competence, or contrivance. Patients who have not been trained or fail to understand use of drug and device combinations (cognition) often do not have the ability to use an aerosol device correctly (competence). Many patients have the competence to use the device correctly and know why they should use the device in the way they were taught; however, they still contrive to use it in an ineffective and suboptimal manner that reduces its efficiency and effectiveness. Ensuring effective aerosol therapy and optimizing its role in disease management involve not only delivery of aerosolized medications to the lungs, but also understanding why, when, and how to use the medications, competence to use the device, motivation to adhere to therapy, and not contriving to use the device in a way that will prevent effective drug delivery. This paper explains some of the problems with patient education and adherence to aerosol therapy and suggests strategies to evaluate, monitor, and improve patient adherence effectively in primary care. Factors affecting patient adherence to prescribed medications, effective educational interventions, and strategies to promote patient adherence to aerosol therapy are also discussed.

### What is the clinical value of mHealth for patients? [^648a7f23]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Behavior change interventions through mHealth apps

Apps are potentially powerful platforms for delivery of behavior change interventions because they can improve engagement with established strategies for prevention and treatment of disease through personalized goal setting, individualized dosing reminders, and gamification. Apps that are linked to wearable devices that monitor heart rate and activity level often utilize additional behavior change techniques such as social comparison and competition, self-monitoring and review of physiological changes, and other techniques centered on social cognitive theory. A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies investigating the effect of mobile apps to improve weight loss and physical activity outcomes demonstrated reductions in BMI of 0.43 kg/m² (95% CI −0.74 to −0.13) with much greater weight loss seen when the devices were used optimally. Benefits have also been seen with the use of behavior change apps to drive improvements in glycemic control in people with diabetes through improved adherence to treatment protocols. However the challenge is to achieve sustained improvements in clinical parameters and the long-term outcomes with use of these devices is unknown.

App-based behavior change interventions are also available to address long-term non-adherence with prescribed pharmacological treatments for chronic illnesses, which is estimated to be as high as 50%. Common reasons for non-adherence that can be addressed through an app include forgetfulness, lack of understanding of side effects, and perceptions of lack of efficacy. A recent review identified 704 apps on the app store utilizing behavioral strategies to enhance medication adherence through alerts, reminders, and logs. There was positive feedback from patients on features such as customized medication regimen details and reminders; however, there were frequent technical difficulties experienced through glitches, confusing app navigation and dosage scheduling, and reminder setup inflexibility. A systematic review noted that only 4 out of 805 medication adherence apps included had associated published evidence of clinical outcomes. High-quality evidence from multicenter randomized controlled trials has recently emerged demonstrating the potential of app-based interventions to improve treatment adherence in the management of hypertension and clinical outcomes from enhanced perioperative care after elective abdominal surgery. While there is evidence of positive patient experiences with treatment adherence apps further research is needed to better understand how these can be utilized to add value to clinical care when prescribed alongside pharmaceuticals.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^de70aa28]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 5–3 — Poor adherence with prescribed maintenance treatment in asthma — contributing factors and clinical identification are summarized as follows: Medication/regimen factors include "Difficulties using inhaler device (e.g., arthritis)", "Burdensome regimen (e.g., several times per day)", and "Multiple different inhalers"; unintentional poor adherence includes "Misunderstanding about instructions" and "Forgetfulness"; and intentional poor adherence includes "Perception that treatment is not necessary" and "Concerns about side-effects (real or perceived)". For patients prescribed maintenance treatment, "ask an empathic question" and "Acknowledge the likelihood of incomplete adherence and encourage an open non-judgmental discussion", using example prompts such as "In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it – not at all, 1, 2, 3 or more days a week?" and "Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or the evening?" Practical checks include "Check the date of the last prescription", "Check the date and dose counter on the inhaler", and, where available, electronic monitoring since "prescribing and dispensing frequency can be monitored electronically by clinicians and/or pharmacists".

### Intentional-but not unintentional medication non-adherence was related with beliefs about medicines among a multi-ethnic sample of people with HIV [^21f39232]. AIDS and Behavior (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a primary determinant of antiretroviral treatment success. Sufficiently high levels of adherence to ART are necessary to achieve and sustain viral suppression thereby preventing morbidity and mortality. Yet, people with HIV (PWH) do not always succeed in achieving or maintaining adequately high levels of treatment adherence. Adherence is potentially amenable to intervention. To be able to intervene on low levels of medication adherence, problems with adherence need to be detected.

Non-adherence can be unintentional or intentional, whereby intentional non-adherence is characterized by the patient's active decision not to adhere to the prescribed medication. This is mainly influenced by perceptual barriers such as a perceived lack of necessity of medication or concerns about taking medication. Unintentional non-adherence is considered to occur more subconsciously and is mainly influenced by practical barriers such as a lack of capacity, resources and skills (e.g. forgetting, poor comprehension). The distinction between unintentional and intentional medication non-adherence is highly relevant because the different causes of these two types of non-adherence require different interventions to enhance medication adherence. For example, helping someone to remember taking medicines will not likely improve adherence if a person intentionally skips medication due to concerns about negative effects of medicines or disclosure concerns. Unintentional and intentional medication non-adherence have been extensively investigated among patients with various medical conditions.

Despite the wealth of studies that have investigated adherence to ART to date, only a few studies have distinguished between unintentional and intentional non-adherence among PWH. Nevertheless, these few studies have shown that unintentional- and intentional non-adherence appear to be two separate entities with each of them being associated with a different set of predictors/associated factors, including in studies for HIV treatment. Intentional non-adherence was generally associated with motivations, perceptions and beliefs, whereas unintentional non-adherence was more often associated with demographic- and HIV-treatment related factors.

Beliefs about medicines have emerged as an important factor influencing medication adherence among people with various medical conditions. Beliefs about medicines can be divided into four themes: beliefs about the necessity of the prescribed medication, concerns about possible adverse effects of prescribed medication, beliefs that medicines in general are overused/over-prescribed by doctors, and beliefs that medicines in general are potentially harmful. Previous studies have shown that stronger beliefs in the necessity of ART and lower concerns about ART are related with improved adherence. However, none of these previous studies has distinguished between intentional and unintentional non-adherence.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^1c4f914f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Intentional and unintentional nonadherence — common reasons and effectiveness of adherence strategies are described, stating that it remains important that the clinician and patient have ongoing discussions about statin therapy and the reasons for less than optimal adherence if present; reasons for high discontinuation and missed doses include cost of medication, patient cannot afford the co-pay, unclear label instructions, patient forgetfulness, adverse effects from medication that patient is too embarrassed to discuss with doctor, patient does not like the idea of having to take medication, patient does not understand the importance of a given medication for a condition for which he or she has no symptoms, patient-practitioner relationship is suboptimal, and polypharmacy and complexity of regimen. Unintentional nonadherence is defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. One of the most important aspects of long-term medication adherence is to review the medication list, ask about adverse effects, cost, and adherence, and discuss barriers to adherence at every office visit. Current methods of improving adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, and even with the most effective methods the magnitude of effect was quite small; strategies noted include the quality of the patient–care provider relationship, shared decision making, and avoidance of overly complex and expensive regimens, and much more research is needed to develop approaches that reduce stopping medications shown to benefit overall health.

### What is the meaning of health literacy? A systematic review and qualitative synthesis [^9069b74c]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Health literacy, as a term first proposed in the 1970s, generally concerns whether an individual is competent with the complex demands of promoting and maintaining health in the modern society. Over the past two decades, increasing attention has been attached to the concept due to its significant benefits to individual and public health and the sustainability of healthcare systems. It is considered particularly important when non-communicable diseases (NCDs) prevail and their corresponding costs are steadily rising, highlighting the need for people to take more responsibility in managing their own health with more effective use of health services. Inadequate health literacy is associated with difficulties in comprehension of health information, limited knowledge of diseases and lower medication adherence, which contribute to poor health, high risk of mortality, insufficient and ineffective use of healthcare, increased costs, and health disparities. The existing evidence seems to suggest health literacy as one of the most promising and cost-effective approaches to overcome the NCD challenges. Many countries have included health literacy as a key priority in their policies and practices, such as the USA, Canada, Australia, the European Union and China. The WHO recommends health literacy as an instrument for achieving several key targets listed in the Sustainable Development Goals.

Despite the realisation of the importance of health literacy to human health and extensive studies into this area over the past few decades, there is still a lack of consensus on 'what the concept actually represents'. Such an essential research question has often been overlooked. The concept of health literacy seems to be very flexible, which allows anyone to identify nearly whatever one wants as health literacy. Over 250 different definitions exist in the academic literature. The unclear and inconsistent interpretations of health literacy are projected to limit the development of valid and reliable measurements, the accurate evaluation and comparisons of health literacy initiatives, and the synthesis of evidence to support strategies for improving health literacy. Furthermore, the confusion of the concept is likely to produce disjointed and even contradictory findings, jeopardising the development and implementation of trustworthy and effective health literacy-related interventions and policies.

This study aimed to clarify 'what health literacy represents' through a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of existing studies across different contexts in relation to this complex concept.

### Ensuring medication adherence with direct oral anticoagulant drugs: lessons from adherence with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) [^5787f734]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Medication adherence (taking drugs properly) is uncommon among patients on warfarin. Poor adherence to warfarin leads to an increase in adverse medical events, including stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). Factors related to patients, physicians and the health system account for poor adherence. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are easier to use than warfarin, with fewer drug and food interactions and no need for routine blood monitoring. A proper use of DOACs may reduce the risk of stroke in AF. However, in clinical settings where no laboratory monitoring is needed, a poor medication adherence is common and may impact clinical outcomes. In the management of chronic disorders, careful knowledge of the individual patient's attitudes and behaviors is a pre-requisite for a successful doctor-patient communication. To increase patient's awareness of the risks and benefits of DOACs and, in turn, increase medication adherence, at each follow-up visit physicians should screen for priorities and motivational problems; check for the lack of understanding and/or knowledge; assess any health system or personal barriers to medication adherence; identify appropriate interventions and provide tailored support to patient needs. Dissemination of guidelines to the health care chain (prescribing physician, general practitioners, caregivers, nurses, pharmacists) further encourages medication adherence. However, the long-term effect of some of these strategies is unknown; one tool may not fit all patients, and the prescribing physician should consider individualization of these aids to ensure medication adherence and persistence (continuing to take drugs properly in long-term treatments) for DOACs in every day practice.

### Medicine partnerships [^e1327263]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Partial medication compliance, where patients do not take enough of their prescribed medicine to achieve adequate outcomes, is common. Research using electronic monitoring to assess compliance has shown that people take approximately 75% of doses as prescribed, irrespective of the condition being treated or its severity. Erratic compliance often leads to discontinuation of therapy, as treatment is perceived to be ineffective. Compliance decreases as frequency of dosing increases. Inadequate compliance and treatment persistence results in poor outcomes, despite the best efforts of the medical team. It is important to develop and implement a strategy to improve compliance. Simple steps that can be taken include helping patients to select "cues" to remind them to take their tablets, use of dose reminder boxes, and visual feedback of compliance data from electronic monitors.

Patient adherence — definition and constructs: Adherence is defined as the extent to which a person's behaviors correspond with agreed upon healthcare recommendations, and medication adherence refers to conformance with timing, dosage, frequency, and duration as prescribed; poor adherence may be irregular or interrupted intake or lack of persistence, where persistence is the duration from initiation to discontinuation of therapy.

### Non-adherence to cardiovascular medications [^a9f6007e]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Despite evidence-based interventions, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of global mortality. As therapies advance, patient non-adherence to established treatments is well recognized. Non-adherence is a powerful confounder of evidence-based practice and can affect daily patient management, resulting in inappropriate therapeutic escalation with greater costs and potential for harm. Moreover, it increases risk for adverse cardiac events, including mortality. Yet, non-adherence is complex, remains difficult to define, and provider ability to identify its presence accurately remains limited. Improved screening tools are needed to detect at-risk patients, enabling appropriate targeting of interventions. Given the rapidly expanding global population with CHD and emerging clinical and cost-benefits of adherence, addressing non-adherence to prescribed therapies is a top priority.

SIMPLE — modify patient beliefs and behavior states that to modify patients' beliefs and behavior, providers should empower patients to self-manage their condition and create an open dialogue verifying needs, expectations, and experience in taking medications; providers should also verify what will help patients to become, and remain, adherent. It is important to ensure that patients understand that they will be at risk if they do not take their medications; this can be done by asking patients to describe the consequences of not taking their medications as well as having patients recite the positive benefits of taking their medications ("teach back").

### Treatment non-adherence in pediatric long-term medical conditions: systematic review and synthesis of qualitative studies of caregivers' views [^2e82a13e]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-adherence is the primary cause of treatment failure in pediatric long-term conditions. Internationally, a third to a half of all prescribed treatments are not adhered to and the rates of non-adherence amongst children and adolescents with long-term conditions is higher than amongst adults.

'Adherence' is ' the extent to which the patient's behaviour matches agreed recommendations from the prescriber '. We prefer it to the term 'compliance' because it includes, but does not presume, the possibility of patient involvement in the treatment decision making process. We do not use the term 'concordance' because it assumes a shared decision making process between patients and doctors. Although shared decision making would ideally occur in all clinical encounters, this cannot be assumed.

Quantitative research into barriers to treatment adherence has identified a range of factors including: costs and access to treatments; complexity and demands of treatment regimen; lack of social support and depression. Research into promoting treatment adherence has found that the most effective interventions are complex and include combinations of more convenient care, information, reminders, specific behavioural change techniques and involving patients in the decision-making process. Adherence interventions amongst pediatric populations also show that multicomponent interventions are most effective. However, the effect sizes are inconsistent across studies and settings, effect sizes are small and more research is needed.

There is a recognised need for qualitative research to understand the complex behaviour of treatment adherence. A systematic review and synthesis of qualitative papers on treatment adherence that focussed primarily on adults found a reluctance to take medicines in general; a preference to take as little as possible; a widespread practice of personal testing of medicines, mainly for adverse effects; and patients modifying treatment regimens to make them more acceptable.

Treatment adherence in pediatric care has been less extensively studied, yet influences appear even more complex than in the care of adults. For example, the burden of treatment generally lies with caregivers rather than with the patients themselves. Additionally, whereas in adults the therapeutic relationship is between the medical team and the patient, in pediatric care there is a 'therapeutic triad' with communicative interactions between parent -professionals; child - professionals and parent - child.

### Non-adherence to medication regimens among older African-American adults [^00a829ca]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

While other studies have documented that medication adherence remains an important issue among older adults, our study shows that for the underserved elderly African-American community, these issues are particularly striking. We also documented that several medication-related issues among this segment of our population are alarming. Logically, the first step in improving adherence among underserved older adults with multiple comorbidities is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of all their prescribed medications and any other medications that they take. The goal should be to identify issues such as excessive use of medications, drug interactions, inappropriate medications, the use of unauthorized and expired medications, and assessment of the medication regimen complexity. The next step must focus on enhancing health literacy and disease-related knowledge, explaining the therapeutic purposes of medications, side-effects, special instructions, etc. Inter-professional collaboration using a patient-centered approach that promotes appropriate communication between older adult patients and providers is the key for achieving this goal.

### Can we improve adolescent adherence? [^d19e9e99]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Adherence has been defined as the extent to which a person's action and behaviour matches the agreed recommendations from a clinician.(1,2) It is a continuous and dynamic process influenced by many factors, including the disease, the treatments, the healthcare team and system, social and economic factors, as well as patient-related factors.(1) Non-adherence may adversely affect clinical outcomes and lead to increased healthcare costs.(1–3) Reported rates of adherence are around 50% for people with long-term conditions, and may be as low as 30% among adolescents (aged 10–19 years).(1,3,4) Around 20% of those aged under 18 years have a chronic illness and treatment often requires long-term cumbersome regimens including multiple daily medicines, making adherence challenging.(1,3,5) It is important to distinguish between intentional and non-intentional adherence and to tailor interventions to the individual, using every healthcare contact as an opportunity to discuss adherence.(1) Here we consider the challenges faced by healthcare professionals in encouraging adolescents to adhere to treatment regimens (in particular taking medicines) and some strategies that may help.

### Tools to measure barriers to medication management capacity in older adults: a scoping review [^69fa6292]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In individuals aged 60 years and above, there is a higher prevalence of multiple chronic conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, compared to younger age groups. According to a report by the National Council on Aging, "approximately 92% of older adults have at least one chronic disease, and 77% have at least two chronic diseases". These chronic diseases, along with associated disabilities, can result in complex medication regimens and an increased risk of functional impairment, presenting significant challenges in medication management capacity. Additionally, the burden of handling medications, especially within the context of multi-morbidity and complex medications regimens, introduces an added layer of complexity to the day-to-day lives of older people, and these burdens can also influence their capacity to manage medications.

Medication management capacity (MMC) refers to the "cognitive and functional ability to comply with a medication regimen, when it is the individual's wish or desire to follow a medication regimen as prescribed". MMC encompasses factors such as understanding the purpose and importance of medications, being able to remember and follow prescribed dosages and administration instructions and having the necessary skills to handle medication containers and administer medications correctly. Medication management capacity is closely linked to adherence. Medication adherence refers to "the extent to which a person's medication‐taking behavior corresponds with agreed-upon treatment recommendations from a healthcare provider". If an individual lacks the necessary cognitive or functional abilities to manage their medications effectively, it can result in unintentional nonadherence. Compared to younger patient groups, concerns regarding medication management capacity are particularly significant among older adults. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 46% of people over the age of 60 suffer from some form of disability, with visual impairment, hearing impairment, cognitive limitations, and osteoarthritis being the most common causes. These limitations can impair the ability of older individuals to manage complex medications and, as a consequence, restrict their independence.

### Medical measures in hypertensives considered resistant [^8bc0c3fe]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient-related factors

Patient-related factors contributing to medication nonadherence are many and diverse. Some factors, such as younger age, have a well-known association with nonadherence, while others, such as female gender, have been found only in some studies and remain disputed. Furthermore, health literacy remains an important factor in nonadherence, reflecting to some degree the overall understanding of a patients' comprehension of their own disease, and the implications of not receiving adequate treatment. Even though several studies have explored the relationship between health literacy and nonadherence, existing studies on health literacy suffer from imprecise methods in detection of nonadherence, relying mainly on self-reports rather than objective methods. In addition to sociodemographic factors, certain psychological and behavioral factors may influence the degree of adherence, exemplified by the fact that nonadherence could be both intentional (i.e. the active choice of not taking medication as prescribed) and unintentional (i.e. forgetfulness). Particularly patients' trust in medical treatment, and their beliefs about medicines have been extensively investigated, and play an important role in the persistence of adherent behavior. Bridging the gap between patient- and physician-related factors, joint decision-making and patient empowerment throughout the treatment process have been shown beneficial in improving adherence, yet many studies suffer from the same methodological limitations already mentioned.

Physician-related factors [physician inertia]

Physician-related factors contributing to nonadherence to antihypertensive drugs overlap somewhat with both patient- and treatment-related factors. The physician must be aware that prescription of complex treatment regimens, lack of joint decision-making or patient empowerment along with suboptimal communication between physicians with different areas of expertise or at different levels of care may contribute to decreased adherence. Therapeutic inertia is a very frequent and underestimated issue that might contribute to apparent treatment failures. As physician inertia might lead to a higher rate of treatment failure, one might speculate that this will further aggravate medication adherence, as patients who do not reach their treatment goals might be more likely to discontinue both medical treatment and lifestyle changes. Inertia may be extended to up-titrating study medications in randomized clinical trials (investigator inertia), an important issue previously addressed. Thus, apparent TRH in some of the world's most cited randomized controlled trials in hypertension research was caused by investigator inertia.

### Understanding the causes and consequences of low statin adherence: evidence from UK biobank primary care data [^6b4191e1]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using real-world data, we identify substantial variability in the time to first on-treatment LDL-c and adherence to statin medication, highlighting a gap between NHS guidelines and the actual level of achieved treatment response monitoring. Our work highlights important predictors of reduced statin effectiveness, such as pharmacogenetic variants, polygenic scores, but most of all, sustained adherence to statin medications. Higher adherence to treatment was associated with greater adherence to therapy overall, leading to more significant LDL-c reductions over time. This suggests that improved service provision and patients' factors — such as increased statin use, better understanding of treatment by patients, more frequent GP visits for LDL-c checks, and tailored treatments addressing low-adherence risk factors — could enhance efficacy, safety, and long-term patient outcomes.

When quantifying adherence using the proportion of days covered (PDC) measure, we assumed that patients adhered to their prescribed medication regimens. While PDC typically refers to the proportion of days a patient is covered by medication and is capped at 100%, our calculation allowed values above 100% to account for scenarios such as multiple-tablet daily regimens. However, since adherence was evaluated using a binary threshold (≤ 95% vs. > 95%), this methodological distinction is unlikely to meaningfully affect our results. However, the UKB lacks detailed data on actual medication intake and GP dosage instructions (e.g. whether a patient is taking 2 × 40 mg versus 1 × 80 mg). Therefore, we restricted our PDC analysis to patients with a PDC of less than 200%, under the assumption that they might be taking two tablets per day as prescribed. As a result, our adherence rate is higher than in previous Finnish cohorts, likely due to their smaller PDC cut-off and the fact that 96% of statin users in Finland were prescribed one tablet daily. Nevertheless, PDC is widely used and regarded as the gold standard for measuring medication adherence in observational studies, particularly for long-term treatments like lipid-lowering drugs. In the UK healthcare system, prescriptions are typically collected from a pharmacy shortly after issue. Thus, monthly GP prescribing patterns may serve as a reasonable proxy for medication availability (if someone is receiving regular prescriptions (e.g. monthly) and those are recorded in the electronic health record, it strongly suggests they are likely collecting the medication — especially since getting a prescription usually requires action from the patient (request or visit). While PDC may not fully capture adherence behaviour at the patient level, the extent to which LDL-c change is strongly predicted by our PDC measure indicates that it is capturing the underlying relationship between medication adherence and effectiveness of treatment. Different PDC cut-offs have been used previously, we chose the > 95% PDC threshold because it splits the population into two groups with distinct LDL-c dynamics: leading to a 40% reduction in primary prevention and an average 2 mmol/L reduction in secondary prevention, aligning with NICE guidelines and enhancing clinical relevance.

### Unintentional non-adherence: can a spoon full of resilience help the medicine go down? [^f361542d]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Barberand Barber et al have found theoretical leverage for understanding unintentional non-adherence by applying the human error literature to their data. Reasondistinguishes between three broad categories of error that have different cognitive causes: slips and lapses, mistakes, and violations. Slips and lapses occur when someone has a momentary lapse of attention and forgets to do something or does the wrong thing in a routine procedure despite knowing what to do; mistakes are the misapplication of knowledge so that people make the wrong decision about what to do; and a violation is where people have the correct knowledge but intentionally choose to break rules. Barber et al applied this theory to data about instances of non-adherence and found that it provided a way of seeing different patterns, problems and solutions in the situation. First and foremost, it provided a structure for analysing instances of non-adherence in terms of their cognitive causes. This was particularly useful for gaining insight into causes of unintentional non-adherence, which are largely neglected in the literature. Second, it moved blame away from the patient to investigate the contribution of the wider system in cases where someone did not adhere. These include system level factors that are not purely cognitive, such as poor communication from medical staff, the patient's financial situation, their life style, poor labelling on medication and confusing instructions.

### Non-adherence to medication regimens among older African-American adults [^5906bfba]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-adherence to medication is an alarming problem in the United States healthcare system causing an excess cost of over $170 billion annually. Non-adherence to prescription medication can lead to an increase in morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. Adherence to prescribed medications is extremely important to ensure the efficacy of medical treatment regimens and more positive health outcomes. Poor medication adherence is relatively common. Studies have consistently shown that 20–30% of medication prescriptions are never filled and that, on average, 50% of medications for chronic disease are not taken as prescribed by their provider. Measuring medication adherence is challenging because adherence is an individual patient behavior. Medication non-adherence can occur in different ways, such as not filling the prescription, not taking medication at all, missing doses, taking the wrong amount, taking medication at the wrong time of day, not taking it as prescribed (e.g. with or without food), purposefully discontinuing it for a period of time, or stopping it altogether.

Several recent meta-analysis and systematic reviews examined the impact of investigational interventions to improve medication adherence among older adults found a modest main effect of medication adherence and limited improvement in clinical outcomes. These systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies unanimously suggest additional empirical research to optimize interventions among elderly populations. Particularly, medication non-adherence among underserved minority populations is not well described in the literature, despite being a major cause of morbidity and mortality among this segment of our population. Indeed, racial differences in adherence to prescribed medication regimens among minority elderly have been previously reported in several studies conducted in US. It is suggested that factors that actually change minority patients' medication-taking practices must be re-examined. Re-examination of correlates of low medication adherence and their interactions among minority underserved population not only guide health service researchers to design more effective interventional strategies, it will also help health providers to better recognize patients at higher risk for chronic disease-related outcomes.

### Improving adherence to treatment in patients with diabetes: practical strategies [^0937b6f1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic diseases worldwide. In addition to complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, repeated infections or even limb amputation, lack of continuous blood sugar control can cause economic problems and disruption in the progress of prescribed treatments for patients. According to the World Health Organization, adherence to treatment includes behaviours such as taking medications, following a diet, and living a healthy lifestyle that are consistent with the recommendations of health care providers. Despite the great advances of medical science in the treatment of diabetes, the poor adherence of patients to the treatment and prescribed drug regimen is still considered as one of the important challenges related to this disease. Adherence to treatment is simultaneously influenced by several factors such as social and economic factors, healthcare team/system‐related factors, condition‐related factors, treatment‐related factors and patient‐related factors. Therefore, to improve treatment adherence, issues related to each factor must be addressed. The aim of the present study was to provide practical strategies to improving adherence to treatment in patients with diabetes.

Social problems of patients with diabetes include feelings of fear, embarrassment, blame, guilt, anxiety and decreased self‐confidence, which may lead to a feeling of social stigma in the patient. For this reason, these patients may resort to strategies such as hiding the disease, not performing therapeutic activities in public, avoiding social relations and finally not adherence to treatment of their disease. Meanwhile, family support, as one of the most important sources of social support, plays a significant role in increasing self‐confidence and adaptation to the disease in people with diabetes. The coordination and cooperation of family members, especially in relation to understanding the physical and mental conditions of the patient, following the diet and remembering to take the appropriate and timely dose of medicine, helps a lot to adherence to treatment in the patient with diabetes. In this regard, one of the most important ways to increase compliance with treatment is to increase the level of awareness of the patient, family and society about the nature, control and transmission of this disease. Educational interventions to improve the level of health literacy, based on educational strategies, including lectures, audio and video media, interviews, the use of mobile phone software programs, social networks, as well as low‐cost and accessible education such as the use of SMS By raising the level of understanding and knowledge, it can lead to continuous adherence to treatment and increase the patient's self‐confidence in enjoying their normal life.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^397a1234]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Summary and recommendations — non-adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors state that medication non-adherence is common and associated with worse outcomes and higher health system costs, and improvement depends on early recognition and a sustained, coordinated team effort to prevent and address it. Central to adherence is the quality of the provider–patient relationship, with better communication empirically linked to positive outcomes including patient satisfaction. Effective provider–patient dialogue provides increased opportunities for patients to understand their condition and engage with weighing therapy risks and benefits, and providers can improve outcomes by focusing on public policy, outpatient practice redesigns that leverage electronic health record capability, and patient-specific interventions such as explaining consequences of non-adherence, suggesting ways to improve adherence, introducing team-based care, and defining roles and responsibilities to deliver optimally improved patient-centered outcomes.

### What do clinical practice guidelines say about deprescribing? A scoping review [^8030759b]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Potentially inappropriate medicines (PIMs) are medicines where the potential harm outweighs the expected benefit. In the UK, an estimated 10% of the 1.1 billion medicines dispensed each year are deemed potentially inappropriate, contributing to undesired outcomes including drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, non-adherence, falls, hospitalisations and mortality. High rates of PIM use have been observed internationally, with one-third to a half of older adults taking one or more PIMs.

Clinical practice guidelines (guidelines) are statements containing recommendations informed by a systematic review of the evidence, intended to mitigate variation in practice and optimise patient care. While guidelines play a vital role in promoting evidence-based care, they may not prompt consideration of how to optimally manage the complexities or competing demands of multimorbidity or frailty, nor take into account the potential impacts of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Well-intentioned healthcare professional adherence to prescribing recommendations contained in guidelines may therefore be a driver of PIM use.

Deprescribing, an integral component of appropriate prescribing, refers to the systematic process of dose reducing or discontinuing a medicine under the supervision of a healthcare professional. At a societal level, deprescribing plays an important role in reducing low-value care and overtreatment, as well as avoiding preventable medicine-related harm. At the patient level, benefits may include improved adherence, reduced medicine-related costs and burden, and resolution of adverse drug reactions. However, implementation of deprescribing in practice remains limited due to various patient, prescriber and organisation-level barriers. Specifically, limitations in healthcare professionals' knowledge of when and how to safely and effectively deprescribe, and their perceived lack of self-efficacy to cease medications have been reported. Such findings suggest that additional guidance for healthcare professionals may increase deprescribing in practice.

### Improving medication adherence in cardiometabolic disease: practical and regulatory implications [^601dd248]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Medication nonadherence, a major problem in cardiovascular disease (CVD), contributes yearly to approximately 125,000 preventable deaths, which is partly attributable to only about one-half of CVD patients consistently taking prescribed life-saving medications. Current interest has focused on how labeling and education influence adherence. This paper summarizes the scope of CVD nonadherence, describes key U.S. Food and Drug Administration initiatives, and identifies potential targets for improvement. We describe key adherence factors, methods, and technological applications for simplifying regimens and enhancing adherence, and 4 areas where additional collaborative research and implementation involving the regulatory system and clinical community could substantially reduce nonadherence: 1) identifying monitoring methods; 2) improving the evidence base to better understand adherence; 3) developing patient/health provider team-based engagement strategies; and 4) alleviating health disparities. Alignment of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approaches to dissemination of information about appropriate use with clinical practice could improve adherence, and thereby reduce CVD death and disability.

### Patients' beliefs and behaviors related to treatment adherence in patients with asthma requiring maintenance treatment in Asia [^e501c242]. The Journal of Asthma (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways associated with increased airway responsiveness. Although effective treatments are available, the disease burden is still substantial, often owing to poor adherence to prescribed asthma medications, particularly inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

Poor adherence to maintenance treatment such as ICS has been identified to be associated with higher rates of emergency room visits or hospitalization and poorer asthma control. Studies have shown that improved treatment adherence resulted in better clinical outcomes. However, improving adherence to medication remains a challenge in practice because factors contributing to poor adherence are diverse and multifaceted. Furthermore, not all factors are modifiable and therefore are not amenable to interventions.

Patients' perceptions of the disease and treatment play an important, yet often overlooked role in adherence to treatment. Patients' decisions to follow recommended treatment are influenced to a large extent by their beliefs and attitudes concerning the disease and treatment. For instance, patients often do not adhere to their long-term treatment regimen due to a misguided belief that it is not necessary to take their medications when they are asymptomatic, or due to concerns with dependency or adverse effects associated with long-term treatment. They often adhere to their prescribed medications only when they believe that their treatment provides more benefit than harm.

Understanding patients' perceptions of the disease and treatment can increase the chances of achieving better treatment outcomes. Regular consultations with healthcare professionals provide opportunities for enhanced communication and support, and patient education, which can lead to improved adherence. In addition, efforts to identify barriers to adherence and enhance patients' understanding of their disease and treatment can contribute to improved disease control and better clinical outcomes.

Patients have diverse beliefs and attitudes concerning their disease and treatment, which are significantly influenced by their personal, cultural and socioeconomic environment. There is little information available regarding the influence of patient beliefs and behaviors on adherence in patients with asthma in Asia. We conducted an observational study of adult patients with asthma in six Asian countries. This report describes patients' perceptions of their disease and treatment as well as the current status of asthma control and adherence in the participating countries in Asia. It also describes potentially modifiable beliefs and behaviors that are related to treatment non-adherence in the region.

### Noninfectious uveitis: strategies to optimize treatment compliance and adherence [^2de0fa79]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Strategies to promote compliance and adherence

There is, in general, no clear consensus on how to optimize uveitis patients' compliance and adherence. The most commonly used interventions include providing clear instructions and encouraging an open and nonjudgmental dialogue regarding patient-encountered difficulties with compliance and adherence, simplifying the treatment regimen, and discussing with the patient specifics of their disease, the intended treatment goals, and the risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.

The AIDES method attempts to summarize the key points for improving adherence to medications based on assessment (all medications), individualization (personalized regimen), documentation (written communication), education (continuing medical education), and supervision (continuous supervision of regimen).

Providing clear instructions to the patient

Research suggests that nearly 50% of patients leave the doctor's office with an incomplete understanding of what they have been told. Clear and simple treatment instructions should be provided both verbally and in writing. This means avoiding scientific terms and using colloquial language instead; it also means that health care providers should write information in short sentences and use brand names of medications, exact doses, and times of the day medications should be taken in their communications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Clear Communication Index is available on the Internet, and it contains guidelines and examples to enhance clarity and aid understanding. As appropriate and as authorized by the patient, the caregiver should encourage the presence of a companion or family member when treatment instructions are reviewed. Some patients choose to audio record such instructions. All patients should be given a telephone number to call for clarifications (if needed).

Modifying patient misconceptions

Addressing a patient's misconceptions can be difficult and time-consuming, but it is essential in order to avoid intentional noncompliance and non-adherence. Health care providers should take time to describe the condition, the causes and risks of vision loss, and the risks, benefits, and alternatives to treatment. Health care providers should specifically ask what concerns the patient most about their condition and whether they envision any problems or issues related to the recommended therapy.–

Enhancing patient communication

Encouraging an open and nonjudgmental dialogue with patients is essential to promote compliance and adherence. Avoiding general assumptions and highly technical language is also of paramount importance. Asking each patient to summarize the instructions as provided and whether they have any concerns regarding their ability to adhere to the recommended treatment is also essential.–

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^67922525]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for diabetes and CKD — patient education and adherence support state that education of the patient regarding medicines should include, at a minimum, the reason the medicine is being prescribed, instruction regarding side effects, importance of adherence, consequences of nonadherence, and signs or symptoms that should trigger a return call or visit to a health care provider, and all information should be relayed to the patient in lay terms. If appropriate, the patient should be instructed that other medicines are available if side effects become unmanageable. Referral to a social worker, diabetes educator, dietitian, nurse, case manager, or pharmacist for appropriate counseling should be considered when encountering such barriers to regimen adherence as cost; cultural factors and cultural beliefs; misperceptions or misunderstandings regarding diabetes and CKD, its treatment, and the consequences of nonadherence; or apparent inability to take medicines on a regular basis (ie, forgetfulness, or difficulty managing a complex medication regimen). Establishing and maintaining self-management behaviors likely will require multiple ongoing contacts with members of the health care team, and aging of the population will require regular reassessment of the patient's ability to independently handle the management regimen. Development of culturally sensitive educational materials and services is necessary to ensure adherence to medical recommendations and requires time and resources that may be beyond the control of the individual clinician, and the approach to the patient should be individualized, taking into consideration his or her culture, economic situation, knowledge and beliefs regarding the disease and treatment, response to medication (in particular, side effects), ability (emotional, functional, cognitive, visual) to adhere to the prescribed regimen, and changes in status over time.

### Understanding barriers to and strategies for medication adherence in COPD: a qualitative study [^e956b533]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, challenges with patient-provider communication were reported frequently as barriers to medication adherence. Such challenges included confusion regarding what the provider is asking of the patient, insufficient or confusing instructions regarding inhaler use and techniques, and an inability to communicate with providers outside of scheduled appointments. Lack of clear and consistent patient-provider communication may also pose a barrier to discussion of cost concerns. These challenges contributed to gaps in understanding of the disease process and indications for therapies, which in turn may have affected adherence, according to some individual's reports.

A common sentiment expressed relating to personal motivation for COPD management was the importance of feeling heard during doctor visits, which contributed to confidence in providers and prescribed care regimen. Communication with community pharmacists has previously been noted to improve self-confidence in use and may increase adherence, as does physician follow-up regarding technique and usage of inhaled devices. Pharmacy involvement is particularly important for inhaler usage given previous data showing physicians lack nuanced understanding themselves of appropriate use of all inhalers.

Accompaniment by family at physician visits was cited by participants to have a positive impact on information retention by patients which in turn may improve adherence to prescribed medications. Specifically, patients felt that the presence of a family member at visits who could make comments, ask questions, or take notes enhanced their ability to communicate with their provider during the visit and allowed for more detailed recall of provider instructions after the visit when taking their medications. This is particularly notable in the context of the burden of cognitive impairment in individuals with COPD, both previously demonstrated and demonstrated in this cohort of people with COPD with 53% having at least mild cognitive impairment. Interestingly, similarities to previously documented factors affecting asthma management were observed, including that individuals valued clear communication with physicians as facilitators to disease control and behaviors were influenced by the cost of inhalers. This work will be informative for the development of interventions aimed at improving self-management in COPD.

### Recommendations for providers on person-centered approaches to assess and improve medication adherence [^aefb6bf7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Medication non-adherence is a significant clinical challenge that adversely affects psychosocial factors, costs, and outcomes that are shared by patients, family members, providers, healthcare systems, payers, and society. Patient-centered care (i.e., involving patients and their families in planning their health care) is increasingly emphasized as a promising approach for improving medication adherence, but clinician education around what this might look like in a busy primary care environment is lacking. We use a case study to demonstrate key skills such as motivational interviewing, counseling, and shared decision-making for clinicians interested in providing patient-centered care in efforts to improve medication adherence. Such patient-centered approaches hold considerable promise for addressing the high rates of non-adherence to medications for chronic conditions.

### Deprescribing for all: a narrative review identifying inappropriate polypharmacy for all ages in hospital settings [^328bbbe5]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Relationship between adherence and deprescribing

It is important to distinguish 'deprescribing' from 'non-adherence' and 'non-compliance' because deprescribing is directed and supervised by healthcare professionals with the same level of expertise and attention that prescribing entails. It is also critical to remember that patient views and understanding of their medications have a direct relation to their willingness to adhere to or discontinue medications. All patients who struggle with medication adherence should be encouraged to ask their healthcare providers the five questions listed in online supplemental abstract 6 to prevent adverse effects of medications early on and to ask whether their medications can be reviewed to determine if any can be stopped or reduced. It can also be used by healthcare providers as a Teach-Back tool to confirm the patient's understanding of the reason for medication changes and discontinuations.

Deprescribing has the potential to improve patient adherence. Research has shown that an increased number of medications is associated with reduced adherence and that a reduced number of daily administrations leads to better adherence. Considering that deprescribing can reduce the number of medications and the frequency of administrations, it could lead to overall improved adherence.

Case study

This patient is a 56-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia. The pharmacist identified polypharmacy, with a regimen of xx medications, including xxx medications. The patient had difficulty managing his medications secondary to poor compliance and lack of awareness of the indications of his medications. He inquired about his medications but was instructed to ask his family physician instead and was offered a blister pack to improve compliance.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes, urinary incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections over the past 6 months and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. He also has a history of falls due to dizziness spells and memory loss. The patient thinks his recent falls could be due to not taking some of his medications. The patient has poor diabetes control with an average A1C of 8.5% for the past year, leading to the worsening of his other medical conditions such as neuropathic pain.

### Nonadherence to lipid-lowering therapy and strategies to improve adherence in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^5928963a]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

2 CHALLENGES FOR ADHERENCE TO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LLTS

2.1 Patient‐related factors

2.1.1 Poor ASCVD awareness and unintentional nonadherence

A poor understanding of ASCVD and associated health risks and a limited appreciation of the benefits of treatment to reduce hypercholesterolemia represent another barrier to LLT adherence. This barrier is in part a consequence of physicians overestimating patients' understanding of the importance of managing CV risks.

In addition, poor LLT adherence can sometimes be unintentional and a consequence of forgetfulness or a lack of understanding of medication instructions. A cross‐sectional questionnaire study of stroke survivors showed no association between nonadherence to preventive drugs and personal beliefs about medicine and suggested that nonadherence might be associated with difficulties with memory and the need of help from next of kin.

2.2 Therapy‐related factors

### The role of medication regimen complexity in diabetes management: a rapid review [^1f1d890e]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This review underscores the importance of addressing concerns about MRC in diabetes management, as it is associated with various health outcomes that may impact treatment effectiveness. Higher MRC was generally associated with poorer glycemic control and medication adherence, greater treatment burden, and increased diabetes-related distress. Due to methodological heterogeneity across studies, including variations in populations, settings, study designs, and outcome measures, further research is needed to clarify how regimen complexity influences glycemic control. Nonetheless, our findings emphasize the need for healthcare providers to consider regimen simplification strategies where possible to enhance adherence and improve other patient outcomes. Incorporating simplification into clinical decision-making may also support more patient-centered care by reducing treatment burden and aligning therapy with individual patient needs and preferences. Future research should focus on standardizing outcome assessments and identifying subgroups most likely to benefit, thereby improving the understanding of the actual impact of MRC and informing strategies for optimizing diabetes treatment in both practice and policy.

### Decreasing avoidable vision loss: identifying antecedents of adherence [^16b163f2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Adherence to medication treatment protocols and active participation by individuals in their medical care are important for all patients, but especially for those with chronic conditions such as vision loss. Adherence is crucial for decreasing avoidable vision loss. Failure to take medications as prescribed and keep scheduled appointments reduces treatment effectiveness, increases complications and results in poorer outcomes. Reasons for nonadherence vary by diagnosis and include not understanding the importance of adherence, low health literacy, lack of adequate self-efficacy, low level of activation and behavioral issues including depression. Patients may lack information about their condition and its prognosis, available treatment alternatives, and other essential information such as how to monitor their eye condition, what to do if vision deteriorates and how to get needed community-based help. Each of these factors impedes patients' ability to engage with their physician and participate in their own care. The ability of individuals with vision loss to actively and effectively manage their health care, ie, activation, has been understudied. When patients are involved with their own care, their care experience, and most importantly, their outcomes, are improved. Identifying antecedents of adherence may help provide disease- and patient-specific pathways to reduce avoidable vision loss.

### I believe, therefore I do [^5f22d4cd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

But what is perhaps also needed is a much more fundamental change in physicians' understanding of the role of patients in developing treatment plans. To borrow from a legal analogy, it is probably fair to say that we don't yet have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that developing a better understanding of patient beliefs will lead to better adherence. But the circumstantial evidence is mounting and one has to ask how long we are going to continue waiting before we change our fundamental views of the roles of physician and patient in negotiating treatment plans.

Despite a few decades of progress and movement toward more patient centered care, the prevailing model is still one in which the physician is viewed as the expert who assists the patient who needs help. We have frequently found ourselves struck when listening to discussions about patient centered medical homes, one of the latest buzzwords in primary care, how much attention is focused on reengineering practices and redistributing tasks. Yet very little attention is paid to orienting in an entirely different way toward patients.

### How to communicate evidence to patients [^55ff8c86]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Don't rely on words, give numbers alongside them

Words mean different things to different people. Tests of what patients understand by the European Medicines Agency's recommended terms to convey the probabilities of adverse effects consistently show that they are misinterpreted by both healthcare professionals and patients. For instance, when non-medically trained people were told an adverse effect was 'common', they tended to think that it will happen around 50% of the time. Doctors surveyed in one study put the probability of 'common' at around 25%. In fact, in official communications and patient information leaflets, this term is used for adverse effects that occur 1%–10% of the time. Crucially, these differences in people's perceptions of the risk also influenced their opinions on whether they would take the medication or not.

### Interventions to improve medication adherence: a review [^5a885bff]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among adults with chronic illness, 30% to 50% of medications are not taken as prescribed. In the United States, it is estimated that medication nonadherence is associated with 125 000 deaths, 10% of hospitalizations, and $100 billion in health care services annually.

Observations

PubMed was searched from January 1, 2000, to September 6, 2018, for English-language randomized clinical trials of interventions to improve medication adherence. Trials of patients younger than 18 years, trials that used self-report as the primary adherence outcome, and trials with follow-up periods less than 6 months were excluded; 49 trials were included. The most common methods of identifying patients at risk for nonadherence were patient self-report, electronic drug monitors (pill bottles), or pharmacy claims data to measure gaps in supply. Patient self-report is the most practical method of identifying nonadherent patients in the context of clinical care but may overestimate adherence compared with objective methods such as electronic drug monitors and pharmacy claims data. Six categories of interventions, and characteristics of successful interventions within each category, were identified: patient education (eg, recurrent and personalized telephone counseling sessions with health educators); medication regimen management (using combination pills to reduce the number of pills patients take daily); clinical pharmacist consultation for chronic disease co-management (including education, increased frequency of disease monitoring via telephone or in-person follow-up visits, and refill reminders); cognitive behavioral therapies (such as motivational interviewing by trained counselors); medication-taking reminders (such as refill reminder calls or use of electronic drug monitors for real-time monitoring and reminding); and incentives to promote adherence (such as reducing co-payments and paying patients and clinicians for achieving disease management goals). The choice of intervention to promote adherence will depend on feasibility and availability within a practice or health system. Successful interventions that are also clinically practical include using combination pills to reduce daily pill burden, clinical pharmacist consultation for disease co-management, and medication-taking reminders such as telephone calls to prompt refills (maximum observed absolute improvements in adherence of 10%, 15%, and 33%, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

Adherence can be assessed and improved within the context of usual clinical care, but more intensive and costly interventions that have demonstrated success will require additional investments by health systems.

### Cultural issues in medication adherence: disparities and directions [^2ff75993]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Adherence to medications is dependent upon a variety of factors, including individual characteristics of the patient, the patient's family and culture, interactions with healthcare providers, and the healthcare system itself. Because of its association with worse outcomes, poor medication adherence is considered a potential contributor to disparities in health outcomes observed for various conditions across racial and ethnic groups. While there are no simple answers, it is clear that patient, provider, cultural, historical, and healthcare system factors all play a role in patterns of medication use. Here, we provide an overview of the interface between culture and medication adherence for chronic conditions; discuss medication adherence in the context of observed health disparities; provide examples of cultural issues in medication adherence at the individual, family, and healthcare system/provider level; review potential interventions to address cultural issues in medication use; and provide recommendations for future work.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^b1f1117e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Health literacy — prevalence, consequences, and communication factors are detailed, with health literacy defined as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions" and described as "found in approximately 90 million US adults". In a survey at "4 Veterans Administration medical centers", "32.9% of patients were determined to have inadequate health literacy, 16.9% needed help reading medical material, 17.1% had problems learning about their medical condition, and 29.6% were not confident completing health forms alone". Consequences include costs "4 times higher" and hospitalization risk "50% increased" for those with low literacy skills. Contributors to inadequate adherence include empathy gaps, with "approximately 70–90% of opportunities for a health care provider to express empathy to a patient" missed, and patients often not perceiving immediate benefit, which "leads to their being frustrated and not adhering to, or failing to persist in taking their medication"; accordingly, "Providers must attempt to understand the patients' concerns and beliefs about their problems".

### Patient-centered communication to assess and enhance patient adherence to glaucoma medication [^3d6efe02]. Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Topic

Using an understanding of a patient's difficulty in revealing nonadherence and patient-centered communication skills to identify and address barriers to adherence to glaucoma medication regimens.

Clinical Relevance

In addition to cost and logistical difficulties with obtaining and administering medicine, a patient's adherence to medication is influenced by the balance between the perceived need for medication and concerns about taking medication.

Methods

This article is based on both the author's clinical experience and peer-reviewed research on effective doctor-patient communication and assessment and management of nonadherence.

Results

Three strategies have been identified that help physicians to detect and address problems with adherence: (1) a 4-step adherence assessment interview designed to detect nonadherence that decreases patient resistance to revealing nonadherence by applying a shared decision-making process and mitigating social undesirability; (2) asking open-ended questions in ask-tell-ask sequences; and (3) tailoring interventions to the patient's stage of readiness for change.

Conclusions

Patients conceal nonadherence because they want to be thought of by their physicians as good patients. They are driven to nonadherence by an imbalance between their perceived need for medication and their concerns about taking it. Patient-centered communication techniques can engage the patient in shared decision making about medication, thereby redefining the good patient as someone who works with his or her health care provider to address adherence barriers. Those barriers can be explored with open-ended questions designed to elicit the patient's understanding and concerns, to provide information, and to assess change in the patient's understanding and attitudes. Communication will be more effective if it is based on the patient's stage of readiness to adopt adherent self-management practices.

### Patient adherence and effective communication [^5609a02a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Poor adherence to inhaled corticosteroid medication is a critical problem for asthma because it contributes to morbidity and mortality through poor asthma control, frequent asthma exacerbations, acute care visits, and oral corticosteroid use.

Objective

To discuss evidence-based, time-efficient strategies that can be adopted by most practitioners to try to increase patient adherence.

Methods

Asthma management guidelines and other key publications are used to enhance discussion.

Results

Establishing patient-centered, collaborative care that permits effective patient-practitioner communication can improve adherence, thus leading to improved asthma outcomes. One critical strategy is shared decision making, in which the patient and the practitioner share relevant information, discuss risks vs benefits of various treatment options, express treatment preferences, deliberate the options, and agree on treatment. Asthma self-management education, which emphasizes self-efficacy, is also essential. The education necessary to provide those skills depends in part on consideration of the patient's health literacy. Practitioners also have at their disposal a variety of tips and techniques to improve communication and gather information not only at the patient-practitioner level but also at the practitioner-practitioner level, such as within a group practice or within a health care system.

Conclusion

To improve patient adherence, clinicians need to consider a variety of factors and implement strategies that directly target underlying issues. Strategies may include customizing and simplifying learning and intervention regimens, identifying barriers to adherence and addressing them, ensuring patient support structures are in place, and improving self-efficacy and health literacy.

### Realigning diabetes regimens in older adults: a 4S pathway to guide simplification and deprescribing strategies [^d07929f5]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Treating older people with diabetes is challenging due to multiple medical comorbidities that might interfere with patients' ability to perform self-care. Most diabetes guidelines focus on improving glycaemia through addition of medications, but few address strategies to reduce medication burden for older adults-a concept known as deprescribing. Strategies for deprescribing might include stopping high-risk medications, decreasing the dose, or substituting for less harmful agents. Accordingly, glycaemic management strategies for older adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes not responding to their current regimen require an understanding of how and when to realign therapy to meet patient's current needs, which represents a major clinical practice gap. With the gap in guidance on how to deprescribe or otherwise adjust therapy in older adults with diabetes in mind, the International Geriatric Diabetes Society, an organisation dedicated to improving care of older individuals with diabetes, convened a Deprescribing Consensus Initiative in May, 2023, to discuss Optimization of diabetes treatment regimens in older adults: the role of de-prescribing, de-intensification and simplification of regimens. The recommendations from this group initiative are discussed and described in this Review.

### Patients' beliefs and preferences regarding doctors' medication recommendations [^13097bff]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

An estimated 20–50% of patients do not take medications as recommended. Accepting a doctor's recommendation is the first step in medication adherence, yet little is known about patients' beliefs and preferences about how medications are prescribed.

Objective

To explore patients' beliefs and preferences about medication prescribing to understand factors that might affect medication adherence.

Methods

Fifty members from 2 health plans in Massachusetts participated in in-depth telephone interviews. Participants listened to an audio-vignette of a doctor prescribing a medication to a patient and were asked a series of questions related to the vignette. Responses were reviewed in an iterative process to identify themes related to participants' beliefs and preferences about medication prescribing.

Results

Participants' beliefs and preferences about medication prescribing encompassed 3 major areas: patient-doctor relationships, outside influences, and professional expertise. Important findings included participants' concerns about the pharmaceutical industry's influence on doctors' prescribing practices and beliefs that there is a clear "best" medication for most health problems.

Conclusions

Patients' beliefs and preferences about medication prescribing may affect medication adherence. Additional empiric studies that explore whether doctors' relationships with pharmaceutical representatives impact medication adherence by affecting trust are indicated. In addition, it would be worthwhile to explore whether discussions between patients and doctors regarding equipoise (no clear scientific evidence for 1 treatment choice over another) affect medication adherence.

### Intentional-but not unintentional medication non-adherence was related with beliefs about medicines among a multi-ethnic sample of people with HIV [^077a631e]. AIDS and Behavior (2023). Medium credibility.

Examples of strategies to explore and address people's medicine-related beliefs in the clinical setting are the Perceptions and Practicalities Approach and the Necessity-Concerns Framework. These two strategies suggests that adherence support needs to address both the perceptions (e.g. beliefs about illness and treatment) and practicalities (e.g. capability and resources) affecting the individual's ability and motivation to adhere. For many patients, taking medication does not 'make common sense' when they have an asymptomatic condition and feel well. These strategies include providing a rationale for medication necessity so that patients perceive a 'common sense' fit between their condition and treatment, eliciting and addressing concerns about medicines and addressing practical barriers to adherence. Exploring and addressing perceptual factors requires patient-centered communication. Carrying out non-judgmental assessments of what influences a person to want or not want to adhere and what factors influence their ability to do so is essential. Motivational interviewing is one technique which could be used to explore people's perceptions of ART and foster their motivations to adhere.

### EHR-based medication support and nurse-led medication therapy management: rationale and design for a three-arm clinic randomized trial [^1256eb2f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

A substantial portion of medication nonadherence is not a result of a failure to understand basic medication tasks but rather of patients' deliberate choices not to use medications. Research on health behaviors has identified several important determinants of whether an individual performs a specific health behavior: attitudes toward the behavior, the perception of social norms, and one's own sense of self‐efficacy in performing the behavior. Patients may have negative attitudes or conflicting beliefs toward the efficacy of certain medications or be influenced by friends or family to not use a prescribed medicine. The limited interactions between patients and their providers and currently used print material may not be sufficient to overcome these negative perceptions of medications. One's sense of self‐efficacy may be reduced if dosing requirements are too burdensome or if cost barriers to obtaining specific medications are not addressed. The approach we have outlined may help patients to consciously make decisions about their medications that would more likely promote desired health outcomes. For instance, the focus on medication list review will ideally help to initiate provider–patient discussions about medications a patient has chosen not to use so that providers have additional opportunities to engage in discussions about nonadherence that could affect patients' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Similarly, providing simplified medication information sheets should be a more reliable way to give patients salient information about the purpose of using medications that could foster more favorable attitudes at a critical time (point of prescribing).

Although potentially cost‐prohibitive for many primary care settings, the inclusion of a healthcare professional may be necessary to confirm patients receive the EHR‐based MTM materials, subsequently understand how to safely administer their current regimens, and continually adhere to their medicines to achieve optimal health outcomes. A trained clinician who is specifically tasked with helping patients with medication management could use these tools while directly assisting patients with medication list review, information exchange, and dosing simplification. Although prior MTM strategies have used both nurses and pharmacists, availability and cost would likely favor the use of a nurse in primary care settings.

Feasible and sustainable approaches to help patients safely execute complicated outpatient medical regimens are needed. The overall objective of this study is to rigorously evaluate 2 related approaches to improving patients' medication self‐management in primary care settings. We hypothesized that hypertension patients receiving EHR‐based medication management tools alone or EHR tools plus nurse‐led medication management education, compared with usual care, would have lower systolic blood pressure, better understanding of dosing instructions, fewer discrepancies between patient‐reported medications and the medical record, and better medication adherence.

### CDC grand rounds: improving medication adherence for chronic disease management-innovations and opportunities [^8092856a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Opportunities in Medication Adherence Outcomes

Although a range of interventions have demonstrated improved medication adherence and health outcomes during the study period, few studies have shown that these benefits were maintained over time. Interventions that can sustain patient medication adherence are needed. One priority for developing sustainable strategies to improve medication adherence includes standardizing research methodology for both clinic and research settings. Currently, studies use a variety of measurement methods. Varying study methodologies prevents comparability across interventions, hinders wide application into clinical practice, and limits efforts that focus on patients with the greatest burden and need. Standardization might also help to understand both the dose-response and effectiveness of interventions over a longer time, increasing sustainability and reducing a waning effect at follow-up time points.

In addition, patient-specific tailored approaches to identifying reasons for nonadherence and aligning intervention efforts to address identified needs are needed. Outcomes might also be improved by recognizing populations at increased risk for nonadherence and addressing the broader reasons for their nonadherence, such as low health literacy. Health literacy is lower among the elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons living in poverty. Interventions to improve medication adherence could be more effective if patient's health literacy, cultural background, and language preference and proficiency are taken into account when designing communication and patient education materials.

### Health literacy and medication understanding among hospitalized adults [^bb9fae00]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients' ability to accurately report their preadmission medications is a vital aspect of medication reconciliation, and may affect subsequent medication adherence and safety. Little is known about predictors of preadmission medication understanding.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of patients at 2 hospitals using a novel Medication Understanding Questionnaire (MUQ). MUQ scores range from 0 to 3 and test knowledge of the medication purpose, dose, and frequency. We used multivariable ordinal regression to determine predictors of higher MUQ scores.

Results

Among the 790 eligible patients, the median age was 61 (interquartile range [IQR] 52, 71), 21% had marginal or inadequate health literacy, and the median number of medications was 8 (IQR 5, 11). Median MUQ score was 2.5 (IQR 2.2, 2.8). Patients with marginal or inadequate health literacy had a lower odds of understanding their medications (odds ratio [OR] = 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34 to 0.84; P = 0.0001; and OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.78; P = 0.0001; respectively), compared to patients with adequate health literacy. Higher number of prescription medications was associated with lower MUQ scores (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.75; for those using 6 medications vs 1; P = 0.0019), as was impaired cognitive function (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.86; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Lower health literacy, lower cognitive function, and higher number of medications each were independently associated with less understanding of the preadmission medication regimen. Clinicians should be aware of these factors when considering the accuracy of patient-reported medication regimens, and counseling patients about safe and effective medication use.

### EHR-based medication support and nurse-led medication therapy management: rationale and design for a three-arm clinic randomized trial [^6c2433ee]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with chronic conditions are asked to use increasingly complex medical regimens. Long‐term proper adherence is essential to reap the health benefits demonstrated in clinical trials; however, nonadherence is widespread and is linked to worse outcomes including increased mortality. For major chronic illnesses, common forms of nonadherence include failure to fill new prescriptions, incomplete adherence to medications being used, and premature discontinuation. Complex drug regimens increase the risk for medication errors and adverse drug events. Outpatient adverse drug events are prevalent, and many are either preventable or ameliorable. Individuals with chronic illness and the elderly are at greatest risk for unintentional medication errors, failing to properly self‐administer a medication as intended. –

For outpatient care, patients (or their surrogates) are primarily responsible for executing medication care plans. The expectations for medication management placed on patients by the healthcare system are considerable, with patients expected to perform multiple steps to adhere to their care plan and gain the benefits of chronic drug therapy. Figure 1 provides a conceptual schema of the tasks involved, how they relate to outcomes, and how the process can break down. Ideally, adherence to the care plan begins with an exchange of information between prescriber and patient followed by their agreement on an appropriate medication plan. As a result of these interactions or through information obtained from other sources, patients acquire the information they will use to administer medications on an ongoing basis. Information about prescription medication may come from sources directly involved in the prescribing and dispensing process (prescriber/other healthcare team member, prescription, pharmacist, medication guides, prescription labels, or auxiliary labels) or from other sources (references, Internet, family, friends, advertising). Patients and their healthcare providers must also recognize safety problems or adverse events when they occur and modify the medication care plan when necessary. Patients and providers must also monitor the efficacy and tolerability of prescribed medications. Changes to the medication plan are common in response to changing disease conditions, adverse effects, cost considerations, or lack of efficacy. Patients are the ones who must successfully execute these changes. New medicines may be added, others are discontinued, and dosages may be altered. Errors in any of these steps could lead to adverse drug events or reduced efficacy of treatment.

### Different methods of presenting risk information and their influence on medication compliance intentions: results of three studies [^08e543a0]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmaceutical noncompliance is an increasingly important problem in the United States, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and billions of wasted dollars each year. Patients' fear of adverse events (AEs) is one possible reason for lack of compliance.

Objectives

The aims of the 3 studies described in this article were to investigate whether commonly used methods of conveying AE risk might influence subjects' perceptions of their risk of experiencing drug-related AEs and whether disclosing this information by other means might subsequently influence their intentions to comply with prescribed medication regimens.

Methods

In study 1, randomly selected participants were surveyed to estimate their percentage risk for medication AEs. In study 2, randomly selected participants were presented with a fictitious medical scenario, informed of their AE risk either in terms of specific percentages or in general semantic terms (eg, "some people may experience"), and then asked to rate their fear of AEs and likelihood of compliance. Study 3 was a randomized, controlled experiment in which we duplicated the methods of study 2, with the addition of real-life stimuli (pharmaceutical advertisements).

Results

In study 1, 40 subjects were surveyed. Participants overestimated their risk of AEs when information was disclosed semantically. In study 2, people were more fearful of experiencing AEs and less likely to intend to comply with prescribed medication regimens (both, P < 0.01) when presented with AE risk information in the form of semantic risk frames rather than actual risk percentages. In study 3, 120 subjects participated. Again, participants expressed stronger intent to comply with medication regimens when they received AE risk information as percentages rather than in semantic terms (P < 0.04). In addition, intended likelihood to comply was negatively correlated with fear of experiencing AEs (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

In these studies, informing participants of actual percentage risk of AEs was associated with less fear about AEs and greater intent to comply with prescribed regimens. Using verbal descriptors to disclose AE risk information was associated with less intent to comply.

### Improving adherence to antidepressants: a systematic review of interventions [^46416fcc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Effectiveness of antidepressant medication is reduced by patients' nonadherence. Several interventions to improve adherence in patients diagnosed with unipolar depression have been tested.

Objective

To systematically review the effectiveness of interventions that aimed to improve adherence to antidepressant medication in patients with unipolar depression.

Method

Systematic review of English-language articles of randomized controlled trials obtained by a computerized literature search of MEDLINE (1966-January 2002) using the terms patient compliance, patient dropout, treatment refusal, patient education, adherence, clinical trial, randomized controlled trial, controlled trial, depressive disorder, and depression; PSYCINFO (1984-January 2002) using the terms random, clinical, control, trial, adherence, compliance, noncompliance, dropouts, patient education, depression, major depression, affective disorders, and dysthymic disorder; EMBASE (1980-January 2002) using the terms patient compliance, patient dropouts, illness behavior, treatment refusal, patient education, clinical trial, controlled study, randomized controlled trial, and depression; and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (no restrictions) using the terms random*, complian*, adheren*, pharmacotherapy, regimen*, educat*, medicat*, depression, and depressive disorder.

Results

Educational interventions to enhance adherence failed to demonstrate a clear benefit on adherence and depression outcome. However, collaborative care interventions tested in primary care demonstrated significant improvements in adherence during the acute and continuation phase of treatment and were associated with clinical benefit, especially in patients suffering from major depression who were prescribed adequate dosages of antidepressant medication.

Conclusion

We found evidence to support the introduction of interventions to enhance adherence with antidepressant medication in primary care, not only because of better adherence but also because of better treatment results. Because collaborative care interventions require additional resources, a better understanding of the mode of action of different programs is needed to reduce avoidable costs. The effectiveness of educational interventions needs more evidence.

### An adaptable framework for factors contributing to medication adherence: results from a systematic review of 102 conceptual frameworks [^a331d8ee]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We categorized the available conceptual models by eight patient groups since the key factors contributing to medication adherence can vary depending on the age and type of disease conditions studied. This categorization is reflected by the varying support for each of the WHO dimensions across patient groups.

The common factors across all patient groups were patient-related. Specifically, cognitive and psychological factors such as patients' beliefs, perceptions, and concerns were most commonly cited. On the other hand, medication-, condition-, healthcare system/HCP-related factors, and socioeconomic factors were less consistently included.

For adults with chronic, non-communicable conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, patient-related factors, and healthcare system/HCP-related factors were most common. Many patients with the abovementioned chronic conditions are often asymptomatic. The rationale for adhering to medications for non-communicable conditions is often for secondary prevention rather than symptomatic relief. As such, we would expect medication adherence to be dependent on patients' perceived needs and beliefs about the medication, which are in turn influenced by information and counselling provided by the healthcare provider during the medical encounter.

In adults with symptomatic conditions such as nocturia and migraine, the rationale for adhering to medications would be for symptomatic relief. The extent of symptoms bother and the efficacy of medications in providing symptomatic relief would therefore contribute to patients' decision to adhere or not adhere to their medications. For adults with psychiatric conditions, patient- and medication-related factors were most commonly cited, likely attributed to cognitive factors and the side effects associated with psychiatric medications.

For adults with cancer, patient-, medication-, and healthcare system/HCP-related factors, and socioeconomic factors were most commonly described. Cancer treatments are often perceived as unpleasant side effects. As such, patients' perceptions, beliefs, and concerns about the disease and medications, and the tolerability of medication side effects, as well as the availability of social support, are critical in determining adherence behavior. Additionally, healthcare system/HCP providers provide patients with the necessary information, counselling, comfort, and support that contribute to patients' decision to adhere to their medications.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^343a90ea]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Adherence to inhaled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) medications is defined as the process by which a person takes their medication as prescribed by a healthcare provider, and non-adherence has been associated with poor symptom control, increased risk of exacerbation, increased healthcare utilization and costs, decreased health-related quality of life and higher mortality risk. One systematic review reported non-adherence rates to COPD medication of 22% to 93%, with over half of the included studies reporting non-adherence in > 50% of subjects. Self-reported non-adherence to COPD medication varies between 28% and 74% (mean 50.9%) in high income countries and between 46% and 93% (mean 61.7%) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but when compared with data obtained through electronic monitoring, studies have consistently demonstrated that self-reports are inaccurate as people generally over-report medication use. Factors such as the presence of co-morbidities, in particular depression, smoking status, schooling level, disease severity, and drug regimen factors such as dosage complexity, polypharmacy and side effects of therapy, are the main factors associated with low adherence; additionally, socioeconomic factors, including unemployment, low-income status, immigration status, living alone and poor medication availability have been shown to negatively influence inhaled medication adherence and to be related to the non-use of medication. Prescribing strategies that could help improve adherence often include selecting devices with a similar inhalation technique (in the case of multiple inhalers) and combination therapy, and a better understanding of the disease and drug therapy, as well as greater trust in healthcare professionals and pharmacist-led interventions have been shown to improve COPD medication adherence. Self-management education can help a person understand their disease and the benefits of proper use of medication, and prescribing behavioral components that are tailored to the individual barriers of each person is more effective in changing behavior than offering general suggestions. A study assessing interventions intended to improve adherence to pharmacological therapy showed that multi-component interventions with education, motivational or behavioral components delivered by health professionals may improve adherence, and involving a person in establishing an individually tailored treatment plan has been shown to improve adherence; further research on medication adherence in COPD is needed to gain insight into the effectiveness of different self-management education and health behavior change strategies.

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^b01b4c38]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Polypharmacy in older adults leads to increased risks of side effects and drug-drug interactions, affecting their health outcomes and quality of life. Deprescribing, the act of simplifying medication regimens, is challenging due to the lack of consensus guidelines.

Hypothesis

To offer some guidance on managing medication regimens for older cardiovascular patients.

Methods

We reviewed the most recent pertinent guidelines and literature.

Results

This review provides practical considerations for appropriate prescribing in the older population with cardiovascular disease in order to strike a balance between unnecessary or harmful medications and therapies with proven long-term benefits.

Conclusion

On-going dialogue between healthcare providers and patients allows close monitoring of medication effectiveness and prevention of side effects. Medication regimens require individualization, as patients' goals of care change with advancing age.

### Understanding reasons and factors for participation and non-participation to a medication adherence program for patients with diabetic kidney disease in Switzerland: a mixed methods study [^fe2096f8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, while the interview proceeded with open-ended questions about possible forgetfulness or misuse of medication, some patients expressed denial of their illness and banalization of nonadherence.

Patients reported a few instances of unintentional forgetting, delayed intakes, or voluntary omissions, which occasionally occurred because of a disrupted routine (e.g. appointments, social encounters). Episodes of confusion were described in the cases of medication or regimen changes. Some patients also explain that the high cost of treatment was a risk factor for nonadherence.

"If I'm invited to a friend's house or if I go to a restaurant, it's true that I don't always take my insulin syringe… So I skip the [insulin] shot.… I can see that the blood sugar rises a bit more than usual, but well". (P02).

The transition from forgetting once in a while to not taking the treatment at all happens sometimes unintentionally, for example, in relation to a personal burden, as explained by the patient below:

"It annoys me if one day I forget because I am so busy helping my husband… I remind him but nobody reminds me… My husband is also ill and under heavy treatment and he can't prepare his weekly pillbox alone, and I have to do everything. In addition to mine, it is a tsunami, it's a lot… The mental load of women has nothing to do with the mental load of men". (P05, caregiver burden).

When moving forward with the interview, patients were invited to talk about their medication and disease management throughout their therapeutic journey. The patients explained their concerns about the constant increase in the number of prescribed medications. Some participants talked about a " cocktail " of medications that was not easy to accept (P14, P15).

### Medication adherence: a call for action [^81378b5e]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Poor adherence to efficacious cardiovascular-related medications has led to considerable morbidity, mortality, and avoidable health care costs. This article provides results of a recent think-tank meeting in which various stakeholder groups representing key experts from consumers, community health providers, the academic community, decision-making government officials (Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, etc), and industry scientists met to evaluate the current status of medication adherence and provide recommendations for improving outcomes. Below, we review the magnitude of the problem of medication adherence, prevalence, impact, and cost. We then summarize proven effective approaches and conclude with a discussion of recommendations to address this growing and significant public health issue of medication nonadherence.

### Medication adherence: importance, issues and policy: a policy statement from the American Heart Association [^f99bd6be]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Medications do not work in patients who do not take them. This true statement highlights the importance of medication adherence. Providers are often frustrated by the lack of consistent medication adherence in the patients they care for. Today with the time constraints that providers face, it becomes difficult to discover the extent of non-adherence. There are certainly many challenges in medication adherence not only at the patient-provider level but also within a healthy system and finally in insurers and payment systems. In a cross-sectional survey of unintentional nonadherence in over 24,000 adults with chronic illness, including hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, 62% forgot to take medications and 37% had run out of their medications within a year. These sobering data necessitate immediate policy and systems solutions to support patients in adherence. Medication adherence for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has the potential to change outcomes, such as blood pressure control and subsequent events. The American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) has a goal of improving medication adherence in CVD and stroke prevention and treatment. This paper will explore medication adherence with all its inherent issues and suggest policy and structural changes that must happen in order to transform medication adherence levels in the U.S. and achieve the AHA/ASA's health impact goals.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^01d2f8f3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Factors associated with medication adherence — beliefs and clinician communication: Adherence relates to medication-taking behaviors influenced by the patient's beliefs about the medications and by their trust in the prescriber; many providers are unaware of strong patient feelings about "chemical" versus natural therapies, concerns about side effects or interactions, and views on generic versus brand efficacy; Table 27 lists the prevalence of self‑reported reasons for primary non‑adherence among patients with a newly prescribed statin, and the provider‑patient relationship and communication issues must be considered when addressing medication non‑adherence.

### Life-saving medications: the urgent need for guideline adherence and patient acceptance [^75963a4e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Much information can learned from the survey data in the study by Bradley and colleagues. 1 First, patients aren't always offered guideline‐recommended therapies, particularly statin medications that have been proven to reduce risk of ASCVD events. Strategies must be implemented to increase knowledge among all relevant disciplines (cardiology, primary care, OB‐gyn, and endocrinology) and clinician types (physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants, and PharmDs), to create processes for ease of guideline implementation in the practice setting, and to leverage electronic health record capability in identifying patients not receiving guideline‐recommended care. Second, fear of side effects and perceiving side effects while taking a statin is a huge issue in patients declining or stopping statin therapy. Patients have access to a great deal of information, some of which is inaccurate or may need to be clarified by a knowledgeable clinician. The clinician–patient discussion is critical for not only communicating risk but also for addressing benefit versus risk of statin therapy, potential for side effects, patient perception of statin safety, and allowing the patient to ask questions and express his/her preferences. Ample time must be devoted to this discussion because it serves to instill trust and foster an optimal clinical–patient partnership. In addition, fostering team‐based care provides the patient with multiple avenues to discuss concerns. Finally, willingness to take a statin is quite high by patients who have declined statin therapy in the past or who have never been offered one. Therefore, clinicians must revisit the statin decision at future encounters in the context of shared decision making, while providing the patient with new clinical trial data if available and offering select statin options.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^3c33ab77]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Medication non-adherence — prevalence and costs in chronic disease: Medication non-adherence is thought to account for 30–50% of treatment failures, and only half of the 3.2 billion annual prescriptions in the United States are taken as prescribed; it is estimated to result in 33–69% of medication-related hospital admissions and as many as 125,000 deaths per year, while by the year 2020 Americans affected by at least 1 chronic condition requiring medication therapy were expected to grow to 157 million; patients with chronic conditions adhere only to 50–60% of medications and adherence often drops after the first 6 months; non-adherence costs an average of $2000 per patient in clinician visits annually and an estimated $105.8 billion annually to the US healthcare system, with research suggesting an approximate cost-to-savings ratio of 1:10 and that a substantial proportion may be preventable with strategies targeting improved medication adherence.

### Prevalence of patient knowledge gaps regarding the purpose of their cardiometabolic medications [^1707688b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patient knowledge regarding why they are prescribed their medications is paramount for the delivery of quality and patient-centered cardiometabolic care.

Objective

To generate national estimates of the proportion of patients who do not know why they are taking their anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetes, or anti-lipid medications.

Design

Cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from January 2013 through March 2020.

Participants

Non-institutionalized adults in the United States.

Main Measures

Medication use was ascertained by respondent self-report and pill bottle review of their anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetes, or anti-lipid medications. The primary outcome was the proportion of respondents with a knowledge deficiency about why they were taking their respective medications defined by respondents reporting (1) they did not know why or (2) an incorrect indication for why they were taking each medication. We also report knowledge deficiency prevalences stratified by respondent characteristics and use multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess for relationship between respondent characteristics and odds of having a knowledge deficiency.

Key Results

4.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0–5.6%, n = 391) of respondents on cardiometabolic medications had ≥ 1 knowledge deficiency, which corresponds to approximately 3,152,243 US adults. This was driven most strongly by knowledge deficiencies in anti-hypertensive medication use (4.5%, 95% CI 3.7–5.3%). There were large variations in knowledge deficiency prevalence by respondent characteristics. Most notably, 12.9% (95% CI 9.8–16.0%) of adults ≥ 80 years and 12.2% (95% CI 8.6–16.0%) of adults taking ≥ 10 medication had a knowledge deficiency. Of older adults with polypharmacy (≥ 5 prescriptions), 11.2% (95% CI 8.9–13.5%) > 65 years and 15.8% (95% CI 11.5–20.2%) > 80 years had a knowledge deficiency.

Conclusions

Most adults report a plausible reason for their use of their cardiometabolic medications. However, the prevalence of having a knowledge deficiency varied greatly by respondent demographic and health characteristics.

### How can osteoporosis patients benefit more from their therapy? Adherence issues with bisphosphonate therapy [^93a07430]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence on adherence with bisphosphonates and evolving dosing strategies for osteoporosis treatment.

Data Sources

Articles were identified by searching MEDLINE (1975-December 2005) using the following terms: osteoporosis, postmenopausal, fracture, adherence, compliance, persistence, drug therapy, bisphosphonates, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate. Additional data included bibliographies from identified articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All pertinent English-language articles that discussed adherence issues in patients with osteoporosis were included. Both those that reviewed overall issues of medication adherence in osteoporosis and those that focused specifically on adherence to bisphosphonates were included, as were articles that addressed strategies for overcoming nonadherence.

Data Synthesis

Inadequate diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis result in a higher risk of fractures than is necessary. Even patients who are diagnosed and beginning treatment often do not persist with their osteoporosis medication because they perceive their fracture risk to be low and, given the asymptomatic nature of osteoporosis, do not experience the benefit of symptom reduction after taking the drugs. Factors that affect adherence to osteoporosis therapy include drug costs, adverse effects, dosing frequency, disease education, patient follow-up, and patient involvement in treatment decisions.

Conclusions

By considering and implementing strategies that can improve adherence and persistence, primary care providers and pharmacists (via counseling) may enhance long-term outcomes for patients with osteoporosis.

### Medication adherence in cardiovascular medicine [^39967e0a]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally. While pharmacological advancements have improved the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease, non-adherence to prescribed treatment remains a significant barrier to improved patient outcomes. A variety of strategies to improve medication adherence have been tested in clinical trials, and include the following categories: improving patient education, implementing medication reminders, testing cognitive behavioral interventions, reducing medication costs, utilizing healthcare team members, and streamlining medication dosing regimens. In this review, we describe specific trials within each of these categories and highlight the impact of each on medication adherence. We also examine ongoing trials and future lines of inquiry for improving medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular diseases.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^f43f198a]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Recommendations — antiretroviral treatment (ART) for care and prevention, clinical providers — Offer ART (according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommendations), regardless of patient's CD4 cell count, to treat and prevent HIV-related disease and to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV. When prescribing ART, provide information to ensure that patients understand expected benefits and risks to personal health, expected reduction in HIV transmission risk, need for sustained high adherence to ART, long-term follow-up, and retention in care, importance of committing to initiating or resuming lifelong, uninterrupted ART, hazards of sharing their ART with others, and that use of ART is voluntary and patients can decline ART without risk of being denied medical and social services. For patients who choose to postpone or discontinue treatment, periodically reoffer ART after informing them of the benefits and risks of currently recommended regimens based on experiences of other patients with similar viral load and immune status.

### Providing physicians with feedback on medication adherence for people with chronic diseases taking long-term medication [^3cbf87ac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Poor medication adherence decreases treatment efficacy and worsens clinical outcomes, but average rates of adherence to long-term pharmacological treatments for chronic illnesses are only about 50%. Interventions for improving medication adherence largely focus on patients rather than on physicians; however, the strategies shown to be effective are complex and difficult to implement in clinical practice. There is a need for new care models addressing the problem of medication adherence, integrating this problem into the patient care process. Physicians tend to overestimate how well patients take their medication as prescribed. This can lead to missed opportunities to change medications, solve adverse effects, or propose the use of reminders in order to improve patients' adherence. Thus, providing physicians with feedback on medication adherence has the potential to prompt changes that improve their patients' adherence to prescribed medications.

Objectives

To assess the effects of providing physicians with feedback about their patients' medication adherence for improving adherence. We also assessed the effects of the intervention on patient outcomes, health resource use, and processes of care.

Search Methods

We conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase, all from database inception to December 2016 and without any language restriction. We also searched ISI Web of Science, two trials registers, and grey literature.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies that compared the effects of providing feedback to physicians about their patients' adherence to prescribed long-term medications for chronic diseases versus usual care. We included published or unpublished studies in any language. Participants included any physician and any patient prescribed with long-term medication for chronic disease. We included interventions providing the prescribing physician with information about patient adherence to medication. Only studies in which feedback to the physician was the sole intervention or the essential component of a multifaceted intervention were eligible. In the comparison groups, the physicians should not have had access to information about their patients' adherence to medication. We considered the following outcomes: medication adherence, patient outcomes, health resource use, processes of care, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted and analysed all data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care group. Due to heterogeneity in study methodology, comparison groups, intervention settings, and measurements of outcomes, we did not carry out meta-analysis. We describe the impact of interventions on outcomes in tabular form and make a qualitative assessment of the effects of studies.

Main Results

We included nine studies (23,255 patient participants): eight randomised trials and one interrupted time series analysis. The studies took place in primary care and other outpatient settings in the USA and Canada. Seven interventions involved the systematic provision of feedback to physicians concerning all their patients' adherence to medication, and two interventions involved issuing an alert for non-adherent patients only. Seven studies used pharmacy refill data to assess medication adherence, and two used an electronic device or self-reporting. The definition of adherence differed across studies, making comparisons difficult. Eight studies were at high risk of bias, and one study was at unclear risk of bias. The most frequent source of bias was lack of protection against contamination. Providing physicians with feedback may lead to little or no difference in medication adherence (seven studies, 22,924 patients), patient outcomes (two studies, 1292 patients), or health resource use (two studies, 4181 patients). Providing physicians with feedback on medication adherence may improve processes of care (e.g. more medication changes, dialogue with patient, management of uncontrolled hypertension) compared to usual care (four studies, 2780 patients). None of the studies reported an adverse event due to the intervention. The certainty of evidence was low for all outcomes, mainly due to high risk of bias, high heterogeneity across studies, and indirectness of evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

Across nine studies, we observed little or no evidence that provision of feedback to physicians regarding their patients adherence to prescribed medication improved medication adherence, patient outcomes, or health resource use. Feedback about medication adherence may improve processes of care, but due to the small number of studies assessing this outcome and high risk of bias, we cannot draw firm conclusions on the effect of feedback on this outcome. Future research should use a clear, standardised definition of medication adherence and cluster-randomisation to avoid the risk of contamination.

### Viewpoint: antimicrobial resistance diagnostics use accelerator: qualitative research on adherence to prescriptions [^b26ee7ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Compounding Behavioral Drivers

Beyond knowledge of basic prescription instructions, the research highlighted compounding behavioral drivers that hinder patients' prescription adherence. These are drivers of routine and habit, social norms, and the influence of others. We consider that behavioral drivers could be influenced by knowledge and persuasive communication from the healthcare provider to the patient during prescribing. However, we appreciate that these are unlikely to change deep-seated behaviors and beliefs independently, and complementary interventions are likely needed.

The research findings indicate that many patients stop taking prescribed medicine when they feel better (which, given cost issues described below, may be influenced by a desire to save medicine for later for themselves or others). This is driven by social norms, routines, habits, and a lack of knowledge of the health consequences of their actions. Similarly, driven by habits and social norms, patients halt medication when they experience side effects. However, medication is stopped without understanding which side effects are medically acceptable (meaning they should continue with the drug) and which are more serious (when they should seek further care).

Patients Do Not Take Medicines at the Right Time of Day or Miss Dosages

Forgetfulness is often cited as the reason why the medicine is not taken at the prescribed time. Aids are required, including linking the time of day to take the medication with mealtimes, the position of the sun, or other daily events that happen in the community such as prayer calls/time; written or pictorial instructions for the patient to take home; support from caregivers or family members to give reminders; and the use of watches or phones to set alarms.

Patients report that work or school schedules hinder them from taking medicines at the required times. It is implied that patients consider that they need to be at home to take the medication, which affects minors who require medication while at school/during the school day and thus away from their usual caretaker/parent.

Influence of Others and Preconceived Beliefs

Patients' preconceived beliefs and common religious and cultural practices combine with influence from community leaders to hinder prescription adherence. Religious leaders may advocate for prayer instead of medicine, traditional healers may advocate for the use of traditional medicines, and community members who have, for example, a status of advisor on child health (Burkina Faso) may negatively influence patients' adherence to the prescription. Communication messages try and counter the effects of these alternative treatments or advise simultaneous use.

Antihypertensive medication adherence strategies — synopsis and screening: Studies have documented that up to 50% of patients do not adhere to their antihypertensive medications after 1 year of treatment; adherence to medication can be divided into 3 phases — initiation, persistence or implementation consistent with medication taking, and avoiding permanent discontinuation; contributors to poor adherence include social determinants of health, poor health literacy, stress, anxiety, and depression; once nonadherence is identified, clinicians must work with patients to identify barriers in a nonjudgmental manner and create a plan that includes patient preferences and shared decision-making; patients with identified nonadherence should be screened for stress, anxiety, and depression with valid and reliable scales, and screening for low health literacy should also be conducted with additional education and resources if identified.

### The impact of adherence and health literacy on difficult-to-control asthma [^e9b8e513]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Medication nonadherence and health literacy are key factors that influence the management of difficult-to-control asthma. Adherence, or the extent to which a patient follows a treatment plan, extends beyond asthma medication use and includes an appropriate inhaler technique. Assessment of adherence is critical before making a diagnosis of severe asthma and stepping up asthma therapy but is challenging in the clinical context. Health literacy, or the degree to which individuals can obtain, process, and understand health information and services needed to make health care decisions, is additionally important for asthma management and has been shown to impact medication adherence. Initiatives aiming to improve difficult-to-control asthma should address medication adherence and health literacy. Universal health literacy precautions are recommended while communicating with patients, in addition to the creation of low health literacy asthma action plans. To improve adherence, a comprehensive assessment of adherence should be conducted. Additional evidence-based interventions aiming to improve adherence focus on appropriate inhaler use, improved access to medications, the use of digital platforms, school-based asthma interventions, and the implementation of culturally tailored interventions. Data are limited regarding the use of these initiatives in patients with severe or difficult-to-control asthma.

### Improving adherence to medical regimens for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [^ed0c5469]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Defining adherence

"Adherence" is now the preferred term in the literature, replacing the term "compliance". The term adherence better reflects a more active role for patients in consenting to and following prescribed treatments. The World Health Organization defines adherence as "the extent to which a person's behavior – taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider". This definition acknowledges that regimens for chronic conditions involve multiple behavioral components, with varying levels of adherence to each component, and that agreement to follow regimens has been secured from the patient. In pediatric rheumatology, agreement to follow prescribed regimens needs to be obtained from caretakers as well as patients.

Another potentially useful distinction in the adherence literature is between inadvertent (non-volitional) and volitional (or intentional) nonadherence. Inadvertent nonadherence may involve patients forgetting to take a medication dose or being away from home without access to medications. Whereas, volitional nonadherence may involve a reasoned and purposeful decision by patients to omit a medication dose, because they are asymptomatic, taking medications that interferes with their lifestyle, or are being defiant. In the case of inadvertent nonadherence, one could help patients problem solve about how to keep track of medication doses (such as using a pill reminder case) and to have medications with them when away from home. In the case of volitional nonadherence, one would need to negotiate with patients and their families to obtain agreement on what they would be willing to do to treat their disease without compromising their quality of life.

Prevalence of nonadherence to regimens for JRA

There are few studies that have specifically addressed adherence to regimens for JRA. Two retrospective studies by Litt and her colleagues examined adherence to salicylate medications in the treatment of JRA. In the first study adherence among 82 patients with JRA was assessed using serum salicylate assays, with patients classified as adherent if their mean salicylate levels over a 19-month period were above 20 mg/dl. Some 55% of adolescents (n = 38) and 55% of children (n = 44) were found to be adherent, In the second study, adherence among 38 adolescents with JRA was assessed using serum salicylate assays obtained over a 12-month period, with patients again classified as adherent if their salicylate levels were greater than 20 mg/dl. Again, 55% of adolescents were adherent.

### A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to help older people adhere to medication regimes [^2cbfdc3a]. Age and Ageing (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Non-adherence is a common cause of treatment failure. The causes and context of non-adherence may differ amongst older people and reviews of interventions to improve adherence have tended to focus on the younger adult population.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of interventions to aid adherence to medication for older people over the age of 65.

Method

Relevant papers identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Review of Effectiveness (Cochrane Library), Medline 1966-October 2002, Embase 1980-October 2002, Best Evidence, PsychINFO 1887-October 2002 and CINAHL 1982-October 2002. These were then hand-searched. The papers that fitted our inclusion criteria were selected. Two independent reviewers using an established tool assessed the studies for methodological quality. A non-statistical narrative approach was then taken to analyse the studies due to the heterogeneity of the outcome measures.

Results

7 studies were identified. They used a variety of approaches involving external cognitive supports and/or educational interventions. Most studies were of poor methodological quality. Statistically significant effects, where present, tended to have small effects clinically.

Conclusions

Currently there is no strong evidence to support the use of any one intervention type. Future research should use combinations of approaches, as there is some evidence that these are more likely to be successful.

### Non-adherence to medication regimens among older African-American adults [^f86895e4]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

It is imperative to mention several limitations of this study. First, this study used a cross-sectional study design which allowed us to collect data at a single point in time. Therefore, it is difficult to draw causal inferences. As a simple example, we documented that participants with a higher level of knowledge about the therapeutic purpose of prescription dosage regimen were almost seven times more likely to adhere to their medication. However, without a longitudinal data and causal identification strategy, it is challenging to prove that this association is a causal relationship. Secondly, older African-American adults who participated in this study were selected from local churches that may be different than non-church attenders and may introduce a selection bias. Third, the assumption is made that participants brought in all of the medication vials that they used within 2 weeks prior to the interviews. Lack of access to participants' medical or pharmacy records limits our ability to validate this assumption. However, several attempts were made prior to the face-to-face interviews to make sure that participants will follow the instructions and bring all their medications with them.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^c03f3349]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) — patient education and counseling should focus on the patient's understanding of the risk of irreversible blindness from glaucoma, the long-term nature of treatment, and the importance of attending follow-up visits despite the lack of visual symptoms. Patient discussions should include open-ended questioning regarding medication use and recommendations by the physician for how to best fit the medication into the patient's life and address any identified barriers, and patient communication, including question/answer discussions, are important with patients who have POAG to remove any barriers regarding medication use, improve their understanding of treatment strategies, and foster an open, approachable relationship with their eye care provider. When clinicians educate patients and assess their views about glaucoma and its treatment, patients report higher medication self-efficacy. Stated considerations include: Potential Benefits — counseling and educating patients may improve adherence to help maintain ocular health and visual function; Potential Risks/Harms — none; Benefits and Harms Assessment — benefits significantly outweigh harms; Potential Costs — direct and indirect costs of counseling and educational services; Value Judgments — none; Role of Patient Preferences — moderate; Intentional Vagueness — none; and Gaps in Evidence — research to identify medication persistence rates in patients with glaucoma at different stages of disease progression.

### Learning from successes: designing medication adherence intervention research so that we can learn what works and why [^b547a129]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Previous research has shown that individually tailored interventions are likely to be effective at changing behaviour, through recognising and addressing the varying barriers people face to medication adherence, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. Tailoring has not always been included in previous pharmacy-based medication adherence interventions. To enable others to learn from effective tailored interventions, studies must include details of the steps and methods used to tailor the intervention, for example, exactly how barriers were identified, and how the selected techniques were implemented. As with any behavioural intervention, it is essential to clearly specify the active ingredients of the behavioural intervention — the behavioural techniques prompting changes in behaviour. A practical and evidence-based way of doing this is with the Behaviour Change Techniques taxonomy, which provides recognised and consistent terminology to describe the behavioural components of an intervention. When reporting tailored interventions, data on the frequency of use of each of the listed intervention options may also inform researchers and practitioners as to the more common barriers in the population. For example, for the Torres-Robles study, it would have been beneficial to know the proportion of participants from each medical condition reporting intentional or non-intentional barriers to adherence, or a combination. Understanding this profile, and how this may change according to condition, age or other demographics, would be valuable to those designing interventions to promote adherence, and assist in suggesting the types of intervention components which may be effective in other populations and settings. Related to this, some aspects of the reported intervention addressed barriers linked to specific conditions (eg, medication techniques, or beliefs about a particular condition), whereas others were related to adherence more generally (eg, forgetfulness). Given the prevalence of multi-morbidity, knowing whether there is an optimum balance between assessing and addressing the general or specific medication barriers would be helpful knowledge. We can only establish this if details, such as the amount each technique was used, are measured and reported.

### Effectiveness of a medication adherence management intervention in a community pharmacy setting: a cluster randomised controlled trial [^c4c610fa]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with chronic conditions rely on medications to treat and control their diseases. However, medication adherence (ie, the process by which patients take their medications as prescribed) is suboptimal. Medication adherence is composed of initiation, implementation and discontinuation. There is evidence that nearly 40% of patients with chronic conditions discontinue their medication after 1 year and 4% never initiate their treatment. Similarly, implementation of the dosing regimen (ie, the extent to which a patient's actual dosing corresponds to the prescribed dosing regimen) has been shown to decline over time. This complex phenomenon is a preventablesource of patient harm and poor health outcomes. It often leads to disease progression, lower quality of life, increased use of healthcare resourcesand increased morbidity and mortality. It accounts for an estimated 125 000 deaths per year in the USA, with annual costs per patient ranging from $949 to $44 190 (US$2015). This problem is especially relevant in chronic conditions such as hypertension, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), three of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases in developed countries, whose prevalence continues to increase. Medication non-adherence rates in these conditions are high, reaching 50% for antihypertensive medicationsand between 20% and 80% for inhaled medications, with 14%–20% patients failing to fill in their first prescription.

Medication adherence interventions have the potential to improve clinical outcomes, patient's health-related quality of lifeand the efficiency of the healthcare system. Long-term multicomponent interventions involving behavioural change theories seem promising at improving adherence, probably because they target multiple determinants. However, previous research has reported a lack of convincing evidence regarding the efficacy of these interventions, mainly due to the wide heterogeneity in settings, participants, intervention types or adherence measures among others. Moreover, there seems to be a paucity of randomised controlled trials reporting an improvement in both adherence and clinical outcomes, despite ethical standards for adherence research dictating that attempts to improve adherence should be judged by their clinical benefits. In this regard, some evidence suggests that community pharmacist-led interventions may enhance both medication adherenceand disease-specific clinical outcomes. However, these usually involve interventions that would be difficult to implement in usual care settings. The development of effective interventions that are implementable in routine practice settings still represents a challenge for quality improvement in patient care.

### Learning from successes: designing medication adherence intervention research so that we can learn what works and why [^c85f7e0e]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

To conclude, testing the effects of adherence interventions on health outcomes is a crucial part of their evaluation. However, conducting in-depth process evaluations are also important if we are to capitalise on the success of effective interventions. This approach may help in identifying which aspects of interventions were critical to their success, and establishing how these can be replicated and scaled up as cost-effectively as possible. In addition, measuring and reporting the views of patients, family carers and healthcare professionals on the tailorability acceptability, accessibility and sustainability of such interventions may inform development of future interventions that are both high impact and scalable, and therefore help address this so far elusive challenge.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^db72e101]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Refractory Helicobacter pylori — adherence considerations and patient guidance: The threshold of adherence above which additional benefit is negligible in refractory infection is not known, but studies indicate that adherence to > 60% to > 90% of the prescribed course might be sufficient for successful eradication in primary infection, and the threshold might plausibly be higher in refractory H pylori. Before therapy is prescribed, barriers to adherence should be explored and addressed and the regimen thoroughly discussed; common barriers include regimen complexity, high pill burden, medication intolerance, poor provider communication, and lack of understanding of the therapy's indication. Providers who treat H pylori infection should provide their patients with anticipatory guidance to help ensure maximum adherence, including the rationale for therapy, dosing instructions, expected adverse events, and the importance of completing the full therapeutic course (BPA #3). Two recent large randomized controlled trials from China demonstrated that an interactive smartphone medical application and text-based reminders during treatment improved adherence to primary therapy.

### Medication adherence (October 2015) [^e38f7ee8]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Poor medication adherence can interfere with the ability to treat many diseases, leading to greater complications and a lower quality of life. FDA Drug Info Rounds Pharmacists discuss strategies pharmacists can use to help patients break through common barriers to medication adherence. Host: Captain Catherine Chew Pharmacist: Dr. Sonia Kim. CAPT Chew: Medication adherence, or taking medications correctly, is generally defined as the extent to which patients take medication as prescribed by their health care provider. This involves factors such as getting prescriptions filled, remembering to take medication on time, and understanding the directions. Hi, I'm Captain Catherine Chew and this is Drug Info Rounds, brought to you by the pharmacists in FDA's Division of Drug Information. I'm joined by Dr. Sonia Kim, who has some background information on why medication adherence is so important. Dr.

Kim: Poor medication adherence can interfere with the ability to treat many diseases, leading to greater complications and a lower quality of life. Common barriers to medication adherence include: the inability to pay for medications disbelief that the treatment is necessary or helping difficulty keeping up with multiple medications and complex dosing schedules confusion about how and when to take the medication). As pharmacists we have a responsibility to help our patients break through these barriers. One of the best strategies is asking questions. Ask your patient to discuss any side effects or problems they are having. Explain that you can't help find solutions to problems you don't know exist. Open and honest communication with your patients is a critical and sometimes overlooked step in achieving medication adherence. CAPT Chew: There are some specific strategies pharmacists can teach their patients to simplify even complex regimens. Dr.

Kim: Setting daily routines is one strategy. It can be helpful to connect taking medication with daily activities, such as eating meals or going to bed. Using daily dosing containers that have the time and day of the week can also be useful. Pharmacists should be familiar with the dosing containers sold where they work. CAPT Chew: We must remind patients that with high medication adherence
- they can take charge of their health and their future. If you have questions about medication adherence, call or email FDA's Division of Drug Information.

### Learning from successes: designing medication adherence intervention research so that we can learn what works and why [^14a2c6a2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

The study has some important limitations, including the use of self-report rather than objective adherence measures. However, there is no gold standard for the measurement of medication adherence, and self-report measures correlate well with electronic monitoring devices. A further important limitation is that measurement of outcomes did not continue past the end of the intervention — it is therefore not known whether the improved adherence can be expected to be sustained after the intervention has finished. Previous research has suggested that adherence interventions may need to be continued long term for some patients to achieve sustained effects on adherence. Notwithstanding these limitations, the demonstration of a positive intervention effect over the relatively long term, and in disease outcomes in addition to adherence, is highly promising. The key questions are: what can we learn from this study and other adherence interventions in terms of how to effectively increase medication adherence in a scalable and sustainable way? And what makes such interventions successful, and how can they be applied to other populations and conditions to improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs associated with poor adherence?

In order to answer these important questions, it is crucial to be able to identify which specific aspects of effective interventions lead to their success. For example, in Torres-Robles and colleagues' studywas it the tailored and protocoled intervention process supporting participants with appropriate behavioural techniques needed for change in behaviour, the application of theory through the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change, participants having attention from multiple individual face-to-face sessions, or expert intervention delivery specifically by community pharmacists? Alternatively, is the whole intervention required to be carried out, as in the trial, to achieve these results? When reporting trial findings, inclusion of some process evaluation approaches may shed light on which aspects contribute most to the improvements seen. Key factors to consider when doing a process evaluation of a medication adherence intervention include tailorability, acceptability, scalability and sustainability.
