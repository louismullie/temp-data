## Question

Tympanic membrane rupture healing time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tympanic membrane rupture healing time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions, including acute versus chronic perforations and traumatic versus infectious etiologies. Then, I should verify spontaneous healing timelines from observational cohorts. Next, I will examine how interventions modify healing time, especially bFGF, EGF, ofloxacin, and patching strategies. After that, I need to consider prognostic factors that delay or accelerate healing. Finally, I will synthesize practical timelines and counseling points, while double-checking the strength and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions, because healing expectations differ substantially between acute traumatic perforations, chronic perforations, and those arising from otitis media or tympanostomy tubes. Acute traumatic perforations generally heal spontaneously, whereas chronic perforations often persist without intervention, and tympanostomy tube–related perforations have their own natural history and risk profile, so I need to keep these buckets distinct as I interpret data [^e0620539] [^d5b8bb98].

> I will now examine spontaneous healing timelines in acute traumatic perforations, since that is the most common scenario in general practice. In a large retrospective series of 504 traumatic perforations, 89% closed spontaneously with a mean closure time of 27.4 days, and importantly, small perforations closed faster than large ones, with mean times of 22.8 days versus 47.3 days, respectively, which is a clinically meaningful difference I should emphasize [^b94bd284]. Wait, let me verify consistency across studies: another series of 80 traumatic cases reported spontaneous healing in most patients with a mean follow-up of 6.2 weeks, aligning with the 3–4 week window seen elsewhere, and all children in that cohort healed spontaneously, which supports counseling that pediatric traumatic perforations often resolve without intervention [^bf9ee897].

> Next, I should review how interventions modify healing time, starting with basic fibroblast growth factor. Multiple meta-analyses and RCTs show bFGF shortens healing time by roughly 2–3 weeks compared with observation, with pooled standardized mean differences around −5.89 and absolute mean closure times often near 10–15 days in treated groups versus 25–48 days in controls, though heterogeneity is high and many studies are Asian cohorts, so I need to be cautious about generalizability while acknowledging the consistent direction of benefit [^e683b6e8] [^2c5f9020] [^23609c02]. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies to large perforations too; subgroup analyses suggest benefit persists even in larger defects, though effect sizes vary and some studies combine bFGF with patches, which complicates attribution [^2c5f9020] [^375eb7c7].

> Let me consider epidermal growth factor next, because several clinical studies suggest acceleration of closure with topical EGF. In a randomized study of large traumatic perforations, EGF reduced mean closure time to about 11 days versus 25–26 days with observation, with higher closure rates, and similar benefits have been shown in subacute perforations, though otorrhea can occur and requires counseling on moisture control and follow-up [^6c0594ca] [^2d1cde98]. I should double-check that these effects are not just surrogate endpoints; yes, closure times and rates consistently improve across studies, supporting clinical relevance when available [^6c0594ca] [^2d1cde98].

> Ofloxacin ear drops deserve separate attention because they are non-ototoxic and may both reduce infection risk and accelerate healing. A 2024 meta-analysis of six RCTs found a mean reduction in healing time of about 18 days and improved closure rates versus observation, with no signal for increased hearing loss or infection, which makes ofloxacin a pragmatic first-line adjunct when infection risk is present or when a simple, safe intervention is desired [^bb282296]. But wait, what if the perforation is dry and uninfected? Even then, ofloxacin has shown faster closure than observation in large traumatic perforations, suggesting a direct facilitative effect on healing beyond infection control, though mechanism remains uncertain [^8f8686c7].

> I need to check patching strategies as well, since paper or gelfoam patching is commonly used. Early paper patching has been associated with modest improvements in closure rates and faster symptomatic recovery compared with observation, and gelfoam or steri-strip patches can shorten healing time, albeit with occasional otorrhea, so patient selection and technique matter [^f02af0c4] [^bd98abdf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some studies are small and nonrandomized, so I should frame patching as reasonable when patients desire faster recovery or when edges are inverted or unstable, while acknowledging that spontaneous healing remains high without intervention [^f02af0c4] [^b94bd284].

> Now, I should review prognostic factors that modify healing time, because counseling is more precise when I can stratify risk. Larger perforation size consistently prolongs healing and lowers spontaneous closure rates, malleus or umbo involvement delays closure even if the ultimate closure rate is similar, and preexisting myringosclerosis or calcification impairs healing and predicts failure with growth factor therapies, so I need to set expectations accordingly and consider earlier intervention in these scenarios [^b94bd284] [^8360f91c]. Let me verify edge characteristics: outward epithelial migration at the perforation margin can prolong healing unless it transitions to centripetal migration, which explains why some perforations appear to "stall" before closing, and late crust formation at the margin is associated with delayed healing, which I should watch for on follow-up [^129f142c] [^2f6af8e2].

> I should confirm pediatric nuances, because age affects both spontaneous closure likelihood and time. In children, traumatic perforations almost universally heal spontaneously, and in a large pediatric cohort, 90% closed by 2.5 years in those diagnosed before age 7, whereas older children had lower closure rates, reinforcing that watchful waiting is appropriate for months in many pediatric cases unless there are risk factors for nonhealing [^bf9ee897] [^ad0e9a4d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 2.5-year figure applied to acute traumatic cases, but that study actually addressed chronic perforations and tube-related perforations, so I should correct myself: the 2.5-year benchmark pertains to chronic pediatric perforations, not acute traumatic ones, which typically close within weeks [^ad0e9a4d] [^b94bd284].

> Next, I should review chronic perforations and tympanostomy tube–related perforations, because healing expectations differ. Chronic perforations have lower spontaneous closure rates and often require surgical repair, though growth factor–based regeneration therapies show promise with closure rates around 66–90% in selected series, and persistent perforations after tube extrusion occur in roughly 1–3% with short-term tubes and up to 20% with long-term tubes, with most persistent holes amenable to outpatient repair [^8360f91c] [^0306c2c8] [^d5b8bb98]. Hold on, I should verify that these regeneration data are not overgeneralized; they derive from specific protocols and patient selections, so candidacy and local expertise matter when considering these alternatives to tympanoplasty [^8360f91c] [^0306c2c8].

> Let me synthesize practical timelines while keeping the strength of evidence in mind. For small acute traumatic perforations, expect spontaneous closure in about 2–4 weeks in most patients, with a range of 2–6 weeks depending on size and edge factors, and counsel on water precautions and follow-up otoscopy to confirm progression [^b94bd284]. For larger traumatic perforations, spontaneous healing may take 4–8 weeks or longer, and the failure rate is higher, so offering bFGF, EGF, ofloxacin, or patching can reasonably shorten healing to roughly 10–20 days in many cases, with the caveat that some data are heterogeneous and not universally generalizable [^b94bd284] [^e683b6e8] [^6c0594ca] [^bb282296]. For chronic perforations, spontaneous closure is unlikely beyond 3–6 months, and surgical repair or growth factor–based regeneration should be considered, with tympanoplasty success rates typically 80–90% in experienced hands [^8360f91c] [^c133d38c].

> I should double-check safety and counseling points so I do not overstate benefits. bFGF and EGF appear safe in clinical studies with minimal adverse effects beyond occasional otorrhea, ofloxacin is non-ototoxic and appropriate when infection risk exists or when a simple, low-cost intervention is desired, and water precautions remain prudent until the membrane is confirmed closed to reduce infection and edge trauma risks [^e683b6e8] [^bb282296] [^e999f581]. But wait, what if the patient is using topical drops already? I need to ensure non-ototoxic agents are selected when the tympanic membrane is nonintact, avoiding aminoglycosides and alcohol-containing preparations, and I should reassess at 2–4 weeks to confirm healing trajectory and pivot to procedural options if stalled [^e999f581] [^7cd32554].

> In summary, I should confirm the key takeaways: most acute traumatic tympanic membrane perforations heal spontaneously within 2–6 weeks, with size being the strongest predictor of time and likelihood. Targeted interventions such as bFGF, EGF, ofloxacin, or patching can accelerate closure by 1–3 weeks in appropriate candidates. Chronic or tube-related perforations have different natural histories and often require procedural management. And careful follow-up with otoscopy at 2–4 weeks allows timely escalation if healing lags, aligning expectations with the best available evidence [^b94bd284] [^e683b6e8] [^6c0594ca] [^bb282296] [^d5b8bb98].

---

Tympanic membrane rupture typically heals spontaneously within **2–8 weeks** [^b94bd284], with most traumatic perforations closing by 4 weeks [^bf9ee897]. Healing is slower for **larger perforations** [^b94bd284], marginal or anterior lesions, malleus involvement [^b05f2124], chronic or infected ears, and in older adults [^notfound]. Interventions such as bFGF [^e683b6e8], EGF [^6c0594ca], or ofloxacin drops [^bb282296] can accelerate closure to about 10–14 days, while paper patching offers modest benefit [^f02af0c4]. Persistent perforations beyond 3 months are uncommon but may require surgical repair [^notfound].

---

## Average healing time

- **Spontaneous healing**: 2–8 weeks for most traumatic perforations; mean ~27 days [^b94bd284].
- **Large perforations**: 4–8 weeks or longer, especially if > 50% of the TM [^b94bd284].
- **Small perforations**: often heal within 2–4 weeks [^b94bd284].

---

## Factors influencing healing time

Several factors **significantly affect healing time**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on healing time** |
|-|-|
| Perforation size | Larger perforations heal more slowly [^b94bd284] |
| Location | Marginal or anterior perforations heal more slowly [^notfound] |
| Cause | Traumatic perforations heal faster than chronic or infected perforations [^notfound] |
| Age | Older patients heal more slowly [^notfound] |
| Malleus involvement | Prolongs healing [^b05f2124] |
| Edge characteristics | Inverted or curled edges delay healing [^notfound] |
| Infection | Prolongs healing [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical interventions and their impact on healing time

Several interventions can **accelerate healing**:

- **bFGF**: Shortens healing to ~10–15 days; closure rates 89–100% [^e683b6e8] [^2c5f9020].
- **EGF**: Reduces closure time to ~10–14 days [^6c0594ca] [^2d1cde98].
- **Ofloxacin drops**: Shortens healing to ~10–14 days, especially with infection risk [^bb282296] [^8f8686c7].
- **Paper patching**: Modest acceleration; closure rates ~90% at 6 weeks [^f02af0c4].

---

## Complications delaying healing

Certain complications can **prolong or impair healing**:

- **Infection**: Chronic suppurative otitis media or persistent otorrhea delays closure [^notfound].
- **Myringosclerosis**: Calcification of the TM impairs healing [^8360f91c].
- **Cholesteatoma**: Epithelial ingrowth prevents closure [^notfound].
- **Persistent perforation**: Occurs in ~10% of traumatic cases, often requiring surgery [^notfound].

---

## When to consider surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated if the perforation **persists beyond 3 months** [^notfound], is **large or marginal**, or is associated with chronic infection, cholesteatoma, or significant hearing loss. Tympanoplasty achieves closure rates of 80–95% [^c133d38c].

---

## Patient-specific counseling

Patients should be counseled that **most perforations heal within 2–8 weeks** [^b94bd284]; larger defects, marginal location, infection, or older age may delay healing. Water precautions, infection prevention, and follow-up otoscopy are essential; persistent perforations beyond 3 months warrant ENT evaluation for possible surgical repair [^notfound].

---

Tympanic membrane rupture usually heals spontaneously within **2–8 weeks** [^b94bd284], with size, location, cause, age, and infection as key modifiers. Selected interventions can accelerate closure, and persistent defects may need surgery [^e683b6e8] [^c133d38c].

RESULTS

Characteristics of the Studies

Of the 91 studies identified, a total of 14 studies with 1,072 patients were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of seven RCTs and seven non-RCTs (,–). The included studies were published between 2003 and 2018, with a range of follow-up time from 3 to 12 months. Perforations in three studies were chronic due to various causes, while perforations in the other studies were caused by trauma. All studies reported the closure rates (,–); only eight studies reported the healing time. Six studies provided the outcomes of hearing. The characteristics and statistics of the selected documents were summarized in Table 1. The detailed information of the bFGF application in each study was also summarized in Supplemental Table 1, including composition, manufacturer, concentration, doses, frequency, and duration.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 12 (StataCorp LP, Texas City, TX) and Review Manager version 5.3. Closure rates are expressed as odds radio (OR), while healing times and hearing improvement are reported as the standardized mean difference (SMD). Moreover, the I 2 statistic was applied to assess heterogeneity, with an I 2 value of 25, 50, and 75% indicating a low, moderate, and high heterogeneity respectively. All data were dropped into the pool with suitable statistical models. The subgroup analysis was also continued considering that the perforation size has been reported to be associated with healing time. We divided the studies into three subgroups based on the patients' perforation size, as: large perforation (> 50% of the TM); small perforation (< 50% of the TM); and unknown size (size of the TM perforation unspecified in the studies) for the outcomes of the healing time. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure reliability of the results by excluding one outlying study. Funnel plots were used to examine publication bias. In addition, Begg's tests were used to quantitatively assess publication bias. To further examine the possible effect of publication bias, the trim-and-fill method also was used in our analyses. All p values were two sided, with p < 0.05 being considered as statistically significant.

### Late crust formation as a predictor of healing of traumatic, dry, and minor-sized tympanic membrane perforations [^2f6af8e2]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of crust formation on the healing of traumatic, dry, and minor-sized tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) in humans.

Study Design

Case series with a chart review.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Materials and Methods

The clinical records of patients with traumatic TMPs who met the case selection criteria were retrieved and categorized according to the presence of a crust and the timing of crust formation into three groups: no crust, early crust formation, and late crust formation. Healing outcomes (i.e., healing rate and time) in the three groups were analyzed.

Results

In total, 83 patients were analyzed. The perforation closure rates were 92%, 100%, and 78% in the groups with no-crust, early crust formation, and late crust formation, respectively. No significant difference was seen between the groups with no-crust and with late crust formation (p > 0.05). By contrast, closure rates differed significantly between the early and late crust formation groups (p < 0.05). Overall, the no-crust and early crust formation groups showed shorter healing times compared with the late crust formation group (p < 0.05). However, closure times did not differ significantly between groups with early crust formation and no crust (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Crust formation at the margin of a traumatic TMP may serve as a predictor of healing outcome. Compared with perforations with early crust formation or no crust, late crust formation can result in delayed healing and failure to close completely.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^88de732d]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This meta-analysis has identified that the application of bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate as well as shorten healing time for the TM regeneration. There is no evidence, as assessed only from studies of acute perforations, to show that bFGF improves hearing. Given its ease, availability and safety, bFGF can be used effectively for the TM repair. Additional high-quality multi-center randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further support its efficacy in different ethnic groups especially with chronic TM perforations.

### Cellular dynamics in early healing of mouse tympanic membranes [^e1722b4e]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To better elucidate the cellular dynamics by which perforations in the tympanic membrane (TM) are healed.

Background

Under normal conditions, epidermal cells are born and then migrate radially outward from the malleus in the TM. It is unknown what the relative contribution of newly proliferated cells from different lineages is in the healing of TM perforations.

Methods

Thirty-six female mice were used in this study. Ethynyl deoxyuridine, a thymidine analogue that labels newly proliferated cells, was injected intraperitoneally into each mouse and then subsequently supplied in the drinking water. Acute perforations were performed on the right TM and the left TM served as the control and remained intact. The animals were sacrificed at six time points between 2hours and 6 days. We stained for proliferative, epithelial, mesenchymal markers, and ethynyl deoxyuridine and analyzed the distribution of cells.

Results

In control TMs, newly proliferated cells were detected around the malleus handle and then migrated radially outward. Perforated TMs had a significantly higher number of newly proliferated cells throughout the tympanic membrane with a marked proliferative response of epithelial, mesenchymal, and mucosal cells in the region of the malleus and perforation. The majority of cells in the healed perforation were newly proliferated. In the anterior TM opposite the perforation, an increased turnover of keratinocytes was noted, but not mesenchymal cells.

Conclusions

Perforation of the TM alters the cellular dynamics throughout the entire TM, rather than simply adjacent to the perforation. This argues for long distance signaling occurring in the perforated TM.

### The effect of using ofloxacin ear drops in traumatic tympanic membrane healing: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bb282296]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of ofloxacin ear drops versus no intervention in the repair of traumatic tympanic membrane (TM) perforations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data Sources: Medline/PubMed, CENTRAL, Clinical Trials. Gov, and Google Scholar. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria: (1) English language; (2) RCT studies; (3) reported the outcomes on the application of ofloxacin and outcomes of spontaneous healing. Exclusion criteria: (1) studies without a control group; (2) patient with severe otologic disease such as chronic suppurative otitis media or ossicular disruption or patients with craniocerebral injury; (3) studies with no pretreatment values or single-arm clinical studies. Data Extraction: Country, year of publication, number of participants in each arm, patient characteristics such as age, sex, intervention details, laterality, cause of TM perforation, position of perforation, follow-up time, hearing gain, rate of TM closure, and closure time. Results: A total of 6 RCTs studies were analyzed. A total of 502 participants were included; the relative risk for closure rate of ofloxacin treatment was 1.18 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08 to 1.28, P < .001] and the mean difference (MD) for healing time was -18.4 (95% CI, -19.96 to -16.82, P < .001), suggesting ofloxacin has a significant effect on closure of TM perforations. However, no clinically significant effect in hearing (SMD: 0.21, 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.40, P = 0.03) was seen in ofloxacin group. Also, patients in the ofloxacin group were associated with a 13% reduction in the risk of infections compared to their observation-assigned counterparts, but this estimate was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Ofloxacin use in patients with traumatic TM perforation is effective in reducing healing time and increasing rate of TM perforation closure. No evidence of increased risk of hearing loss or infection rates are encountered when ofloxacin is prescribed to patients with traumatic TM perforation.

### Natural history of pediatric tympanic membrane perforation [^ad0e9a4d]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the natural history of pediatric tympanic membrane perforation using an existing clinical database, with the aim of defining the time beyond which a perforation is unlikely to close naturally.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary center.

Patients and Interventions

A database of pediatric ear, nose, throat, and audiology consultations containing 20 years of data was analyzed. A total of 2865 episodes of perforation were followed, with all cases of surgical reconstruction excluded. Cases of perforation after ventilation tube extrusion were tagged. Statistical techniques including survival analysis were used.

Main Outcome Measures

Time from diagnosis of perforation to diagnosis of closure, in years.

Results

There was a predominance of perforations in boys (59.1% versus 40.9%). Time to closure increased by 7% for each 1-year increase in age at diagnosis. Time-to-closure curves for children older than 12 years diverged considerably from those for younger children after approximately 18 months. Centiles of time to closure were calculated for each 1-year age band. After 2.5 years of follow-up, rates of closure were 90% in children diagnosed younger than 7 years and 75% in children diagnosed between the age of 7 and 12 years. No significant difference was found in time to closure between boys and girls, left-sided and right-sided perforations, or in ventilation tube-related perforations and others. Comparison of membranes suffering a first perforation with those suffering a second perforation suggested a borderline significant time-to-closure disadvantage for first perforations.

Conclusion

When faced with the clinical question of what period of watchful waiting would be appropriate in monitoring a perforated tympanic membrane, before intervention may reasonably be recommended; there seems to be little advantage in waiting longer than 2.5 years.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e683b6e8]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To investigate the effectiveness of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) versus placebo or no intervention in the treatment of tympanic membrane (TM) perforations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies.

Data Sources:

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were screened from their inceptions to June 2019.

Study Selection:

Inclusion criteria: 1) English language; 2) observational (retrospective or prospective) or treatment (RCT) studies; 3) reported the outcomes on the application of bFGF in adult or pediatric population. Exclusion criteria: 1) studies without a control group; 2) animal studies, in vitro studies, review studies, and case reports.

Data Extraction:

Number of patients, cause of TM perforation, perforation size, treatment, mean age, follow-up time, sex, closure rate, healing time, mean air-bone gap improvement.

Data Synthesis:

A total of 14 studies were included, including seven RCTs and seven non-RCTs with a total of 1,072 participants. The odds ratio for closure rate of bFGF treatment was 7.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.65 to 11.53; p < 0.01; I² = 44%) and the standardized mean difference (SMD) for healing time was –5.89 (95% CI: –7.85 to –3.93, p < 0.01, I² = 98%), suggesting bFGF application has a significant effect on closure of TM perforations. However, no significant change in hearing (SMD: 0.08, 95% CI: –0.11 to 0.27, p = 0.39, I² = 0%) was seen as a result of bFGF treatment.

Conclusions:

Our meta-analysis has revealed that the application of bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate as well as shorten the healing time for TM perforations. In terms of hearing, there is as yet no evidence that bFGF has a significant effect. Given its ease, availability, and safety, bFGF can be used effectively for TM repair.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

After searching, the 91 articles were independently evaluated by two authors (J.H. and B.M.T.) with the following inclusion criteria: 1) observational (retrospective or prospective) or treatment (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) studies; 2) studies that reported the outcomes on the application of bFGF in adult or pediatric populations. Studies without a control group were excluded. Animal studies, in vitro studies, review studies, and case reports were excluded as well. A third author (Y.S.) was available when any disagreement presented between these two authors. A total of 14 studies were selected for further analysis from the 91 studies through screening the abstract and full texts. Subsequently, the quality of the included studies was judged according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias through Review Manager 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) (Fig. 2).

FIG. 2
Risk of bias summary for enrolled studies. Green, yellow, and red circles indicate a low, unclear, and high risk of bias, respectively.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was the complete closure rate in the bFGF treatment group versus the complete closure rate in the control group. The secondary outcomes were the differences in healing time and improvement in hearing. The following data was taken or derived from the full report of the 14 studies for both the treatment and control groups: 1) number of subjects, 2) percentage closure, 3) mean and standard deviation (SD) of closure time in days, 4) mean and SD of four frequency (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) average of air-conduction threshold in decibels (dB) obtained via standard pure-tone audiometric testing. Also recorded were 1) first author, 2) year of publication, 3) the study design (RCT or non-RCT), and 4) size of perforation targeted by the study.

Effect of bFGF on Healing Time in Acute TM Perforations

Eight studies reported the healing time, however, one of them was excluded due to different reporting methods for results compared with the others. The seven studies, all with acute TM perforations, had a total number of 524 participants. The average closure time ranged from 10.4 to 15.7 days in the bFGF groups and 24.8 to 48.2 days in the control groups. Overall, healing times were significantly shorter for the bFGF group compared with control group (SMD = –5.89; 95% CI: –7.85 to –3.93, p < 0.01) but showed high heterogeneity (I 2 = 98%).

The forest plot showed a random effects meta-analysis for the difference in healing time after the bFGF treatment among these studies (Fig. 4). The healing times in the large perforations (SMD = –7.01; 95% CI: –7.96 to –6.06, p < 0.01, I² = 0%), small perforations (SMD = –11.53; 95% CI: –20.92 to –2.14, p = 0.02, I² = 98%), and perforation of unknown size (SMD = –1.50; 95% CI: –1.84 to –1.77, p < 0.01, I² = 18%) were in each case statistically shorter in the bFGF group compared with the control group. Large perforations and perforations of unknown size were not sources of heterogeneity; instead small perforations may account for the heterogeneity (p < 0.01). Sensitivity analysis reflected the reliability of these outcomes.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) versus placebo or no intervention in the treatment of tympanic membrane (TM) perforations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were screened from their inceptions to June 2019.

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria: 1) English language; 2) observational (retrospective or prospective) or treatment (RCT) studies; 3) reported the outcomes on the application of bFGF in adult or pediatric population.

Exclusion Criteria

1) studies without a control group; 2) animal studies, in vitro studies, review studies, and case reports.

Data Extraction

Number of patients, cause of TM perforation, perforation size, treatment, mean age, follow-up time, sex, closure rate, healing time, mean air-bone gap improvement.

Data Synthesis

A total of 14 studies were included, including seven RCTs and seven non-RCTs with a total of 1,072 participants. The odds ratio for closure rate of bFGF treatment was 7.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.65 to 11.53; p < 0.01; I = 44%) and the standardized mean difference (SMD) for healing time was -5.89 (95% CI: -7.85 to -3.93, p < 0.01, I = 98%), suggesting bFGF application has a significant effect on closure of TM perforations. However, no significant change in hearing (SMD: 0.08, 95% CI: -0.11 to 0.27, p = 0.39, I = 0%) was seen as a result of bFGF treatment.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis has revealed that the application of bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate as well as shorten the healing time for TM perforations. In terms of hearing, there is as yet no evidence that bFGF has a significant effect. Given its ease, availability, and safety, bFGF can be used effectively for TM repair.

### Achieving a successful closure of an anterior tympanic membrane perforation: evidence-based systematic review [^2fbf9b05]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives Surgical repair of a tympanic membrane perforation is a common otologic procedure. However, achieving a successful closure can be challenging, especially if the anterior margin of the tympanic membrane is involved. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on evidence published in closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations. Data Sources The following data sources were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1997 to August, 3 2017), MEDLINE (February 1948 to August 3, 2017), and Embase (1975 to August 3, 2017). Data Extraction Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed. For the purpose of this study, the inclusion criteria were as follows; (1) studies reporting surgical technique for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations, (2) primary cases only, (3) articles published in the English language, (4) minimum 6-month follow-up, and (5) recorded pre- and postoperative audiometry. The exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, revision surgery, and no audiometric outcomes. Results On initial search, a total of 181 articles were identified (PubMed, n = 136; Cochrane, n = 28; Embase, n = 17). Based on the criteria, 136 articles were excluded. Full text of 45 articles was reviewed, and a further 24 articles were excluded. A total of 21 articles fulfilled the criteria for study inclusion. Conclusions All published evidence is level 4. High-quality controlled studies are required to determine the most effective method for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforation.

### Traumatic tympanic membrane perforations: a study of etiology and factors affecting outcome [^b94bd284]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this study were to determine the factors involved in the spontaneous healing and to profile the various etiologies of traumatic tympanic membrane (TM) perforation.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed on 729 cases of traumatic TM perforation diagnosed in the emergency department and outpatient clinic from January 2007 to March 2011.

Results

A total 641 patients with traumatic TM perforations were enrolled in the study. The group consisted of 320 male and 321 female patients with a mean age of 33.6 years (3–79 years). The types of trauma included compression injury (554 patients), blast injury (55 patients), and instrumental injury (32 patients). The causes of conflict by a slap or a fist were spouse or lover (52%), parents and sibling (3%), school teachers (4%), schoolmate (12%), state police and prisoner (7%), and blow against the ear during street fight (22%). Of the 641, 137 were lost during follow-up; of the remaining 504, perforations closed spontaneously in 451 (89%), within a mean of 27.4 days. Wet perforations with bloody or watery discharge significantly improved the healing rate (P < .01) and shortened the average perforation closure time (P < .01), as compared with dry perforations. Although the perforation that involved malleus or umbo damage did not significantly affect the healing rate (P > .05), a significantly prolonged closure time (41.6 vs 23.8 days) was observed as compared with no damage. However, the curled edges did not also affect the outcome of spontaneous healing; the healing rate was 91% and 88% (P > .05), and the average closure time was 28.1 and 26.7 days (P > .05), respectively, for with and without curler edges. By perforation size, the overall healing rate was 92% and 54% (P < .01), and the average closure time was 22.8 and 47.3 days (P < .01), respectively, for small and larger perforations. Moreover, 7 patients had neomembrane formation on follow-up, 2 developed cholesteatoma, 1 developed tympanosclerosis, and 1 developed facial paralysis.

Conclusion

In our experience, domestic violence and street fight were the most common causes of the traumatic TM perforation. Traumatic TM perforations have excellent prognosis. However, preexisting tympanosclerosis and the perforation that involved malleus or umbo damage could lengthen the healing time of perforation, Wet perforations with bloody or watery discharge accelerate the healing, but the curled edges did not affect the outcome of spontaneous healing.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^99a5858c]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning injury — ear and audiovestibular effects include tympanic membrane (TM) rupture and transient sensorineural deafness, with TM rupture present in more than 60% in one case series (12 of 18 victims). Uncomplicated TM rupture usually heals spontaneously and can be managed conservatively, but otorrhea may signal basilar skull fracture, and current through the temporal bone can cause microhemorrhages and microfractures resulting in permanent hearing loss. Initial evaluation for TM integrity is necessary in all lightning strike victims, and follow-up with an otolaryngologist is essential for victims with hearing loss (Recommendation grade: 1C).

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^23609c02]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, a major limitation is that only studies conducted in Japan and China fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. In fact, a majority of the included studies was reported by Lou's group in China. Specifically, six randomized controlled trials (RCT) and four prospective studies among Lou's studies. Only one study published in 2011 is a retrospective study. It is unclear whether these patients included were individual or overlapped patients, which may lead to selection bias. If this represents overlapped patients, it would significantly skew the results of our analysis. Moreover, there may be potential biases due to ethnic and genetic differences among Asians as compared with other ethnic groups. Secondly, our analysis is based on only 14 clinical controlled studies. Though most of them were published recently, the sample size is relatively small. Thirdly, the majority of studies enrolled focused on the efficacy of bFGF in cases of acute or traumatic TM perforation. Only three studies evaluated the closure rate of bFGF in chronic TM perforation. These studies did not report healing time and hearing improvement, thus limiting our analysis. Therefore, well-designed RCTs studies, which focus on chronic TM perforation with larger sample populations without any patching materials are warranted.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e897706b]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

TM perforations lead to significant morbidities and lifestyle limitations. Although acute TM perforations tend to heal spontaneously, the long-term healing results are suboptimal. For chronic TM perforations, surgeries using fascia or cartilage autografts are common practice. However, all of these autografts have their own limitations; an ideal graft material is yet to be identified. Moreover, patients who undergo surgeries undertake the risks of general anesthesia, high medical costs, surgical complications, and loss of productivity. Hence, various alternatives have been explored to promote TM regeneration. Previous researches indicate that bFGF is a safe, convenient and effective treatment for TM repair. However, the majority studies are outcome-based and subjective in nature. In this study, we have used quantitative meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of bFGF for TM repair. To our knowledge, this meta-analysis is the first of its kind.

Closure rate serves as the fundamental importance in the evaluation of TM regeneration. The success rates of bFGF application have been reported to be as high as 89.3 to 100% and 83 to 98.1% in acute and chronic TM perforations respectively. Our analysis supports previous findings that bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate of TM perforations. Given that some clinical trials are non-controlled, we only included studies with control group for this current study. Closure rate in our review ranged from 89 to 100% with the application of bFGF. A meta-analysis of pooled results further demonstrated that bFGF has a statistically significant effect on closure rates of perforated TMs.

Similarly, our results support the current trends in the literature indicating that bFGF significantly shortens the perforation closure time. However, we could only include data for acute perforations. Based on our study, the SMD value for the closure time was –5.89, demonstrating a large and statistically significant effect size. This is clinically relevant, since earlier closure reduces morbidities, costs associated with follow up reviews and audiology, as well as quicker return to sporting activities and fewer precautions required to prevent water entering the ear canal. Lou et al. reported that closure time was around 2 weeks in patients with traumatic TM perforation following bFGF treatment based on 11 clinical studies. In our study, subgroup analysis showed that those studies with small perforations (< 50% of the TM) accounted for high heterogeneity, which may be due to the small sample size and insufficient trials.

### Analysis of the effectiveness of basic fibroblast growth factor treatment on traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane at different time points [^1468f1cc]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) treatment on traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane at different time points.

Research Design

This is a prospective clinical study.

Methods

Patients with traumatic perforations of the tympanic membrane were given a treatment of gelatin sponge + bFGF at different time intervals of 3 days, 4 to 7 days, 8 to 15 days, and more than 4 weeks after the injury. Healing rate and time of perforation were also observed after 1 month.

Results

In 147 ears, 144 (98.0%) were healed. The perforation healing rates were 98.6%, 97.6%, 96.3%, and 100%, respectively, at the following time intervals: within 3 days, 4 to 7 days, 8 to 14 days, and 2 to 4 weeks since the injury. This was quite true without any significant difference (P > .05). Meanwhile, in the small perforation healing of 120 ears, the average healing times from admission to perforation within 3 days, 4 to 7 days, and 8 to 14 days after the injury were 7.95 ± 2.07, 6.75 ± 2.67, and 4.18 ± 0.91 days, respectively. No significant difference was found among the 3 groups (P(1) < .01).

Conclusion

Treating traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane using the bFGF technique at different times of admissions is quite effective.

### Assessment and spontaneous healing outcomes of traumatic eardrum perforation with bleeding [^dbccc62f]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This study investigated the influence of the degree of bleeding from the remnant eardrum on the spontaneous healing of human traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Study Design

A case series with chart review.

Setting

A tertiary university hospital.

Materials and Methods

The clinical records of traumatic TMP patients who met the case selection criteria were retrieved and categorized into two groups based on the documented degree of bleeding from the remnant eardrum: with and without bleeding. The demographic data and spontaneous healing outcomes (i.e., healing rate and duration) of these two TMP types were analyzed using the chi-squared test or t-test.

Results

One-hundred and eighty-eight cases met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Of these, 58.5% had perforations without bleeding and the remaining 41.5% had perforations with bleeding. The overall closure rate at the end of the 3-month follow-up period was 90.9% for perforations without bleeding and 96.2% for perforations with bleeding; the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, the average closure time differed significantly between the two groups (P < 0.05): 29.4 ± 3.7days for perforations without bleeding and 20.6 ± 9.2days for perforations with bleeding. The closure rate was significantly different between the groups (62 vs. 15.6%, P < 0.01) within 2weeks for medium-sized perforations. In total, 11 (39.3%) large-sized perforations achieved complete closure in the group with bleeding, while none of the large-sized perforations closed in the group without bleeding within 2weeks. The closure rate of medium-sized perforations was not significantly different (79.2 vs. 92%, P > 0.05) between the groups without and with bleeding within 4weeks, while the closure rate of large-sized perforations was significantly different between the groups without and with bleeding (27.2 vs. 75%, P = 0.0).

Conclusion

This study shows that traumatic TMPs with bleeding significantly shortened the closure time compared to TMPs without bleeding. This finding indicates a significant correlation between the prognosis of traumatic TMPs and the degree of eardrum bleeding: severe bleeding from and a hematoma in the remnant eardrum appear to be good signs.

### Spontaneous healing of traumatic eardrum perforation: outward epithelial cell migration and clinical outcome [^129f142c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the otoendoscopic features of traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) with outward-migrating epithelium at the perforation edges and to evaluate the spontaneous healing outcome of this type of perforation.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Materials and Methods

The clinical records of traumatic TMP patients who met the case selection criteria were retrieved and categorized based on the documented migration pathways of the proliferating epithelial cells at the perforation margins into 2 groups: centripetal migration and outward migration. The demographic data and spontaneous healing outcomes (ie, healing rate and time) of these 2 types of TMP were analyzed using the chi-square test or t-test. The otoendoscopic features were characterized.

Results

In all, 122 cases were analyzed. During the spontaneous healing process, perforations were associated with centripetal epithelial cell migration in 87 (71.3%) cases and with outward epithelial cell migration in 35 (28.7%) cases. The overall perforation closure rates at the end of 6 months were 97% and 94% for the centripetal and outward migration groups, respectively (P > 0.05). The average perforation closure times were 18.4 ± 3.7 and 37.6 ± 9.2 days, respectively (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Although the outward epithelial migration did not affect the overall perforation spontaneous healing rate, it alone could not close the perforation. The prerequisite for eardrum healing is that the outward epithelium migration pattern evolves into a centripetal migration pattern. Consequently, outward epithelial migration prolonged substantially the time to traumatic eardrum perforation closure.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e0620539]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) perforation is commonly encountered in the clinical setting. It can be iatrogenic, or caused by trauma or infections. In the United States, it is estimated that 1 to 3% of the population will have a TM perforation some time in their life. In specific groups (e.g. Indigenous Australians), the prevalence reported has been as high as 28 to 43%. Some perforations may lead to chronic otorrhea and hearing loss, and limit water sports, which may significantly reduce the quality of life. Moreover, chronic TM perforations, if left untreated, serve as a conduit for further infections, acquired cholesteatoma, facial nerve palsy, labyrinthitis, and subperiosteal abscess. Although traumatic TM perforations tend to heal spontaneously, large or chronic perforations may fail to heal and require surgical interventions. In addition, the long-term spontaneous healing rate can sometimes be unsatisfactory. Kristensen reported that healing rate for spontaneous perforations to be 78.7%, which appears to vary depending on the cause of perforation. To repair TM perforations, patients may suffer from complications from conventional surgery. Hence, it is crucial to explore options that may improve the efficacy of repair.

With the advancement in the field of tissue engineering, various bioscaffolds and bioactive molecules have been applied with encouraging results. Among them, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is one of the most commonly used bioactive molecules. Until recently, a majority of the studies were in animal models. However, in the recent years, we have witnessed a surge in the use of bFGF in human trials (,–). Although a majority of trials reported promising benefits, the perforation closure rates varied across the different studies, and there does not appear to be a consensus for hearing benefits. Recently, a literature review supported the role of bFGF in the repair of TM perforation, but to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of bFGF.

Thus, the aim of this comprehensive meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of bFGF for the repair of TM perforations both in healing and hearing by evaluating the current best evidence.

### Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane: a review of 80 cases [^bf9ee897]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TPTM) is often encountered in primary care or in the emergency department (ED). Several therapeutic interventions have been described, but conservative follow-up until spontaneous complete recovery is the most common choice.

Objective

Our goal was to analyze the trauma mechanism, perforation characteristics, and outcome of patients with TPTM.

Methods

The study included patients examined in the ED of a tertiary, university-affiliated medical center because of TPTM between 2012 and 2016. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, trauma mechanism, clinical characteristics, and outcome. A phone survey was performed to obtain the missing information of all the patients who did not continue their follow-up in our outpatient clinic.

Results

We reviewed the histories of 80 patients with a mean age of 26.7 ± 14.6 years (20 children; 25%). TPTM was caused by blunt trauma in 45 patients (56%) and penetrating trauma in 35 patients (44%). Thirty-five patients (44%) completed their follow-up in the hospital outpatient clinic, with a mean duration of 6.2 weeks. Twenty-five patients (38%) completed their follow-up in a community-based otolaryngology clinic, 6 patients (9%) chose not to complete their follow-up, and 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 60 patients who completed follow-up, 56 patients recovered spontaneously, 3 patients underwent successful tympanoplasty, and 1 patient was referred to surgery but was lost to follow-up. All children healed spontaneously.

Conclusion

TPTM was more common in young males with main mechanisms of blunt trauma (an assault) or cleaning the ear canal. All children demonstrated complete spontaneous recovery.

### Comparison of endoscopic modified and typical myringoplasty: a randomized controlled trial [^84d7b960]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Here, we aimed to compare the operation time, postoperative pain score, graft healing, graft success rate, cholesteatoma incidence, audiometric outcomes, and complications between endoscopic modified myringoplasty (EMM) and endoscopic typical myringoplasty (ETM).

Methods

Patients with unilateral chronic tympanic membrane (TM) perforations undergoing myringoplasty were prospectively randomized to undergo EMM (n = 44) or ETM (n = 45). The operation time, postoperative pain score, graft healing, graft success rate, cholesteatoma incidence, audiometric outcomes, and complications were compared between these groups.

Results

In total, 89 patients with unilateral chronic perforations were included (EMM group, 44; ETM group, 45). There were significant differences between the EMM and ETM groups in mean pain scores on the day after surgery (1.32 ± 0.56 vs. 2.58 ± 1.16, p < 0.001) and in the mean operation time (18.18 ± 2.43 vs. 51.53 ± 8.28min, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in graft success rates (93.18% vs. 88.89%, p = 0.735), pre- or postoperative air conduction pure-tone averages or air bone gaps (ABGs), or changes in ABGs between the groups. However, the difference in graft healing was significant at postoperative week 2 (33/44 vs. 24/45, p = 0.033) but was nonsignificant at postoperative week 4 and month 6. Computed tomography revealed the middle ear and mastoid to be well pneumatized at 12months in all patients.

Conclusion

While 12-month graft and audiometric outcomes were comparable between EMM and ETM techniques, patients who underwent EMM had less postoperative pain, shorter operative times, faster healing, and a lower incidence of complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^c42a5e86]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 7 — Acute otitis media (AOM) with and without a tympanostomy tube differs by symptoms, antibiotic needs, and complication risks as follows: ear pain is "None, unless skin irritated or tube occluded" vs "Mild to severe"; otorrhea is "Yes, unless tube obstructed" vs "No, unless eardrum ruptures"; middle ear effusion (MEE) after infection "Usually resolves promptly" vs "Can last weeks or months"; oral antibiotics are needed "Rarely" vs "Often", while antibiotic eardrops are "First-line treatment" vs "No benefit"; eardrum rupture risk is "No, unless tube obstructed" vs "Yes"; suppurative complications are "Likely very rare since infection can drain through the tube" vs "Rare but reported, since the infection occurs in a closed space"; and bacterial resistance impact is "Topical antibiotics generally do not cause resistance" vs "Systemic antibiotics can promote resistance".

### A systematic review and meta-analysis: timing of elective removal of tympanostomy tubes [^eccb0358]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective(S)

Tympanostomy tube (TT) placement is the most common surgical procedure in children. Less than 10% of TT do not self-extrude. This study is a systematic review (SR) on elective TT removal in the pediatric population: timing, perforation rates, and role of simultaneous repair. A PICOTS (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing, setting) question was formulated: In pediatric patients who have retained TT, what is the preferred time to elective removal of such tubes, and what are the outcomes in terms of perforation rates? Does an intervention at the time of TT removal improve perforation rates?

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched four major electronic databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, CDSR, CCRCT for articles published prior to 02/19/20. EndNote® was used to gather references, review abstracts, and obtain full text articles. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting patients aged 0 to 18years undergoing elective TT removal with follow-up greater than 3months. Exclusion criteria included patients > 18years, duplicate patient series, or case series with fewer than five patients. Articles that were not available in English, not available in full text, and those that only addressed long-acting TT were excluded. Data were pooled and meta-analysis was conducted to examine how timing of TT removal, patching of the tympanic membrane, or any TM intervention at TT removal affected outcomes.

Results

A total of 1,064 references were found. We identified 63 unique studies for full text review. Of these, 17 were selected for SR. MINORS (Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies) scores were low-revealing high bias among the studies. Reported perforation rates after elective TT removal ranged from 0% to 57%. Four studies had data suitable for comparative meta-analysis, which showed a significant increase in perforation rates after elective removal of TT after 3years compared to removal prior to 3years (OR 2.89; CI 1.78–4.69). No difference in perforation rates were identified when TM intervention vs. no intervention at time of TT removal was performed (six studies: OR 1.21; CI 0.71–2.07). No difference in perforation rates was identified when the type of TM intervention was compared, including freshening of TM edges, to patching with various materials (paper, fat, gelfoam®/gelfilm®, Trichloroacetic acid) (three studies: OR 1.07; CI 0.52–2.19).

Conclusion

From the data reviewed in this SR and meta-analysis, elective TT removal at or prior to 3years' retention showed decreased perforation rates. However, TM intervention at the time of TT removal was not shown to lower perforation rates. In the absence of tube complications such as granuloma formation, nonfunctional tube, or chronic tube otorrhea, it may be reasonable to wait up to 3years to electively remove a retained TT.

### Rate of tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection [^967154c9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection. To determine which comorbid conditions and risk factors are associated with prolonged time to perforation closure following intratympanic steroid injection.

Materials and Methods

Clinical data were gathered for patients who had undergone intratympanic steroid injection to treat sudden sensorineural hearing loss or Ménière's disease. Primary outcomes analysis included rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation, defined as perforation at least 90days following last injection, and time to perforation healing. Age, sex, number of injections, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, previous head and neck irradiation, and concurrent oral steroids, were analyzed as potential predictors of persistent perforation.

Results

One hundred ninety two patients were included in this study. Three patients (1.6%) had persistent tympanic membrane perforations. All three patients received multiple injections. One patient underwent tympanoplasty for repair of persistent perforation. The median time to perforation healing was 18days. There was no statistically significant variable associated with time to perforation healing. However, patients with prior history of head and neck radiation averaged 36.5days for perforation healing compared to 17.5days with no prior history of radiation and this approached statistical significance (p = 0.078).

Conclusions

The rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation following intratympanic steroid injection is low. Patients with a history of radiation to the head and neck may be at increased risk for prolonged time for closure of perforation.

### Comparative study on the effects of EGF and bFGF on the healing of human large traumatic perforations of the tympanic membrane [^3f3db0cf]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

We evaluated the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the healing of large traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Study Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Methods

A randomized, prospective analysis was performed between June 2013 and August 2014 on the treatment of traumatic TMPs larger than 25% of the TM. Closure rate, closure time, hearing gain, and rate of otorrhea were compared between EGF and bFGF groups, as well as to an observation-only group.

Results

Final analysis was performed on 86 patients at 3 months. The closure rates of perforation in the EGF, bFGF, and observation groups were 86.2%, 89.3%, and 72.4%, respectively. The closure rates in the EGF and bFGF groups were 14% to 17% higher than in the observation group, although the difference was not statistically significant for the total closure rate among the three groups (P = 0.200). The average closure time was significantly longer (P < 0.01) in the observation group than in the EGF and bFGF groups. However, the closure times in the EGF and bFGF groups were not significantly different (P = 0.92). In addition, differences in purulent otorrhea rates among the groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.82).

Conclusions

Both EGF and bFGF can accelerate the closure of human large traumatic TMPs. The healing outcomes among the two growth factors were not significantly different.

### Efficacy of EGF and gelatin sponge for traumatic tympanic membrane perforations: a randomized controlled study [^6c0594ca]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and gelatin sponge patch treatments for traumatic tympanic membrane perforations.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled.

Setting

University-affiliated teaching hospital.

Subjects and Methods

In total, 141 perforations encompassing > 50% of the eardrum were randomly divided into 3 groups: EGF (n = 47), gelatin sponge patch (n = 47), and observation (n = 47). The edges of the perforations were not approximated. The closure rate, mean closure time, and infection rate were evaluated at 6 months and the related factors analyzed.

Results

A total of 135 perforations were analyzed. At 6 months, the closure rates were 97.8%, 86.7%, and 82.2% in the EGF, gelatin sponge patch, and spontaneous healing groups, respectively (P = 0.054). The mean ± SD closure time was 11.12 ± 4.60, 13.67 ± 5.37, and 25.65 ± 13.32 days in the EGF, gelatin sponge patch, and spontaneous healing groups, respectively (P < .001). In addition, the presence of infection was not significantly associated with rate of closure in any group.

Conclusions

As compared with spontaneous healing, daily application of EGF and gelatin sponge patching reduced the closure time of traumatic tympanic membrane perforations. EGF treatment had a higher closure rate and shorter closure time but resulted in otorrhea. By contrast, gelatin sponge patches did not improve the closure rate or cause otorrhea but required repeated patch removal and reapplication. Thus, the appropriate treatment should be selected according to patient need.

### Repair of large traumatic tympanic membrane perforation with a steri-strips patch [^bd98abdf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of the Steri-Strips patch (3M) on the treatment of large traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMP).

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Subjects and Methods

A randomized prospective analysis was performed between February 2009 and January 2011 for the treatment of traumatic TMP larger than 50% of the entire tympanic membrane. The results of closure rate, closure time, hearing gain, and rate of otorrhea between conservative observation, paper patching, and Steri-Strips patching groups were compared.

Results

In total, 87 patients were analyzed in this study. The closure rates of the perforations in the Steri-Strips patching, paper patching, and observation groups were 93.3%, 84.2%, and 78.9%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in tympanic membrane closure rate between the 3 groups. The Steri-Strips technique decreased the need for repeat procedures. Overall, the Steri-Strips and paper patching groups showed shorter healing times compared with the observation group. However, there was an increased rate of otorrhea in the Steri-Strips group compared with the observation group.

Conclusion

Steri-Strips patching reduced the healing time and need for repeat procedures in patients with large traumatic TMPs. However, the occurrence of otorrhea was significantly more common in patients treated with the Steri-Strips technique.

### Fresh tympanic membrane perforations heal without significant loss of strength [^53cb14ab]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The mechanical and structural properties of the tympanic membrane change after a perforation has healed.

Background

In previous studies, efforts have been made to enhance the healing process of tympanic membrane perforations. The strength of the healed perforation has been tested with moiré interferometry in gerbils, but in no other species.

Methods

A laser myringotomy was made on 10 Sprague-Dawley rats and 10 CBA mice, and assessments were made after 2 or 4 weeks with moiré interferometry and light and electron microscopy.

Results

The mean peak displacement at pressure loads of +350 daPa and of -350 daPa did not differ significantly in the healed perforations as compared with the untouched tympanic membranes. Morphologic assays showed fivefold increased thickness at the site of the perforation due to invaded fibroblasts and extracellular matrix.

Conclusion

Moiré interferometry was successfully performed in the rat ears, whereas in mouse ears the method was not easily applicable due to technical difficulties. The stress-strain curve of the rat tympanic membrane displays an S-shape. The strength of the spontaneously healed tympanic membrane after myringotomy was not significantly impaired. The site of the perforation became significantly thickened at 2 and 4 weeks post-myringotomy. This information is of clinical importance, because recently closed perforations will be challenged by pressure gradient in everyday life.

### Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor by erlotinib: wound healing of experimental tympanic membrane perforations [^22fbdc40]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may arrest wound healing of experimental tympanic membrane perforation in rats.

Background

An animal model of chronic tympanic membrane perforation is needed for experiments on supporting wound healing of tympanic membrane perforations. The EGFR has been implicated in the regulation of wound healing.

Methods

Thirty animals were administered 80 or 40 mg/kg/d EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or vehicle only for 5 days. The right-sided tympanic membrane of each animal was perforated at Day 2. Rat ears were inspected repeatedly to analyze the status of perforation. Tympanic membranes were examined histologically.

Results

Unfortunately, five animals in the 80-mg/kg group and four in the 40-mg/kg group died before they reached their scheduled endpoint. Taking into account the small sample sizes, we observed a delayed closure of perforations in the 80-mg/kg group and differences in the histologic parameters between treated groups and control group.

Conclusion

The inhibition of EGFR by systemic application of erlotinib seems not to be suitable to create a chronic tympanic membrane perforation in rat.

### Pretreatment factors affecting traumatic tympanic membrane regeneration therapy using epidermal growth factor [^b05f2124]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to achieve closure of human traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) was recently reported. However, pretreatment factors affecting healing outcomes have seldom been discussed. This study was performed to evaluate pretreatment factors contributing to the success or failure of TMP healing using EGF.

Design and Participants

This was a retrospective cohort study of 95 TMPs who were observed for at least 6 months after EGF treatment. Eleven factors considered likely to affect healing outcome were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.

Interventions

Each traumatic TMP was treated by daily topical application of EGF. The main outcome measures were complete closure versus failure to close and mean closure time.

Results

A total of 95 patients were included in the analyses. The total closure rate was 92.6% at 6 months, and the mean closure time was 10.5 ± 4.8 days. The closure rate was not significantly different according to the duration of perforation ≤ 3 days and > 3 days (P = 0.816). However, the mean closure time was significantly different according to the duration of perforation (P < 0.001). The perforation size did not affect the closure rate (P = 0.442). The mean closure time in the low-dose EGF group was significantly shorter than that in the high-dose EGF group (P = 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that perforations with preexisting myringosclerosis were more likely to fail to close compared to those without preexisting myringosclerosis (P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the duration of perforation (P = 0.011), size of perforation (P < 0.001), and involvement of the malleus in perforation (P = 0.005) were factors independently correlated with closure time.

Conclusions

Daily application of EGF can be used to treat all traumatic TMPs. The size of the perforation and inverted edges did not affect the closure rate, and the most beneficial dosage was sufficient to keep the eardrum moist. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed a significant correlation between preexisting myringosclerosis and failure to heal. Nevertheless, the size of perforation, starting time of application, and malleus injury were independent prognostic factors for prolonged healing time.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f977fe88]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, the underlying mechanism of bFGF in promoting the TM regeneration has not been fully understood. Previous studies have postulated the possible effects of bFGF on cell proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and fibroblasts and production of proteases in vitro. Studies have shown that spontaneously healed TMs tend to be thin and dimeric due to incomplete formation of the fibrous layer, resulting in higher risks of reperforation. It is thought that bFGF promotes neovascularization and improves the arrangement of collagen fibers in the fibrous layer of a TM, thereby reducing the risk of reperforation.

Despite an improvement in healing outcomes, this study did not show a statistically significant improvement in hearing compared with spontaneous healing. The SMD for the hearing gains was only 0.08, which is a change that is not clinically significant. The outcome of hearing function for TM repair depends on various factors, including graft type, surgical approach, Eustachian tube function, site and size of perforations. Our study did not show an improvement in hearing following bFGF treatment, suggesting that bFGF may not have improved sound conduction despite the probable improvement in TM structure. However, our results of hearing are limited to those with traumatic TM perforations. It should be noted that, compared with other causes of perforations, traumatic perforations tend to heal more spontaneously and rapidly. Moreover, it has been reported that there is no significant impact on hearing upon complete closure of the acute TM perforations compared with pre-perforation hearing. Hence, these studies mainly showed faster hearing recovery following the bFGF treatment rather than improvement in hearing.

### Tympanic membrane healing process and biocompatibility of an innovative absorbable ventilation tube [^36a323fb]. Otology & Neurotology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate tympanic membrane healing process and biocompatibility of pressure-equalizing (PE) tubes, made of a novel biodegradable, absorbable material, in an animal model.

Background

Myringotomy and pressure-equalizing tube insertion is a frequent otologic procedure in children. However, results may vary because of the unpredictable extrusion rate of tubes. Furthermore, tubes that are no longer required need a surgical procedure to be removed. The ideal pressure-equalizing tube should remain in place for the time selected by the otologist, with no need for subsequent removal. This objective could be met with pressure-equalizing tubes made from a self-disintegrating material.

Methods

Pressure-equalizing tubes, made of poly-bis(ethylalanate)phosphazene, were inserted in 55 ears of 28 Hartley guinea pigs, with survival times of 10, 30, and 60 days after tube insertion. In vivo reactions between the poly-bis(ethylalanate)phosphazene pressure-equalizing tubes and the tympanic membrane were studied. Tympanic membranes, middle ears, and tubes were examined by scanning electron microscopy.

Results

There was neither infection nor inflammatory reaction to the tube in any animal. The healing process of tympanic membranes revealed neither residual perforation nor inward spread of skin epithelium into the middle ear cavity. At 30 days, 53% of the tubes had disintegrated. At 60 days, tubes were functioning in 25% of ears.

Conclusion

These new poly-bis(ethylalanate)phosphazene pressure-equalizing tubes are promising. The healing process of tympanic membranes is excellent, with no complications. The tube disintegration rate can be controlled by varying the formulation of the polymer, obtaining tubes with predictable resorption rates, to adapt treatment to the needs of each single patient.

### Comparative study of epidermal growth factor and observation only on human subacute tympanic membrane perforation [^2d1cde98]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and observation only on human subacute tympanic membrane perforation (TMP).

Methods

A total of 44 patients with traumatic TMPs > 2 months after trauma were divided into an observation group (n = 18) and EGF group (n = 26). Patients in the EGF group underwent direct application of EGF without stripping of the perforation edge. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. The TMP closure rate, closure time, and hearing gain were evaluated.

Results

At 6 months, 25 of 26 (96.2%) perforations achieved complete closure with a mean closure time of 9.1 ± 3.9 days (range, 3–14 days) in the EGF group. However, only 11 of 18 (61.1%) perforations achieved complete closure in the observation group, with a mean closure time of 20.6 ± 10.7 days (range = 9–71 days). The patients in the EGF-treated group had significantly improved closure rates (P = 0.026) and a reduced closure time (P < 0.01) compared to those in the observation group. The difference in mean hearing improvement between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.86).

Conclusions

Topical application of EGF improved the closure rate and shortened the closure time of human subacute TMPs compared with spontaneous healing, the stripping of the perforation edge was unnecessary. This treatment is simple and convenient and should be recommended pre-myringoplasty.

### Creating a stable tympanic membrane perforation using mitomycin C [^53d801c8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the ability of topically applied mitomycin C to create a stable tympanic membrane perforation.

Study Design and Setting

Twenty-four rats underwent subtotal removal of the tympanic membranes bilaterally. Forty ears received 0.2 mg/ml of mitomycin C. The remaining 8 received phosphate-buffered saline solution (control). Photographs taken every 3 to 5 days for 44 days were digitally scanned and computer analyzed to calculate the percentage of residual perforation. Application of solutions, photography, and data analysis were performed in a blinded fashion.

Results

The mitomycin C treated ears had delayed closure time and healing rate (from day 0 to 25) compared to the control group. All controls healed by day 14. By day 44, 92.5% of the mitomycin C treated ears healed.

Conclusion

Mitomycin C prolongs the closure and healing rate of myringotomies in rat tympanic membranes.

Significance

Myringotomy with concurrent mitomycin C application may be useful for creating an animal model for chronic tympanic membrane perforation and should be tested in human beings as a method to maintain myringotomy patency for long-term ventilation.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^31c818ea]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of exogenous bFGF in TM regeneration has been studied extensively. In the last decade, bFGF has been studied as an effective and convenient therapy with numerous experimental and clinical studies. The use of bFGF as an eardrop applied directly via transcanal route has been shown to be simple and convenient. Although a majority of studies reported encouraging outcomes, this is mainly in the setting of acute or traumatic TM perforation models. For chronic TM perforation, bFGF has been used in combination with a graft material such as Gelfoam or a collagen patch, thus the direct effectiveness of bFGF in chronic perforation is unclear. In addition, the most effective dosage, duration and frequency of application, and presence of patching materials have yet to be fully investigated. Mondain et al. found that high doses of bFGF (e.g. 400 ng) caused myringitis; in contrast, Lou indicated this dosage was not associated with any severe complications such as cholesteatoma and infection. Although otorrhoea was reported with excessive application of a single dosage, it only prolonged the closure time and did not affect the closure rate. The safety of bFGF has been investigated extensively in the literature. In addition, Lou et al. reported that patching materials were not necessary for topical application of bFGF in acute TM perforation. However, other studies have shown that bFGF in combination with bioscaffolds can significantly promote the TM healing (,–). Indeed, graft materials and bFGF enhance TM repair via different ways where the bioscaffolds offer structural support to guide the neo-tissue regeneration and bFGF facilitates cellar migration and proliferation.

### Prevalence of tympanic membrane perforations among adolescents, adults, and older adults in the United States [^19a792a9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) perforations can occur at any age, but limited population-level data are available. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and population estimates for TM perforations among individuals ≥ 12 years old in the United States. Overall, TM perforations have a prevalence of 2.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-2.6%), corresponding to 5.8 million Americans. Across the life course, older adults have the highest prevalence of TM perforations at 6.1% (95% CI, 4.7%-7.6%), corresponding to nearly 3 million Americans, as opposed to a prevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3%-0.9%) in adolescents, which equates to 0.2 million Americans. Males and females have a similar prevalence at 2.3% (95% CI, 1.6%-3.0%) among males and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.6%) among females. These prevalence and population estimates provide the first US-based population estimates of the burden of TM perforations over the life course.

### Effects of ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone and ofloxacin on tympanic membrane perforation healing [^f0fbb235]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

HYPOTHESIS:: Exposure to ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone, but not ofloxacin, prolongs tympanic membrane (TM) healing. BACKGROUND:: Exposure to hydrocortisone has been shown to delay TM wound healing. No published studies have compared the effects of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone and ofloxacin on TM healing. METHODS:: Noninfected TM perforations were created in 30 rats. The rats were split into three groups, and ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone, ofloxacin, or isotonic sodium chloride solution drops were instilled for 8 days. Tympanic membrane healing was analyzed at specified intervals using photographic documentation verified by a blinded observer. RESULTS:: The isotonic sodium chloride solution control and ofloxacin-exposed TMs healed at similar rates. There was a statistically significant delay in TM healing in the ciprofloxacin-/dexamethasone-exposed TMs by postoperative Day 10. However, all TM perforations were healed by postoperative Day 20. CONCLUSION:: Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone delays healing of experimental TM perforations, but the brief exposure in this study did not cause persistent perforations.

### Otitis media in young aboriginal children from remote communities in Northern and central Australia: a cross-sectional survey [^b8f6c18d]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this standardised assessment of middle ear state in 29 remote Aboriginal communities, 1 in every 2 children (aged between 6 and 30 months) had otoscopic signs consistent with suppurative ear disease and 1 in 4 children had a perforated tympanic membrane. Some of the children with intact tympanic membranes had experienced a perforation that healed before the survey. In this high-risk population, high rates of tympanic perforation were associated with high rates of bulging of the tympanic membrane.

### Utility of basic fibroblast growth factor in the repair of blast-induced total or near-total tympanic membrane perforations: a pilot study [^be1aaa14]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

A pilot study was performed to investigate the utility of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the repair of blast-induced total or near-total tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Study Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Subjects and Methods

Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were treated with 0.10–0.15 mL of bFGF solution applied directly to total or near-total TMPs once daily until the perforations closed or for a maximum of 6 months. The treatment response was monitored via serial otoendoscopy, and audiometric outcomes were evaluated.

Results

Complete TMP closure was achieved in 16 of 17 patients with a blast-induced total or near-total TMP. The mean closure time was 28.4 ± 10.9 days. The improvement in hearing from pre- to post-treatment was statistically significant. There were no complications or adverse outcomes.

Conclusions

The direct application of bFGF to blast-induced total or near-total TMPs is a promising, minimally invasive alternative to conventional tympanoplasty, with a comparable success rate. As reported in the literature, the closure rate was higher than achieved with spontaneous healing. There was no effect of the inverted edge on healing outcome. The use of bFGF in this setting has immediate therapeutic applications for military personnel with blast-induced TMPs who are stationed in isolated, remote environments.

### Effects of ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone and ofloxacin on tympanic membrane perforation healing [^d5ad79a5]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Exposure to ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone, but not ofloxacin, prolongs tympanic membrane (TM) healing.

Background

Exposure to hydrocortisone has been shown to delay TM wound healing. No published studies have compared the effects of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone and ofloxacin on TM healing.

Conclusion

Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone delays healing of experimental TM perforations, but the brief exposure in this study did not cause persistent perforations.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^38ce79e0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Early paper patching versus observation in patients with traumatic eardrum perforations: comparisons of anatomical and functional outcomes [^f02af0c4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients with acute tympanic membrane perforation after spontaneous healing and paper-patching procedure.

Methods Design, Setting, and Participants

In this study, we performed a retrospective chart review with a prospective follow-up in 63 patients with tympanic membrane perforations. The patients undergoing a paper-patching procedure were assigned to group 1 (n = 33), whereas the patients that healed spontaneously were included in group 2 (n = 30). Retrospective analyses of the otoscopic examination findings and audiometric test results of the groups at the sixth-week follow-up were compared.

Results

Eardrum healing was achieved in 90.9% of the patients in group 1 and 76.7% of the patients in group 2 at the sixth week (P > 0.05). The mean values of air conduction were significantly improved, and the air-bone gap was markedly decreased in the patients treated with paper patching, when compared with the patients in group 2 (P < 0.001). The area of perforation was found to be inversely related to the healing success.

Conclusions

Early intervention by paper patching, which is a readily applicable procedure, may be offered to the patients with acute perforation of the tympanic membrane, because of the slightly better closure rates and significantly higher hearing functions when compared with simple observation.

### Systematic review on the management of term prelabour rupture of membranes [^c02ef32a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Quality assessment questions for RCT studies

Furthermore, the results from the systematic review are in agreement with a recent Cochrane systematic review published by Middleton et al. in that the quality of most studies in this topic is generally low. Since there was a high degree of heterogeneity in the outcomes to be measured, it was not possible to do meta-analysis. All the studies that were found in the searches that met the criteria are presented in Table 4, and no studies were omitted due to their quality. Therefore, there is no bias in reporting.

A total of 13 questions were to be answered by the RCTS and 12 questions for the observational studies. All questions were deemed equaly important and had the same weight. Therefore, all studies were given a score between 0 and 12 or 13, in which 0 indicated very poor quality and 12–13 extremely good quality and then a percentage was obtained, for example 8/13 (61.5%). It was decided a priori that studies that scored less than 40% were considered low quality, studies that scored between 41% and 79% were considered intermediate quality and studies that scored 80% or more were considered of high quality. In order to maintain consistency and rigor, in the case of RCT studies where it was not clear what the primary and secondary outcomes were or in cases where these were not stated, these studies were given a score of 0 as an answer to question: "Were the primary and secondary outcomes clearly stated?". Also in the case of RCT studies, if the randomisation system used was either not stated or the allocation to treatment was done by the day of the week, or the number of the hospital number or by means of sealed envelopes, these studies were given a score of 0 as an answer to the question "In the case of RCT, was the allocation to treatment randomised?".

### "Window shade" tympanoplasty for anterior marginal perforations [^1a92667a]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Anterior marginal perforations of the tympanic membrane often present a reconstructive challenge to the otolaryngologist. Poor surgical outcomes are often due to inadequate exposure, a lack of residual tympanic membrane, impaired vascular supply, and delayed healing. This study reports on the success of the "window shade" technique, combining aspects of both the traditional underlay and overlay tympanoplasty techniques, for the management of anterior marginal tympanic membrane perforations.

Study Design

Retrospective review of patients undergoing window shade tympanoplasty from July 1, 1994, to July 1, 2003, at a tertiary care referral center.

Methods

Only patients found to have anterior tympanic membrane perforations and who underwent a window shade tympanoplasty were included in the study. Tympanoplasty success rate was studied by examining postoperative complications of recurrent perforation, tympanic membrane lateralization, or anterior blunting.

Results

The authors identified 164 patients who underwent window shade tympanoplasty during the study period. The overall success rate for tympanic membrane repair was 94.5%. There were no cases of tympanic membrane lateralization or significant blunting. The average healing time was 4 weeks. The surgical technique is described in detail.

Conclusion

The window shade tympanoplasty is an excellent surgical option for repair of anterior marginal perforations of the tympanic membrane.

### The importance of vascular endothelial growth factor in the healing of acute tympanic membrane perforation [^152b5aa7]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the more important growth factor expression between basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the healing of acute tympanic membrane (TM) perforation.

Materials and Methods

Bilateral perforations of the TM were created in 12 rats. The TM perforations in the right ears were treated with dexamethasone, and left ears were designated as the control group. The TM was examined for the growth factor expression immunohistochemically in the epithelial and fibrous layers according to the rate of TM perforation healing.

Results

The mean spontaneous healing time of the TM perforations was 11.0 ± 2.0 days. However, dexamethasone-treated group showed no evidence of closure. The bFGF and VEGF expression were significantly correlated with the rate of healing of acute TM perforations. The VEGF expression was decreased both in the epithelial and fibrous layers, but bFGF expression was decreased only in the epithelial layer in the dexamethasone-treated group. The VEGF was expressed to a lesser degree than bFGF in the dexamethasone-treated group.

Conclusion

Vascular endothelial growth factor is the more specific and important growth factor than bFGF in the healing of acute TM perforation.

### Treatment of otorrhea in infants and children… [^b29fe74b]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Otorrhea, defined as drainage from the ear, can be acute or chronic. This common problem can be caused by benign or serious conditions. Sabella reviewed the management of otorrhea in infants and children. Acute otorrhea is usually a result of acute otitis media or otitis externa, or a postoperative complication of tympanostomy tube placement. Acute otitis media can cause spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane, allowing purulent material to drain into the external ear canal. The microbiology of these cases is similar to that of otitis media without perforation. The most common organisms associated with an acutely perforated tympanic membrane are. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Group A streptococcus, a relatively rare cause of otitis media, appears to be associated with a higher rate of acute perforation and more rapid injury to the tympanic membrane.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cause most cases of otitis externa. Otorrhea is the most common complication of tympanostomy tube placement. The insertion of ototopical drops at the time of surgery appears to be effective in reducing the rate of otorrhea. Acute otorrhea in a patient with a tympanostomy tube may represent acute otitis media or water contamination from the external canal. Aspirating material from the middle ear through the tympanostomy tube will help in identifying the causative organisms. When otorrhea continues for 10 days despite the use of oral antibiotics, culture of the drainage from the perforation site is important in guiding antibiotic choice. The specimen can be obtained using a spinal needle attached to a tuberculin syringe. Cleaning of the ear canal may also be required. Otorrhea that continues beyond 14 days requires a careful examination for cholesteatoma, neoplasm or intracranial abnormalities.

Treatment of otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes should be guided by stain and culture of purulent material. The use of ototopical agents such as ofloxacin and irrigation are usually sufficient, although oral antibiotics are often used. Otitis externa can be treated with gentle suction using hypertonic saline and instillation of 2 percent acetic acid. Antibioticcorticosteroid combination otic drops may be helpful if canal wall inflammation is severe.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^6efe0f1e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tube otorrhea and complications — frequencies and management — are reported as follows: Acute TTO occurs in up to 50% of children who are closely monitored in RCTs, with cohort studies finding 16% postoperative otorrhea (first 30 days), 26% delayed otorrhea, 7% recurrent otorrhea, and 4% chronic otorrhea. Caregivers should be counseled that TTO responds to topical antibiotic ear drops, does not usually require oral antibiotics, and benefits from water precautions until the discharge is no longer present. Up to 3% of tubes may fail to extrude and require active removal; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs with about 2% of short-term tubes and up to 20% of long-term tubes; and localized cholesteatoma may be seen in 0.5% of cases.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — adverse events and complications include tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) seen in approximately 16% within 4 weeks and 26% at any time while the tube remains in place; most tubes stay 8 to 18 months with approximately 7% experiencing recurrent TTO, and a Netherlands cohort reported 52% TTO with 3.9% chronic; other complications include tube blockage 7% to 10%, granulation tissue 4%, premature extrusion 4%, and tube displacement 0.5% or lower; myringosclerosis is more common in intubated ears but does not typically cause clinically significant hearing loss; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs in 1% to 6% overall, near 3% at 7 years in a Medicaid review, 1% after extrusion, and 2.6% required removal of retained tubes, with repeat tube insertion and older age at surgery associated with perforation; TTO risk factors included young age, recurrent AOM as primary indication, older siblings, and frequent upper respiratory infections.

### A retrospective study of EGF and ofloxacin drops in the healing of human large traumatic eardrum perforation [^972a65ce]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and ofloxacin otic drops on the healing of large human traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Methods

Retrospective case review of patients with traumatic TMP larger than 25% of the TM seen between February 2007 and December 2008. Patients were stratified into EGF drops, ofloxacin drops, and observation groups. The closure rate, closure time, and hearing level were compared among the three groups at 6months.

Results

In total, 120 patients met the inclusion criteria. The total closure rate was 89.2% (107/120) and the total mean closure time was 22.6 ± 7.4days. The closure rates of perforation in the EGF, ofloxacin otic drops, and observation groups were 93.5%, 92.0%, and 82.2%, respectively. The closure rates among the three groups were not statistically different (p = 0.19). The mean perforation closure times were 12.6 ± 6.9, 12.9 ± 5.1, and 35.7 ± 9.2days for the EGF, ofloxacin otic drops, and observation groups, respectively. The average closure time in the observation group was significantly longer (p = 0.01) than that in the EGF and ofloxacin otic drops groups. However, the closure times in the EGF and ofloxacin otic drops groups were not significantly different (p = 0.84).

Conclusions

The study surprisingly found that both topical application of EGF and ofloxacin otic drops result in more rapid closure compared with spontaneous healing for human large traumatic TMPs. The benefit would be great as a shorter recovery time may reduce health care costs. Therefore, ofloxacin otic drops should be considered in clinics.

### Acute traumatic tympanic membrane perforation… [^daf58edb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In the article that appeared in the December issue of the Archives, by Lindeman et al, 1 they concluded that acute traumatic tympanic membrane perforations do not need to be treated routinely with paper patching. I am convinced that their observation regarding the healing rate, whether or not a paper patch was used, is valid. However, the majority of the patients that I see with acute traumatic tympanic membrane perforations are symptomatic, and their prime complaints are decreased hearing, tinnitus, and otalgia. The vast majority of the patients that I patch obtain almost immediate relief of symptoms. Although I admit that I had the feeling that they healed quicker and more frequently with the paper patch, I also was seeking to achieve relief of their symptoms through the paper patching. I would suggest that this is a very valid reason for patching most traumatic perforations of. WALLENBORN WM. Acute Traumatic Tympanic Membrane Perforation.

### Prognostic factors of successful tympanoplasty in pediatric patients: a cohort study [^65112855]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tympanoplasty in children is a current and controversial theme. Previously reported success rates for tympanoplasty in children have ranged between 56–94%, with this wide range being attributed to different selection criteria and definitions of success. The latter parameter traditionally has been measured only by the post-operative integrity of the graft. Yet, there exist other valuable characteristics to consider, as it is known that children in general, and those who have undergone repair of the tympanic membrane, in particular, present a greater risk for retractions, serous otitis media, and re-perforation with episodes of acute otitis media. In addition, with a pediatric patient, the surgery itself may be considered as being more difficult technically, due to the narrowness of the external ear canal and the generally smaller size of the ear, thus contributing to a poor result, but of a functional type. Therefore, over time, otorhinolaryngologists dedicated to pediatric pathology have considered it necessary to have a more complete definition of "success" — one that should include 1) integrity of the graft or membrane; 2) post-operative gain (minimum of 10 dB) in the auditory threshold, or conservation of hearing; and 3) complete healing, with the space of the aerated middle ear manifested by the graft located in the correct anatomical position, with neither atelectasis nor otitis media with effusion (OME).

### Total tympanic membrane reconstruction: alloDerm versus temporalis fascia [^15b3ed85]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Patients who require surgery for chronic otitis media with perforation and cholesteatoma frequently provide no residual tympanic membrane that is usable in grafting procedures. A novel technique of total tympanic membrane reconstruction (TTMR) is described that maximizes perforation closure rate in these situations while minimizing mucosalization, incomplete healing, and anterior blunting. The specific aim of this report is to assess the safety and efficacy of TTMR and to compare the results obtained with AlloDerm compared with temporalis fascia as a grafting material.

Methods

The records of 50 patients operated within the years 1999 and the 2004 were reviewed. TTMR with intact canal wall was performed in all cases. Both clinical and audiometric data were analyzed.

Results

Overall perforation closure rate was 92%. There was no statistical significance in closure rate when grafting with AlloDerm versus temporalis fascia. A statistically significant shortened healing time was observed with AlloDerm grafting.

Conclusions

TTMR is a highly effective and safe technique.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^943b203b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Follow-up setting and triggers for referral — Periodic follow-up for all children with tubes is essential to detect and manage complications, which may vary by the type of tube and its composition. Once adequate postoperative tympanostomy tube function and hearing improvement are established within 3 months by the surgeon or designee, some follow-up care may occur in primary care offices; if this approach is chosen, the specialist should ideally be informed of the visit, with referral to otolaryngology implemented upon any complication such as early extrusion, tube obstruction, tube medialization, otorrhea, retained tube, or tympanic membrane perforation.

### Comparing spontaneous closure and paper patching in traumatic tympanic membrane perforations [^fe5f36c2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The authors aim to analyze the effects of oral antibiotic treatment for traumatic tympanic membrane perforations and to compare the outcomes of patients with traumatic tympanic membrane perforation after paper-patching procedure and spontaneous healing. In this study, 80 patients with traumatic tympanic membrane perforation diagnosed in the otorhinolaryngology emergency department and outpatient clinic from March 2010 to January 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. If the patient is diagnosed at first week and the edge of perforation is moist with blood, our routine procedure is paper-patching (group 1). However, if the patients reject treatment or delay in admission, the authors follow up patients for spontaneous closure (group 2). Some of the patients got oral antibiotics for 7 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 1000 mg 2 times/d) while some others did not. Closure rates and effectivity of oral antibiotics were evaluated and compared between 2 groups. In total, 80 patients were analyzed. The closure rates of perforations were 95.2% for group 1 (n = 42) and 81.6% for group 2 (n = 38). Although the paper-patched patients (group 1) perforation closure rate (95.2%) is higher than the nontreated patients (group 2) closure rate (81.6%), it is not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Antibiotic administered 55 patients had a significantly higher closure rate (94.5%) than the 25 patients who are not treated with antibiotics (76%) (P = 0.023; P < 0.05). In patients with traumatic tympanic membrane perforations, spontaneous closure rate is quite high. This study showed us that antibiotherapy and paper-patch treatments increase the healing rates.

### Healing large traumatic eardrum perforations in humans using fibroblast growth factor applied directly or via gelfoam [^375eb7c7]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of conservative treatment and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) applied directly or via Gelfoam on the healing of large traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) in humans.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Methods

A randomized prospective analysis was performed between February 2009 and January 2011 for the treatment of traumatic TMPs in humans that affected greater than 50% of the TM. The closure rate, closure time, hearing gain, and rate of otorrhea were compared among the direct application of FGF, FGF via Gelfoam, and conservative treatment.

Results

A total of 94 patients were analyzed. The closure rates of large perforations in the direct FGF application, FGF via Gelfoam, and observation groups were 100%, 97%, and 55%, respectively. FGF-treated groups had significantly improved closure rates compared with the observation group (p < 0.05). However, the closure rate did not differ significantly between patients who received FGF only and those who received FGF via Gelfoam (p > 0.05). FGF-treated groups showed shorter mean closure times compared with the observation group (p < 0.05). However, the closure time did not differ significantly between FGF-treated groups (p > 0.05). All perforations were closed within 2 weeks, regardless of the presence of curled edges in the FGF-treated groups.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^b704d3cc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) initial corticosteroids — Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with SSNHL within 2 weeks of symptom onset, categorized as an Option based on systematic reviews of RCTs and new RCTs and a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and the level of confidence in the evidence is Medium, with the benefit of hearing improvement. Risks for systemic steroids include suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and Cushing's-like syndrome (minimal with 10- to 14-day treatment), aseptic necrosis of the hip, and hyperglycemia, whereas IT corticosteroids have minimal systemic effect but can cause local reactions of pain, tympanic membrane perforation, and transient dizziness, and entail high cost and multiple office visits. Exceptions for systemic steroids include medical conditions affected by corticosteroids, such as insulin-dependent or poorly controlled diabetes, tuberculosis, and peptic ulcer disease. There is a large role for shared decision making with patients, and although several group members were reluctant to endorse the 2-week time frame, the time frame of 2 weeks was retained to encourage early care. The majority of trials use a 1- to 2-week window from symptom onset as the initial therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^9dec16c0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tube design and complication rates — Thermoplastic elastomer tympanostomy tubes had higher rates of occlusion than silicone tympanostomy tubes, with an overall rate of about 11%; in another trial, long-shafted tubes, especially the Armstrong design, were less likely to extrude early than short-shaft tubes, with rate of occlusion about 11% of all tubes and no significant difference in time to first occlusion by tube shape or material. After tube extrusion, only 1.3% of ears had persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane for more than 90 days.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^0b5ce0ca]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Predictors of OME persistence — time thresholds and expected spontaneous resolution: "OME is unlikely to resolve quickly when present for 3 months or longer". In randomized observations of children with OME for 3 months, spontaneous resolution occurs in "only 19% of ears after an additional 3 months, 25% at 6 months, and 31% at 12 months". By contrast, OME after acute otitis media has "about 75%-90% resolution after 3 months". Persistence for "3 months or longer can be documented by review of medical records, by review of prior audiometry or tympanometry".

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^40fe7476]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Several methods for intratympanic application of corticosteroids haven been developed in recent years. Most are single or repeated intratympanic injections with or without visualisation of the round window membrane. In some studies additional substances like hyaluronic acid are used for volume stabilisation to increase the persistence of the drug in the middle ear. Another strategy is continuous or discontinuous drug application via partly or fully implantable pump systems, allowing adjustment of drug concentrations over time. Potential adverse events in the intratympanic application of corticosteroids are in principle the same as in systemic drug administration, but to a lesser extent. Some of the intratympanically applied drug may be lost from the middle ear by drainage through the Eustachian tube and then swallowed. However, the dose is much lower than with systemic application. Persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane can develop after injection if there is an impaired healing process. Also, temporary pain may be observed, or temporary vertigo or dizziness due to caloric stimulation.

### What effect does smoking have on the surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforations? A review [^6b211c78]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The link between cigarette smoking and outcome following surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforation is unclear. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the link between smoking and success rate following surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations.

Materials and Methods

Systematic review performed using the following data sources: 1) Cochrane central register of controlled trials (1997 to April 30, 2018), 2) Medline (February 1948 to April 30, 2018), and 3) Embase (1975 to April 30, 2018). Inclusion criteria for this study was: 1) studies reporting surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforations in smokers, 2)primary and revision cases, 3) English language literature, 4) minimum follow-up period of 6 months, and 5) pre and postoperative audiogram. The exclusion criteria were: 1) no identifiable data on smokers in reported outcomes, 2) less than 6 months follow-up, 3) no audiometric outcomes, and 4) non-English language articles.

Results

A total of 75 studies were identified on initial search and 8 were eligible for the study. All studies were of level 4 evidence. In these eight studies, overall surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforation was successful in 512/577 (88.7%) of nonsmokers and 151/197 (76.6%) in smokers. This difference was statistically significant.

Conclusions

Smokers may have a lower success rate compared against nonsmokers for surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations. Our review has limitations and more prospective high-quality controlled trials are required to further study this association.

### Tympanic membrane regeneration therapy for pediatric tympanic membrane perforation [^b1484040]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate tympanic membrane regeneration therapy (TMRT) for pediatric tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Study Design

Intervention study.

Setting

Research institute hospital.

Patients

In this study, 20 patients with chronic TMP (M/F: 13/7, 13/8 ears, age 0–15 years) treated with TMRT were evaluated. As comparison, 20 pediatric patients with chronic TMP who underwent myringoplasty/tympanoplasty were included.

Interventions

For the TM repair procedure, the edge of the TMP was disrupted mechanically, and gelatin sponge immersed in basic fibroblast growth factor was placed inside and outside the tympanic cavity and covered with fibrin glue. The TMP was examined 4 ± 1 weeks later. The protocol was repeated up to four times until closure was complete.

Main Outcome Measures

Closure of the TMP and hearing improvement were evaluated at 16 weeks after the final regenerative procedure. Adverse events were monitored.

Results

The mean follow-up period was 427.1 days. The TM regenerated in all cases, but pinhole reperforation occurred in two cases, and the final closure rate was 90.5% (19 of 21). Hearing improved to 24.9 ± 7.6 dB on average before surgery and to 13.8 ± 5.4 dB after surgery. The AB gap improved from 12.9 ± 8.0 to 5.2 ± 3.5 dB. The myringoplasty/tympanoplasty group had significantly lower AB gap improvement compared with the TMRT group. There were no adverse events.

Conclusions

TMRT can be expected to regenerate near-normal TMs with a high closure ratio, resulting in better-hearing improvement compared with the myringoplasty/tympanoplasty group, and is an effective treatment for children with long life expectancy.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^e999f581]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^d5b8bb98]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Ear tubes — complications and tube course include perforation, tube position, and extrusion/retention timelines. Perforation risk is reported as "About 1–2 out of every 100 children" after a short-term tube, with "up to 1 in every 5 children" after a long-term tube, and "The hole will often close on its own" or can be repaired. Tubes almost always fall out into the ear canal, though "Very rarely" one can fall "into the middle ear". Most tubes come out "within 12 to 24 months", while tubes still present "after 2 to 3 years" can be removed; early extrusion can occur "before 6 months". Scarring on the eardrum is "usually of no concern".

### Preoperative factors affecting tympanic membrane regeneration therapy using an atelocollagen and basic fibroblast growth factor [^8360f91c]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The use of growth factors to achieve closure of perforated tympanic membranes (TMs) has recently become popular. However, preoperative factors affecting treatment outcomes have seldom been discussed.

Objective

To evaluate preoperative factors contributing to the success or failure of healing of perforated TMs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study of 153 patients (48 males and 105 females) in whom the duration of perforation was longer than 6 months prior to treatment and who were observed for at least 1 year after treatment between July 2009 and June 2012. Eight factors considered likely to affect the outcome of perforation closure were statistically evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Interventions

Each perforated TM was filled with a synthetic graft material (atelocollagen sponge and silicone membrane) containing human basic fibroblast growth factor to promote wound healing after TM perforation closure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Complete closure vs residual perforation.

Results

After 1 year of follow-up, 101 patients (66.0%) achieved complete closure, 30 patients (19.6%) had residual pinhole perforations (< 1 mm diameter), and 22 patients (14.4%) had larger residual perforations. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for each explanatory variable identified a TM without calcification (odds ratio [OR], 2.68 [95% CI, 1.17–6.15]; P = 0.03) and a perforation not involving the tympanic annulus (odds ratio, 2.75 [95% CI, 1.09–6.94]; P = 0.04) as significant. Insignificant factors included perforation margin identified on microscopy (OR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.99–6.27]; P < .001), perforation margin without epithelial migration (OR, 7.27 [95% CI, 0.66–80.49]; P = 0.11), absence of preoperative otorrhea (P = 0.38), no previous ear operations (P = 0.82), perforation size (P = 0.14), and patient age (P = 0.26).

Conclusions and Relevance

Tympanic membrane regeneration therapy can be applied to all patients, except those with cholesteatoma or malignant neoplasm. However, patients with severe calcification of the TM and those with marginal perforations close to the fibrous annulus should be treated more prudently to achieve perforation closure.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^fa106e16]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) evidence-based statements — clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal (Recommendation); clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy) (Recommendation); the clinician should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain (Strong recommendation); clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy (Strong recommendation); clinicians should use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE (Recommendation); clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops and should enhance delivery of topical drops when the ear canal is obstructed by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both (Recommendation); when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should recommend a non-ototoxic topical preparation (Recommendation); if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness (Recommendation).

### Comparative study of fibroblast growth factor 2 and ofloxacin ear drops for repairing large traumatic perforations: a randomized controlled study [^8f8686c7]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the healing outcome of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), ofloxacin ear drops (OFLX) and spontaneous healing for repairing large traumatic tympanic membrane (TM) perforations.

Material and Methods

A total of 75 traumatic large perforations with > 1/4 of TM were randomly divided into FGF2 (n = 25), OFLX (n = 25), and spontaneous healing (n = 25) groups. The closure rates, closure times, and hearing gains were compared at 3 months.

Results

At 2 weeks after treatment, the closure rate was 95.8% in the FGF2 group, 96.0% in the ofloxacin ear drops group, and 14.3% in the spontaneous healing group (P < 0.01), respectively. At 3 months after treatment, the closure rate was 100% in the FGF2 group, 100% in the OFLX group, and 85.7% in the spontaneous healing group, no among-group differences were significant (P > 0.05). The mean closure time was 9.69 ± 2.46 days in the FGF2 group, 9.45 ± 2.32 days in the OFLX group, and 30.94 ± 8.95 days in the spontaneous healing group (P < 0.01). The mean ABG was 10.37 ± 2.51 dB for the FGF2 group, 11.01 ± 1.31 dB for the OFLX group, and 10.86 ± 1.94 dB for the spontaneous healing group, no significant difference was found among three groups (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

This study suggested that both FGF2 and OFLX significantly shortened the mean closure time and improved the closure rate compared with spontaneous healing for repairing large traumatic perforations, while the healing outcome wasn't significantly different among FGF2 and OFLX groups.

### Tympanic membrane regeneration therapy… [^0306c2c8]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

After 1 year of follow-up, 101 patients achieved complete closure, 30 patients had residual pinhole perforations, and 22 patients had larger residual perforations. Using a long thin needle, 0. 1 to
0. 2 mL of BFGF solution is applied from a gap between the silicone membrane and the perforation onto the atelocollagen membrane to complete the procedure. The entire procedure is completed in approximately 30 minutes. The silicone membrane is removed at a follow-up visit 2 to 3 weeks after the procedure. If a perforation remains, steps 1 to 4 are repeated until the perforation is completely closed. Nine of the 153 patients developed reperforation more than 1 year after TM perforation closure by regeneration therapy and underwent reoperation. The mean duration of perforation prior to treatment was 32. 0 years.

Small, medium, and large perforations, defined as those involving 1, 2, and 3 or more quadrants of the TM, respectively, were found in 73, 55, and 25 patients before treatment. Seventeen patients were recognized as having otorrhea at the first visit. We applied ear treatments, as mentioned, for at least 8 weeks. In 8 patients, the otorrhea stopped, whereas 9 patients underwent regenerative therapy despite the presence of otorrhea. The mean time it took for the ear treatment to heal the otorrhea was 3. 9 weeks. At 3 months after treatment, 129 patients achieved complete closure, 9 patients were found to have perforations smaller than 1 mm in diameter, and 15 patients were found to have perforations of 1 mm or larger in diameter. In the initial study, not all patients were observed for longer than 1 year. In this study, complete closure was achieved in 101 patients after at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up, although 129 had achieved complete closure 3 months after the operation.

### Treatment of otitis media with perforated tympanic… [^cc110cee]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best treatment for otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation. Evidence-Based Answer. Evidence Summary There are three different types of otitis media associated with a perforation of the tympanic membrane: acute otitis media complicated by perforation of the tympanic membrane, presenting as otorrhea; acute otitis media in a patient with tympanostomy tubes; and chronic suppurative otitis media, defined as tympanic membrane perforation with chronic inflammation of the middle ear and persistent otorrhea for two weeks to three months.

1. ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA WITH PERFORATION A meta-analysis of six RCTs of children six months to 12 years of age with acute otitis media examined the effectiveness of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid versus placebo or delayed treatment in reducing pain, fever, or both at three to seven days.

The authors concluded that antibiotics were more effective than placebo or delayed treatment in children with acute otitis media and otorrhea versus children with acute otitis media without otorrhea.
2. Clinical cure, defined as cessation of otorrhea at 18 days, was
84. 6 percent in the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone group versus 58. 5 percent in the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid group.
3. 5 Topical therapy with non-quinolone antibiotics appeared to work about as well, but the data were not as consistent. A 2006 Cochrane review of five generally short studies of variable quality found that topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better at one to two weeks than systemic quinolone or nonquinolone antibiotics. 6.

### The clinical course of acute otitis media in high-risk Australian aboriginal children: a longitudinal study [^c4eafccd]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Onset and progression of AOM with perforation

The changes in TM position and diagnosis over the 219 examinations are shown in Figure 1. Of the 14 children who entered the study with a diagnosis of AOM with perforation, two TMs had already healed and six were functionally intact (ie. pinhole perforation only seen on pneumatic otoscopy). Both children who initially had fresh discharge obscuring an intact TM subsequently experienced recurrent perforations (A02 and A03). In the other 12 children with identifiable perforations, discharge continued seeping through the perforation almost immediately after completing the cleaning or swabbing of the middle ear canal. Eight TMs were initially perforated and in the neutral position. Over time, five of these also became functionally intact (ie. the perforation size reduced and the TM became bulging). AOM without perforation progressed to perforation in three children (A01, A10 and A26). In each case, the TM was observed to be bulging prior to perforation. On one occasion when a new perforation was observed, the TM had perforated and healed again within a 24 hour period (A26).

Figure 1
Position and integrity of tympanic membrane in 31 Australian Aboriginal children following a new diagnosis of acute otitis media. Shaded = discharge present; C = chronic perforation; P = acute perforation; B = bulging; n = neutral; R = retracted; 0 = no bulging; 1 = mild bulging; 2 = moderate bulging; 3 = marked bulging. ✱ = past history of otorrhea.

There were two patterns of resolution of AOM with perforation. In four children, the suppurative process resolved and the perforation became dry (A07, A18, A22, A29). Two of these TMs subsequently healed during the study period. More commonly, the perforation appeared to be healing while the suppurative process was ongoing (A01, A02, A03, A10, A12, A14, A20, A26, and A28). Perforations were observed to heal and re-perforate in 4 children (A02, A03, A12, and A14). In one child, the right and left TM healed and re-perforated 8 times over a 6 week period (A02), confirming that healing and re-perforation can occur frequently.

### The effects of hyaluronic acid, epidermal growth factor, and mitomycin in an experimental model of acute traumatic tympanic membrane perforation [^1abd9ca1]. Otology & Neurotology (2003). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of hyaluronic acid, epidermal growth factor, and mitomycin C on the healing of acute experimental traumatic perforations of the tympanic membrane.

Background

Most acute perforations of the tympanic membrane heal spontaneously. However, some form of surgical treatment (i.e., myringoplasty) is needed for nonhealing perforations. Because the closure occurs by squamous epithelial migration, drugs that stimulate this regenerative process may aid in the closure of the perforation, obviating the need for more extensive treatments.

Methods

Bilateral perforations of the tympanic membrane were created in 30 rats, divided into three groups (A, B, C). The perforations in the right ears were treated with hyaluronic acid, epidermal growth factor, or mitomycin C. Those in the left ears were left untreated for comparison. To examine the healing process in different periods, 5 animals were killed in each group at days 3, 5, 7, 9 and 14. The other 5 animals in each group were observed daily to determine the duration of perforation closures. Thirty surgical specimens (5 right sides from each group and all 15 left sides in all groups) were histopathologically examined for tympanic membrane thickness, fibroblastic reaction, neovascularization, and crust morphology.

Results

Hyaluronic acid and epidermal growth factor applications significantly shortened the healing in acute experimental traumatic perforations of the tympanic membrane (p = 0.0432); however, the difference between them was not significant (p = 0.3160). On the other side, tympanic membrane perforations treated with topical mitomycin C showed no evidence of closure. There were no significant differences in the histologic parameters between the treated groups and their contralateral control ears.

Conclusion

Hyaluronic acid and epidermal growth factor accelerated the closure of acute tympanic membrane perforations in rats. This may make them clinically useful in augmenting the efficiency of conservative treatments of acute perforations of the tympanic membrane.

### The topical use of insulin accelerates the healing of traumatic tympanic membrane perforations [^0829835a]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

In recent years, there has been a tendency to search for regulatory substances that can optimize the healing process of perforated tympanic membranes (TMs). The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of using topical insulin on the healing process of traumatic TMs perforations.

Study Design

Experimental.

Methods

Tympanic membranes of 20 Wistar rats were perforated in two sections, anterior and posterior to the malleus. The rats were divided into two groups: control and insulin. The insulin group was treated with topical regular insulin. The TMs were histologically examined 3, 5, and 7 days after the perforation through a morphometric analysis of the epithelial layer thickness, perforation size, TM cross-sectional area, semiquantitative and qualitative evaluation of the collagen production by polarization microscopy, and immunohistochemical evaluation of epithelial cells and myofibroblasts markers.

Results

Insulin accelerated the healing process of the perforated TMs (P < 0.01); stimulated early thickening of the outer epithelial layer (P < 0.01); contributed to a larger identification of the antipankeratin antibody as epithelial marker (P < 0.05); and increased labeling of smooth muscle anti-alpha-actin antibody (P < 0.05), indicating greater proliferation of myofibroblasts. When the topical insulin was used, it resulted in a greater formation of collagen tissue (P < 0.05), with thicker and better-organized collagen fibers (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Insulin accelerated the healing process of TMs traumatic perforations.

### Otitis media in young aboriginal children from remote communities in Northern and central Australia: a cross-sectional survey [^c7538dc4]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Middle ear disease (otitis media) is common and frequently severe in Australian Aboriginal children. There have not been any recent large-scale surveys using clear definitions and a standardised middle ear assessment. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of middle ear disease (otitis media) in a high-risk population of young Aboriginal children from remote communities in Northern and Central Australia.

Methods

709 Aboriginal children aged 6–30 months living in 29 communities from 4 health regions participated in the study between May and November 2001. Otitis media (OM) and perforation of the tympanic membrane (TM) were diagnosed by tympanometry, pneumatic otoscopy, and video-otoscopy. We used otoscopic criteria (bulging TM or recent perforation) to diagnose acute otitis media.

Results

914 children were eligible to participate in the study and 709 were assessed (78%). Otitis media affected nearly all children (91%, 95%CI 88, 94). Overall prevalence estimates adjusted for clustering by community were: 10% (95%CI 8, 12) for unilateral otitis media with effusion (OME); 31% (95%CI 27, 34) for bilateral OME; 26% (95%CI 23, 30) for acute otitis media without perforation (AOM/woP); 7% (95%CI 4, 9) for AOM with perforation (AOM/wiP); 2% (95%CI 1, 3) for dry perforation; and 15% (95%CI 11, 19) for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The perforation prevalence ranged from 0–60% between communities and from 19–33% between regions. Perforations of the tympanic membrane affected 40% of children in their first 18 months of life. These were not always persistent.

Conclusion

Overall, 1 in every 2 children examined had otoscopic signs consistent with suppurative ear disease and 1 in 4 children had a perforated tympanic membrane. Some of the children with intact tympanic membranes had experienced a perforation that healed before the survey. In this high-risk population, high rates of tympanic perforation were associated with high rates of bulging of the tympanic membrane.

### The effects of fibroblast growth factor-2 delivered via a gelfoam patch on the regeneration of myringosclerotic traumatic eardrum perforations lying close to the malleus [^05205ed6]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the effects of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) delivered via a Gelfoam patch on the regeneration of myringosclerotic traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) lying close to the malleus.

Study Design

A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study.

Setting

A university-affiliated teaching hospital.

Subjects and Methods

We prospectively analyzed, in a randomized manner, the outcomes of treatment for traumatic TMPs constituting > 25% of the tympanic membrane. The closure rates, closure times, and otorrhea rates were compared among patients treated via FGF-2-containing Gelfoam patches, Gelfoam patches alone, and observation only.

Results

We analyzed data from 138 patients. The perforation closure rates in the FGF-2 plus Gelfoam patch, Gelfoam patch, and observation alone groups were 97.9, 89.8, and 70.7%, respectively. Both the FGF-2 plus Gelfoam and Gelfoam alone groups exhibited significantly higher closure rates than the observational group (both p < 0.05). The mean closure times were 15.7 ± 5.1, 24.8 ± 4.9, and 35.7 ± 9.2days in the FGF-2 plus Gelfoam patch, Gelfoam patch alone, and observation alone groups, respectively. The FGF-2 plus Gelfoam patch group exhibited a significantly shorter closure time than the Gelfoam patch alone and observation alone groups (p < 0.05). The incidences of purulent otorrhea were 14.6, 6.1, and 4.9% in the FGF-2 plus Gelfoam patch, Gelfoam patch alone, and observation alone groups, respectively. Surprisingly, 7 of 7 (100.0%) perforations associated with purulent otorrhea completely closed in the FGF-2 plus Gelfoam patch group; however, no such perforation healed in either the Gelfoam alone or observation alone group.

Conclusions

FGF-2 plus Gelfoam patching significantly shortened the closure time compared to observation and Gelfoam patching alone, and it significantly improved the closure rate (compared to observation alone) of myringosclerotic perforations lying close the malleus. FGF-2 plus Gelfoam patching is a valuable, minimally invasive alternative treatment that may be readily applied to outpatient settings.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3758e4d8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### The impact of platelet-derived growth factor on closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^51debdab]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with tympanic membrane (TM) perforations often have infections, and repetitive topical treatment may be required. These infections can be prevented by permanent closure of the TM perforation. Different surgical treatment options have been described, but noninvasive techniques may be preferred as they carry less risk than surgery. One noninvasive approach is to induce wound healing by application of growth factors. The effect and clinical use of applying topical platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for decrease of size and closure of chronic TM perforations is evaluated.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Twenty patients with chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma for more than 3 months.

Intervention

Topical treatment with PDGF or placebo applied weekly to the TM for 6 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Success rate, defined as a reduction of perforation size of 50% or more to determine relative changes of the perforation size; effect of initial size and location of TM perforation on success rate; and air and bone conduction thresholds to determine air-bone gap measured before treatment.

Results

Randomization made matching pretreatment perforation size of the 2 study groups impossible, and the initial rate perforation/TM was significantly smaller in the PDGF group. No difference between the 2 groups was found for perforation/TM less than 10%. However, success rate did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (power = 0.8), and the effect of PDGF was found to be small (-2%; standard deviation, ± 49%). Initial size and position of the TM perforation were not significant factors determining success. Mean air-bone gap for the frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz was 22.5 dB.

Conclusion

The topical application of PDGF as an office treatment for chronic otitis media is not a favorable alternative to surgery.

### Outcomes in children with perforated tympanic membranes after tympanostomy tube placement: results using a pilot treatment algorithm [^9d460bf9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to examine the success of a pilot treatment algorithm for tympanic membrane perforations in children after tympanostomy tube placement.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review of children with diagnosed tympanic membrane perforations after tympanostomy tube placement from 1998 to 2003 at a tertiary care children's hospital was performed. The patients had been treated according to an algorithm used by 2 pediatric otolaryngologists for management of tympanic membrane perforations: observation vs myringoplasty. Success rates were examined.

Results

Ninety-five children were identified, 27% of whom had nonhealing perforations after tube extrusion; 73% of the perforations were caused by a retained tube. The median duration of tube retention was 48 months, ranging from 13 to 120 months. After the treatment protocol, 76% of the patients underwent gelatin film or paper patch myringoplasty, 23% had adipose myringoplasty, and 1% were observed. Overall, 91% had healed perforations after the first intervention. Among those requiring a second intervention, the sizes of initial perforations were between 15% and 40%, with postrepair perforation sizes between 5% and 40%. In addition, 75% of those requiring a second intervention underwent tympanoplasty repair and 25% had fat patch myringoplasty. None required a third intervention.

Conclusions

Our treatment algorithm for children with tympanic membrane perforations after tympanostomy tube placement appears to be successful and is an excellent model for other clinicians.

### Otomycosis with tympanic membrane perforation: a review of the literature [^986cac2f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of the present study was to assess the rate of tympanic membrane perforation in patients with otomycosis and to discuss the literature regarding the difficulties in managing this condition.

Data Sources

Literature review from 1999 to 2019, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline.

Study Selection

We searched for eligible articles concerning the clinical entity of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis. Case series and clinical trials were the types of articles included for this review.

Data Extraction

All the articles described in the study selection were used for this review.

Data Synthesis

Statistical techniques were not used.

Conclusion

Based on the available literature, it seems that tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis is not uncommon. The presence of this complication is associated with 2 problems: Antimycotic solutions are irritant to middle ear and may be ototoxic to the cochlea. Although most cases of fungus caused tympanic membrane (TM) perforation resolve with proper medical treatment, in a few patients a tympanoplasty may be required.

### Ventilation time of the middle ear in otitis media with effusion (OME) after CO ₂ laser myringotomy [^066da49a]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the transtympanic ventilation time, the healing course of the tympanic membrane, the early and late complications, and the recurrence rate of otitis media with effusion (OME) within 6 months after CO2 laser myringotomy with the CO2 laser otoscope Otoscan.

Study Design

Prospective clinical study.

Materials and Methods

In this study, laser myringotomy was performed with the CO2 laser otoscope Otoscan in a patient population comprising 81 children (159 ears) with a history of otitis media with effusion (OME) associated with adenoidal and sometimes tonsillar hyperplasia. The procedure on the tympanic membrane was accordingly combined with an adenoidectomy, a CO2 laser tonsillotomy, or a tonsillectomy and therefore performed under insufflation anesthesia. In all ears, approximately 2 mm circular perforations were created in the lower anterior quadrants with a power of 12 to 15 W, a pulse duration of 180 msec, and a scanned area of 2.2 mm in diameter.

Results

None of the children showed postoperative impairment of cochleovestibular function such as sensorineural hearing loss or nystagmus. Otomicroscopic and videoendoscopic monitoring documented the closure time and healing pattern of tympanic membrane perforations. The mean closure time was found to be 16.35 days (minimum, 8 days; maximum, 34 days). As a rule, an onion-skin-like membrane of keratinized material was seen in the former myringotomy perforations at the time of closure. At the follow-up 6 months later, the condition of the tympanic membrane of 129 ears (81.1%) could be checked by otomicroscopy and videoendoscopy and the hearing ability by audiometry and tympanometry. The CO2 laser myringotomy sites appeared normal and irritation-free. Two of the tympanic membranes examined (1.6%) showed atrophic scar formation, and 1 (0.8%) had a perforation with a diameter of 0.3 mm. The perforation was seen closed in a control otoscopy 15 months postoperatively. OME recurred in 26.3% of the ears seen intraoperatively with mucous secretion (n = 38) and in 13.5% of the ears with serous secretion (n = 37; P < .05).

Conclusion

The most important principle in treating OME is ventilation of the tympanic cavity. CO2 laser myringotomy achieves this through a self-healing perforation in which its diameter roughly determines the duration of transtympanic ventilation. Laser myringotomy competes with ventilation tube insertion in the treatment of OME. It may be a useful alternative in the surgical management of secretory otitis media.

### Surgery for tympanic membrane retraction pockets [^acec90ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Tympanic membrane retractions are commonly managed by ENT surgeons. There is currently no consensus as to the indications, timing and options for management of this condition.

Objectives

To study the effectiveness of different surgical options in the management of tympanic membrane retractions.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2010 Issue 1); PubMed (1950 to 2010); EMBASE (1974 to 2010); CINAHL (1982 to 2010); BIOSIS Previews; ISI Web of Science; CAB Abstracts; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; ISCTRN; UKCRN; ICTRP and Google. The date of the search was 17 March 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the surgical management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets in adults or children. Staging of the retraction using a known system must have been performed. Studies of cholesteatoma or perforations were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently collected and analysed data to minimise the effects of selection and reporting bias.

Main Results

Two RCTs were included, involving 71 participants. The first study showed no statistically significant benefit of cartilage graft tympanoplasty over a watch and wait policy for either disease progression or hearing outcome. The second showed no additional benefit from the insertion of ventilation tubes over cartilage tympanoplasty alone with regards to hearing outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence currently exists to either support or refute the role of surgery in the management of tympanic membrane retractions. Higher quality studies are much needed to ascertain this.

### The effect of external auditory canal packing duration on healing after endoscopic cartilage myringoplasty [^b3e7e0b3]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The external auditory canal (EAC) packing is widely used in otosurgery and is considered to promote hemostasis and to support tympanic membrane grafts. However, few studies have investigated the effects of packing removal time on healing.

Objective

We investigated the effect of EAC packing duration on healing after endoscopic cartilage myringoplasty in patients with chronic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Materials and Methods

Patients with chronic TMPs who underwent endoscopic "push-through" cartilage myringoplasty were divided into early and late groups based on the length of time before EAC packing was removed. The graft success rate, eardrum appearance, and hearing gain were assessed 3 months after surgery.

Results

The study included 137 patients. Three months after surgery, the graft success rate was 83.5% (66/79) in the early group and 94.8% (55/58) in the late group (P = 0.042). The graft was displaced in 8 (10.1%) patients in the early group and in 1 (1.7%) patient in the late group (P = 0.050). No epithelialization was found on the surface of the grafts in the early group, whereas epithelialization was nearly complete 4 weeks after surgery in the late group.

Conclusions

Delaying removal of the EAC packing after endoscopic cartilage myringoplasty may promote tympanic membrane better healing and cartilage graft epithelialization and improve the appearance of the eardrum.

### Comparison of the medical costs and effects of large traumatic eardrum perforations treatment [^eb5d3d10]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the medical costs and effects of ofloxacin drops (OFLX), gelatin sponge patches, spontaneous healing, and endoscopic myringoplasty on healing in large tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Methods

In total, 100 patients with large traumatic TMPs involving > 50% of the eardrum were randomly assigned to OFLX, gelatin sponge, spontaneous healing, or endoscopic myringoplasty treatment groups. Medical costs, closure times, and closure rates were compared among groups at 6 months.

Results

The closure rates in the OFLX, gelatin sponge, spontaneous healing, and endoscopic myringoplasty groups were 95.7%, 82.6%, 58.3%, and 91.7%, respectively (P = 0.05). The mean closure time was 13.73 ± 6.14 days in the OFLX group, 15.89 ± 4.95 days in the gelatin sponge group, 48.36 ± 10.37 days in the spontaneous healing group, and 12 days in the endoscopic myringoplasty group (P < 0.001). The mean medical costs in US dollars were $15.53 ± 3.15, $103.64 ± 111.58, $11.17 ± 1.33, and $715.90 in the OFLX, gelatin sponge, spontaneous healing, and endoscopic myringoplasty groups, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Although the gelatin sponge and myringoplasty treatments significantly shortened the closure time compared with spontaneous healing, the gelatin sponge patch did not significantly improve the closure rate, and the medical cost of myringoplasty was significantly higher than that of the other treatments. In contrast, OFLX significantly shortened closure time and had a higher closure rate than spontaneous healing, and the medical costs were lower than those of the gelatin sponge and myringoplasty procedures.

### Intratympanic lipopolysaccharide elevates systemic fluorescent gentamicin uptake in the cochlea [^ba715e81]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Establishment of the‐Induced MouseModel

Intratympanic injection of LPS has been widely adopted to establish animal AOM models. In our AOM mouse model, empirical clinical manifestations were detected by otic endoscopy as well as histological hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Fig. 1). The normal appearance of the TM was thin and transparent with light reflection (Fig. 1B). Immediately after the i.t. LPS injection, an aperture in the membrane could be seen, and the middle ear cavity was filled with translucent liquid (Fig. 1C). After 48 hours, the TM became congested and thickened, light reflection disappeared, the middle ear cavity was filled with turbid liquid (Fig. 1D–F), membrane perforation healed, and a healing pseudomembrane covered on the prior perforation (Fig. 1F). Microscopic images of H&E‐stained samples confirmed the thickening of TM (Fig. 1G, H). The membrane thickening appeared more prominent at the inner mucosal epithelial layer facing the middle ear cavity (Fig. 1G).

Treatment EnhancedUptake by Cochlear Tissues

Three treatment groups were initially tested for 24, 48, and 72‐hour post‐injection, to determine the effective time of i.t. LPS injection on GTTR uptake, by outer hair cells (OHC) and by the SV. After LPS treatment, the SV GTTR uptake increased by 71%, 32%, and 18% in the 24, 48, and 72‐hour groups, respectively (Fig. 2A). In comparison, the increase of OHC GTTR uptake was 32%, 43%, and 27%, respectively (Fig. 2B). A significant correlation existed between the SV and OHC GTTR uptake for each post‐treatment time point, manifested by a significant non‐zero slope of the linear regression (Figs. 2C, S1 and Table S2). Given the greatest OHC GTTR uptake enhancement, 48‐hour LPS post‐treatment was selected for the following experiments, and we expanded the sample size in this group to detect treatment effect in detail in terms of region‐specific GTTR uptake. In all ears (n = 8) with LPS treatment for 48 hour, more intensive OHC GTTR fluorescence was observed among all three cochlear turns (Fig. 3).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^a020e8ce]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) with structural damage — The text states individuals "should have prompt tympanostomy tube insertion when there is real or impending structural damage to the tympanic membrane caused by retraction (from negative middle ear pressure) or collapse (from atrophy or atelectasis)". It adds, "Although there are no randomized trials to support this approach, inserting the tube will equalize middle ear pressure and eliminate middle ear effusion, which may help avoid more extensive otologic surgery for ears with retraction pockets, atelectasis, or early signs of cholesteatoma".

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^4a8f658f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — natural history supports observation: "OME occurring after an episode of AOM resolves in 75% to 90% of cases by the third month". Among newly diagnosed OME with a type B tympanogram, "56 will improve… by 3 months; 72 will have improved at 6 months; and 87 will no longer have a flat tracing at 12 months", whereas with chronic OME, "19 will resolve by 3 months, 25 by 6 months, 31 by 12 months, and 33… by 24 months". A type B tympanogram is "an imperfect measure of OME (81% to 94% sensitivity and 74% to 94% specificity vs myringotomy)". The guideline notes "The recommendation for a 3-month period of observation is based on a clear preponderance of benefit over harm".

### The impact of adding platelet-rich plasma during fat graft myringoplasty for managing medium-sized tympanic membrane perforations: a prospective randomized case-control study [^d1c2c3da]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding platelet-rich plasma (PRP) during FGM to close medium-sized TM perforations.

Methods

This prospective randomized case-control study was conducted from February 2017 to March 2022. We included 320 patients with a medium-sized TM perforation with inactive mucosal otitis media. Transcanal FGM managed all patients under general or local anesthesia according to the patient preference. According to PRP, patients were divided into two groups: the first with PRP (170 patients) and the other without PRP (150 patients). We evaluated the closure rate of both groups one month, six months, and one year after the surgery. Also, we assessed the audiological performance before and one year after the operation for the patients with a successful closure.

Results

The closure rate was 87.6% in the first group and 72.7% in the second group, with a statistically significant difference between both groups as the P-value, was 0.001. Successful closure of the ABG to < 10 dB occurred in 95.3% of group A and 90.8% of group B without a statistically significant difference between both groups (P-value = 0.163).

Conclusions

This prospective comparative study on a relatively large number of patients revealed that FGM effectively closed medium-sized TM perforations. It also significantly improved postoperative audiological performance in both groups. Adding PRP during the FGM enhanced the closure success and the healing process without recorded complications. We recommend using the PRP in the routine FGM for closing medium-sized TM perforations.

### Otitis media in children vaccinated during consecutive 7-valent or 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination schedules [^090b8490]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

General health measures

Common conditions of childhood were recorded at the time of ear assessment by direct observation; the child's skin (head, arms, legs and trunk) was examined for the presence of scabies, tinea, skin sores or other skin condition; presence of nasal discharge (visible at a distance of 1 meter), and any cough (spontaneous or cough on request, either wet or dry). We categorised 'not sure' as absent. Antibiotics and other treatments or referrals were provided to participants according to local guidelines.

Definitions of OM

We categorized middle ear states as follows: (1) normal; (2) otitis media with effusion (OME); (3) acute otitis media without perforation (AOMwoP); (4) AOM with perforation (AOMwiP); (5) dry perforation; and (6) chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The final middle ear diagnosis reflected the child's more severely affected ear (highest category). We based our criteria for diagnosis on recommendations for clinical practice in this population: (i) OME – intact and non-bulging tympanic membrane (TM) and Type B tympanogram; (ii) AOMwoP – any bulging of the TM and Type B tympanogram; (iii) AOMwiP – middle ear discharge observed and TM perforation recently healed or present for less than six weeks or covering less than 2% of the pars tensa of the TM; (iv) dry perforation – TM perforation without any discharge observed; (v) CSOM – middle ear discharge observed and perforation present for longer than six weeks and covering at least 2% of the pars tensa of the TM. We also include combination categories of any suppurative OM (any AOM, AOMwiP or CSOM) and any TMP (any AOMwiP, dry perforation or CSOM). Where duration of discharge was not known, size of perforation was used to distinguish AOMwiP and CSOM. Where otosocopy was not successful we used the child's tympanometry result and defined the child's status as OME if either ear had a Type B tympanogram. We asked the mother if she thought her child had ear pain that day or during the previous evening. These a priori diagnostic criteria have been applied in all our surveillance and clinical trials conducted in this population since 2001.

### How does closure of tympanic membrane perforations affect hearing and middle ear mechanics? An evaluation in a patient cohort and temporal bone models [^e74d8076]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine how tympanic membrane (TM) perforations and their closure, using a paper-patch technique, affect middle-ear mechanics and, thus, conductive hearing for different sizes of the TM perforation.

Study Design

Temporal bone (TB) study and prospective clinical trial.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Nine patients with chronic otitis media for more than 3 months.

Intervention

The TM perforations were closed with a paper patch in all 9 patients. In 5 of 9 patients, myringoplasty was performed. Matching TM perforations were created in a TB model (n = 8) and closed using the paper patch.

Main Outcome Measures

Air-bone gap was measured in all 9 patients of the patient cohort with TM perforations before and after closure and in 5 patients after myringoplasty. Stapes velocity and sound pressure difference between the ear canal and middle-ear cavity were measured in TBs with intact TM, with TM perforations, and with the perforations closed by the paper patch. All measurements in the patient cohort and TBs were performed for different sizes of TM perforations to determine if the effects varied as a function of size.

Results

Degree of the air-bone gap differed as a function of size of the TM perforations and its recovery after closure, and myringoplasty was independent of the size of the TM perforation in the frequency range of 0.25 to 4 kHz. In the TB measurements, although pressure difference across the TM was almost fully recovered by closing the perforation with a paper patch, recovery of the stapes motion was limited at frequencies above 4.5 kHz for larger sizes of TM perforations.

Conclusion

Hearing loss caused by TM perforations depends on the size of the perforation. Hearing returns almost completely across the frequency range after closure except above 4 kHz for larger perforations. This is because the structural damage caused by large TM perforations cannot be completely restored by application of a paper patch.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^b6afa48f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Selective reporting

Kitahara 2016 used a ratio of pre/post‐treatment values to define vertigo control as "better", "worse" or "no change". However, the authors only report the number of participants in whom vertigo resolved completely over the course of the study. Although the study was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, the only outcome listed here is "all cause mortality". This seems a surprising choice of primary outcome measure (and is also not reported in the publication). There was no report of any adverse events, including relatively common complications of ventilation tube placement, such as otorrhoea or tympanic membrane perforation. We rated it as high risk.

Thomsen 1981 did not publish a protocol. It was unclear if all outcomes are fully reported. Also, there were no adverse events published at the 12‐month follow‐up. We rated it as unclear risk.

Other potential sources of bias

No additional sources of bias were identified in Kitahara 2016.

We are aware that the data presented in Thomsen 1981 were subsequently re‐analysed leading to different conclusions (Welling 2000). Also, there was no control around how patients were treated medically during the nine‐year follow‐up study, which could have a significant impact on the results. We rated it as high risk.

Effects of interventions

See: Table 1; Table 2

1. Ventilation tubes compared to no intervention (plus medical therapy for both groups)

This comparison was addressed by Kitahara 2016. All follow‐up was conducted at 24 months.

1.1. Improvement in vertigo

1.1.1. Global score

This study did not consider improvement in vertigo using a global score.

1.1.2. Vertigo frequency

1.1.2.1. 3 to < 6 months

The study did not report at this time point.

1.1.2.2. 6 to ≤ 12 months

The study did not report at this time point.

1.1.2.3. > 12 months

The risk ratio (RR) for improvement in the frequency of vertigo (complete resolution) for those receiving ventilation tubes was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.97; 1 study; 133 participants; Analysis 1.1; very low‐certainty evidence).

1.2. Change in vertigo

This outcome was not reported.

### Heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor heals chronic tympanic membrane perforations with advantage over fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor in an animal model [^b921d051]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

That heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) heals chronic tympanic membrane (TM) perforations at higher rates than fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in an animal model.

Background

A nonsurgical treatment for chronic TM perforation would benefit those unable to access surgery or those unable to have surgery, as well as reducing the cost of tympanoplasty. Growth factor (GF) treatments have been reported in the literature with variable success with the lack of a suitable animal providing a major obstacle.

Methods

The GFs were tested in a validated mouse model of chronic TM perforation. A bioabsorbable hydrogel polymer was used to deliver the GF at a steady concentration as it dissolved over 4 weeks. A control (polymer only, n = 18) was compared to polymer loaded with HB-EGF (5 μg/ml, n = 18), FGF2 (100 μg/ml, n = 19), and EGF (250 μg/ml, n = 19). Perforations were inspected at 4 weeks.

Results

The healing rates, as defined as 100% perforation closure, were control (5/18, 27.8%), HB-EGF (15/18, 83.3%), FGF2 (6/19, 31.6%), and EGF (3/19, 15.8%). There were no differences between FGF2 (p = 0.80) and EGF (p = 0.31) with control healing rates. HB-EGF (p = 0.000001) showed a significant difference for healing. The HB-EGF healed TMs showed layers similar to a normal TM, whereas the other groups showed a lack of epithelial migration.

Conclusion

This study confirms the advantage of HB-EGF over two other commonly used growth factors and is a promising nonsurgical treatment of chronic TM perforations.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3141b1be]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

Reporting checklist for preoperative HRCT of the temporal bone in otosclerosis

False-negative CT findings may occur in some cases of fenestral otosclerosis in the sclerotic phase when there are no irregularities of the bone contour. The imaging differentials of fenestral otosclerosis are few. The cochlear cleft is a small non-osseous space in the otic capsule in the region of the fissula ante fenestram. It is a normal variant, commonly seen in children, and its incidence decreases with age. An inexperienced reader may mistake a cochlear cleft for a demineralised focus in the region of the fissula ante fenestram (Fig. 7). Tympanosclerois with post-inflammatory fixation of the stapes footplate may present clinically with identical CHL, especially with a healed tympanic membrane. This may cause a diagnostic dilemma in certain cases, although, this can be differentiated on CT by observing signs of inflammation in the middle ear and an underpneumatised mastoid.
