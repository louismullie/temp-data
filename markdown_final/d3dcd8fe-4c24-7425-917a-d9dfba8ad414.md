## Question

Pacemaker is pacing irregularly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why a pacemaker is pacing irregularly and how to evaluate and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "irregular pacing" looks like on ECG and whether it reflects true malfunction or expected device behavior. Then, I should verify the most common causes, including sensing issues, capture problems, and algorithmic features. Next, I will outline a prioritized diagnostic approach, starting with immediate safety checks and moving to device interrogation, ECG analysis, and targeted testing. Finally, I will consider management strategies tailored to the identified cause, including when to reprogram, replace leads, or escalate to extraction or temporary pacing, and I will close with a concise decision framework and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical meaning of "irregular pacing". On surface ECG, this can manifest as inconsistent pacing spikes, variable coupling intervals, intermittent failure to capture, or apparent pauses, and I need to distinguish these from pseudo-malfunction due to normal algorithms or intrinsic rhythm competition, because many modern features can mimic malfunction and confuse interpretation if I don't check the device diagnostics carefully [^1162UVGo] [^117Grfbu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize the likely etiologies into sensing abnormalities, capture failure, and algorithmic or hardware issues. Sensing problems include oversensing of T waves, myopotentials, or electromagnetic interference, and undersensing of small intrinsic signals, while capture failure reflects elevated thresholds or lead issues, and algorithmic causes include rate-smoothing, MVP, mode switching, and pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, all of which can produce irregular pacing patterns on ECG [^1162UVGo] [^117Grfbu] [^111rdbfu] [^115ZetoD].

> I will now examine sensing issues more closely. Oversensing can inhibit pacing and make the rhythm look irregular, with common culprits being T-wave oversensing, far-field R waves in the atrial channel, myopotentials, and EMI, whereas undersensing can cause pacing to occur at inappropriate times and may look like random spikes. I should double-check sensitivity settings, lead integrity, and environmental sources of interference before labeling this as device malfunction [^1162UVGo] [^117Grfbu] [^111MXkcm].

> Next, I should review capture failure. Elevated pacing thresholds from lead microdislodgement, fibrosis, or exit block can cause intermittent loss of capture, making the rhythm appear irregular even though spikes are present. I need to check thresholds, impedance, and morphology of paced beats, and I should remember that some patients with low programmed outputs can have intermittent loss of capture despite apparent safety margins, so I must verify beat-to-beat capture reliability rather than assume nominal settings are safe [^117Grfbu] [^1167Ja2B].

> Let me consider algorithmic and hardware causes. Features like Managed Ventricular Pacing, rate-smoothing, and mode-switching can produce irregular pacing sequences that mimic malfunction, and pacemaker-mediated tachycardia can present as a rapid, irregular wide-complex rhythm. I should confirm the programmed mode, recent diagnostics, and whether any automated features were triggered by atrial tachyarrhythmias or PVCs before concluding there is a hardware problem [^1162UVGo] [^111rdbfu] [^115ZetoD].

> I need to ensure immediate safety first. If the patient is unstable, I should apply a magnet to force asynchronous pacing while preparing for transcutaneous or transvenous backup pacing, and I should treat life-threatening tachyarrhythmias per ACLS, recognizing that magnet application can unmask or terminate pacemaker-mediated tachycardia in some cases. If the patient is stable, I should proceed with a structured evaluation rather than rushing to interventions [^117Grfbu] [^112VcFnk] [^111RB2Ve].

> Next, I should review device interrogation. I will check battery status, lead impedances, sensing thresholds, capture thresholds, and stored electrograms for oversensing or undersensing events, and I will correlate timing with patient symptoms. I should also verify programmed parameters, including sensitivity, blanking periods, and mode-switching algorithms, because inappropriate programming is a frequent cause of apparent irregular pacing [^117Grfbu] [^114ZGDKa].

> Let me analyze the ECG carefully. I should confirm whether pacing spikes are present, whether they capture consistently, whether the rhythm is irregular due to competition with intrinsic beats, and whether there are fusion or pseudofusion beats suggesting sensing issues. I should also look for evidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias that could trigger mode switching or irregular ventricular pacing, and I should compare the current tracing to baseline recordings when available [^117Grfbu] [^1127m9Pa].

> I should double-check for reversible contributors. Electrolyte disturbances, ischemia, and drugs like flecainide can elevate pacing thresholds or alter sensing, so I need to correct potassium, magnesium, and acid-base status, review medications, and consider ischemia workup if the presentation suggests it. If flecainide is on board, I should anticipate threshold increases and plan closer follow-up or dose adjustment [^112NQLWB] [^117Grfbu].

> Now, I will outline management by cause. For oversensing, I should decrease sensitivity, lengthen blanking periods, or reprogram polarity and sensing vectors, and I must eliminate EMI sources. For undersensing, I should increase sensitivity cautiously while avoiding T-wave oversensing. For capture failure, I should increase output with adequate safety margin and reassess thresholds, and if thresholds remain high, I should suspect lead microdislodgement or exit block and consider repositioning or replacement. For algorithmic issues, I should reprogram or temporarily disable the offending feature and monitor. For pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, I should break the loop by prolonging PVARP, shortening AV delays, or applying a magnet, and then adjust programming to prevent recurrence [^117Grfbu] [^1162UVGo] [^115TQpmM].

> But wait, what if the problem is hardware failure. If lead impedance is abnormal, if there is evidence of conductor fracture or insulation breach, or if thresholds are persistently high despite reprogramming, I should consider lead revision or extraction, balancing risks and benefits, and I should involve electrophysiology for extraction planning if infection or failure is present. In pacemaker-dependent patients, I should arrange temporary pacing during any corrective procedure [^117Grfbu] [^116B4dqk] [^113QC6ef].

> I should confirm follow-up needs. After any intervention, I should recheck thresholds, sensing, and impedance, and I should arrange closer surveillance if instability is suspected. Routine follow-up intervals should adhere to guideline schedules, with earlier checks after changes or suspected malfunction, and I should educate the patient to report palpitations, dizziness, or syncope promptly [^114ZGDKa] [^114qm1gJ].

> Let me reconsider the decision framework to ensure nothing is missed. If the rhythm is irregular with spikes that fail to capture, I should prioritize capture failure and escalate output or address the lead interface. If spikes are absent when expected, I should consider oversensing or battery/component failure. If the rhythm is irregular with apparent competition, I should verify sensing and algorithmic behavior. And if there is a rapid, irregular wide-complex rhythm, I should consider pacemaker-mediated tachycardia or device-induced tachyarrhythmia and act urgently with magnet and reprogramming [^117Grfbu] [^1162UVGo] [^114UqxSk].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: stabilize if unstable, interrogate the device, analyze the ECG in context, identify reversible factors, and treat according to the specific cause, reserving hardware revision for refractory or life-threatening scenarios. This method minimizes misclassification of pseudo-malfunction and addresses true failure efficiently while maintaining patient safety [^117Grfbu] [^1162UVGo] [^114ZGDKa].

Irregular pacing from a pacemaker is most often due to **oversensing** (myopotentials, electromagnetic interference, or T-wave oversensing) [^1162UVGo], **undersensing** of intrinsic beats [^116U5AA8], or **algorithmic features** (rate-smoothing, MVP, or mode switching) [^111rdbfu] [^115ZetoD]. Less commonly, it reflects **lead issues** (fracture, displacement, or high threshold) [^117Grfbu] or **battery decline** [^114qm1gJ]. Immediate steps include a 12-lead ECG, device interrogation, and checking for EMI or lead problems [^117Grfbu]; management is cause-specific, such as adjusting sensitivity, reprogramming algorithms, or replacing leads/battery if indicated [^114ZGDKa] [^116B4dqk].

---

## Common causes of irregular pacing

### Oversensing

- **Myopotentials**: Muscle activity (e.g. diaphragmatic or pectoral) can be misread as cardiac activity, inhibiting pacing [^1162UVGo].
- **Electromagnetic interference (EMI)**: Surgical equipment, MRI, or strong fields can cause erratic sensing and pacing [^111MXkcm].
- **T-wave oversensing**: Ventricular channels may sense T waves as R waves, causing inappropriate inhibition [^115TQpmM].

---

### Undersensing

Undersensing occurs when the device **fails to detect intrinsic beats**, leading to mistimed or competing pacing spikes; causes include small intrinsic signals, lead malposition, or fibrosis at the lead–myocardium interface [^116U5AA8].

---

### Algorithmic features

- **Rate-smoothing**: Designed to reduce rate jumps, but can cause apparent irregularity [^1162UVGo].
- **Managed ventricular pacing (MVP)**: Alternates between AAI and DDD, creating intermittent pacing patterns [^111rdbfu].
- **Mode switching**: Responds to atrial tachyarrhythmias by changing modes, causing irregular ventricular pacing [^115ZetoD].

---

### Lead-related issues

- **Lead fracture or insulation breach**: Intermittent contact causes sensing/capture failure and irregular pacing [^117Grfbu].
- **Lead displacement**: Poor contact elevates thresholds and causes intermittent capture [^117Grfbu].
- **Elevated pacing threshold**: Exit block or fibrosis can cause intermittent loss of capture [^1167Ja2B].

---

### Battery or device malfunction

Battery decline may present with **erratic behavior** as the device nears end-of-life, and rare electronic faults can cause irregular pacing [^114UqxSk].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic steps

### Initial assessment

Obtain a **12-lead ECG** to characterize the rhythm and pacing spikes, and perform **device interrogation** to review programmed parameters, sensing/capture thresholds, lead impedances, and stored events [^114ZGDKa].

---

### Specific diagnostic tests

- **Sensitivity testing**: Adjust atrial/ventricular sensitivity to resolve oversensing or undersensing [^116U5AA8].
- **Capture threshold testing**: Identify elevated thresholds or exit block [^1167Ja2B].
- **Lead impedance measurement**: Detect fractures or insulation breaches [^117Grfbu].
- **EMI assessment**: Identify environmental interference sources [^111MXkcm].

---

## Management strategies

| **Cause** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Oversensing | - Adjust sensitivity <br/> - Reposition lead <br/> - Eliminate EMI source [^1162UVGo] [^111MXkcm] |
| Undersensing | - Increase sensitivity <br/> - Reposition lead <br/> - Treat fibrosis [^116U5AA8] |
| Algorithmic features | - Reprogram or disable offending algorithm [^1162UVGo] |
| Lead-related issues | - Lead revision or replacement [^116B4dqk] |
| Battery/device malfunction | - Generator replacement [^113cZy5w] |

---

## Clinical implications and patient safety

Irregular pacing can cause **palpitations, dizziness, syncope, or heart failure exacerbation**; prompt recognition and correction are essential to restore reliable pacing and prevent hemodynamic compromise [^117Grfbu].

---

## Preventive measures and follow-up

Regular follow-up with **device interrogation** enables early detection of irregular pacing, and patient education on avoiding EMI and recognizing symptoms supports timely intervention [^114ZGDKa] [^111MXkcm].

---

Irregular pacing is usually due to **oversensing, undersensing, algorithms, or lead/battery issues**; a structured approach — ECG, interrogation, and targeted testing — allows rapid diagnosis and cause-specific therapy, restoring safe, reliable pacing [^117Grfbu].

### Inappropriate pacing in a patient with managed ventricular pacing: what is the cause? [^111rdbfu]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

A case of inappropriate atrial pacing in a patient with a pacemaker programmed with Managed Ventricular Pacing (MVP) mode, a proprietary algorithm in Medtronic devices, is presented. The patient was an 84-year-old woman who presented in sinus rhythm with complete atrioventricular block. A dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted and programmed to an MVP pacing mode. After the implant, the patient developed a relatively slow atrial tachyarrhythmia with 2:1 atrioventricular block and inappropriate atrial pacing, followed by a delay in tracking of the atrial tachyarrhythmia. The mechanisms for these behaviors are described.

### Tailoring pacemaker output to physiology in chronic heart failure… [^113EMnVz]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

The investigators think that this might be important at rest, but even more important during activity. This concept has never been tested before in a systematic manner but could have large implications for people with heart failure and existing CRT devices which could simply be reprogrammed to derive greater benefits for patients during everyday activities. Design: The proposed project has two parts: Of these patients, 40 will be invited to return for two further visits, to perform an exercise test each time with the pacemaker programmed to its usual output or high output pacing. At each visit, including the heart scans, the order of the programming will be random, and neither the observer nor the patient will know how the device has been programmed.

BACKGROUND Chronic heart failure and cardiac resynchronisation therapy Even when prescribed optimal medical and device therapy, patients with chronic heart failure suffer a persistent reduction in quality of life mainly due to breathlessness and fatigue on exercise. The origin of these symptoms is multifactorial, but despite increasing appreciation of the influence of peripheral adaptations on exercise tolerance the key factor in initiation and persistence of the symptoms is impaired cardiac contractility both at rest and over the relevant heart rate range. Whilst cardiac resynchronization therapy provides a powerful adjunct to medical therapy in the third of patients with dyssynchronous contraction, many patients remain symptomatic despite CRT, prompting a series of pacing adaptations to try and improve the technology further.

Standard left ventricular leads now include four poles from which a pacing stimulus can be delivered selectively or in parallel, and each of the manufacturers includes automated software to adjust the intraventricular and interventricular timing. Methods: 40 consecutive attendees will be enrolled to provide 25 evaluable paired data sets accepting up to a possible 35% drop-out rate from this part of the study due to intolerance of the high-output setting. Patients will undergo two cardiopulmonary exercise tests one week apart on the same protocol, during which their device will be programmed in a random order to provide either high output pacing on the left ventricular lead or normal settings. This will help to identify people who may benefit more from the programming change.

In this way additional information for the personalization of pacemaker programming will be provided, since high output pacing might have an adverse effect on battery longevity such that perhaps only patients with a clinically relevant improvement or with persistent symptoms are put forward for such reprogramming.

### Electronic pacemakers [^1127m9Pa]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The number of patients who have cardiac pacemakers has increased markedly over the past few decades since the technology was first introduced in the 1950s. Advances in technology, expanding indications, and the aging of the population ensure that clinicians will encounter patients with cardiac pacemakers on a regular basis. This article summarizes the electrocardiographic manifestations of the normally functioning permanent cardiac pacemaker and abnormalities associated with pacemaker malfunction.

### The quest for physiological pacing-does one size fit all? [^112yBBdE]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pacing is an established and ubiquitous treatment of bradycardias and some types of heart failure. The optimal pacing lead position which maximizes cardiac function and minimizes deterioration of ventricular function remains controversial. The desire to achieve a physiological pacing system that mimics cardiac function has led to the investigation of several potential pacing sites. This editorial provides an overview of past and current pacing lead position and summaries the current and future direction of physiological pacing.

### Implantable cardiac arrhythmia devices – part I: pacemakers [^114rmEqP]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Implantable cardiac devices have become firmly entrenched as important therapeutic tools for a variety of cardiac conditions. The first part of this two-part review will discuss the contemporary use and follow-up of pacemakers, while the second part will address the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators and implantable loop recorders. Pacemakers are the only available treatment for symptomatic bradycardia not due to reversible causes. Large randomized studies have demonstrated a small but statistically significant reduction in atrial fibrillation associated with pacing modes that maintain atrioventricular synchrony. In contrast, pacing mode appears to have a less dramatic effect in patients with atrioventricular block. Cardiac resynchronization with specialized left ventricular leads has been shown to reduce symptoms and improve survival in patients with symptomatic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and widened QRS complexes. For all patients, careful follow-up is necessary to ensure optimal therapeutic benefit of pacing systems.

### Isorhythmic interaction between a dual-chamber pacemaker and an intrinsic rhythm: pacemaker malfunctioning or not? [^111Hkp1w]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

A patient underwent cardiac surgery (including a biatrial maze procedure) for congenital heart disease and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. Previously, a dual-chamber pacemaker was inserted for bradycardia. Postoperative ECG showed a narrow complex rhythm interspersed with pacing stimuli that appeared premature and unable to capture. The phenomenon was due to isorhythmic interaction between the pacemaker and the patient's own intrinsic rhythm, which is compatible with normal pacemaker functioning. The different patterns possible for the phenomenon and the necessary conditions for their occurrence are elucidated.

Troubleshooting

Common problems with temporaring pacing include failure to pace, failure to capture, and R-on-T. Failure to pace occurs when the pacemaker is set to deliver electrical impulses but no corresponding pacing spikes are seen. There is a problem either with the pacemaker, the pacing wires, or at the lead/myocardium interface. A full check should be undertaken to evaluate whether the wires have migrated, whether the leads are properly inserted into the pacing box, and whether the pacing leads are faulty and require replacing. A pacing check should be undertaken to ensure that the pacing rate is not set below the patient's intrinsic rate and that the device is not oversensing.

Failure to capture occurs when the pacemaker delivers electrical impulses that generate corresponding pacing spikes. However, the impulses do not reliably induce action potentials in the myocardium of the chamber being paced, which means that the patient's heart rate remains lower than the rate set on the pacemaker. In this setting, a full check should be undertaken to eensure that there are no connection issues between the heart, pacing wires, pacing leads, and pacing box. A pacing check should be performed especially to confirm the capture threshold and appropriateness of the set capture output.

Inappropriate pacing, irregular pacing, or both, may occur in these circumstances: the set pacing rate is similar to the patient's intrinsic rate, the capture output is set too low, or the device is oversensing or undersensing. If R-on-T occurs, the pacemaker should be switched off and senior input immediately sought. If the patient is pacing dependent, emergency help should be sought. It is important to check the sensing threshold and confirm both that the sensing threshold is not too low and that the sensitivity has been appropriately set.

### Leadless pacemakers: where are we? [^1175xiKi]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pacemakers have been the cornerstone of brady-arrhythmia management since the mid-20th century. Despite the widespread use and success of traditional transvenous pacemakers, they are associated with an estimated 15% complication rate at three years. Driven by the advantages over traditional transvenous pacemakers including a lack of transvenous leads, resistance to infection, and ease of implantation, the number of leadless pacemakers placed annually in the United States has dramatically increased since their initial approval. While current iterations of leadless pacemakers lack the versatility offered by transvenous devices, recent advances in leadless pacing offer an increasingly diverse range of therapeutic options. This review will discuss the past, present, and future emerging technologies, and strategies in leadless pacing.

### 2012 ACCF / AHA / HRS focused update of the 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities: a report of the American college of cardiology foundation / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^114qm1gJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Device Guideline: 2012 update — scope, applicability, and follow-up emphasize that the guideline focuses on the appropriate use of heart pacing devices (e.g., pacemakers for bradyarrhythmias and heart failure management, cardiac resynchronization, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [ICDs]), not the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. A device listed as a Class I indication (beneficial, useful, and effective) does not preclude other therapeutic modalities that may be equally effective, and recommendations target an average patient and may be modified by comorbidities, limitations of life expectancy, and circumstances judged by the primary treating physician. Follow-up is underscored because optimal results require device adjustment to changing clinical conditions and because advisories and recalls highlight that devices are not infallible and failures of electronics, batteries, and leads can occur. The committee did not include a section on extraction of failed/unused leads owing to the absence of convincing evidence for timing and methods, and the question of when to discontinue long-term cardiac pacing or defibrillator therapy has not been studied sufficiently; this topic is addressed to emphasize the importance of patient-family-physician discussion and ethical principles. Many indications use the modifier "potentially reversible", referring to abnormal pathophysiology that may result from reversible factors such as complete heart block due to drug toxicity (digitalis), electrolyte abnormalities, periatrioventricular node inflammation (Lyme disease), or transient injury to the conduction system at the time of open heart surgery; when faced with a potentially reversible situation, the treating physician must decide how long a waiting period is justified before device therapy is begun.

### The effects of rate and irregularity on sympathetic nerve activity in human subjects [^112tMcXy]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Background

We have recently shown that atrial fibrillation is associated with an increase in sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) compared with sinus rhythm. It remains unclear, however, whether these findings are true at various rates and whether the magnitude of sympathoexcitation is related to the degree of irregularity.

Objective

To determine the role of irregularity in mediating the SNA changes at various pacing rates. Univariate analysis showed that as the irregularity increased, SBP increased (r = 0.44, P < .001) but that MAP and DBP did not change significantly.

Methods

Using custom-made software, atrioventricular sequential pacing with predetermined rates (100, 120, and 140 bpm) and irregularities (standard deviation = 0%, 5%, 15%, and 25% of mean cycle length) was performed in 23 patients referred for electrophysiologic evaluation. Pacing at each rate/irregularity was performed for 2 minutes, with 2 minutes of recovery in between. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure (SBP, DBP, and MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and SNA were measured at baseline and during pacing.

Results

Univariate analysis showed that as the irregularity increased, SBP increased (r = 0.44, P < .001 but that MAP and DBP did not change significantly. A significant correlation was found between the pacing irregularity and SNA, with greater sympathoexcitation noted at greater degrees of irregularity (r = 0.2, P = 0.04). A five-variable linear model using DBP, MAP, CVP, and degree of pacing irregularity to predict SNA was highly statistically significant (r = 0.46, P < .001). After controlling for hemodynamic changes, for every 1% increase in irregularity, there was a 6.1% increase in SNA.

Conclusion

We have shown that greater degrees of irregularity cause greater sympathoexcitation and that the effects of irregular pacing on SNA are independent of the hemodynamic changes.

### The paced electrocardiogram: issues for the emergency physician [^117Bdtpi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Since the first introduction of implantable pacemaker approximately 50 years ago, these devices have become increasingly more common and more complex. It is estimated that there are approximately 1 million patients with implanted pacemakers in the United States and, with an aging population, the number of pacemakers is certain to increase. This review focuses on basics of pacemaker function as well as the common rhythm disturbance issues and other clinical syndromes that the emergency physician is likely to encounter.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the Evaluation and management of Patients with bradycardia and cardiac Conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113zzZTd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Discontinuation of pacemaker therapy — recommendation and scope: For patients presenting for pulse generator replacement or management of pacemaker related complications in whom the original pacing indication has resolved or is in question, discontinuation of pacemaker therapy is reasonable after evaluation of symptoms during a period of monitoring while pacing therapy is off (IIa, C-LD). Contextually, several studies have estimated that approximately 30% of pacemakers have been implanted for other than Class I and IIa indications, underscoring scenarios in which continued need may be unclear.

### HRS / ACCF expert consensus statement on pacemaker device and mode selection. developed in partnership between the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the American college of cardiology foundation (ACCF) and in collaboration with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [^116LWbQx]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Medium credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — epidemiology and natural history are summarized as follows: SND is the most common cause of bradyarrhythmias requiring pacing therapy in North America and Western Europe. Seventeen percent of patients with SND will have some degree of AV block. Two important developments in the natural history of SND should be emphasized: AV block and AF. The risk of developing AV block following pacemaker implantation within 5 years of follow-up is 3–35%. In patients with SND, the incidence of clinical AF at the time of initial diagnosis has been reported to range from approximately 40–70%. Among patients who do not have AF at initial diagnosis, the incidence of new AF in follow-up ranges from 3.9–22.3%. During long-term follow-up, 68% of patients receiving a dual pacemaker for SND have had AF documented by device diagnostics. In the absence of a reversible cause, the appropriate treatment for symptomatic SND is implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Available pacing modes include dual-chamber (DDD or DDI), ventricular single-chamber (VVI), and atrial single-chamber (AAI).

Pacemaker performance standards referenced for Guideline II applicability — the standards are 90% cumulative survival at 5 years after implantation and an end-of-life decay of less than a 50% drop in output voltage and less than a 20% deviation in magnet rate, or a drop of 5 bpm or less, over a period of 3 months or more; as of 2000, most pacemakers would meet the specifications in Guideline II.

### Class 2 device recall PROPONENT SR pacemaker… [^112NvSqe]. FDA (AccessData) (2002). Low credibility.

Boston Scientific has received reports of intermittent over-sensing of the Minute Ventilation sensor signal with certain Boston Scientific pacemaker and cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker systems. FDA Determined Cause 2 Device Design Action. On December 19, 2017 the firm sent a letter to all their medical consignees stating the following: December 2017 Dear Doctor, Boston Scientific has received reports of intermittent oversensing of the Minute Ventilation sensor signal with certain Boston Scientific pacemaker and cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker systems. MV sensor signal oversensing may cause pre-syncope or syncope due to periods of pacing inhibition. This MV behavior may occur with any manufacturers pacing lead system, but Boston Scientific has determined it to be more likely for affected Boston Scientific pacemakers using Medtronic or Abbott/St.

Jude leads implanted in either the right atrium or right ventricle. Boston Scientific is actively developing a software update designed to automatically detect and resolve this MV sensor signal oversensing behavior. We anticipate submitting the software update to Regulatory Agencies in March 2018 and pending approval, will release it as soon as possible thereafter. Until this software update is available, Boston Scientific has additional re commendations to mitigate this risk for affected pacemaker systems. Root Cause Investigation The MV sensor in Boston Scientific pacemakers can be used for RightRate", Respiratory Rate Trend, or AP Scan"1. When the RA/RV pacing leads and lead terminal connections are operating as intended, the MV sensor signal is appropriately filtered and therefore is not detected by the pacemaker or displayed on electrograms.

However, intermittency related to the lead or pacemaker-lead connection2 has the potential to create a transient high impedance condition. A high impedance condition may subsequently alter the MV sensor signal such that it becomes visible on EGMs and potentially subject to oversensing on the RA or RV channels. For a technical description of the Boston Scientifics MV sensor, please refer to Appendix A. Engineering analysis and. medical device recalls 2 Per FDA policy, recall cause determinations are subject to modification up to the point of termination of the recall. 3 The manufacturer has initiated the recall and not all products have been corrected or removed. This record will be updated as the status changes.

### The past, present, and future of pacemaker therapies [^1113Uhro]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Since its introduction into clinical practice, electronic pacing has saved many lives. Despite continuous improvements, electronic pacemakers have important shortcomings, which stimulated the development of biological alternatives. Biological pacemakers generate the cardiac impulse using genes or cells to treat bradycardias. Over the past decade, significant improvements have been made in biological pacemakers, but issues remain in relation to long-term outcomes and safety. Concurrently, efforts to improve electronic pacemakers have also intensified. Whether new generations of electronic pacemakers will erase lingering concerns with regard to electronic pacing or whether biologicals will ultimately supplement or supplant electronics remains to be seen.

### 2012 ACCF / AHA / HRS focused update of the 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities: a report of the American college of cardiology foundation / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^114FLbNs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ventricular pacing management — avoidance and monitoring: In patients with no atrioventricular (AV) block and no intraventricular conduction abnormalities, ventricular pacing should be avoided as much as possible, and for patients without a bradycardia indication this can be achieved by programming a very low backup ventricular pacing rate (i.e., 30 to 40 bpm). Any hardware system that increases unnecessary ventricular pacing from any site may increase the risk of heart failure, and biventricular or LV pacing may also induce dyssynchrony in hearts with normal ventricular conduction. Efforts to optimize pacing mode or site should be greater in patients with longer expected duration of pacing, poorer cardiac function, and larger mechanical asynchrony, and awareness of dyssynchrony should also lead to more regular monitoring of ventricular systolic function and mechanical asynchrony in any patient with ventricular pacing.

Atrioventricular (AV) block — ventricular pacing minimization algorithms are reported to allow a 60% relative reduction in ventricular pacing over the short term, but there is no documentation that minimizing ventricular pacing is beneficial and no sufficiently large trial has evaluated safety in AV block. In intermittent AV block, cumulative ventricular pacing can be as low as 28%, yet case reports indicate that algorithms allowing intermittent AV block may have deleterious effects, and many such patients progress to complete heart block over longer-term follow-up.

Several studies have estimated that approximately 30% of pacemakers have been implanted for other than Class I and IIa indications, and practical options for discontinuation include programming the pacemaker "off", elective nonreplacement of a device approaching end of battery service life, explant of the pulse generator alone, and in some cases, pulse generator explant and extraction of the lead(s).

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure

Disorganized atrial activity during atrial fibrillation (AF) has many deleterious haemodynamic effects contributing to cardiac remodelling and induction of fibrosis. Early studies proved that irregularity and loss of atrial contribution to left ventricular (LV) filling decreased cardiac output (CO). Further exploration revealed that independent of rate, irregular ventricular rhythm disables cardiac contractility to adapt during beat‐to‐beat changes in ventricular filling. In addition, AF leads to insufficient coronary flow, molecular LV remodelling, and disrupted Ca 2+ homeostasis, which eventually may induce contractile dysfunction. In brief, deleterious haemodynamic effects of AF on cardiac function can be attributed to loss of atrial contraction, reduced CO, and irregular and often rapid heart rate. Considering these facts, removing irregularity and fast ventricular response alone can increase CO and prevent long‐term deleterious effects of AF culminating in arrhythmia‐induced cardiomyopathy.

Treatment strategies

Catheter ablation enables restoration of sinus rhythm and several studies have recently demonstrated its prognostic benefit. Therefore, current guidelines recommend CA as a first‐line treatment when arrhythmia‐induced cardiomyopathy is highly probable (class I, level of evidence B, European and US guidelines). However, these benefits might be less distinct in patients with long‐standing, persistent AF in whom lower interventional success rates might be expected. Additionally, most trials do not specify ablation outcomes in persistent AF or elderly patients with more comorbidities in whom recurrences may be particularly problematic. Therefore, even though the guidelines recommend CA as a treatment of choice, alternative therapeutic strategies may be considered. Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with permanent pacemaker implantation (pace and ablate strategy) is a feasible rate control option that offers more robust control of ventricular rate over medical therapy alone, as well as definitive rhythm regularization. A recent meta‐analysis compared the efficacy and safety endpoints among five major approaches for AF. Although CA performed best in reducing AF recurrence, the pace and ablate strategy showed superiority in reducing mortality and rehospitalization. Current 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend AVNA in patients unresponsive or intolerant to intensive rate and rhythm control therapy, and not eligible for rhythm control by CA (class IIa, level of evidence B). The choice of pacing modality depends on patient characteristics and the presence of heart failure (HF).

### Pacemaker malfunction-review of permanent pacemakers and malfunctions encountered in the emergency department [^117Grfbu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pacemaker malfunction refers to a failure of the pacemaker to perform the desired cardiac pacemaking function. These malfunctions can occur anywhere within the system from the pulse generator and leads to the electrode-myocardium interface. These failures of sensing, capture, and inadequate pacing can have severe hemodynamic consequences, so rapid identification of specific dysfunction is critical to intervention and stabilization. Emergency providers should be aware of pacemaker components, function, basic programming, and types of malfunctions to adequately assess, stabilize, and disposition patients.

### Sensing of concealed ventricular extrasystoles by pacemakers. fifty years later [^114xL98i]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Whether a pacemaker can sense concealed ventricular extrasystoles still remains debatable since its occurrence was first proposed in 1972. It must remain a diagnosis of exclusion if it really exists. Isoelectric complexes and all the causes of oversensing especially discrete false signals generated by a defective pacemaker lead must be excluded before concealed ventricular extrasystoles can be postulated.

### A new paradigm for physiologic ventricular pacing [^115eMPY9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical trials in patients with pacemakers for sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block (AVB) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators provide increasing evidence showing that desynchronization of ventricular electrical activation and contraction, induced by conventional right ventricular apex (RVA) pacing, is a serious threat for long-term cardiac morbidity and mortality. The risk of heart failure is increased even in hearts with initially normal pump function and in case of part-time ventricular pacing. These epidemiologic data fit with knowledge from decades of pathophysiological research, indicating that right ventricular (RV) pacing creates abnormal contraction, reduced pump function, hypertrophy, and ultrastructural abnormalities. This paper presents a new paradigm that aims to tailor ventricular pacing to the individual patient to achieve a way of pacing that is as physiologic as possible. In patients without AVB and no intraventricular conduction abnormalities, ventricular pacing should be avoided as much as possible, using atrial-based pacing. In patients with AVB, alternate single-site RV or left ventricular pacing or biventricular pacing may be superior to RVA pacing. Efforts to optimize the pacing mode or site should be greater in patients with a longer expected duration of pacing, poorer cardiac function, and larger mechanical asynchrony. Awareness of the problem of desynchronization should also lead to more regular monitoring of cardiac pump function and mechanical asynchrony in any patient with ventricular pacing.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sick sinus syndrome, more specifically with respect to permanent pacing, discontinuation, ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing pacemaker therapy, after an evaluation of symptoms during a period of monitoring while pacing therapy is off, in patients presenting for pacemaker pulse generator replacement or for management of pacemaker-related complications if the original indication of pacing has resolved or is in question.

### Novel cause of spurious mode switching in dual-chamber pacemakers: atrioventricular desynchronization arrhythmia [^115ZetoD]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Spurious mode switching is a common problem in DDDR pacing and implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems. It may produce symptoms indistinguishable from classic pacemaker syndrome or paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias due to loss of AV synchrony. The dominant cause of spurious mode switching is oversensing of far-field R waves. This report describes a novel cause of spurious mode switching, AV desynchronization arrhythmia. Clinical manifestations, recognition, and management are discussed.

Pacemaker deactivation and end-of-life care — physicians should clarify for patients or their legally defined surrogates and their families the expected consequences of pacemaker deactivation, and pacemaker deactivation requires a written order from the responsible physician, which should be accompanied by a do-not-resuscitate order as well. Additional documentation in the medical record should include confirmation that the patient (or legal surrogate) has requested device deactivation, capacity of the patient to make the decision or identification of the appropriate surrogate and documentation that alternative therapies as well as documentation that the consequences of deactivation have been discussed. If the decision is made to deactivate a pacemaker, patient death may follow immediately after the cessation of pacing therapy if the patient is completely pacemaker dependent; however, in those who are not pacemaker dependent, the process of death may be unpredictable. It is possible that turning off a pacemaker may lead to additional discomfort; therefore, patients must be monitored closely for potential symptoms, such as respiratory distress, which may require intensification of comfort care measures. Palliative care and medical support should be provided to the patient and family in order to provide comfort in view of potential symptoms that may arise, clinicians with religious or ethical objections should not be forced and the patient should be referred to a different physician who is willing, and clinicians should encourage patients undergoing device implantation to complete advanced directives and specifically address device management and deactivation if the patient is terminally ill.

Pacing check

A complete pacing check may be safely undertaken only if a patient is not pacing dependent, which might be the case if regular pacing spikes are seen on the rhythm strip. Slowly reducing the pacing rate until no pacing spikes are seen reveals both the underlying heart rate and rhythm. Caution should be exercised in patients who become haemodynamically unstable which, for patients in the ward whose blood pressure is not invasively monitored, may only manifest itself symptomatically. It is also not prudent to reduce the pacing rate below 30 bpm because doing so typically indicates that sinus node dysfunction or a high degree atrioventricular block exists, and electrophysiology review should be considered.

In patients who are not pacing dependent, a pacing check may commence with an assessment of the pacing wire sensing thresholds. Sensitivity, which is measured in millivolts, refers to the ability of the pacemaker to sense the current created by the underlying cardiac electrical activity. A pacemaker that is unable to sense the underlying rhythm is said to be undersensing and has a high sensitivity value. An undersensing pacemaker means that the pacemaker is unable to discern where in the cardiac rhythm a pacing spike should be delivered, which risks delivery of random pacing signals. For ventricular pacing wires, an undersensing pacemaker increases the chances of pacing on a T wave in a so-called R on T phenomenon, which can lead to ventricular fibrillation. Conversely, an oversensing pacemaker means that the pacemaker 'over-reads' the cardiac rhythm such that low voltage deflections are interpreted by the device as P waves or QRS complexes when they are not. In this setting, the opposite is true. The pacemaker will not discharge a pacing spike when in fact it should. Thus, pacing up will not occur for patients with an underlying heart rate below the set pacing rate. The minimum current that the pacemaker can sense is termed the sensing threshold and the sensitivity is often set to half this value to allow for detection of abnormally small signals and for the possibility that peri-lead fibrosis over the course of the day will reduce the current transmitted to the pacemaker. A common issue faced on the ward is of a low sensitivity threshold. It becomes unsafe to set the sensitivity of the device to half the sensing threshold, or even the lowest possible sensitivity setting, because of the risk of undersensing, and R-on-T.

Pacemaker follow-up scheduling and clinic assessments — After implantation of a pacemaker, careful follow-up and continuity of care are required. Programming undertaken at implantation should be reviewed before discharge and changed accordingly at subsequent follow-up visits as indicated by interrogation, testing, and patient needs, and with careful attention to programming pacing amplitude, pulse width, and diagnostic functions, battery life can be enhanced significantly without compromising patient safety. The frequency and method of follow-up are dictated by multiple factors, and a more extensive clinic follow-up usually includes assessment of clinical status, battery status, pacing threshold and pulse width, sensing function, lead integrity, sensor-driven rate response optimization, and evaluation of recorded events. The schedule for clinic follow-up should be at the discretion of caregivers, and as a guideline the 1984 Health Care Financing Administration document suggests: for single-chamber pacemakers, twice in the first 6 months after implantation and then once every 12 months; for dual-chamber pacemakers, twice in the first 6 months, then once every 6 months.

### Safety and feasibility of a novel rate-smoothed ventricular pacing algorithm for atrial fibrillation [^11527swm]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was conducted to establish the safety and performance of a new rate-smoothing pacing algorithm for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

Background

Irregularity of the ventricular response is a hallmark of AF. This irregularity may contribute to symptoms and hemodynamic compromise in patients with AF. Interventions designed to reduce irregularity have not previously been evaluated in a long-term, clinical setting.

Methods

We designed a prospective, double-blind study with randomized crossover. Patients with either paroxysmal or chronic AF whose conditions were medically refractory and who were referred for an atrioventricular node ablation procedure all underwent pacemaker implantation. Subjects were then randomly assigned to either DDD mode with the rate-smoothing algorithm (RSA) on, or to OOO mode. After 2 months they were crossed over to the other arm.

Results

Fourteen patients (9 with paroxysmal AF and 5 with chronic AF) were enrolled. There were no significant differences between the group randomly assigned to RSA first versus the group assigned to OOO first. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction with the RSA was not significantly different than it was in OOO mode (45.1 ± 18.6 vs 51.9 ± 12.3; P = 0.11), although some individuals with uncontrolled ventricular rates did have a large decrease in ejection fraction with rate smoothing. One developed overt heart failure. One quality-of-life instrument detected a significant improvement in the "physical limitations" domain with the rate-smoothing mode. Eleven of 14 patients preferred the RSA ON arm, and 6 of those 11 elected to defer the ablation procedure.

Conclusions

Long-term rate-smoothed pacing is feasible. Because of concerns about pacing-induced heart failure in some patients with rapid ventricular rates, rate-smoothed pacing should be reserved for those who remain symptomatic despite adequate control of the ventricular rate. The RSA may help to reduce symptoms in patients with medically refractory AF; more study is required to define its efficacy in reducing symptoms and morbidity in this population.

### Low settings of the ventricular pacing output in patients dependent on a pacemaker: are they really safe? [^1167Ja2B]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

It is generally acknowledged that pacemaker output must be adjusted with a 100% voltage safety margin above the pacing threshold to avoid ineffective pacing, especially in patients dependent on pacemakers.

Aims

The aim of this prospective crossover study was to assess the beat-to-beat safety of low outputs in patients who are dependent on a pacemaker between 2 follow-up examinations.

Methods

The study included 12 patients who had received a DDD pacemaker with an automatic beat-to-beat capture verification function. The ventricular output at 0.4 milliseconds pulse duration was programmed independently of the actual pacing threshold in a crossover randomization to 1.0 V, 1.5 V, and 2.5 V for 6 weeks each. At each follow-up, the diagnostic counters were interrogated and the pacing threshold at 0.4 milliseconds was determined in 0.1-V steps. The diagnostic pacemaker counters depict the frequency of back-up pulses delivered because of a loss of capture. During the randomization to 1.0-V output, we evaluated whether the adjustment of the output under consideration of the > 100% voltage safety margin reduced the frequency of back-up pulses.

Results

Pacing thresholds at the randomization to 1.0-V, 1.5-V, and 2.5-V output were not significantly different, with 0.7 ± 0.3 V at 2.5-V output, 0.6 ± 0.2 V at 1.5-V output, and 0.6 ± 0.2 V at 1.0-V output. The frequency of back-up pulses was similar at 2.5-V and 1.5-V output, 2.2% ± 1.9% and 2.0% ± 2.0%, respectively. The frequency of back-up pulses significantly increased at 1.0-V output to 5.8% ± 6.4% (P < .05). Back-up pulses > 5% of the time between the 2 follow-ups were observed in no patient at 2.5 V, in 1 patient at 1.5 V, and in 5 patients at 1.0 V. At the randomization to the 1.0-V output, 6 patients had pacing thresholds of 0.5 V or less, and 6 patients had pacing thresholds > 0.5 V. The frequency of back-up pulses in the 2 groups was not significantly different, 6.4% ± 8.6% and 5.7% ± 2.6%.

Conclusions

The frequency of back-up pulses was significantly higher at 1.0-V output than at 1.5-V and 2.5-V output. This also applied to patients with pacing thresholds of ≤ 0.5 V. Fixed low outputs seem not to be absolutely safe between 2 follow-ups in patients who are dependent on a pacemaker, even when the output has a 100% voltage safety margin above the pacing threshold. When patients with pacemakers programmed to a low ventricular output have symptoms of ineffective pacing, an intermittent increase of the pacing threshold should be carefully ruled out.

### Reasons for loss of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacing: insights from 32 844 patients [^1135gP5p]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is associated with the amount of CRT pacing delivered. The specific causes of CRT pacing loss and their relative frequencies remain poorly defined.

Methods and Results

CRT patients who transmitted device data from 2006 to 2011 were screened for inclusion. Device diagnostics were analyzed using an automated algorithm to categorize CRT loss into 10 different causes. The algorithm was validated against manual adjudications using a portion of the entire cohort. There were 80 768 patients analyzed with a median time of 594 (interquartile range, 294–1003) days from implant to time of analysis. In this cohort, 40.7% of patients had < 98% pacing, and 11.5% of patients had < 90% pacing. For patients with < 98% pacing, device diagnostics explained 55.8% of pacing loss: 30.6% atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation; 16.6% premature ventricular contractions; and 8.6% captured as episodes with at least 10 consecutive beats of CRT loss (ventricular sensing episodes). Inappropriately programmed sensed and paced atrioventricular (AV) intervals (SAV/PAV) accounted for 34.5% of all ventricular sensing episodes. As the severity of CRT loss increased, the contribution of atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation and SAV/PAV to the loss increased. Atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation accounted for > 50% and premature ventricular contractions accounted for < 10% of CRT loss in those with < 90% CRT pacing.

Conclusions

CRT pacing < 98% was observed in 40.7% of patients. Among those with suboptimal pacing, atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation was the most common reason for CRT pacing loss. Inappropriately programmed SAV/PAV intervals was the most common reason for episodes of sustained loss of CRT pacing. This information can help in defining more effective treatments to improve CRT delivery.

Pacemaker syndrome — crossovers, reprogramming, and predictability — In the PASE trial, 26% of patients randomized to VVIR pacing needed crossover to dual-chamber pacing due to severe pacemaker syndrome; in MOST, 38% of patients in the ventricular pacing group had their pacemakers reprogrammed to the dual-chamber mode for symptoms believed due to pacemaker syndrome; of the 996 patients randomized to VVIR pacing, 182 (18.3%) developed severe pacemaker syndrome during follow-up that improved with reprogramming to DDDR pacing; no baseline parameter or data at pacemaker implantation can reliably predict clinically significant pacemaker syndrome, and although a blood pressure drop of ≥ 20 mm Hg associated with symptoms has been used as a definition, a drop in systolic blood pressure during ventricular pacing at implantation did not predict development during follow-up in MOST.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device programming — sensing, mode switching, and blanking period management: Frequent PVCs reported by device counters may represent ventricular oversensing or atrial under sensing with native ventricular conduction and may compromise the amount of biventricular capture. In the case of T wave oversensing decreasing ventricular sensitivity is important but may require repeat VF testing depending upon the original implant defibrillation testing programmed sensitivity. Inappropriate mode switching, usually due to ventricular far field oversensing in the atrium can also significantly reduce the responses to CRT; in this situation, the device will revert to VVI CRT pacing but can cause retrograde VA conduction with the risk of pacemaker syndrome, and it usually can be prevented by programming a post-ventricular atrial blanking period (PVAB) of at least 150 ms. Conversely, under sensing of atrial fibrillation can lead to absence of mode switching and irregular, fast tracking of atrial fibrillation; adjusting atrial sensitivity to a more sensitive value can minimize it, and the detection rate of atrial tachyarrhythmias can be reduced (e.g. to 170–180 b.p.m.) to allow atrial fibrillation detection in the presence of intermittent atrial fibrillation under sensing. Under sensing of atrial flutter in the PVAB can be avoided by device-specific algorithms, programming a shorter AV delay, and/or reducing the upper tracking limit. If sinus rhythm tracking is not occurring consistently, it may be due to under sensing during PVARP prolongation after PVC; automatic algorithms to terminate pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) may misinterpret sinus tachycardia as PMT and interrupt sinus rhythm tracking, and if interruption of CRT is observed, PVC or PMT intervention algorithms should be programmed off, or if available, utilize dedicated algorithms to regain sinus rhythm tracking.

### Atrioventricular node ablation for atrial fibrillation in the era of conduction system pacing [^111HwBi6]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Haemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation: irregulopathy

Through excessive heart rates, beat-to-beat irregularity, absence of atrial contraction, and reduced coronary flow reserve, AF causes harmful effects upon left ventricular (LV) mechanical stretch and sympathetic nerve activity, leading to unfavourable haemodynamic consequences (Graphical Abstract). The cycle ensues with increased filling pressures and neurohormonal changes, resulting in atrial fibrosis and altered calcium handling, leading to further adverse cardiac remodelling, referred to as arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy.

Early pioneering work attempting to elucidate the effect of 'irregularity' on intracardiac pressures and cardiac output (CO) began in 1983 when Naito et al.studied the haemodynamic effects of atrioventricular (AV) block in canine hearts. After open surgical AVNA was performed in 20 mongrels, ventricular pacing with a regular and irregular (five extra-stimuli introduced at varying coupling intervals) pattern was performed with each sequence from the left atrium and the LV apex: AV sequential pacing at 100 ms; ventricular-only pacing during sinus rhythm (with AV dissociation); AF with ventricular pacing; and AV sequential pacing but with an AV interval of −100 ms. They found that a normal AV sequence was of ultimate importance as AV sequential pacing resulted in optimal haemodynamics during both regular and irregular pacing. The most deleterious haemodynamic effects (reduced CO, increased left atrial pressure, and reduced LV pressure) were observed when atrial systole was superimposed on a ventricular contraction resulting in active retrograde atrial emptying, and although AV dissociation resulted in overall lower CO than during sequential AV pacing, only irregularly pacing the ventricle during AF resulted in a further drop in CO. The CO during this particularly deleterious sequence was indistinguishable from AF with irregular ventricular pacing. The loss of the atrial kick appeared to be the causal factor for the initial 22% reduction in CO, but pacing irregularly resulted in a further 9% CO drop. In other words, regular paced rhythms were still better than irregularly paced rhythms. Mitral valve regurgitation during angiography was observed in this study only in the presence of irregularity.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Bradycardia guideline top take-home messages — In patients with sleep-related bradycardia, "the presence of nocturnal bradycardias should prompt consideration for screening for sleep apnea", yet "nocturnal bradycardia is not in itself an indication for permanent pacing". The presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram "markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease", and "echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test". In sinus node dysfunction, "there is no established minimum heart rate or pause duration where permanent pacing is recommended", and "establishing temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important" when deciding on pacing. For atrioventricular block, in acquired second-degree Mobitz type II, high‑grade, or third‑degree block not due to reversible or physiologic causes, "permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms", whereas for other AV block types, pacing "should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block". In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction "between 36% to 50%" with AV block who are expected to require ventricular pacing " > 40% of the time", techniques providing more physiologic activation (eg, cardiac resynchronization therapy, His bundle pacing) "are preferred to right ventricular pacing to prevent heart failure". After transcatheter aortic valve replacement, conduction abnormalities are common and "recommendations on postoperative surveillance and pacemaker implantation are made in this guideline". For pacemaker implantation, "shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized", and decisions are based on "the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences". Using shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients or legally defined surrogates "has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent", which "should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide". Identification of patients who will benefit most from emerging pacing technologies (eg, His bundle pacing, transcatheter leadless pacing systems) "will require further investigation".

Pacemaker device and mode selection — pacing after atrioventricular (AV) junction ablation: Catheter ablation of the AV node to produce complete heart block combined with permanent pacing is a recognized treatment to control the heart rate and alleviate symptoms in patients with medically refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). However, 16–35% of patients develop permanent AF within the first 6 months after AV junction ablation, and this rate continues to increase during long-term follow-up. Based on the high rate of progression to persistent or permanent AF following AV junction ablation, single-chamber ventricular pacing is an appropriate mode of pacing for the majority of patients undergoing this procedure.

### Echocardiographic screening for heart failure and optimization of the care pathway for individuals with pacemakers: a randomized controlled trial [^117NWzLu]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Pacemaker implantation for bradycardia improves quality of life and survival. Over a million devices are implanted globally each year –. Long-term right ventricular (RV) pacing is associated with an adverse effect on left ventricular (LV) function and the development of HF, especially in the presence of other cardiovascular morbidities, which augurs a worse prognosis –. Routine pacemaker follow-up offers the opportunity to screen for pacemaker-associated HF. However, people with pacemakers were either actively excluded from randomized controlled trials assessing medical therapies for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or subgroup analyses of those with pacemakers were not undertaken. Therefore, as a result of the lack of evidence, no medical treatment strategy has been recommended for this group in current HF or pacing guidelines, such that the effects of a pathway, which includes screening followed by patient-centered education and optimized medical management for people found to have impaired LV function, are unknown.

OPT-PACE (OPTimizing PACEmaker therapy) was designed to determine the effect on clinical outcomes of screening for impaired LV function in people with pacemakers implanted for bradycardia.

### Indications and recommendations for pacemaker therapy… [^111egJ7J]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Symptoms can result from the bradycardia, the paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or both. It is important to correlate symptoms with one of the above-mentioned arrhythmias by means of ECG, ambulatory ECG monitoring, or an event recorder. At times, correlation can be difficult because of the intermittent nature of the arrhythmia. Electrophysiologic studies can be used to diagnose sinus node dysfunction, but their utility is limited by low sensitivity and specificity. Trained athletes often manifest physiologic sinus bradycardia with resting heart rates as low as 40 to 50 beats per minute. During sleep, these athletes may have a heart rate as low as 30 beats per minute with associated pauses or type I second-degree AV block resulting in asystole as long as 2. 8 seconds. In turn, atrial overdrive pacing may reduce episodes of obstructive sleep apnea in these patients.

18 Another form of sinus node dysfunction is "chronotropic incompetence, " defined as an inadequate sinus rate response to stress or exercise. Clinical studies have shown that rate-responsive pacing clinically benefits patients by restoring physiologic heart rate during exercise.
19. An uncommon cause of syncope is the hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome, which is defined as syncope or presyncope resulting from an extreme response to carotid sinus stimulation. As in vasovagal syncope, there usually are vasodepressor and cardioinhibitory components of this reflex. Therefore, before pacing therapy is recommended for carotid sinus hypersensitivity, the relative contribution of the two reflex components must be determined. The basic criterion for a diagnosis of hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome is asystole in excess of 3 seconds caused by sinus arrest or advanced AV block as a result of carotid sinus stimulation.

31 Pauses up to 3 seconds during carotid sinus stimulation are considered to be physiologic. Recent studies have reported that many older patients who sustain unexplained falls may have a hypersensitive carotid sinus, 34 and that pacing therapy can reduce subsequent falls significantly. 35 The main recommendations for pacing therapy in these syndromes are listed in Table 7. 1 The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media.

Discussion

Pacemaker-induced ventricular tachycardia has been described in literature. The earliest report was published in 1965 in a patient who had a fixed rate pacemaker inserted. The most probable reason described was electronic failure. Examination by the manufacturer of the unit used in this case revealed the failure of a transistor in the timing circuit. There was also a 6.4 V direct current leak caused by component failure of the pacemaker output capacitor. This current has been shown to cause polarisation and increased resistance at the positive pole of myocardium.

The fusion of two separate impulses, one arising from pacemaker, the other from ventricular ectopic, is another possible reason described in literature. Ventricular extra systoles occurred at a variable coupling interval of 640–720 ms, and that they were all of similar configuration. Those extra systoles with a short coupling interval (653 (41) ms) inhibited the output of the pacemaker and did not cause ventricular tachycardia. The ventricular extra systoles with a long coupling interval that was close to the programmed cycle length of the pacemaker (710 (14) vs 732 ms) failed to inhibit the pacemaker output, presumably because depolarisation from the extra systole had not spread to the pacemaker electrode site in time to inhibit the pacemaker. The resulting fusion beat usually triggered ventricular tachycardia.

Other possible cause mentioned in the literature is atrial sensing during postventricular refractory period eliciting ineffective atrial stimulation. The following native ventricular beat cannot be identified by the device because it occurred during cross-chamber blanking period. As a result, after atrioventricular delay, ventricular pacing artefact is delivered inducing fatal ventricular tachycardia.

Learning points

Pacemaker-induced ventricular tachycardia is an emergency which needs to be addressed urgently.
Patients with this particular type of ventricular tachycardia would not respond to any medical treatment or cardioversion as fault lies in pacemaker.
These patients need to disable the device via magnet and urgent change of pulse generator.
Recognition of this phenomenon is vital as mostly patients present in emergency room with symptoms or collapse.

Heart Rhythm (2012). Medium credibility.

Conclusions on pacing strategy — clinical effects and trade-offs: Patients with sinus node dysfunction (SND) may derive benefit from atrial or dual-chamber pacing compared with ventricular pacing regarding risks of AF, stroke, pacemaker syndrome, and quality of life, and over the long term dual-chamber pacing may be cost-effective. In atrioventricular (AV) block, dual-chamber pacing compared to ventricular pacing has equivalent effects on major cardiovascular outcomes including mortality, stroke, heart failure, and AF, but can reduce pacemaker syndrome and improve quality-of-life indices. Although implant complications are more frequent for dual-chamber than single-chamber devices, this higher risk is offset over time by reoperations in single-chamber recipients for AV block or pacemaker syndrome.

Sinus node dysfunction — right ventricular pacing effects and device programming emphasize minimizing unnecessary ventricular pacing. "In multiple studies, right ventricular pacing has been associated with negative physiologic consequences as a result of ventricular dyssynchrony", including left ventricular chamber enlargement, worsened functional mitral regurgitation, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and increased inter- and intraventricular dyssynchrony. A programming approach to minimize ventricular pacing "resulted in a 40% risk reduction of persistent AF", and "an increasing percentage of ventricular pacing was associated with a higher rate of systolic heart failure hospitalization and new onset of AF". Consequently, "it is almost always appropriate to program the pacemaker to minimize unnecessary chronic right ventricular pacing whenever possible" except when severe first-degree atrioventricular block causes inappropriate atrioventricular timing.

Transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) nonmagnet and magnet ECG assessment — goals are to determine whether the patient displays intrinsic rhythm or is being intermittently or continuously paced at the programmed settings, characterize the patient's underlying atrial mechanism, and, if intrinsic rhythm is displayed, determine that normal sensing is present for 1 or both chambers depending on whether it is a single- or dual-chamber pacemaker and programmed pacing mode; during magnet application, goals are to verify effective capture of the appropriate chamber(s) and verify the programmed pacing mode, assess magnet rate and compare with previous transmissions while being aware of the magnet rate that represents elective replacement indicators, assess pulse width if it is 1 of the elective replacement indicators, demonstrate and analyze Threshold Margin Test results when programmed on, and, for dual-chamber pacemakers, if magnet application results in a change in AV interval during magnet application, that change should be demonstrated and verified.

Pacemaker discontinuation — supportive evidence: In 1 study, 5 patients referred for pacemaker replacement or a pacemaker related complication in which the original indication for pacing appeared to have resolved had intrinsic rhythm documented and 2 underwent EPS; pacemakers were removed from all 5 and none had symptomatic bradycardia after 18 to 48 months of follow-up. A protocol used to discontinue pacing therapy in 70 patients without a clear initial or persistent indication included clinical evaluation, echocardiogram, exercise testing, and tilt table testing; if tests were negative, the pulse generator energy was turned to off with periodic 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring for up to 1 year, after which an EPS was conducted; of the 70 patients, 35 had their pacemaker explanted and after a mean follow-up of 30.3 months all patients remained asymptomatic except for 1 patient who died of a non-cardiac cause. In a retrospective study of patients who underwent lead extraction without device replacement, mortality appeared to be dependent on comorbid conditions and arrhythmia related death was rare.

### Physiological pacing: mechanisms, clinical indications, and perspectives [^113heWy9]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Early steps in physiological pacing

Demand pacing

The development of demand pacing, where pacing is withheld on sensing spontaneous ventricular depolarization, promoted intrinsic ventricular activation and overcame the problem of pacing-induced arrhythmias due to R on T stimulation.

Rate response

Normally, heart rate increases with exercise and stress to meet metabolic demands. Rate response was one of the early developments in pacing, which allowed pacemakers to replicate normal physiological function more closely. This is achieved using sensors within the pacemaker generator, typically either accelerometers or measures of minute ventilation which assess respiratory rate.

Atrioventricular sequential pacing

Dual-chamber AV sequential pacing was introduced to provide co-ordination of atrial and ventricular activation. Atrioventricular sequential pacing increases cardiac output by 14–25% compared with VVI pacing. Improvements in symptoms and quality of lifewere observed with the introduction of AV sequential pacing, but dual-chamber pacing did not appear to reduce mortality compared with VVI pacing.

Pacemaker cost-effectiveness and generator longevity — In the MOST analysis, dual-chamber pacemaker implantation compared with ventricular pacing had "approximately $53,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained over 4 years of follow-up", and when "extended over the expected lifetime of a typical patient, the calculated cost-effectiveness of dual-chamber pacing improved to $6,800 per quality-adjusted year of life gained". Regarding generator replacement burden, "16% to 24% of pacemaker implantations are for replacement of generators; of those, 76% are replaced because their batteries have reached their elective replacement time".

### Advances and future directions in Cardiac Pacemakers: part 2 of a 2-part series [^112ct9fZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

In the second part of this 2-part series on pacemakers, we present recent advances in pacemakers and preview future developments. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a potent treatment for heart failure in the setting of ventricular dyssynchrony. Successful CRT using coronary venous pacing depends on appropriate patient selection, lead implantation, and device programming. Despite optimization of these factors, nonresponse to CRT may occur in one-third of patients, which has led to a search for alternative techniques such as multisite pacing, His bundle pacing, and endocardial left ventricular pacing. A paradigm shift in pacemaker technology has been the development of leadless pacemaker devices, and on the horizon is the development of batteryless devices. Remote monitoring has ushered in an era of greater safety and the ability to respond to device malfunction in a timely fashion, improving outcomes.

Table 2 — choice of pacemaker generator in selected indications for pacing — defines selection criteria across sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular block, and neurally mediated syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity: For sinus node dysfunction, a single-chamber atrial pacemaker is aligned with "No suspected abnormality of atrioventricular conduction and not at increased risk for future atrioventricular block" and "Maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony during pacing desired", whereas a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker corresponds to "Maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony during pacing not necessary". For atrioventricular block, a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker is used for "Chronic atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachyarrhythmia or maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony during pacing not necessary", while a dual-chamber pacemaker addresses situations where "Atrioventricular synchrony during pacing desired"; selection can also note "Rate response available if desired". For neurally mediated syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity, a dual-chamber pacemaker applies when "Sinus mechanism present". The table also specifies that a "Single-lead, atrial-sensing ventricular pacemaker" may be considered when there is "Desire to limit the number of pacemaker leads".

### Inadvertent left ventricle endocardial or uncomplicated right ventricular pacing: how to differentiate in the emergency department [^112nVJ9Z]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Temporary transvenous pacemaker implantation is an important and critical procedure for emergency physicians. Traditionally, temporary pacemakers are inserted by electrocardiography (ECG) guidance in the emergency department because fluoroscopy at the bedside in an unstable patient can be limited by time and equipment availability. However, in the presence of atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patent foramen ovale, the pacemaker lead can be implanted inadvertently into the left ventricle or directly into the coronary sinus instead of right ventricle. Regular pacemaker rhythm can be achieved despite inadvertent implantation of the pacemaker lead into the left ventricle, leading to ignorance of the possibility of lead malposition.

Case Report

A 65-year-old female patient with hemodynamic instability and complete atrioventricular block underwent temporary pacemaker implantation via right jugular vein with ECG guidance at the emergency department. Approximately 12 h after implantation, it was noticed that the ECG revealed right bundle branch block (RBBB)-type paced QRS complexes. Diagnostic workup revealed that the lead was inadvertently located in the left ventricular apex. This case illustrates the importance of careful scrutiny of the 12-lead ECG and imaging clues in identifying lead malposition in the emergency department. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Because inadvertent left ventricle endocardial pacing carries a high risk for systemic embolization, it is important to determine whether an RBBB pattern induced by ventricular pacing is the result of a malpositioned lead or uncomplicated transvenous right ventricular pacing.

### Pacemaker spikes misleading the diagnosis of ventricular fibrillation [^1173NkWP]. Resuscitation (2005). Low credibility.

Pacemakers are used more and more in modern cardiology, because of the increasing age of patients and the increasing number of cases of congestive heart failure treated with biventricular stimulation. Twelve lead ECG traces of electro-stimulated patients normally can be interpreted correctly, but in emergency circumstances where only a three lead ECG trace is available (i.e. the usual monitoring setting in the pre-hospital arena or intensive care unit) recognition of the underlying baseline rhythm may be difficult. The case described illustrates how differentiation between true asystole and fine ventricular fibrillation in the presence of some confounding elements (e.g. pacemaker meditated spikes) can be challenging for the physician and life-threatening for the patient. Therefore, after selecting the best diagnostic ECG trace, direct current defibrillation should be used in the presence of a persistent but uncertain cardiac rhythm, even if it may be thought to be asystole or pulse-less electrical activity.

### Effects of ventricular rate and regularity on the velocity and magnitude of left atrial appendage flow in atrial fibrillation [^114Yr8Ck]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively determine whether ventricular rate and regularity are significant determinants of the velocity and magnitude of left atrial appendage (LAA) flow.

Design and Patients

12 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), high degree atrioventricular block, and indwelling permanent pacemakers were studied.

Setting

Cardiology department of a tertiary referral centre.

Interventions

Pacing was triggered by an external programmable transcutaneous device. Patients were paced at 60, 120, and 150 beats/min in both regular and irregular rhythm. LAA flow velocity and magnitude were assessed with transoesophageal Doppler echocardiography.

Main Outcome Measures

Peak and mean LAA inflow and outflow velocity, and time-velocity interval (TVI) of LAA flow.

Results

Increasing ventricular rate was associated with significantly lower peak inflow (p < 0.01), peak outflow (p < 0.05), mean inflow (p < 0.01), and mean outflow (p < 0.05) velocities and with a lower TVI of LAA filling and emptying velocities (p < 0.01). This effect was noted at rates of 60 beats/min compared with both 120 and 150 beats/min. At a pacing rate of 120 beats/min there was a significantly higher total TVI when pacing at a regular than at an irregular rhythm (40.16 (14.6) cm v 30.74 (10.9) cm, p < 0.05).

Conclusions

In this study, LAA filling velocities in patients in AF were significantly influenced by paced ventricular rate and to a much lesser extent ventricular rhythm. These results suggest that rapid ventricular rates may predispose to stasis in the LAA in AF.

Pacemaker cost-effectiveness and generator longevity — dual-chamber pacemaker implantation compared with ventricular pacemaker implantation (VVI) was approximately $53,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained over 4 years of follow-up, and when extended over the expected lifetime of a typical patient, the calculated cost-effectiveness of dual-chamber pacing improved to $6,800 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. In resource use and replacement, 16% to 24% of pacemaker implantations are for replacement of generators; of those, 76% are replaced because their batteries have reached their elective replacement time. Hardware and software features that prolong useful battery longevity may improve the cost-effectiveness of pacing; expert programming can prolong longevity by an average of 4.2 years compared with nominal settings, and leads with steroid elution and/or high pacing impedance allow for less current drain. Generators that automatically determine whether a pacing impulse results in capture allow outputs closer to threshold values, although rigorous studies supporting the overall cost-effectiveness of these advanced pacing features are lacking.

EMI and CIEDs — perioperative impact and determinants are outlined: EMI causing malfunction of pacemakers and defibrillators is well-described; the perioperative period is particularly problematic due to exposure to energy sources and machinery, with effects ranging from pacing inhibition and inappropriate tracking of electrical noise to lead‑tissue interface damage, pulse generator damage, and electrical reset mode; EMI can also interfere with rate responsive algorithms and can rarely cause pulse generator damage; the significance and extent of abnormal behavior in CIEDs depend on the strength, duration, and type of interference; and the clinical impact depends upon clinical indications, intrinsic rate and rhythm, pacing mode, protective circuitry, and manufacturer‑specific algorithms.

Perioperative management of cardiac implantable electronic devices — pacing dependence and device assessment emphasizes identifying pacing dependence from history and record indicators (bradycardia causing syncope or symptoms; successful atrioventricular nodal ablation; device interrogation showing no spontaneous ventricular activity at lowest programmable rate in nontracking mode), confirming current settings and proper function via interrogation or the most recent report, and reinterrogating if function is in question. It clarifies that absent intrinsic rhythm is completely pacing-dependent, whereas inadequate intrinsic rhythm may be relatively or functionally pacing-dependent; in many patients, proper device function can be determined from the most recent interrogation report, and the majority of consultants and ASA members agree that a cardiac implantable electronic device should be interrogated within 3 to 6 months before a procedure; involvement of a cardiac implantable electronic device specialist may be needed to help determine device details and function.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Bradycardia device selection — patient factors and reasonable pacing system choices include that patients with atrioventricular block will require ventricular pacing for rate support, and specialized pacing modalities such as biventricular pacing or His bundle pacing may help alleviate deleterious effects of right ventricular pacing. When determining single, dual, or biventricular systems, factors should include the projected percent of ventricular pacing and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and biventricular pacing can be useful for the patient on guideline-directed management and therapy who has an LVEF of ≤ 35% with an anticipated requirement for significant ventricular pacing (> 40%). Although dual chamber devices provide atrioventricular synchrony and are generally preferable, it is reasonable to implant a single chamber ventricular pacing system in patients who do not need the chronotropic support from atrial pacing and who have significant comorbidities or limited mobility; for patients who will only require intermittent pacing support, single chamber ventricular pacing can be a reasonable option, and patients who require intermittent or occasional pacing are less likely to develop symptoms of pacemaker syndrome such as exertion intolerance and hypotension. Clinical situations where it may be reasonable to implant a single chamber ventricular pacing device include patients with frailty or significant comorbidities, advanced age, a very sedentary lifestyle, difficulty placing the atrial lead and very infrequent episodes where pacing would be needed.

### Predictors of pacemaker requirement in patients with implantable loop recorder and unexplained syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113P7e69]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

AF is an independent risk factor for the development of syncope and is associated with SND and sick sinus syndrome. Following elongated intermittent AF pauses, syncope is more likely to occur in SND patients. In addition, AF associated tachycardia suppresses sinus node automaticity upon termination of tachycardia which results in sinus pauses with irregular duration. From a histological standpoint, fibrosis and degenerative alterations at sinus node, atrium, and bundle branches are more frequently witnessed in patients with bradycardia‐tachycardia syndrome (so‐called sick sinus syndrome). These modifications, particularly those near the atrium tissue, inhibit sinus node impulsion activity which is manifested as a prolonged PR interval in the EKG. Previous clinical studies demonstrate that abnormalities at atrium level namely AF, first degree atrioventricular block, and elongated PR interval increase the risk of recurrent syncope with the need for pacing device implantation which is concurrent with our result.,

Sinus bradycardia was found to be a major predictive factor of pacing requirement based on our analysis which is the most common arrhythmia seen in individuals with unexplained syncope during ILR monitoring. Similar to other atrial dysfunction related complications, based on clinical and observational studies, sinus bradycardia is affiliated with reduction of heart rate mostly through SND or disturbances in cardiac conduction system which necessitates the need for pacemaker implantation. In earlier research done in this area, sinus bradycardia was the most prevalent arrhythmia found; for instance, in a study using data from the PICTURE registry in nearly half of the patients with diagnosed syncope, bradycardia was present. Additionally, a number of clinical studies identified sinus bradycardia as a predictive factor of pacemaker implantation which is in line with our results.,

Valvular heart disease is another risk factor for the implantation of pacing device based on our study. Cardiac valvular disease causes structural alterations in cardiac muscles which decreases cardiac output. Although structural heart disorders are known to increase the incidence of cardiogenic syncope, prior investigations have not consistently identified these structural abnormalities as risk factors for pacemaker implantation. This finding can be explained by the fact that, even while structural changes can result in cardiogenic syncope, the cardiac conduction system typically remains intact and the insertion of a pacemaker is not recommended in the absence of arrhythmia.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^113Nhnfc]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial infarction — conduction disturbances and pacemakers — diagnosis is complicated by conduction-related ST-T changes, with specific electrocardiogram (ECG) findings that may indicate acute ischemia. Comparison to a preadmission ECG may be helpful if it "does not delay time to treatment". Ischemic symptoms with presumed new left bundle branch block (LBBB) or right bundle branch block (RBBB) that is not rate-related are "associated with an adverse prognosis". In LBBB, "ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm concordant with the QRS complex in any lead may be an indicator of acute myocardial ischemia", and "similar findings can be useful" in right ventricular paced rhythms; for some non–pacemaker-dependent patients, temporarily switching off the pacemaker "may also be useful", though interpretation must consider "stimulation-induced changes (electrical memory)". In RBBB, "new or presumed new ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm, or ST-segment or T wave abnormalities (excluding leads V1–V3)… may indicate acute myocardial ischemia", and new/presumed new RBBB without associated ST/T changes "is associated with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0–2 flow in as many as 66% of patients (compared with > 90% in those with ST-segment or T wave changes)".

### Cardiac pacing: the state of the art [^114jyhDD]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Permanent cardiac pacing remains the only effective treatment for chronic, symptomatic bradycardia. In recent years, the role of implantable pacing devices has expanded substantially. At the beginning of the 21st century, exciting developments in technology seem to happen at an exponential rate. Major advances have extended the use of pacing beyond the arrhythmia horizon. Such developments include dual-chamber pacers, rate-response algorithms, improved functionality of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, combinations of sensors for optimum physiological response, and advances in lead placement and extraction. Cardiac pacing is poised to help millions of patients worldwide to live better electrically. We review pacing studies of sick-sinus syndrome, neurocardiogenic syncope, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and cardiac resynchronisation therapy, which are common or controversial indications for cardiac pacing. We also look at the benefits and complications of implantation in specific arrhythmias, suitability of different pacing modes, and the role of permanent pacing in the management of patients with heart failure.

### Do media players cause interference with pacemakers? [^111ppqfv]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Electrical devices generate electromagnetic fields that may interfere with pacemakers. Media players cause telemetry interference with pacemakers, but it is not known whether they cause direct interference with pacemakers. The purpose of this study was to examine the interaction between pacemakers and 3 different media players.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized study, 54 patients with dual chamber pacemakers who were in sinus rhythm underwent baseline observation, followed by observation under telemetry communication. These patients were then randomly evaluated with 3 media players (iPod 3G, iPod Photo, and iPod Touch Apple, Cupertino, CA) with and without telemetry communication for 1 minute each. Patients were monitored for pacemaker malfunction using a single-channel ECG during exposure to media players. The pacemaker was interrogated after each exposure and an interrogation report was printed for evaluation. Pacemaker interference was categorized as type I, II, or III. Types I and II interference described telemetry interference and type III interference was defined as any direct interference with pacemaker function or programmed parameters.

Results

A total of 54 patients (29 men and 25 women; mean age 77.2 ± 9.3 y) were evaluated. In total, of the 162 tests (for telemetry interference) 36.4% were positive (Type I and II). Type III interference was also evaluated in 162 tests and none showed any evidence of direct interference.

Conclusion

Media players cause telemetry interference with pacemakers, but they do not directly interfere with pacemaker function.

Three years after, in 2002 the patient experienced ventricular tachycardia and presented with respiratory distress that progressed to. full cardiopulmonary arrest requiring intubation. Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was documented at presentation and the patient was successfully cardioverted to sinus rhythm. The patient was extubated the following day. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient experienced an episode of near syncope associated with palpitations and was. transferred for further evaluation. A transesophageal echocardiogram noted a wire passing through the right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery. Fluoroscopy revealed epicardial temporary pacing wires retained from his cabg operation in 1999 and a wire of the same caliber that appeared to.

The unipolar epicardial pacing wire was extracted and non-sustained monomorphic vt occurred during wire manipulation. Because of the patient¿s left ventricular dysfunction, he was still considered to be at high risk for sudden cardiac death and underwent successful defibrillator implantation. The patient has done well, with no palpitations since discharge. Additional information has been requested.

### Atrial pacing minimization in sinus node dysfunction and risk of incident atrial fibrillation: a randomized trial [^111Bz81Y]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is common in patients with sinus node dysfunction; approximately 40% of patients with pacemakers due to sinus node dysfunction have a history of atrial fibrillation, and 24%–68% experience atrial fibrillation after pacemaker implantation. Previous trials demonstrated that pacing modes that preserve atrioventricular synchrony, promote intrinsic ventricular conduction, and prevent prolonged atrioventricular conduction delays can reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation. Current guidelines recommend dual-chamber pacing (DDD) to avoid unnecessary ventricular pacing but without programming of excessively long atrioventricular delays. Different pacemaker algorithms using triggered or continuous overdrive atrial pacing were developed to prevent AF. The clear effect of these algorithms has not been demonstrated in larger randomized studies. In addition, they are not well tolerated by patients and they accelerate battery depletion. Higher percentages of atrial pacing have also been linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. However, this was never tested in a randomized controlled trial and it is not known whether the association is caused by abnormal prolongation and propagation of atrial depolarization induced by pacing or whether it may result from an increased need for pacing in more progressive atrial disease. Mostly, pacemakers are programmed to a base rate of 60 bpm with activated rate-adaptive pacing to increase the heart rate during physical activity. Programming a lower base rate and avoiding rate-adaptive pacing can reduce the proportion of atrial pacing in patients with pacemakers. This trial was designed to determine whether minimizing atrial pacing in patients with sinus node dysfunction reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation.

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^112NQLWB]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Effects on Pacemaker Thresholds

Flecainide is known to increase endocardial pacing thresholds and may suppress ventricular escape rhythms. These effects are reversible if flecainide is discontinued. It should be used with caution in patients with permanent pacemakers or temporary pacing electrodes and should not be administered to patients with existing poor thresholds or nonprogrammable pacemakers unless suitable pacing rescue is available.

The pacing threshold in patients with pacemakers should be determined prior to instituting therapy with flecainide, again after one week of administration and at regular intervals thereafter. Generally threshold changes are within the range of multiprogrammable pacemakers and, when these occur, a doubling of either voltage or pulse width is usually sufficient to regain capture.

Electrolyte Disturbances

Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia may alter the effects of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Preexisting hypokalemia or hyperkalemia should be corrected before administration of flecainide.

Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of flecainide in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The proarrhythmic effects of flecainide, as described previously, apply also to children. In pediatric patients with structural heart disease, flecainide has been associated with cardiac arrest and sudden death. Flecainide should be started in the hospital with rhythm monitoring. Any use of flecainide in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children.

### HRS / ACCF expert consensus statement on pacemaker device and mode selection. developed in partnership between the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the American college of cardiology foundation (ACCF) and in collaboration with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [^116Kcyna]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Medium credibility.

Pacemaker device and mode selection — pacemaker syndrome: Previous studies, including a meta-analysis of patients with sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrioventricular (AV) block, reported a significant reduction in pacemaker syndrome with dual-chamber pacing compared to single-chamber ventricular pacing. In PASE, all patients received a dual-chamber pacemaker, and 26% of patients randomized to ventricular pacing were considered to have pacemaker syndrome sufficiently severe to necessitate reprogramming the pacemaker from the VVI to DDD mode; about half of those reprogrammed had AV block, and functional status assessed by SF-36 improved after crossover in all patients. In contrast, in CTOPP, only 7% of patients implanted with single-chamber pacemakers and followed over 6 years underwent reoperation for revision to a dual-chamber pacing system.

### ACC / AHA / HRS 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities [^113QCuFN]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Medium credibility.

Pacemaker generator longevity and replacement — ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines for Device-Based Therapy report that 16% to 24% of pacemaker implantations are for replacement of generators; of those, 76% are replaced because their batteries have reached their elective replacement time, and expert programming of pacemaker generators prolonged longevity by an average of 4.2 years compared with nominal settings. Optimal programming of output voltages, pulse widths, and AV delays can markedly decrease battery drain, generators that automatically determine whether a pacing impulse results in capture allow for pacing outputs closer to threshold values, and leads with steroid elution and/or high pacing impedance allow for less current drain, although rigorous studies supporting the overall cost-effectiveness of these advanced pacing features are lacking.

Externalized active fixation lead connected to a reusable pacemaker (temporary PPM) — uses and outcomes: Use of prolonged temporary pacing with an externalized active fixation permanent pacing lead has been demonstrated over the past 10 years, and use of an active fixation permanent pacing lead externalized and connected to a reusable PPM generator has been introduced to allow more prolonged temporary pacing for pacemaker-dependent patients with a contraindication to PPM implantation such as infection. A primary use is bridging therapy after CIED extraction for infection requiring prolonged antibiotic treatment, and patients receiving long-term antibiotics who will be receiving a new pacemaker benefit from externalized devices during therapy. Non-RCTs and cohort studies suggest much lower dislodgement and overall complication rates, with additional advantages including the ability to mobilize patients otherwise confined to bedrest in an intensive care unit. One study suggested cost saving after 1 to 2 days, and no infections have been reported with reusable sterilized pacemakers.

### Rate-dependent pacing failure after pacemaker implantation: novel insights into the mechanism of using adenosine [^117XcQfc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

An 82-year-old woman received pacemaker implantation for sick sinus syndrome. Two days after the implantation, electrocardiography showed 2:1 atrial pacing failure, followed by a bradycardia-dependent increase in the atrial pacing threshold during a pacemaker examination. However, transient 1:1 atrial pacing capture recovered by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) administration, which was performed to evaluate the bradycardia-dependent pacing failure mechanism. We considered this phenomenon to be caused by Phase 4 depolarization and avoided replacing this atrial lead. Three weeks later, the atrial pacing threshold had improved. We report the potential role of Phase 4 depolarization in a bradycardia-dependent increase in pacing threshold by using ATP.

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronisation therapy in patients with heart failure with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^112EbxPs]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

A major limitation to optimal CRT pacing in patients with AF is rapid and irregular ventricular conduction through the AV node decreasing the Bi-V pacing percentage. Even in patients who are aggressively rate controlled with multiple medications and trigger mode pacing, where device data show over 90% Bi-V pacing, more than half the patients have up to 40% of beats with fusion or pseudofusion. Ablation of the AVJ in patients with AF abolishes AV nodal conduction, allowing the ventricle to be fully paced and has been shown to lower mortality. Therefore, we explored whether AV junction ablation improves the outcomes of CRT in patients with AF. Among five similarly sized studies twoshowed that AVJ ablation improved survival in CRT patients with AF, and threeshowed no difference. In addition, Jedrzejczyk-Patej et al showed that CRT-AF patients have higher all-cause mortality compared with CRT patients in SR despite AVJ ablation. Our meta-analysis shows that patients with AF with CRT have reduced all-cause mortality if they also receive concomitant AV junction ablation, which is consistent with the findings of a meta-analysis performed by Lopes et al. Furthermore, our meta-analysis of studies comparing patients with AF only with AVJ ablation or reporting outcomes separately for this subgroup compared with CRT patients in SR shows that patients with AF with CRT who undergo an AVJ ablation have similar all-cause mortality compared with CRT patients in NSR. There could be several explanations for the beneficial effects of AVJ ablation in patients with HF and AF who undergo CRT placement. First, at higher heart rates, irregular R-R intervals in patients with AF and HF impair systolic function even with Bi-V pacing. Additionally, patients with AF and intact AV nodal conduction have a higher risk of inappropriate shocks which have been associated with higher all-cause mortality. Another possible explanation is the change in drugs or their dosage, which could cause negative inotropic effects or proarrhythmic effectsor may be independently associated with higher mortality. Moreover, AVJ ablation has also been reported as an independent predictor of spontaneous resumption of SR in patients with AF with CRT, which can also explain favourable survival outcome in this particular subset of patients. While ablate and pace strategy seems very appealing, limitations of AVJ ablation including pacemaker dependency, ventricular arrhythmiasand sudden deathshould also be considered. Presently, there are no studies comparing outcomes in patients with AF with indications for a CRT device who underwent AVJ ablation randomised to CRT-D or ICD alone.

### Runaway pacemaker [^115QCFT8]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Runaway pacemaker is phenomenon in which pacemaker induces ventricular tachycardia as a result of some malfunction in the device. This entity is not very common in clinical practice. Normally, the pacemaker perceives the inherent cardiac impulse and hence averting the delivery of pacemaker stimulus in susceptible period of cardiac cycle. This is a case of a pacemaker-induced tachycardia (named as runaway pacemaker) in a patient with a history of Single Chamber Ventricular (VVI) pacemaker. A 75-year-old man was admitted with 3 days history of fluttering in the chest, shortness of breath, central chest and epigastric pain which radiated to the back. His medical history includes pacemaker implantation in 1996 with lead complication following which he was managed with VVI pacemaker, and the last procedure was generator change 4 years ago with no complication. Examination revealed ventricular tachycardia with ECG showing paced rhythm with ventricular pacing at the rate of 200–150/min. His pacemaker-induced ventricular tachycardia was immediately aborted after putting magnet on the device which restored his baseline rhythm with heart rate of 60/min. Pacemaker was explanted urgently with replacement of new pulse generator. The patient was discharged home with VVI pacemaker showing excellent parameters.

### Acute and long-term effects of atrioventricular junction ablation and VVIR pacemaker in symptomatic patients with chronic lone atrial fibrillation and normal ventricular response [^113DPCfB]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

The precise role of irregular ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been fully elucidated. This study examined the independent effects of rhythm regularity in patients with chronic AF.

Methods and Results

This study included 50 patients who had chronic lone AF and a normal ventricular rate. Among these patients, 21 who underwent AV junction ablation and implantation of a VVIR pacemaker constituted the ablation group; the other 29 patients were the medical group. Acute hemodynamic findings were measured in 21 ablation patients before ablation (during AF, baseline) and 15 minutes after ablation (during right ventricular pacing). Compared with baseline data, ablation and pacing therapy increased cardiac output (4.7 ± 0.8 vs 5.2 ± 0.9 L/min; P = 0.05), decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (16 ± 5 vs 13 ± 4 mmHg; P = 0.001), and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (14 ± 4 vs 11 ± 3 mmHg; P < 0.05). After 12 months, the ablation group patients showed lower scores in general quality of life (-20%; P < 0.001), overall symptoms (-24%; P < 0.001), overall activity scale (-23%; P = 0.004), and significant increase of left ventricular ejection fraction (44% ± 6% vs 49% ± 5%; P = 0.02) by echocardiographic examination.

Conclusion

AV junction ablation and pacing in patients with chronic AF and normal ventricular response may confer acute and long-term benefits beyond rate control by eliminating rhythm irregularity.

### Implantable defibrillators: which is the best device for each patient? [^1124p4yB]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 S‐ICD Limitations

Despite these developments, certain limitations of the S‐ICD remain. Approximately 8% of patients who may benefit from the S‐ICD may not qualify due to T wave oversensing by the device. Furthermore, the S‐ICD battery is prone to premature depletion. Importantly, the S‐ICD is not capable of pacing. Therefore, careful consideration needs to be given before S‐ICD implantation to anticipate a potential need for pacing. Indeed, in a multi‐center analysis, 4/22 patients who underwent S‐ICD extraction over 4 years required a device capable of pacing. To address this shortcoming, the MODULAR study recently investigated the short‐term outcomes associated with a leadless pacemaker that communicated with a S‐ICD to provide bradycardia and anti‐tachycardia pacing. Results demonstrated a low rate of procedural complications and high rate of device‐device communication through 6 months of follow‐up, however long‐term outcomes remain unknown.

### Relationship between pacemaker dependency and the effect of pacing mode on cardiovascular outcomes [^117QY8ve]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A recently completed trial, the Canadian Trial of Physiological Pacing (CTOPP), showed that physiological pacing did not significantly reduce mortality, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization, but it did show that atrial fibrillation occurred less frequently in patients with physiological pacing. Many pacemaker patients experience only transient bradyarrhythmias with an adequate unpaced heart rate (UHR) and are not pacemaker-dependent. The purpose of the present analysis was to determine if pacemaker-dependent patients have an increased benefit from physiological pacing compared with non-pacemaker-dependent patients.

Methods and Results

Of 2568 patients included in the CTOPP trial, 2244 patients had a pacemaker dependency test performed at the first follow-up visit. The yearly event rate of cardiovascular death or stroke steadily increased with decreasing UHR in the ventricular pacing group, but it remained constant in the physiological pacing group. When the patients were subdivided to UHR ≤ 60 bpm or > 60 bpm, there was an interaction between pacing mode treatment and UHR subgroup. The Kaplan-Meier plot confirmed a physiological pacing advantage only in the UHR ≤ 60 bpm subgroup. This differential effect was also present for the outcomes of cardiovascular death and total mortality.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that UHR at first follow-up has an important influence on how pacing mode selection affects cardiovascular death and total mortality. Pacemaker-dependent patients with low UHR will probably be paced frequently and will likely benefit from physiological pacing. In contrast, non-pacemaker-dependent patients will likely be paced infrequently and may not benefit from physiological pacing.

Recommendation-specific supportive text

1. Small randomized and nonrandomized studies, have shown adverse clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in patients who have interruption of CRT after having experienced improvement with CRT previously. Patients with HFimpEF (with near normalization of LVEF) resulting from superior response to CRT have poor outcomes when CRT pacing is terminated. This was demonstrated in a small single-center randomized studyof 19 patients who showed a superior response to CRT (with improvement in LVEF ≥ 50% and NYHA class I or II) at mid-term follow-up (average 39 months after CRT implant). These patients were randomized to CRT pacing continuation (On-Pace group) or deactivation (Off-Pace group). The patients in the Off-Pace group deteriorated with poor clinical and echocardiographic outcomes, while the On-Pace group had no change in status, clearly highlighting the benefit of continuation of CRT in these patients despite HFimpEF. Intuitively, this recommendation applies to patients with CSP, but data on device replacement in CSP are not yet available.

2. All patients who have benefited from CRT, regardless of the extent of the benefit, should continue CRT at the time of elective generator replacement interval. This recommendation recognizes that beyond improvement in LVEF, CRT benefit may include stabilization of ventricular function as well as improvement in symptoms or functional status.

3. Multiple studies have examined the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with previously low LVEF who have undergone improvement in LVEF due to any reason including medical management and/or CRT. These include retrospective studies and subanalyses of RCTs. Most studies show that an elevated risk of tachyarrhythmias persists in these patients, although decreased compared to patients whose LVEF did not improve ≥ 35%. – In patients with near normalization of LVEF, the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias appears to be markedly reduced, –, yet still persists. Currently the data are inadequate to support discontinuation of ICD therapy at the time of elective replacement interval. An additional consideration is that revision to CRT-P from CRT-D may not be possible without an adapter if a DF-4 defibrillation lead is in place.

4. Certain patients with CRT might have rapid battery depletion due to high LV lead thresholds. This could be a result of suboptimal lead threshold at implant or a subsequent worsening over time. Frequent pacemaker generator replacements carry a statistically significant risk of complications including infection and hematoma. In such a scenario, revision of the LV lead or CPP lead may reduce the frequency of future generator replacements.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Temporary pacing for bradycardia attributable to sinus node dysfunction (SND) — implementation notes that temporary pacing is used to acutely treat bradycardia causing hemodynamically significant instability, such as prolonged and symptomatic pauses, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias mediated by bradycardia, or severe symptomatic bradycardia attributable to a reversible cause with the goal to avoid PPM implantation. Temporary pacing can be implemented transcutaneously, via a transesophageal pacing electrode, or by insertion of a transvenous pacing catheter; emergency temporary pacing for hemodynamic instability generally involves pacing the right ventricle because of ease of access from the venous system, and in rare cases right atrial pacing (alone or with ventricular pacing) is used when maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony is critical.

### Very low ventricular pacing rates can Be achieved safely in a heterogeneous pacemaker population and provide clinical benefits: the Canadian multi-centre randomised study-spontaneous atrioVEntricular conduction pReservation (CAN-SAVE R) trial [^1141imaY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Benefits from reduced ventricular pacing accrue over time. Brief follow-up periods, such as the 6-month primary analysis of the MinVPace trial, failed to show a significant impact on rates of AF despite marked reductions in rates of ventricular pacing (eg, from 86% to 2%). Significant differences emerged over a longer follow-up of 1.4 years. Other trials, such as CTOPP, required even longer follow-up periods to demonstrate that different pacing modes may influence propensity for AF. In the recent PreFER MVP trial, no significant impact of the pacing mode could be observed at a follow-up of 2 years.

Risk – Benefit Assessment

A risk–benefit assessment should be individualized when considering algorithms to minimize RV pacing. The current study excluded patients with > 40% RV pacing during the 2-month run-in phase. In qualifying patients, both treatment alternatives were well tolerated and associated with similar overall rates of adverse events. There are, however, reservations around programming DDD pacemakers with long AV intervals, since deleterious consequences such as endless loop (or pacemaker-mediated) tachycardias, and timing cycle conflicts that limit the detection of atrial tachyarrhythmias, have been reported. In light of recently expressed concerns about possible proarrhythmic effects of algorithms designed to minimize ventricular pacing, it is reassuring to note that no ventricular tachyarrhythmic events were associated with the SafeR mode in the CAN-SAVE R trial.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Permanent pacing techniques and methods for atrioventricular block — In patients with SND and atrioventricular block who require permanent pacing, dual chamber pacing is recommended over single chamber ventricular pacing. For patients in sinus rhythm with a single chamber ventricular pacemaker who develop pacemaker syndrome, revising to a dual chamber pacemaker is recommended. In patients with atrioventricular block who have an indication for permanent pacing with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 36% and 50% and are expected to require ventricular pacing more than 40% of the time, it is reasonable to choose pacing methods that maintain physiologic ventricular activation (eg, cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT] or His bundle pacing) over right ventricular pacing.
