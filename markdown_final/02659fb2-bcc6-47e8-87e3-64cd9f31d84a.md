## Question

Does annually tracking anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels help inform the clinical course of puberty or the risk of stalled puberty?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether annually measuring AMH can help understand the clinical course of puberty or indicate the risk of stalled or delayed puberty. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the longitudinal evidence for intra-individual AMH stability and whether a personal "setpoint" exists. Then, I should examine AMH's physiological trajectory around pubertal onset and whether population patterns translate into individual prediction. Next, I will check for direct evidence that serial AMH predicts stalled or delayed puberty and consider disease-specific exceptions. After that, I should review assay variability, reference ranges, and interpretability to see if annual changes are even detectable beyond noise. Finally, I will synthesize clinical implications and formulate a practical recommendation for monitoring puberty, keeping in mind guideline-level context and limitations of AMH in pediatrics.

> Let me first confirm the strength of evidence on AMH tracking within individuals across childhood; I need to ensure that any claim about annual monitoring is grounded in longitudinal data. High-quality longitudinal work shows robust intra-individual stability from infancy through adolescence, with adolescent AMH correlating with infancy, mid-childhood, and peripubertal levels and a mean within-person variation near half an SD, which strongly suggests a personal biological "setpoint" that tends to persist over time rather than drift meaningfully year to year [^1149mb6H] [^1176gqeu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what that stability means clinically; I should verify AMH's pattern around the pubertal transition and whether it tracks individual timing. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall that AMH rises at puberty — wait, let me verify that more carefully; in fact, AMH typically increases from infancy into mid-childhood and then declines with pubertal onset, with pubertal girls having lower AMH than prepubertal peers and with a documented decline between 9 and 11 years, while AMH throughout development shows a negative correlation with FSH reflecting hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal maturation, which are population-level patterns rather than individualized predictive thresholds for delayed puberty [^111pdxPL] [^113TWhVa] [^1149mb6H].

> I need to check whether any studies directly test annual AMH tracking to predict stalled or delayed puberty in otherwise healthy children; let me think about disease-specific data as possible confounders. No direct evidence demonstrates that serial AMH measurements predict delayed or stalled puberty in healthy populations, whereas in Turner syndrome very low AMH predicts absent spontaneous puberty — a context of accelerated follicle loss that is not generalizable to healthy children — and AMH behavior in precocious puberty reflects treatment-related suppression rather than delayed-puberty risk; similarly, although higher adolescent AMH relates to later adult PCOS, adding AMH to clinical features did not improve prediction, underscoring limited additive value of AMH in adolescent prognostication outside specific disease states [^112YLtFh] [^113ng7sB] [^115W2sdL] [^116FbKeX] [^116Xjxjd].

> Next, I should review whether annual fluctuations would even be interpretable beyond technical noise; I should double-check assay standardization and normative overlap. Assay performance remains a major limitation, with documented preanalytical instability and inter-assay differences undermining detection of small year-to-year changes, and even though adult-cycle variability is modest, intercycle coefficients of variation around 20–25% and broad, overlapping pediatric reference ranges mean that subtle annual shifts fall within biological and analytical variability, making interpretation of year-on-year change in healthy girls unreliable without validated thresholds [^112ujfRs] [^112CcVUt] [^116MTHbX] [^114Ct8Kj] [^116BAZBP].

> Let me synthesize what AMH can reasonably inform and where it falls short for pubertal timing; I should confirm I'm not overstating its role. AMH in pediatrics reflects the pool of small growing follicles and overall ovarian activity, can identify extremes such as markedly low levels in Turner syndrome, and has established roles after gonadotoxic exposures or in adult ovarian reserve contexts, but it lacks validated cutoffs for predicting delayed puberty in healthy children and does not outperform clinical assessment in pubertal monitoring, meaning the signal useful for research at a population level does not translate into actionable annual tracking in routine practice [^117XA8LF] [^116Mf7E5] [^112YLtFh] [^116BAZBP].

> I should now formulate a clinical recommendation and ensure it aligns with broader guideline perspectives; wait, I should verify that guidance cautions against overuse of AMH for predictive purposes. A single baseline AMH in mid-childhood might characterize an individual's relative setpoint, but repeating annual measurements adds little clinical value in healthy children; routine annual AMH tracking is not recommended for monitoring normal pubertal progression or predicting delay, whereas targeted use may be appropriate in specific scenarios such as Turner syndrome or following gonadotoxic therapy, and standard pubertal surveillance should continue to rely on clinical trajectory, growth velocity, Tanner staging, bone age as indicated, and gonadotropins when concerns arise, consistent with guidance that AMH requires clinical context and is not a routine predictive test for ovarian insufficiency [^1165SQsi] [^111j4H9E] [^116BAZBP].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise and reference-aligned; let me reconsider the core points once more. The best available longitudinal evidence shows strong intra-individual AMH stability across childhood and adolescence, which implies annual tracking will seldom yield new actionable information in healthy children, there are no validated thresholds linking annual AMH dynamics to delayed or stalled puberty, and assay and biological variability further limit interpretability; therefore, annual AMH tracking should not be used to inform the clinical course of normal puberty or to predict risk of stalled puberty in healthy children, with AMH reserved for selected disease-specific contexts where it meaningfully alters management [^1149mb6H] [^111pdxPL] [^112ujfRs].

Annual AMH trends do not reliably predict the clinical course of puberty or stalled puberty in healthy adolescents [^notfound] [^1149mb6H]. AMH levels are **relatively stable through childhood and adolescence**, reflecting an individual's ovarian activity set point rather than pubertal timing or progression [^1176gqeu] [^1149mb6H]. AMH is **not associated with age at menarche or pubertal onset**, and annual testing does not yield actionable insight into pubertal trajectory. AMH may be useful in specific contexts (e.g. Turner syndrome, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), but routine annual AMH testing is not recommended to monitor normal puberty or detect stalled puberty [^112YLtFh].

---

## Physiological role of AMH in puberty

AMH is produced by **granulosa cells of small growing follicles** and reflects the pool of small antral follicles [^115ZXPck]. In healthy girls, AMH levels are relatively stable from infancy through adolescence [^114Ct8Kj], indicating an individual set point of ovarian activity [^1149mb6H]. This stability suggests that AMH primarily reflects ovarian follicular activity rather than directly influencing pubertal timing or progression [^111RAVNS].

---

## AMH levels and pubertal timing

Longitudinal studies consistently show that AMH levels in infancy and mid-childhood strongly correlate with levels in adolescence, indicating stable individual trajectories [^1176gqeu] [^1149mb6H]. However, they also show that **AMH levels do not significantly fluctuate during puberty** and are not associated with the timing of pubertal onset or menarche [^1149mb6H]. Specifically, AMH does not predict age at menarche or pubertal onset, limiting its utility for monitoring pubertal progression.

---

## AMH and stalled puberty

Stalled puberty — delayed or arrested pubertal progression — is typically associated with hormonal abnormalities such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or primary ovarian insufficiency [^1165SQsi]. In these conditions, AMH levels may be low, reflecting diminished ovarian reserve or impaired follicular development [^112YLtFh] [^116Mf7E5]. However, in healthy adolescents, **AMH levels remain relatively stable** and do not provide specific information about the risk of stalled puberty [^1149mb6H] [^115W2sdL].

---

## Clinical utility of annual AMH measurements

Annual AMH measurements have **limited clinical utility** in monitoring normal pubertal progression or predicting stalled puberty [^1177CTZa]. The stability of AMH levels throughout childhood and adolescence suggests that annual measurements would not provide significant additional information beyond a single baseline value [^1176gqeu]. Furthermore, AMH levels are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, complicating the establishment of standardized reference ranges for pubertal monitoring [^111RYKVj] [^112ujfRs].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors **limit the reliability** of annual AMH measurements in predicting pubertal progression:

- **Genetic variability**: Individual genetic differences significantly influence AMH levels, contributing to variability in baseline levels and trajectories [^111RYKVj].

- **Environmental factors**: Environmental influences, such as nutrition and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, may affect AMH levels and ovarian function [^115PhA7R].

- **Assay variability**: Differences in assay methods and lack of standardized reference ranges complicate the interpretation of AMH measurements [^112ujfRs].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend routine annual AMH measurements** for monitoring pubertal progression or predicting stalled puberty in healthy adolescents. Instead, AMH testing is primarily recommended in specific clinical contexts, such as:

- **Turner syndrome**: AMH levels may help assess ovarian reserve and predict spontaneous puberty or premature ovarian insufficiency [^112YLtFh] [^113ng7sB].

- **Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**: AMH levels may assist in differentiating hypogonadotropic hypogonadism from constitutional delay of puberty [^113ZrGCc] [^115W2sdL].

- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Elevated AMH levels may indicate increased ovarian follicular activity associated with PCOS [^112W2ypr] [^116FbKeX].

---

## Alternative biomarkers and clinical assessments

Given the limited utility of annual AMH measurements, **alternative biomarkers and clinical assessments are recommended** for monitoring pubertal progression:

- **Gonadotropins (FSH, LH)**: Measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels provides direct information about hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activation and pubertal progression [^1177CTZa].

- **Estradiol**: Estradiol levels reflect ovarian estrogen production and are useful in assessing pubertal progression in females [^115W2sdL].

- **Clinical assessment**: Regular clinical evaluation of secondary sexual characteristics, growth velocity, and bone age remains the gold standard for monitoring pubertal progression [^1177CTZa].

---

Annual AMH measurements **do not reliably predict pubertal course** or the risk of stalled puberty in healthy adolescents [^1177CTZa]. AMH levels remain relatively stable throughout childhood and adolescence, reflecting an individual's ovarian activity rather than pubertal timing or progression [^1149mb6H]. Therefore, routine annual AMH testing is not recommended for monitoring normal pubertal development.

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^1149mb6H]. EClinicalMedicine (2023).

- **Summary**

- **Background**: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells in small growing ovarian follicles. In adult women, serum concentrations of AMH reflect the ovarian reserve of resting primordial follicles, and low AMH is associated with risk of early menopause. In contrast, patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have elevated AMH. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the individual tracking of serum AMH concentrations, as well as whether AMH in early childhood reflects ovarian activity in adolescence.

- **Methods**: In this large longitudinal study, healthy girls were examined from infancy to adolescence (1997–2019). The study included physical examinations, assessment of serum concentrations of reproductive hormones (in infancy, median age 0.3 years; mid-childhood, 7.2 years; puberty, 11.3 years; and adolescence, 15.9 years), transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS, at puberty and adolescence), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, at puberty) of the ovaries.

- **Findings**: Each girl maintained her relative AMH concentration (expressed as standard deviation (SD) scores) over time; the mean variation of individual age-adjusted AMH concentrations was 0.56 ± 0.31 SD.

Serum concentrations of AMH in adolescence correlated with AMH in infancy and childhood (infancy: r = 0.347; mid-childhood: r = 0.637; puberty: r = 0.675, all p < 0.001).

AMH correlated negatively with FSH concentrations in all age groups (infancy: r = −0.645, p < 0.001; mid-childhood: r = −0.222, p < 0.001; puberty: r = −0.354, p < 0.001; adolescence: n = 275, r = −0.175, p = 0.004).

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^115PhA7R]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The improved sensitivity and automation of AMH assays have strengthened the role of serum AMH levels as a marker for the functional ovarian reserve (FOR). Assessment of serum AMH levels in the prediction of ovarian response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and age of menopause, whether natural or iatrogenic, may be useful. However, limitations have also surfaced.

For proper interpretation of AMH levels, more knowledge is needed on endogenous and exogenous factors that regulate AMH expression. Studies further suggest that heterogeneity exists in AMH trajectories, which may hamper application in personalized patient counseling. Over recent years, the number of assays for AMH measurement has increased. However, differences exist between these assays. An international standard for AMH is therefore urgently needed to establish assay-independent cutoff values.

### Random anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a predictor of ovarian response in women with elevated baseline early follicular follicle-stimulating hormone levels [^114ZrPZu]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of random anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in assessing ovarian response among women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) diagnosed by elevated early follicular-phase FSH levels.

This was a retrospective study conducted in academic and academically affiliated assisted reproductive technology (ART) programs. The study included seventy-three women undergoing ART with elevated early follicular FSH levels. No interventions were applied.

- **Main outcome measures**: Number of oocytes retrieved during ART cycle, number of day 3 embryos, and cycle cancellation and clinical pregnancy rates.

- **Results**: Random AMH levels were strongly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved during an ART cycle among women with elevated FSH (r = 0.55). Women with elevated FSH who had a random serum AMH level of 0.6 ng/mL or higher had twice the number of oocytes retrieved (11 ± 1.3 vs. 5.6 ± 0.6), a greater number of day 3 embryos (5.7 ± 0.9 vs. 3 ± 0.5), and approximately a third of the cycle cancellation rate (14% vs. 41%) compared with women with a random serum AMH below 0.6 ng/mL. The clinical pregnancy rate was also higher among women with a random serum AMH ≥ 0.6 ng/mL (28% vs. 14%), however, the difference was not statistically significant.

In conclusion, a random serum AMH level is useful in setting expectations for ART prognosis in women with elevated early follicular-phase serum FSH levels.

### Anti-müllerian hormone reflects the severity of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112W2ypr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

This study examines the relationship between anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels and the severity of the phenotype in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and assesses whether AMH can serve as a diagnostic marker for PCOS. A prospective diagnostic utility study was conducted to evaluate AMH as a marker for PCOS. The study population included a consecutive series of women presenting to a tertiary infertility clinic (n = 164) and a second series of women prepared for assisted conception treatments (n = 89), recruited between June 2012 and May 2013.

Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. AMH levels were measured using the Generation II assay from Beckman Coulter. The diagnostic utility of AMH was established using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, and cut-off values for individual features of PCOS are proposed within the study.

There was a significant difference in serum AMH concentrations among women with normal ovaries (13.2 pmol/l), those with polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) alone (37.8 pmol/l), and those diagnosed with PCOS (53.2 pmol/l). Follicle number, increasing cycle length, and evidence of hyperandrogenism were all independently associated with serum AMH concentration (P < 0.01). Furthermore, AMH levels were significantly impacted by the different phenotypic presentations of PCOS, with those exhibiting all components (PCOM, hyperandrogenism, and oligo-anovulation) showing the highest mean value of 72.7 pmol/l (P < 0.01).

In conclusion, serum AMH has the potential to serve as a diagnostic test for PCOS. Given that its value rises with more pronounced phenotypes, different cut-off values are necessary to effectively differentiate patients with polycystic ovarian manifestations.

### Paediatric anti-Müllerian hormone measurement: Male and female reference intervals established using the automated Beckman Coulter Access AMH assay [^112b9uy7]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a dimeric glycoprotein, is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family of cytokines, which plays an essential role in the normal differentiation of reproductive structures. In males, AMH is produced by Sertoli cells from the seventh week of gestation and plays an important role in the fetus by triggering the involution of Müllerian ducts, allowing for testicular development. In females, by contrast, AMH is produced by ovarian granulosa cells of antral and pre-antral follicles from the 36th week of gestation and plays a role in the control of ovarian follicle growth.

Male AMH is high at birth and persists at an elevated level postnatally until puberty. Although the onset and continued basal expression of fetal male AMH is gonadotropin independent, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates testicular Sertoli cell proliferation, upregulating AMH transcription. However, with the onset of puberty, the increased intratesticular production of androgens, along with the expression of the Sertoli cell androgen receptor, overcomes the stimulatory effect of FSH on AMH production, leading to the downregulation of AMH. In females, AMH levels rise through infancy and increase at puberty, before remaining relatively stable until the third decade of life.

The differing expression of AMH between males and females during childhood makes AMH a valuable marker of gonadal function in paediatric reproductive disorders. One of the main clinical uses of AMH in paediatrics is as a marker for the presence of testicular tissue.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone levels in adolescence in relation to long-term follow-up for presence of polycystic ovary syndrome [^116FbKeX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) measured in adolescence as a biomarker for predicting adult polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is questionable but not substantiated. This study investigates whether serum AMH levels and other PCOS-associated features in adolescence can predict the presence of PCOS in adulthood.

This long-term follow-up study is based on a unique adolescent study on menstrual irregularities performed between 1990 and 1997. AMH was assayed in 271 adolescent girls. Data on PCOS features were combined with AMH levels. In 160 of the 271 (59%) participants, information was collected in adulthood about their menstrual cycle pattern and the presence of PCOS features through a questionnaire conducted two decades after the initial study.

AMH was higher in adolescent girls with oligomenorrhea compared with girls with regular cycles; the median (interquartile range) was 4.6 (3.1–7.5) versus 2.6 (1.7–3.8) μg/L (P < 0.001). Women with PCOS in adulthood had a higher median adolescent AMH of 6.0 compared with 2.5 μg/L in the non-PCOS group (P < 0.001). AMH at adolescence showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for PCOS in adulthood of 0.78. Among adolescent girls with oligomenorrhea, the proportion developing PCOS in adulthood was 22.5% (95% CI, 12.4–37.4) against 5.1% (95% CI, 2.1–12.0) in girls with a regular cycle (P = 0.005). Given adolescent oligomenorrhea, adding high AMH as a factor to predict adult PCOS or adult oligomenorrhea was of no value.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^113GwL2D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

In the Western world, the age at which a woman decides to have her first child has increased, along with the risk of age-related involuntary infertility. Given the strong correlation between the age-related decline in primordial follicle number, the number of growing follicles, and serum AMH levels, several studies have investigated whether serum AMH could aid in predicting the age of menopause. A meta-analysis by Depmann et al, which reanalyzed AMH levels from six studies, concluded that serum AMH can predict time to menopause. However, compared with a woman's age, the added value of serum AMH was limited, as the C statistic only increased from 84% to 86%. Furthermore, serum AMH appeared to have limited precision on an individual level.

Conflicting results have been reported in predicting the onset of menopause in women of late reproductive age.

- **Recent population-based study**: In a recent population-based study, where the majority of women were overweight or obese, it was shown that women aged 45 to 49 years with undetectable AMH levels had a 60% probability of becoming menopausal within 5 years. Furthermore, AMH improved the prediction of menopausal onset compared with age alone (C statistic 91% vs. 83%).

- **Multiethnic study**: A recent multiethnic study, which included 1537 pre- or early perimenopausal women at baseline and with follow-up until 12 months of amenorrhea was reached (SWAN study), analyzed the prediction of the final menstrual period (FMP) by AMH levels. Although AMH was serially assessed in a small subset of this cohort, multiple samples provided additional insights into its predictive capabilities.

### Evidence-based guideline: Premature ovarian insufficiency [^1165SQsi]. Climacteric (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary ovarian insufficiency, specifically in relation to hormone testing (anti-Müllerian hormone), the ASRM/ESHRE 2024 guidelines recommend considering anti-Müllerian hormone testing to confirm a POI diagnosis where follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) results are inconclusive. However, it is advised to interpret anti-Müllerian hormone results within the clinical context.

### Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) in female reproduction: Is measurement of circulating AMH a useful tool [^1139bke7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is a dimeric glycoprotein and a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily. It is produced exclusively in the gonads and is involved in the regulation of follicular growth and development. In the ovary, AMH is produced by the granulosa cells of early developing follicles and seems to be able to inhibit the initiation of primordial follicle growth and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced follicle growth. As AMH is largely expressed throughout folliculogenesis, from the primary follicular stage towards the antral stage, serum levels of AMH may represent both the quantity and quality of the ovarian follicle pool.

Compared to other ovarian tests, AMH seems to be the best marker reflecting the decline of reproductive age. AMH measurement could be useful in the prediction of the menopausal transition. It could also be used to predict poor ovarian response and possibly the prognosis of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. AMH has been shown to be a good surrogate marker for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Finally, its use as a marker for granulosa cell tumors has been proposed. A clearer understanding of its role in ovarian physiology may help clinicians to find a role for AMH measurement in the field of reproductive medicine.

### Changes in anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) throughout the life span: a population-based study of 1027 healthy males from birth (cord blood) to the age of 69 years [^114UBAY4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which is secreted by immature Sertoli cells, triggers the involution of the fetal Müllerian ducts. AMH is a testis-specific marker used for diagnosis in infants with ambiguous genitalia or bilateral cryptorchidism.

The aim of the study was to describe the ontogeny of AMH secretion throughout life in healthy males. This was a population-based study of healthy volunteers.

Participants included 1027 healthy males from birth (cord blood) to 69 years. A subgroup was followed up longitudinally through the infantile minipuberty (in cord blood, and at 3 and 12 months, n = 55) and another group through puberty (biannual measurements, n = 83).

- **Main outcome measures**: Serum AMH was determined by a sensitive immunoassay. Serum testosterone, LH, and FSH were measured, and pubertal staging was performed in boys aged 6 to 20 years (n = 616).

Serum AMH was above the detection limit in all samples, with a marked variation according to age and pubertal status. The median AMH level in cord blood was 148 pmol/liter and increased significantly to the highest observed levels at 3 months (P < 0.0001). AMH declined at 12 months (P < 0.0001) and remained at a relatively stable level throughout childhood until puberty, when AMH declined progressively, with adults exhibiting 3–4% of infant levels.

Based on this extensive data set, we found detectable AMH serum levels at all ages, with the highest measured levels during infancy. At the time of puberty, AMH concentrations declined and remained relatively stable throughout adulthood.

### Comparing anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as predictors of ovarian function [^117NwNzX]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

We compared the predictive values of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and baseline FSH with respect to IVF cycle outcomes, based on oocyte numbers retrieved and the number of clinical pregnancies established. In the 76 IVF cycles investigated, AMH was clearly superior in predicting IVF outcomes compared to FSH.

### Genome-wide association study identifies common and low-frequency variants at the AMH gene locus that strongly predict serum AMH levels in males [^111RYKVj]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The gonadal hormone anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is an essential messenger of sexual differentiation. In the male foetus, AMH results in the involution of the Müllerian ducts, allowing Wolffian ducts to develop into the male reproductive tract under the influence of testosterone. In the female foetus, the absence of AMH allows the Müllerian duct to differentiate into uterine-fallopian internal reproductive structures. Pathological disruption of AMH activity in XY karyotype males leads to the persistent Müllerian duct syndrome, a rare condition characterized by the atypical development of the uterus and occasionally other Müllerian structures. Rare mutations underlying this autosomal recessive disorder have been mapped to the AMH protein-encoding gene (AMH) and its receptor (AMHR2); however, approximately 15% of cases are idiopathic.

In recent years, the development of sensitive assays for AMH has allowed many studies of the role of postnatal AMH levels (which are roughly 10-fold lower than in the foetus) as a gonadal marker in both sexes. In pre-pubertal boys, the measurement of serum AMH is performed in clinical settings as a reliable indicator of functional testes; its absence supports the diagnosis of primary hypogonadism. In women, serum AMH has emerged as the most robust circulating biomarker of reproductive lifespan. Produced by ovarian granulosa cells, AMH levels are highly correlated with the ovarian primordial follicle number and levels gradually decline with age until becoming undetectable approximately five years before menopause when the follicle stock is depleted.

### Next steps toward AMH as a robust biomarker for assessing ovarian aging in individual women [^111AjvQF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a glycoprotein produced by the gonads and a member of the transforming growth factor superfamily, similar to inhibins. Previously, this hormone was referred to as Müllerian-inhibiting substance, known for its pivotal role in male embryonic sexual differentiation. More recent studies using female AMH knockout mice convincingly elucidated its crucial role in the recruitment of follicles from the resting primordial pool, resulting in premature follicle exhaustion.

Initial human studies suggested that AMH could indeed be used as a marker of the remaining functional ovarian reserve. The study by de Vet et al. was recently elected as one of 25 seminal papers by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, emphasizing the key significance of ovarian aging in infertility care. The key questions remain, however, as to what extent the amount of growth of AMH-producing follicles truly represents the size of the remaining resting primordial follicle pool and whether this is constant across the life course. Direct counting of the number of follicles present in human ovaries is not feasible. A more practical approach would be to assess whether single or repeat measurements of AMH concentrations at a younger age are associated with the age of menopause, a state of terminal follicular depletion later in life. This would provide indirect proof that the size of the group of developing follicles is indeed a direct representation of the remaining resting follicle pool.

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^117NwWsX]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The girls completed an electronic questionnaire during their adolescence examination, which included age at menarche, menstrual cycle length within the past 6 months (grouped as: 35 days, "too irregular to tell", "on hormonal contraception", or "unknown"), and the number of menstrual bleedings in the past 6 months. Participants kept a menstrual calendar either from the time of invitation until the examination or retrospectively, if this information was documented. Information was available for a minimum of three cycles.

Menstrual cycles in the 145 girls, who provided AMH data at mid-childhood and adolescence, were categorized as regular menstrual cycles, irregular menstrual cycles, or other cycle patterns.

- **Regular menstrual cycles**: A reported cycle length of 21–35 days and 5 to 8 menstrual bleedings within the past 6 months was defined as regular (n = 90).

- **Irregular menstrual cycles**: This was defined as oligomenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea (n = 38).
	- **Oligomenorrhea**: Reported cycle length of " > 35 days" or "too irregular to tell" in combination with menstrual calendar data of 1–3 bleedings in the past 6 months. Girls reporting either "don't know" or "4 bleedings in the past 6 months" were categorized as irregular only if their menstrual calendar showed oligomenorrhea.
	- **Secondary amenorrhea**: Girls who had experienced menarche but had no menstrual bleeding within the past 6 months.

- **Other cycle patterns**: Girls who had not experienced menarche or who had menarche during the past 6 months were included in this group (n = 17).

### Anti-mullerian hormone and spontaneous puberty in a diverse US Turner syndrome clinic cohort: A cross-sectional study [^113ng7sB]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) concentrations have been proposed as a marker of spontaneous puberty and future fertility in Turner syndrome (TS). Gonadotropins during minipuberty may also provide a clue to ovarian function, but there is insufficient data to inform utility in the routine clinical management of TS. Our objective was to describe the distribution of AMH in a cross-sectional cohort of patients in a TS specialty clinic and correlate it with spontaneous puberty and karyotype, as well as gonadotropins during the minipuberty of infancy in a smaller subset of patients aged 2–9 months.

- **Design**: Retrospective chart review of patients seen in the TS clinic at Children's National Hospital from January 1, 2019, to August 24, 2022, to assess AMH and correlate with karyotype and spontaneous puberty.

- **Results**: Among 114 patients (median age 9.6 years, range 0.08–22 years), AMH values were detectable in only 38% (40/104). Higher mean AMH (2.7 ± 0.95 ng/mL) was seen in mosaic 45, X/46, XX karyotype compared to 45, X (0.03 ± 0.14 ng/mL) (p < 0.001), and structurally abnormal-X karyotype (0.11 ± 0.5 ng/mL) (p = 0.0003). Mean AMH was higher (1.4 ± 1.6 ng/mL) among those with spontaneous menarche compared with spontaneous thelarche but no menarche. AMH was detectable in 2/10 during minipuberty in those with the lowest luteinizing hormone (LH).

- **Conclusions**: Our institutional data reflects a diverse cohort of patients seen in a TS specialty clinic in the United States, showing the correlation of AMH with karyotype and spontaneous menarche. The study also describes gonadotropins during minipuberty, highlighting their clinical significance.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^115W2sdL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

In isolated Leydig cell disorders, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was normal or high, reflecting an increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) effect but a lack of testosterone effect. Precocious puberty in males, including central precocious puberty and gonadotropin-independent forms such as familial male-limited precocious puberty, was associated with low AMH secretion for age due to a rise in intratesticular testosterone. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue therapy normalizes AMH to prepubertal values, suggesting that Sertoli cell maturation in early puberty may be reversible. AMH could potentially serve as an additional tool for diagnosing precocious puberty and monitoring treatment efficacy, although it is not of routine clinical utility compared to luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone.

In females, AMH was normal in most patients with acquired multiple pituitary hormone deficiency but low in severe congenital hypopituitarism, reflecting gonadotropin deficiency. AMH has been shown to be lower in premature thelarche in females aged 1 to 3 years and negatively correlated with FSH compared to age-matched controls. In girls with precocious puberty, AMH levels did not differ from healthy age-matched controls at baseline but were suppressed compared to pretreatment levels with GnRH analogue therapy. They returned to pretreatment levels six months after discontinuation of treatment. The suppression of AMH was consistent with the gonadotropin dependence of AMH secretion. However, the normal AMH levels and negative correlation with FSH at baseline were due to an individual set point for the pituitary-gonadal feedback loop.

### Serum anti-Müllerian hormone in the prediction of response to hCG stimulation in children with DSD [^1177uyaj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The relationship between serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and the testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test is unclear.

- **Methods**: Children who had hCG stimulation tests in one tertiary center from 2001 to 2018 were included (n = 138). Serum testosterone was measured before (day 1 [D1]) and after 3 days (D4) of hCG stimulation. Sixty-one of these children also had prolonged hCG stimulation for 2 more weeks and serum testosterone measured after 21 days (D22). All children had a serum AMH measured on D1.

- **Results**: Of the 138 children, D4 testosterone was normal in 104 (75%). AMH was low in 24/138 (17%) children, and 16 (67%) of these had a low D4 testosterone. Median AMH in those who had a normal vs. low D4 testosterone was 850 pmol/L (24, 2280) and 54 pmol/L (0.4, 1664), respectively (P < 0.0001). AMH < 5th centile was associated with a low D4 testosterone in 18/118 (13%; P < 0.0001). Of the 61 children who had prolonged hCG stimulation, D22 testosterone was normal in 39 (64%). AMH was low in 10/61 (16%) children and 9 (90%) of these had a low D22 testosterone. Median AMH in children who responded and did not respond by D22 was 639 pmol/L (107, 2280) and 261 pmol/L (15, 1034) (P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusion**: A normal AMH may provide valuable information on overall testicular function. However, a low AMH does not necessarily predict a suboptimal testosterone response to hCG stimulation.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone variability and its implications for the number of oocytes retrieved following individualized dosing with follitropin delta [^116MTHbX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

The stability of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) across and between menstrual cycles has been the subject of debate. The objective of this analysis was to study the inter- and intra-cycle variability in repeated measurements and assess the impact on an individualized gonadotropin dosing algorithm and predicted oocyte yield.

This was conducted through a retrospective analysis of repeat AMH measures from a randomized controlled trial involving 1326 women aged 18–40 years. Serum AMH levels were measured at screening and on cycle day 2–3 in up to three ovarian stimulation cycles, alongside examining AMH variability and its impact on gonadotropin dose and the predicted number of oocytes.

The results showed that repeat serum AMH measurements were strongly correlated within individual women (correlation coefficient 0.92). AMH exhibited limited within-subject variation (coefficient of variation 23%) and a small time-related decline (mean 6% decrease per year), but no systematic variation across the menstrual cycle. Regardless of whether the AMH screening value or the AMH at the initiation of ovarian stimulation was used, for women with an AMH level < 15 pmol/L, 93% would receive the same gonadotropin dose and attain an identical number of oocytes in 97% of cases. For women with an AMH level ≥ 15 pmol/L, 80% would receive an individualized dose within ± 1.5 μg, and 90% would attain ± 1 oocyte.

In conclusion, AMH variability had limited impact on individualized gonadotropin dosing, with 95% of women predicted to obtain an oocyte yield that does not vary beyond 1 oocyte count, irrespective of whether a random or early follicular AMH measurement was used.

### Utility of ovarian reserve screening with anti-Müllerian hormone for reproductive age women deferring pregnancy [^11477tFj]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian reserve (OR) testing with serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can provide information about a woman's fertility potential. The aim of this study was to assess interest and knowledge about OR testing and investigate the utility of measuring AMH in women of reproductive age deferring pregnancy.

- **Methods**: Women ages 27–37 years currently delaying childbearing were invited to take a survey regarding attitudes and knowledge about OR testing before and after an AMH measurement with explanation of their results.

- **Results**: Of 121 women who took the pre-test survey, 96% believed OR testing was beneficial. The median AMH of the 97 women who underwent testing was 3.3 ng/mL (IQR 1.9–5.4 ng/mL). Nineteen percent of women had AMH < 10th percentile for age and 3% had an undetectable AMH. Although 83% of these women were using hormonal contraception, none had known risk factors for diminished ovarian reserve. Seventy-eight percent of women with low AMH levels for age planned to seek fertility preservation or pregnancy, while those with AMH levels within established age normograms were reassured. On the post-test survey, 100% reported benefit in knowing their AMH level. Follow-up testing, 6–8 months after the initial measurement, showed stable AMH levels for most participants.

- **Conclusions**: Women are interested in OR testing. Most women will be reassured by knowing their AMH level, whereas those with a lower AMH can be counseled on fertility preservation options or may attempt pregnancy earlier.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone levels in adolescence in relation to long-term follow-up for presence of polycystic ovary syndrome [^116Xjxjd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) measured in adolescence as a biomarker for the prediction of adult polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is doubtful but not substantiated. This study investigates whether serum AMH levels and other PCOS-associated features in adolescence can predict the presence of PCOS in adulthood.

A long-term follow-up study was conducted, based on a unique adolescent study on menstrual irregularities performed between 1990 and 1997. AMH was assayed in 271 adolescent girls. Data on PCOS features were combined with AMH levels. Information in adulthood about their menstrual cycle pattern and presence of PCOS features was collected via questionnaires two decades after the initial study, from 160 of the 271 participants (59%).

Results indicated that AMH was higher in adolescent girls with oligomenorrhea compared to girls with regular cycles: median (interquartile range) 4.6 (3.1–7.5) versus 2.6 (1.7–3.8) μg/L (P < 0.001). Women with PCOS in adulthood had a higher median adolescent AMH of 6.0 compared with 2.5 μg/L in the non-PCOS group (P < 0.001). AMH at adolescence showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for PCOS in adulthood of 0.78. In adolescent girls with oligomenorrhea, the proportion developing PCOS in adulthood was 22.5% (95% CI, 12.4–37.4) against 5.1% (95% CI, 2.1–12.0) in girls with a regular cycle (P = 0.005).

Given adolescent oligomenorrhea, adding high AMH as a factor to predict adult PCOS or adult oligomenorrhea was of no value.

### Age-related changes in low serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels in female adolescents: A single-center retrospective pilot study [^113Vxg13]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

Available data on the clinical significance of low serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels in female adolescents are limited. The aim of this study was to elucidate age-related changes in low serum AMH levels in adolescents and to identify predictive factors for AMH progression.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted on a series of female adolescents aged 11–19 years with low serum AMH levels (1.6 ng/mL). Group 1 participants were compared with those who did not exhibit these markers in Group 2.

- **Results**: Among 1655 adolescents who underwent AMH testing at least once from 2010 to 2022, 75 participants (4.5%) exhibited low AMH levels. This low level (1.6 ng/mL) was confirmed in 7 (30.4%) of the 23 female adolescents who underwent relevant follow-up testing. Group 1 had higher initial AMH levels and lower initial follicle-stimulating hormone levels than Group 2 (1.0 vs. 0.59 ng/mL, P = 0.001 and 4.4 vs. 9.8 mIU/mL, P = 0.015, respectively). Ovarian volume did not differ between the groups (3.8 vs. 4.4 cm³, P = 0.465). None of the participants with initial AMH levels under 0.75 ng/mL showed an increase in AMH levels during follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that low serum AMH levels in adolescents may have other explanations in addition to being indicative of a low ovarian reserve. Prospective studies involving a larger number of participants will aid in predicting AMH dynamics more effectively.

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^1176gqeu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

In this long-term longitudinal study of serum AMH concentrations in healthy girls through infancy (median age 0.3 years), mid-childhood (7.2 years), puberty (11.3 years), and adolescence (15.9 years), each girl maintained her relative AMH level. AMH in adolescence correlated strongly with AMH concentrations in puberty and mid-childhood as well as infancy. In mid-childhood, serum concentrations of AMH predicted the number of ovarian follicles as the girls reached puberty and adolescence. From infancy to adolescence, AMH was negatively associated with FSH. This individual setpoint of ovarian activity, deriving from small growing follicles which exert negative feedback on the pituitary already from infancy, highlights several physiological, clinical, and scientific points of interest.

The primordial follicle pool is established in fetal life. Hereafter, the number of primordial follicles declines continuously until menopause. It has therefore been argued that relatively stable concentrations of AMH during childhood exclude AMH as a clinical marker of the follicle reserve in girls. However, based on the present data, we speculate that this individual setpoint of ovarian activity, tracking throughout the entire childhood to some degree, may reflect the size of the primordial follicle pool. From birth to menopause, primordial follicles are constantly recruited into small antral stages producing AMH. In adult women, the number of small antral follicles is in equilibrium with the number of metabolically inactive primordial follicles. If the same dynamics exist in childhood, this could suggest that the individual setpoint of ovarian activity mirrors the dynamics of the primordial follicle pool.

### AMH as predictor of premature ovarian insufficiency: A longitudinal study of 120 Turner syndrome patients [^112YLtFh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of Turner syndrome (TS) patients suffer from accelerated loss of primordial follicles. Low circulating levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) may predict the lack of spontaneous puberty in prepubertal girls and imminent premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in TS women with preserved ovarian function.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the association between circulating AMH and ovarian status in TS patients.

- **Design**: Longitudinal observational cohort study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center for pediatric and gynecologic endocrinology.

- **Participants**: A total of 120 TS patients, aged 0 to 48 years.

- **Main outcome measures**: Longitudinal measurements of AMH, FSH, LH, estradiol, and inhibin B according to age, karyotype (45, X; 45, X/46, XX mosaicism; miscellaneous karyotypes), and ovarian status (group 0, prepubertal; group 1, never ovarian function; group 2, ongoing ovarian function; and group 3, loss of ovarian function).

- **Results**: Ovarian status was highly associated with the TS karyotype: spontaneous puberty — 45, X (three of 44 patients), 45, X/46, XX (15 of 17), miscellaneous (17 of 42); and POI — 45, X (three of three), 45, X/46, XX (one of 15), and miscellaneous (eight of 17). AMH was associated with ovarian status; for example, group 1 measured < 2 pmol/L vs. group 2 at 19 pmol/L, with P < .001. AMH < 4 pmol/L (corresponding to < -2 SD) predicted absent puberty in prepubertal girls and POI in adolescent and adult patients.

- **Conclusion**: The majority of women with mosaic karyotype 45, X/46, XX had ongoing ovarian function in early adulthood. AMH < -2 SD predicted failure to enter puberty in young individuals.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^1177CTZa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

AMH is a valuable tool in the care of pediatric patients with diverse conditions affecting gonadal development and function. The interpretation of serum AMH should be informed by assay-specific normative data accounting for age/sex and pubertal stage. In conjunction with gonadotropins and testosterone, AMH can be a useful diagnostic marker of Sertoli cell mass and function in males. Although widely used as a biochemical marker of ovarian reserve in females, the predictive value of AMH in prepubertal females for fertility outcomes needs further study. Assay standardization and widespread availability will further enhance its utility in clinical practice.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^112DUN38]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations are age- and sex-specific. They rise in early infancy, starting one month after birth, and peak around six months of age in male infants, while remaining low in female infants. Throughout childhood, AMH concentrations are distinctly higher in males, almost 35-fold more than in females. Despite individual variability and a broad normal range, male AMH levels are easily distinguishable from female norms. During adolescence, as puberty progresses, the mean AMH levels decline in males and increase in females, though there is considerable overlap.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone levels in the spontaneous menstrual cycle do not show substantial fluctuation [^112CcVUt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a quantitative marker for ovarian reserve, has been suggested to be independent of the classical endocrine fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. The objective of this study was to determine whether AMH levels remain constant throughout the menstrual cycle, compared with those of FSH, LH, and estradiol.

Frequent blood sampling was performed in 44 fertile, regularly cycling female volunteers during one full menstrual cycle. The study was conducted at a university hospital. AMH, FSH, LH, and estradiol measurements were allocated to one of seven cycle phases, and a multilevel analysis was performed. Consistent fluctuation patterns were tested by fitting sine patterns to the data. Finally, the frequency in which randomly selected individual samples would remain in one of five preset level categories (quintiles) for each of the variables was studied.

A sine pattern fitted to the AMH data was not statistically significant (P = 0.40). In contrast, sine patterns for FSH, LH, and estradiol were highly significant. No significant differences could be observed between phase-specific AMH levels when comparing the seven cycle phases (P = 0.06). Repeated selection of AMH samples for each individual showed that in 71.5% of selections, AMH values remained in the same quintile, whereas in 27.9%, values fell into an adjacent quintile.

AMH levels measured through a full menstrual cycle did not show consistent fluctuation patterns in contrast to levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol.

### Undetectable serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels and occurrence of ongoing pregnancy [^112JFs2i]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

To discuss the significance of extremely low levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), also known as Müllerian-inhibiting substance, in infertile women, this study draws on two clinical cases and an extensive literature review.

- **Design**: Case report.
- **Setting**: University-based infertility clinic at a medical center in Switzerland.
- **Patients**: Two women, aged 29 and 41 years, with a 2- and 4-year history of secondary infertility, respectively.
- **Interventions**: Clinical, radiological, and biological investigations of infertility, including repeated measurements of the serum AMH with serial ELISA assays.
- **Main outcome measures**: Levels of AMH and development of ongoing pregnancy.
- **Results**: Both women had a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy despite undetectable AMH levels.
- **Conclusions**: Although the predictive value of AMH for the occurrence of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy has limits, it is helpful for the day-to-day management of infertile patients.

### Ovarian reserve biomarkers and menstrual cycle length in a prospective cohort study [^111adJjN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

While age-related changes in menstrual cycle length are well known, it is unclear whether anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) or other ovarian reserve biomarkers have a direct association with cycle length.

- **Objective**: To determine the association between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and menstrual cycle length.

- **Methods**: This study involved a secondary analysis using data from the Time to Conceive (TTC), a prospective time-to-pregnancy cohort study. The age-independent association between cycle length and biomarkers of ovarian reserve was analyzed using linear mixed and marginal models. Study participants were TTC-enrolled women aged 30–44 years with no history of infertility who were attempting to conceive.

The findings indicated that women with AMH levels greater than 8 ng/mL had cycles that were 2.15 days longer (95% CI 1.46, 2.83), follicular phases that were 2 days longer (95% CI 0.77, 3.24), and luteal phases that were 1.80 days longer (95% CI 0.71, 2.88).

- **Conclusion**: Increasing AMH levels are associated with longer menstrual cycles due to a lengthening of the follicular phase.

### Peripubertal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone levels in girls [^115iCUCG]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Our cross-sectional finding that antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels were approximately 25% lower in pubertal girls compared to prepubertal girls is consistent with our pilot longitudinal data showing a 20% reduction in AMH levels between ages 9 and 11 years and confirms other recent longitudinal data. The onset of puberty is characterized in the ovary by the progression of small antral follicles to antral follicles, which do not produce AMH, potentially contributing to the reduction in circulating AMH levels. Furthermore, Kelsey et al. recently estimated that the rate of primordial follicle recruitment peaks during adolescence and then declines; our findings refine the timing of this decline in follicle recruitment to the onset of puberty. In contrast to AMH, inhibin B levels increased by 49% between ages 7 and 9 years and increased by a further 76% between ages 9 and 11 years. We suggest that the divergence between AMH and inhibin B levels beyond age 9 years reflects the decreasing rate of primordial follicle recruitment as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-stimulated follicle activity increases with the maturation of the pituitary-gonadal axis.

Associations between AMH levels at age 8 and age at menarche, and between baseline inhibin B levels and later changes in AMH, suggest that prepubertal ovarian follicle activity may predict the timing of pubertal onset and completion. However, this needs to be confirmed in larger longitudinal studies, ideally with the use of objective assessments of pubertal timing. Longer follow-up is also needed to determine whether the close intraindividual tracking in AMH levels continues through subsequent development.

### The measurement of anti-Müllerian hormone: a critical appraisal [^112ujfRs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is perceived as reliable, but the literature reveals discrepancies in reported within-subject variability and between-method conversion factors. Recent studies suggest that AMH may be prone to preanalytical instability. We therefore examined the published evidence on the performance of historical AMH assays in terms of the assessment of sample stability, within-patient variability, and comparability of the assay methods.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We reviewed studies (manuscripts or abstracts) measuring AMH, published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 1990, and August 1, 2013, using appropriate PubMed/Medline searches.

- **Evidence synthesis**: AMH levels in specimens left at room temperature for varying periods increased by 20% in one study and by almost 60% in another, depending on duration and the AMH assay used. Even at -20°C, increased AMH concentrations were observed. An increase over expected values of 20–30% or 57%, respectively, was observed after 2-fold dilution in two linearity-of-dilution studies, but not in others. Several studies investigating within-cycle variability of AMH reported conflicting results, although most studies suggest that variability of AMH within the menstrual cycle appears to be small. However, between-sample variability without regard to menstrual cycle as well as within-sample variation appears to be higher using the GenII AMH assay than with previous assays, a fact now conceded by the kit manufacturer. Studies comparing first-generation AMH assays with each other and with the newer assays have shown varying results, which continue to influence perceptions of assay reliability.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^116Mf7E5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is expressed by granulosa cells of growing follicles after the recruitment of primordial follicles from the resting pool, with expression increasing until the large preantral and small antral follicular stage. AMH expression is lost in atretic follicles as well as corpus lutea. With age, AMH levels decrease, and serum AMH levels correlate strongly with the decrease in the size of the antral follicle pool. Although no marker can directly measure the number of primordial follicles, the number of growing follicles recruited from the primordial follicle pool reflects the number of primordial follicles. As a marker for the number of growing follicles, AMH is used as a proxy for the number of primordial follicles and the quantitative aspect of the ovarian reserve in adults.

In prepubertal children, however, ovarian follicles remain in a quiescent state after the mini-puberty of infancy. AMH is not expressed by primordial or small preantral follicles and, prior to the onset of puberty, may correlate poorly with ovarian reserve in children. In vitro evaluation of ovarian tissue in children undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) prior to gonadotoxic therapies due to malignant diseases revealed high follicle density despite low AMH levels. Furthermore, studies reporting intervals for AMH in children showed wide variations in AMH in healthy girls aged 1 to 12 years. Despite these limitations, AMH has been proposed as a potential biomarker of ovarian reserve in childhood to determine possible candidates for fertility preservation.

### Comparing the intercycle variation of serum anti-Mullerian hormone and antral follicle count measurements over four consecutive menstrual cycles [^114LYkQ9]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

To compare the intercycle variation of serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) measurements over four consecutive menstrual cycles, an observational study with secondary analysis was conducted using data from two previous randomized controlled trials.

Seventy-eight women from two previous randomized trials on the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone pretreatment on ovarian response in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment were included.

- **Measurements**: The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for AFC and AMH across the four study cycles, as well as their predictive performance on poor ovarian response, were compared.

- **Results**: No significant difference was observed in AMH (p = .608) across the four study cycles. AFC was significantly higher at 4 weeks before ovarian stimulation compared with 0, 8, and 12 weeks before ovarian stimulation (p < 0.05). Among the four cycles, ICC values for AFC ranged from 0.558 to 0.742, whereas those for AMH ranged from 0.730 to 0.780 with no significant difference (p > .05).

- **Conclusions**: Although both AFC and AMH are good predictors of ovarian response, intercycle repeatability was significantly better with serum AMH than AFC measurement.

### Individualized predictions of time to menopause using multiple measurements of antimüllerian hormone [^114AoZty]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

The ability of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) to predict age at menopause has been reported in several studies, and a decrease in AMH level has been found to increase the probability of menopause. The rate of decline varies among women, and there is also a variability of decline between women's cycles. As a result, individualized evaluation is required to accurately predict the time of menopause. To this end, we have used the AMH trajectories of individual women to predict each one's age at menopause.

- **Methods**: From a cohort study, 266 women (ages 20–50 years) who had regular and predictable menstrual cycles at the initiation of the study were randomly selected from among 1,265 women for multiple AMH measurements. Participants were visited at approximately 3-year intervals and followed for an average of 6.5 years. Individual likelihood of menopause was predicted by fitting the shared random-effects joint model to the baseline covariates and the specific AMH trajectory of each woman.

- **Results**: In total, 23.7% of the women reached menopause during the follow-up period. The estimated mean (SD) AMH concentration at the time of menopause was 0.05 ng/mL (0.06 ng/mL), compared with 1.36 ng/mL (1.85 ng/mL) for those with a regular menstrual cycle at their last assessment. The decline rate in the AMH level varied among age groups, and age was a significant prognostic factor for AMH level (P < 0.001). Adjusting for age and body mass index, each woman had her own specific AMH trajectory. Lower AMH and older age had significant effects on the onset of menopause.

### Back to the basics of ovarian aging: A population-based study on longitudinal anti-müllerian hormone decline [^112hoNqd]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The notion of differing decline rates of AMH was previously put forward by Faddy et al, who suggested that the decline rate of follicles accelerates after reaching a certain numeric threshold. The number of follicles at this threshold was primarily estimated to be around 25,000 and later hypothesized to differ per individual. Thilagam recently extended this mathematical model to include the influence of other hormones involved in ovarian aging. Indeed, our results indicate that there are more factors at play.

We observed an average acceleration of AMH decline with chronological age, while the average decline rate gradually decreased with time to menopause. This could mean that follicle quantity changes are more dependent on chronological rather than reproductive aging, or it could be an indication of increased AMH production per follicle due to increasing FSH levels nearer to menopause. Moreover, higher initial AMH levels were first associated with a slower AMH decline rate, but later with a quicker decline. This could potentially mean that the suggested inhibitory effect of AMH on follicle recruitment is effective up to a certain age or ovarian reserve threshold.

- **Mouse study findings**: This concept was previously brought up in a mouse study, in which the decline of growing follicles and AMH levels accelerated only later in reproductive life, leading to the hypothesis that compensatory mechanisms are present earlier on.

In any case, this observation may prove detrimental for the hopes of improved reproductive age estimation with repeated AMH measurements.

### What does anti-Müllerian hormone tell you about ovarian function [^117FNVCb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

The measurement of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is leading to new insights into ovarian function. AMH is produced by small growing follicles, thus it is distinct from ovulation and is a step closer to being able to assess the true ovarian reserve. AMH is measurable from birth to near menopause, with a peak in the mid-20s. Changes in adolescence are likely to lead to new understanding of ovarian maturation at puberty.

AMH is becoming a routine test in assisted conception, reflecting a decline in the primordial follicle pool during the later reproductive years and also identifying women at risk of over-response. Thus, its relationship with the ovarian reserve changes from an inverse one in the first quarter-century to a positive one thereafter, as both decline in parallel. AMH does not vary significantly across the menstrual cycle, but it is not fully gonadotrophin-independent, showing delayed changes consistent with its production from smaller growing follicles.

There is considerable interest, both professional and public, in its ability to predict remaining reproductive lifespan. Clinically, it may be valuable in the assessment of ovarian reserve following damage, for example, post-chemotherapy or ovarian surgery. AMH is markedly increased in polycystic ovarian syndrome and may be of diagnostic value. The considerable promise of AMH measurement is ahead of the robustness of the data in allowing clinical interpretation in most contexts, but it is clear that it will, in the future, offer novel opportunities for the assessment of ovarian function in health as well as disease.

### Peripubertal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone levels in girls [^111pdxPL]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

To identify correlates and longitudinal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels as a marker of ovarian primordial follicle recruitment in normal peripubertal girls, an observational study using mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses was conducted.

- **Setting**: Not applicable.

- **Patients**: Unselected girls assessed at ages 7–11 years.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Main outcome measures**: AMH, inhibin B, and FSH levels were analyzed in blood samples collected at ages 7, 9, and 11 years for longitudinal analyses and at age 8 years for cross-sectional analyses.

In the cross-sectional analysis, AMH levels at age 8 years were lower in pubertal girls (median 25.0 pmol/L, interquartile range [IQR] 16.0–33.9; n = 39) than in prepubertal girls (33.5 pmol/L, IQR 22.3–49.1; n = 342). In prepubertal girls, higher AMH levels were associated with higher inhibin B levels, lower FSH levels, and larger body mass index at age 8 years and subsequently with later age at menarche. AMH levels were unrelated to birth weight or birth length.

In the longitudinal analysis, AMH levels increased between ages 7 (median 27.0 pmol/L, IQR 19.2–34) and 9 years (32.0 pmol/L, IQR 26.5–42.7), then declined between 9 and 11 years (26.5 pmol/L, IQR 19–42.25) with high intraindividual correlation in AMH levels between ages 7 and 9 years and 7 and 11 years.

The measurement of circulating AMH and inhibin B levels suggests that the rate of ovarian primordial follicle recruitment increases in the prepubertal years then declines again following the onset of puberty.

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^115ZXPck]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta family, named for its role in male sex differentiation by inducing the regression of the Müllerian ducts. At the time of writing, AMH is best known as a serum marker for ovarian function, with assessments focusing on both ovarian reserve and polycystic ovarian syndrome. In the ovary, AMH is expressed by granulosa cells of growing follicles from the primary up to the small antral stage. After follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-dependent selection, AMH expression disappears, although some expression remains in cumulus cells of preovulatory follicles. In atretic follicles and corpora lutea, AMH expression is lost. This window of expression is largely preserved among species and in the adult human ovary. Increasing expression levels of AMH are detected in follicles up to 8 mm, and expression is absent in follicles greater than 8 mm. This expression pattern is positively matched by AMH concentrations in follicular fluid, showing the highest levels in follicles up to 8 mm and a sharp drop thereafter.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone levels in adolescence in relation to long-term follow-up for presence of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115VJddN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first long-term longitudinal follow-up study investigating AMH and other PCOS features in adolescence as a prognostic marker for PCOS in adulthood. We were able to investigate AMH in a large group of adolescents not on hormonal contraceptives, and to parallel this with PCOS-related features. Although the data collected in this study are valuable, they do have their limitations.

A first limitation is that the PCOS diagnosis in adulthood was based on a self-reported questionnaire. We used a validated questionnaire, and previous studies that used self-reported PCOS yielded highly acceptable rates of accurate identification. Second, it would be of interest to perform a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with PCOS in adulthood. Unfortunately, the sample size of this study (n = 19) is too small to perform such a multivariable analysis. We therefore had to limit ourselves to a model with AMH only corrected for oligomenorrhea in adolescence. Third, the hormonal samples were taken years ago and stored before the measurement of AMH became available. However, the comprehensive adolescent data were gathered by a physician during hospital visits, and AMH was measured using an acknowledged modern laboratory method. The measured AMH values are comparable with existing literature. Finally, the finding of biologically plausible differences among the various adolescents supports the contemporary validity of the study.

In conclusion, this study confirms and extends the notion that AMH measured in adolescence has the potential to distinguish…

### Age-specific definition of low anti-Mullerian hormone and associated pregnancy outcome in women undergoing IVF treatment [^116pJ3pz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Our findings suggest that low AMH concentrations are associated with poor ovarian stimulation and pregnancy rate in women younger than 35 years. Large studies are required to investigate the predictive value of age-specific low AMH levels for pregnancy outcomes in women older than 35 years.

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^111MyL6E]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells in small follicles prior to FSH-dependent growth. Serum AMH concentrations reflect the number of small antral follicles throughout life; i.e. in infancy, peripubertal girls, adolescents, and adult women. In adult women, the number of small growing follicles is in equilibrium with the number of resting primordial follicles, constituting the total number of germ cells established in fetal life. Thus, the risk of early menopause is increased in women with low age-specific AMH.

When AMH was first characterized, it was a marker of testicular tissue in young boys due to high levels produced by immature Sertoli cells. However, after the introduction of highly sensitive AMH assays, serum concentrations of AMH are now measurable in all healthy girls. This measurability is due to the recruitment of primordial follicles to small growing follicles through childhood, even prior to pubertal onset. Minor fluctuations of AMH around pubertal onset have been observed, but overall, AMH concentrations are stable through pubertal development, indicating an individual set-point of ovarian activity. To our knowledge, there are currently no longitudinal data revealing whether this set-point of activity from small antral follicles tracks all the way from infancy and mid-childhood over puberty to adulthood.

### The utility of serum inhibin B, anti-Müllerian hormone and insulin growth factor-1 in predicting a positive response to GnRH analogs for diagnosing central precocious puberty in girls [^114hBPbS]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Use of inhibin B (INHB), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in differentiating central precocious puberty (CPP) from non-CPP was evaluated.

- **Methods**: In total, 115 Chinese girls were recruited (CPP: 44, non-CPP: 71). The diagnostic performance of INHB, AMH, and IGF-1 in differentiating CPP from non-CPP was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

- **Results**: INHB levels were higher in the CPP group than in the non-CPP group (55.56 ± 22.42 vs. 32.97 ± 15.59 pg/mL; p < 0.001). AMH levels were similar in the CPP and non-CPP groups (6.63 ± 3.74 vs. 5.70 ± 3.15 pg/mL; p = 0.158), and IGF-1 levels were much higher in the CPP group than in the non-CPP group (290.75 ± 79.78 vs. 200.10 ± 54.01 pg/mL; p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greatest for INHB (0.819, standard error (SE) 0.041), followed by IGF-1 (0.809, SE 0.047) and AMH (0.567, SE 0.057). Among the ROC curves including combinations of these parameters, the AUC for INHB + IGF-1 was 0.849 and that for INHB + AMH was 0.768.

- **Conclusions**: Serum INHB and IGF-1 measurements could predict positive responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog stimulation in girls with precocious puberty.

### Peripubertal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone levels in girls [^113TWhVa]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

To identify correlates and longitudinal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels as a marker of ovarian primordial follicle recruitment in normal peripubertal girls, an observational study utilizing mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses was conducted.

Unselected girls were assessed at ages 7–11 years with no specific interventions applied. Blood samples were analyzed for AMH, inhibin B, and FSH levels at ages 7, 9, and 11 years for longitudinal analysis, and at age 8 years for cross-sectional analysis.

- **Cross-sectional analysis**: At age 8 years, AMH levels were lower in pubertal girls (median 25.0 pmol/L, interquartile range [IQR] 16.0–33.9; n = 39) compared to prepubertal girls (33.5 pmol/L, IQR 22.3–49.1; n = 342). In prepubertal girls, higher AMH levels correlated with higher inhibin B levels, lower FSH levels, a larger body mass index at age 8 years, and later age at menarche. AMH levels were not related to birth weight or birth length.

- **Longitudinal analysis**: AMH levels increased from age 7 (median 27.0 pmol/L, IQR 19.2–34) to 9 years (32.0 pmol/L, IQR 26.5–42.7), then declined between ages 9 and 11 years (26.5 pmol/L, IQR 19–42.25). High intraindividual correlation was noted in AMH levels from ages 7 to 9 years and ages 7 to 11 years.

The measurement of circulating AMH and inhibin B levels suggests that the rate of ovarian primordial follicle recruitment increases during the prepubertal years and then declines following the onset of puberty.

### Clinical utility of measurement of anti-mullerian hormone in reproductive endocrinology [^111tnrF9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

The development of novel antibodies directed against anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) has allowed its measurement in serum and immunohistochemical assessment in tissues. AMH is secreted by granulosa cells in late preantral and small antral follicles, and it appears in serum in detectable and stable amounts throughout the menstrual cycle. AMH measurement allows an assessment of ovarian reserve with several advantages over other biochemical and biophysical markers. Recent research has highlighted its utility in cases of premature ovarian failure, whether iatrogenic after treatment for cancer or naturally occurring, in polycystic ovary syndrome, and in the management of superovulation in assisted reproduction.

A surge in research activity has taken place over the last five years. The true place of AMH in reproductive medicine remains to be fully elucidated, but the rapid and widespread adoption of AMH assay into clinical practice demonstrates the degree of interest in this new marker among reproductive endocrinologists.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^116BAZBP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

- **AMH as a marker of ovarian reserve and fertility**: Ovarian reserve, as defined by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, represents the number of oocytes remaining in the ovary, or oocyte quantity. Ovarian reserve tests include both ultrasound imaging and biochemical tests. The antral follicle count (AFC), a traditional marker of ovarian reserve, is typically performed in the early follicular phase by transvaginal ultrasound, which precludes its use in prepubertal children as well as postmenarchal adolescents who do not tolerate transvaginal imaging. Although transabdominal AFC measurements have been performed in both prepubertal and pubertal children, AMH was only moderately correlated to AFC in premenarchal girls. AMH is a sensitive biochemical marker of ovarian reserve and may be more sensitive when compared to early follicular phase FSH and estradiol levels.

The ideal timing of AMH measurement depends on whether serum AMH levels vary throughout the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Numerous studies have investigated AMH variations during the menstrual cycle, with some reporting only mild intra- and intercycle fluctuations of AMH secretion, while others have reported a peak AMH level in the mid-follicular phase followed by a decrease in the luteal phase. However, these fluctuations are not substantial enough to warrant a recommendation for timed AMH measurements on specific menstrual cycle days or phases. Although AMH possesses the ability to predict ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation and oocyte yield in assisted reproductive technologies, further standardization in measurement timing is not currently recommended.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^117XA8LF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells of small, growing follicles in the ovary. Serum AMH levels strongly correlate with the number of growing follicles, and therefore, AMH has received increasing attention as a marker for ovarian reserve. This review summarizes recent findings and limitations in the application of serum AMH in ovarian reserve assessment.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A PubMed search was conducted to find recent literature on the measurements and use of serum AMH as a marker for ovarian reserve.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Serum AMH levels are measured to assess the "functional ovarian reserve", a term that is preferred over "ovarian reserve", since AMH levels reflect the pool of growing follicles that potentially can ovulate. Serum AMH levels are used in individualized follicle-stimulating hormone dosing protocols and may predict the risk of poor response or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but have limited value in predicting ongoing pregnancy. Serum AMH levels are studied to predict the natural or disease-related age of menopause. Studies show that the age-dependent decline rates of AMH vary among women. The generalized implementation of serum AMH measurement has also led to an increase in diagnostic assays, including automated assays. However, direct comparison of results remains problematic.

- **Conclusion**: Serum AMH remains the preferred ovarian reserve marker. However, the lack of an international standard for AMH limits comparison between AMH assays. Furthermore, little is known about endogenous and exogenous factors that influence serum AMH.

### Evidence-based guideline: Premature ovarian insufficiency [^111j4H9E]. Climacteric (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary ovarian insufficiency, specifically related to hormone testing (anti-Müllerian hormone), the ASRM/ESHRE 2024 guidelines recommend not obtaining routine anti-Müllerian hormone testing to predict POI.

### Clinical uses of anti-Müllerian hormone assays: Pitfalls and promises [^115voSds]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the controversy surrounding fluctuations of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels during the menstrual cycle arises from differences in the immunoassays currently available: the Beckman Coulter Immunotech kit (Fullerton, CA) and the Diagnostic Systems Laboratories kit (Webster, TX).

This study employed a prospective trial design, conducted in the fertility clinics of two tertiary university hospitals. The participants included 168 blood samples from three different populations, with serial samples at set intervals from the LH surge collected in a fourth population of 10 volunteers.

Intervention involved remeasuring AMH levels using the Diagnostic Systems Laboratories kit in 168 blood samples initially measured with the Beckman Coulter assay. Serial AMH measurements (n = 7) were also conducted during the menstrual cycle of 10 women.

- **Main outcome measures**: Linear regression of AMH levels was determined using two different assays, along with analysis of variance of serial measurements in the menstrual cycle.

The results indicated a linear relationship between the two methods, with a correlation coefficient of 0.88. When repeated individual AMH measures were analyzed longitudinally in relation to the LH surge, a slight but significant decrease was noted after ovulation.

In conclusion, differences in AMH fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, as reported in recent publications, do not result from the use of different AMH assays. The changes in AMH levels post-ovulation are slight but statistically significant, although the observed fluctuations are minimal.

### Defining reference ranges for serum anti-Müllerian hormone on a large cohort of normozoospermic adult men highlights new potential physiological functions of AMH on FSH secretion and sperm motility [^113BLdqr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

AMH measurement is currently used in pediatric endocrinology for diagnostic purposes. However, poor knowledge of AMH function in adult men, together with the lack of reliable reference ranges of circulating AMH levels in normozoospermic adult men, has prevented the use of AMH measurement in adulthood for clinical purposes. To fill this gap in knowledge, we analyzed blood levels of AMH and AMH/tT values in a large cohort of normozoospermic adult men.

We first reported the reference range for serum AMH concentrations and AMH/tT values in normozoospermic adult men. Second, we studied the relationship between serum AMH and both reproductive hormones and semen parameters.

- **The reference range for serum AMH concentrations and AMH/tT values**: Interestingly, serum AMH concentrations were negatively correlated with age in normozoospermic adult men. In our study, the normal range for AMH serum concentrations was from 18.1 to 90.9 pmol/L for individuals between 20 and 39 years and from 12.3 to 87.6 pmol/L for those over 39 years. In 2010, Aksglaede et al. reported a reference range for serum AMH levels (13–98 pmol/L) in a cohort of 150 adult men from the general population aged between 21.6 and 64.4 years. Indeed, in the latter study, exhaustive andrological phenotyping including inhibin B measurement and the evaluation of spermatic parameters were not performed. Their AMH assay was also less sensitive than the one used in our study.

We have also reported for the first time the reference range for blood AMH/tT (20–39 years of age: 0.45–3.44 pmol/L; > 39 years of age: 0.36–3).

### Circulating AMH reflects ovarian morphology by magnetic resonance imaging and 3D ultrasound in 121 healthy girls [^111RAVNS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

In adult women, Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by small growing follicles, and circulating levels of AMH reflect the number of antral follicles as well as primordial follicles. Whether AMH reflects follicle numbers in healthy girls remains to be elucidated.

This study aimed to evaluate whether serum levels of AMH reflect ovarian morphology in healthy girls. It was designed as a population-based cohort study involving the general community. The participants included in the study were 121 healthy girls aged 9.8–14.7 years.

- **Main outcome measures**: Clinical examination, including pubertal breast stage (Tanner's classification B1–5), ovarian volume, as well as the number and size of antral follicles were assessed by two independent modalities: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ellipsoid volume, follicles ≥ 2 mm; and transabdominal ultrasound, ellipsoid and 3D volume, follicles ≥ 1 mm. Circulating levels of AMH, inhibin B, estradiol, FSH, and LH were assessed by immunoassays; T as well as androstenedione were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

AMH reflected the number of small (MRI 2–3 mm) and medium (4–6 mm) follicles (Pearson's Rho [r] = 0.531 and r = 0.512, P < .001) but not large follicles (≥ 7 mm) (r = 0.109, P = 0.323). In multiple regression analysis, small and medium follicles (MRI ≤ 6 mm) remained the main contributors to circulating AMH (β, 0.501; P < .001) whereas the correlation between AMH and estradiol was negative (β, -0.318; p = 0.005). In early puberty (B1-B3), the number of AMH-producing follicles was a significant factor.

### The roles of anti-Müllerian hormone in breast cancer [^117PknxD]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2023). Low credibility.

Ovarian reserve refers to the number of primordial follicles in the ovarian cortex, indicating the ability of the ovary to produce fertilizable eggs. Currently, ultrasound-guided antral follicle counting (AFC) is the diagnostic procedure used to evaluate ovarian reserve. Some scholars suggest that the level of serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can indirectly reflect the size of the primordial follicle pool in the ovary or the abundance of ovarian reserve. Several studies have confirmed that the serum AMH level is positively correlated with AFC.

AMH levels can reflect ovarian function for women at a given age more sensitively than other reproductive hormones because the level of AMH starts declining earlier than other ovarian signs with the corresponding age. The dominant follicles and corpus luteum do not secrete AMH because AMH does not depend on the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis, making it stable during the menstrual cycle. With regard to sensitivity and specificity, AMH is more suitable than FSH, estradiol, and inhibin B for evaluating ovarian reserve.

Regarding AMH as an outstanding candidate to evaluate adult female ovarian function has become prevalent. The obtained results are then applied for individualized counseling of women with fertility needs to predict the menopausal date and reproductive life, to predict ovarian response to overstimulation in assisted reproductive technology, to assist in the diagnosis of ovarian diseases (such as polycystic ovary syndrome and congenital ovarian insufficiency), and to evaluate the iatrogenic impacts on ovarian reserve.

### Back to the basics of ovarian aging: A population-based study on longitudinal anti-Müllerian hormone decline [^1123uJfA]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

With this longitudinal study, we are able to shed light on the individual decline of AMH. We found that AMH trajectories with age and time to menopause were not identical, as the rate of decline differed between individuals. The rate of AMH decline was dependent on initial AMH levels, and this relationship differed with age and time to menopause. The evident differences between women with relatively high and low age-specific AMH levels at baseline became increasingly smaller as time progressed. The AMH levels of an individual woman correlated well with one another and thus did not deviate far from her trajectory. Contrary to our expectations, there was considerable variation of AMH levels between individuals with time to menopause. Taken together, these results indicate that women do not all follow the same decline trajectory of AMH, and the largest differences in AMH levels between women can be found in early adult and reproductive life, after which they become increasingly smaller.

In a study of 81 fertile women, the variation of two AMH levels measured over an interval of 4 years was compared per study participant. AMH levels were strongly associated with chronological age, and the change of individual AMH levels was comparable with the overall group decline, with a within-individual residual correlation of 0.66. Our results indicate that there is indeed a high within-individual correlation of AMH levels over a long trajectory with age, which appeals to the reliability of multiple AMH measures to estimate the trajectory of an individual.

### Serum anti-müllerian hormone levels in healthy females: a nomogram ranging from infancy to adulthood [^114Ct8Kj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is an accurate marker of ovarian reserve. However, sufficiently large sets of normative data from infancy to the end of reproductive life are scarce. This study assessed serum AMH levels in healthy females. In 804 healthy females ranging from infancy until the end of the reproductive period, serum AMH levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunometric assay. All adults had regular menstrual cycles. The majority were proven fertile, and none had used oral contraceptive pills prior to study inclusion.

In the total cohort, AMH was inversely correlated with age (r = -0.24; P < 0.001). The age at which the maximum AMH value was attained was 15.8 years. In girls younger than 15.8 years, serum AMH and age were positively correlated (r = +0.18; P = 0.007). Thereafter, AMH levels remained stable (r = -0.33; P = 0.66), whereas from the age of 25.0 years onward, an inverse correlation between AMH and age (r = -0.47; P < 0.001) was observed. At any given age, considerable interindividual differences in serum AMH levels were noted.

During infancy, AMH levels increase, whereas during adolescence, a plateau until the age of 25 years is observed. From the age of 25 years onward, serum AMH levels correlate inversely with age, implying that AMH is applicable as a marker of ovarian reserve only in women aged 25 years and older. Our nomogram may facilitate counseling women on their reproductive potential.

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^111Avwrz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

In the above-discussed meta-analysis by Depmann et al, compared with age alone, anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) increased the C statistic from 52% to 80% in the prediction of early menopause. In a recent prospective study with a nested case-control design containing 327 cases, the use of serum AMH to predict early menopause was confirmed. A decrease of 0.10 ng/mL in AMH increased the risk of early menopause by 14% (95% CI, 1.10–1.18). Compared with an AMH level of 2.0 ng/mL, the odds ratio (OR) for early menopause was 23 for women with an AMH level of 0.5 ng/mL.

Most prediction models are based on a single AMH measurement and assume a comparable decline pattern in each woman. Recent studies analyzing longitudinal AMH measurements suggest that AMH may not follow a uniform decline trajectory. Analysis of the population-based Doetinchem cohort study, with data available from 5 visits over a 20-year follow-up period, showed an age-dependent decline in AMH levels, which varied significantly for individual women. Furthermore, it was shown that the decline rate changed with age, accelerating after the age of 40 years. Hence, it has been suggested that using individual AMH decline patterns may improve the prediction of age of menopause. However, reanalyzing data of 2432 women from the Doetinchem cohort study showed that an AMH decline rate alone, or in combination with age-specific AMH, had little additional value. In contrast, an Iranian study analyzing longitudinal data of 959 women during a follow-up of 14 years, of whom 55% reached menopause, did show that serial measurements of AMH improved the prediction.

### Baseline inhibin B and anti-Mullerian hormone measurements for diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in boys with delayed puberty [^113ZrGCc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) in boys with delayed puberty is challenging, as is the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in boys with combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). However, the therapeutic choices for puberty induction depend on accurate diagnosis and can influence future fertility.

The objective was to assess the utility of baseline inhibin B (INHB) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) measurements to discriminate HH from constitutional delay of puberty (CDP). Both hormones are produced by Sertoli cells upon FSH stimulation. Additionally, prepubertal AMH levels are high, reflecting Sertoli cell integrity.

We studied 82 boys aged 14 to 18 years with pubertal delay: 16 had IHH, 15 congenital HH within CPHD, and 51 CDP, as confirmed by follow-up. Subjects were genital stage 1 (testis volume < 3 ml; 9 IHH, 7 CPHD, and 23 CDP) or early stage 2 (testis volume 3–6 ml; 7 IHH, 8 CPHD, and 28 CDP).

Age and testis volume were similar in the three groups. Compared with CDP subjects, IHH and CPHD subjects had lower INHB, testosterone, FSH, and LH concentrations (P < 0.05), whereas AMH concentration was lower only in IHH and CPHD subjects with genital stage 1, likely reflecting a smaller pool of Sertoli cells in profound HH. In IHH and CPHD boys with genital stage 1, sensitivity and specificity were 100% for INHB concentration of 35 pg/ml or less. In IHH and CPHD boys with genital stage 2, sensitivities were 86% and 80%, whereas specificities were 92% and 88%, respectively, for an INHB concentration.
