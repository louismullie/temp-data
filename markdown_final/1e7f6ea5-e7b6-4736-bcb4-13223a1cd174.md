## Question

What is mpv in a cbc

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what MPV means on a CBC and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and normal range of MPV. Then, I should verify how MPV is calculated and what it reflects about platelet biology. Next, I will review disease contexts where MPV is informative versus where it is not. After that, I need to check preanalytical and analytical factors that can mislead interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize practical takeaways and cautions for use, anchoring to high-quality sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition. MPV stands for mean platelet volume, a routine CBC parameter that reports the average size of platelets in femtoliters, and it is typically reported alongside platelet count and other indices on modern hematology analyzers [^115MT3GP] [^114zNbMc].

> I should confirm the usual reference range before drawing conclusions. In healthy adults, MPV commonly falls around 7–11 fL, with a large epidemiologic cohort showing a mean of 8.9 ± 1.4 fL and a 95% range of roughly 7.2–11.7 fL, though instrument and population variability exist, so I need to check the lab's specific reference interval before interpreting a single value [^111Qexay].

> Wait, let me verify how MPV is derived technically. MPV is calculated as plateletcrit divided by the total platelet count, which means it reflects the average platelet size across the circulating population and is sensitive to shifts in platelet production and destruction kinetics [^114zNbMc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "bigger is better". Larger platelets are generally younger and more functionally active, containing more granules and prothrombotic mediators, so an increased MPV often signals heightened platelet activation and turnover. However, I should double-check that this pattern is context dependent and not universal across diseases [^111rq1V8] [^116xQr2r].

> Next, I should review where MPV meaningfully informs diagnosis or prognosis. In sepsis and critical illness, rising MPV tracks increased consumption of platelets and compensatory release of larger, younger platelets, and in preterm infants, an MPV around 8.5 fL has shown promise as an early signal of late-onset sepsis, sometimes preceding clinical recognition by days, although I need to ensure I pair this with platelet count trends and clinical judgment [^111Dm7oe] [^1162967D] [^116iyAWk].

> Let me consider pregnancy-related complications. Elevated MPV greater than about 10.2 fL has been associated with preeclampsia risk and may precede diagnosis by several weeks, and MPV around 9.8 fL has been linked to gestational diabetes, likely reflecting endothelial dysfunction and metabolic inflammation. I should confirm that these thresholds are population and instrument specific before applying them rigidly [^1119ZPHc] [^113N54tF] [^113Jun36].

> I will now examine cardiovascular and cerebrovascular contexts. Higher MPV has been associated with acute coronary syndromes and worse outcomes after ischemic stroke, consistent with more reactive platelets, but I should be cautious because MPV alone has modest diagnostic discrimination and should be integrated with troponins, ECG, and clinical risk scores rather than used in isolation [^11295AS2] [^114iuhJT].

> But wait, what if the disease process lowers MPV instead of raising it. In inflammatory bowel disease, meta-analyses show decreased MPV during active disease, contrasting with the pattern seen in many high-grade inflammatory states, and in acute pancreatitis, MPV tends to be lower at onset and rises with recovery, so I need to ensure I interpret directionality in disease-specific context [^115SkgaN] [^1162YDLi] [^111EssTJ].

> Hold on, I should verify hematologic differentials where MPV helps. In thrombocytopenia, a high MPV supports increased peripheral destruction with compensatory thrombopoiesis, as in immune thrombocytopenia, whereas very small platelets with low MPV should prompt consideration of inherited microthrombocytopenias such as Wiskott-Aldrich spectrum disorders. However, instrument calibration and very large platelets can artifactually depress MPV, so I need to check the smear and consider instrument limitations before concluding [^112qFkEF] [^1112tXWp] [^1128yjdn].

> I need to ensure I account for preanalytical and analytical pitfalls. MPV is sensitive to anticoagulant type, time to analysis, temperature, and analyzer methodology, and a substantial minority of U.S. hospitals do not report MPV at all, which can limit comparability; therefore, I should confirm local reference intervals, avoid delayed processing, and be wary of cross-platform comparisons when interpreting small differences [^115MT3GP] [^11525EnS] [^116kaa87].

> Let me reconsider the clinical takeaways. MPV is a dynamic, context-sensitive marker of platelet turnover and activation that can add value in sepsis, pregnancy-related hypertensive and metabolic disorders, and selected cardiovascular settings, but it lacks specificity and should be interpreted alongside platelet count, inflammatory indices, and the clinical picture. Trends over time often carry more signal than a single static value, so I should double-check serial measurements when available [^111Dm7oe] [^1119ZPHc] [^111rq1V8].

> In summary, MPV on a CBC quantifies average platelet size and reflects the balance of platelet production and destruction. Normal adult values are roughly 7–11 fL, higher MPV often indicates younger, more reactive platelets, but disease-specific patterns vary, and accurate interpretation requires attention to clinical context, serial changes, and analytic quality, so I should confirm the lab's reference range and integrate MPV with the broader clinical and laboratory picture before acting on it [^111Qexay] [^114zNbMc] [^115MT3GP].

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a CBC index that reflects **platelet size and activity** [^116xgTfC], with a typical adult range of 7.5–11.5 fL. MPV rises when larger, younger platelets are released during increased turnover or activation [^111Dm7oe] (e.g. ITP, sepsis, ACS) and falls in low-production states or with certain drugs. It is a **low-cost, widely available marker** [^1119ZPHc] that aids diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring across inflammatory, cardiovascular, hematologic, and obstetric conditions, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and with awareness of preanalytical variables [^116kaa87].

---

## Definition and measurement

- **Definition**: MPV is the average platelet volume in femtoliters (fL), calculated from plateletcrit divided by platelet count [^114zNbMc].
- **Measurement**: Automated hematology analyzers compute MPV from platelet histograms; preanalytical factors (EDTA, time, temperature) can affect accuracy [^116kaa87].
- **Normal range**: Adults typically have MPV 7.5–11.5 fL; neonates and infants have higher values that decline with age [^111Qexay].

---

## Physiological significance

- **Platelet size and function**: Larger platelets are younger, more reactive, and contain more granules, reflecting higher activation and thrombotic potential [^116xQr2r].
- **Bone marrow activity**: MPV rises with increased thrombopoiesis (e.g. platelet destruction) and falls with decreased production (e.g. aplastic anemia) [^notfound].
- **Inflammation and activation**: MPV is a surrogate of platelet activation and systemic inflammation [^111SVY9P].

---

## Clinical implications

### Inflammatory and infectious diseases

In sepsis, **MPV rises early** with platelet activation and consumption and correlates with severity and mortality [^111Dm7oe] [^115BHjyB]. In COVID-19, higher MPV reflects activation and consumption and associates with worse outcomes [^116pPVQi]. In inflammatory bowel disease, **MPV is often reduced** in active disease and may normalize with remission [^115SkgaN].

---

### Cardiovascular diseases

In acute coronary syndromes, **MPV is increased** and independently predicts adverse events [^11295AS2]. In stroke, higher MPV correlates with severity and worse outcomes, likely via increased platelet reactivity [^114iuhJT]. In heart failure, elevated MPV reflects neurohormonal activation and inflammation and predicts worse prognosis.

---

### Hematological disorders

In immune thrombocytopenia, **MPV is elevated** due to increased turnover and release of large, immature platelets [^1153k5ix]. In myeloproliferative neoplasms, MPV may be elevated and help distinguish from reactive thrombocytosis. In bone marrow failure syndromes, **MPV is typically low** due to impaired thrombopoiesis [^notfound].

---

### Pregnancy-related conditions

In preeclampsia, **MPV rises with endothelial injury and platelet activation** and can precede clinical onset [^113Jun36]. In gestational diabetes mellitus, higher MPV reflects insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation [^1119ZPHc]. In postpartum hemorrhage, low MPV may signal impaired thrombopoiesis and higher bleeding risk [^1158ukoY].

---

## Factors influencing MPV levels

| **Factor** | **Effect on mpv** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Inflammation | ↑ | Platelet activation and consumption [^111Dm7oe] |
| Bone marrow disorders | ↓ | Impaired thrombopoiesis [^notfound] |
| Medications (e.g. antiplatelets) | ↓ | Inhibition of platelet activation |
| Age | ↑ | Larger platelets in older adults |
| Smoking | ↑ | Platelet activation and inflammation [^notfound] |
| Diabetes mellitus | ↑ | Chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction [^114gtLVy] |

---

## Clinical utility and limitations

- **Utility**: MPV is a low-cost, widely available marker for diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring in inflammatory, cardiovascular, hematologic, and obstetric conditions [^1119ZPHc].
- **Limitations**: MPV is nonspecific; preanalytical variables, comorbidities, and medications can affect values. Interpretation should be context-specific and combined with clinical and laboratory data [^116kaa87].

---

MPV is a **practical index of platelet size and activity** that informs diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring across diverse clinical scenarios; its value lies in integrating MPV with clinical context and other laboratory findings [^112kQAdd].

Measurement of variables

CBC including platelet parameters was measured using a laser-based hematology analyzer ADVIA 2120i (Siemens Healthineers, Germany) that generates a higher quality measurement compared to impedance-based methodology. The platelet parameters measured include the routinely used parameters such as platelets count (PLTs), plateletcrit (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet large cell ratio (PLCR) and platelet large cell concentration (PLCC); as well as the new platelet parameters; mean platelet mass (MPM) and mean platelet component concentration (MPC). These new platelets parameters are more informative than MPV and PDW as markers of platelet activity. ABO blood grouping and RhD antigen were phenotyped using standard laboratory techniques. PC, PS and LA were measured using Elisys Uno Fully Automated ELISA Analyzer (Human Company, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions and standard laboratory protocols. ATIII was measured by RID kit methodology from immunodiagnostic KENT laboratories (Bellingham, USA). TSH, anti-TPO and D-dimer were measured using Siemens IMMULITE 1000 Immunoassay analyzer (Siemens Healthineers). ACA, APA, B2GP1 and ANA antibodies were measured by ELISA kits according to the manual procedure of AskuLisa-Company (Germany) per the manufacturer's instructions.

Data quality assurance

Personal protective equipment was used throughout all steps. SOPs were followed while collecting the samples by a trained phlebotomist, samples were inspected for hemolysis, clotting, volume and collection time, and labeling after collection was done. The quality of samples and reagents was assured based on the respective SOP and the performance of the analyzers was maintained by running three levels of controls (Normal, Low, and High). Abnormal results were repeated twice to confirm the results.

Data processing and analysis

Results were tabulated in excel sheet, and then the data were exported and analyzed using SPSS version 23. We insured having normal distribution by eliminating outliers without exceeding 5% of the data. Independent t-test was used to compare means of continuous variables and Chi-square for non-continuous variables. A P -value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Are mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width useful parameters in children with acute rheumatic carditis? [^116xgTfC]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Rheumatic fever (RF) is an inflammatory disease caused by autoimmune response to a preceding group A streptococcal infection. Mean platelet volume (MPV) reflects the platelet size and the rate of platelet production in bone marrow, and it may be used as an indicator of platelet activation and severity of inflammation. Fifty-three consecutive patients diagnosed with acute rheumatic carditis and 53 control subjects were enrolled into this study. Leukocyte and platelet counts were significantly higher in patients with acute carditis before treatment compared with controls, whereas MPV and platelet distribution width (PDW) values were not significantly different between groups. Platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) values were decreased significantly in patients with RF after treatment. There was not a significant difference in terms of platelet count between the controls and the patient group after treatment. ESR was found to be correlated with CRP in patients before and after treatment. In conclusion, the results of our study showed that MPV and PDW levels do not change during acute rheumatic carditis before and after treatment.

Results

Platelet parameters reference intervals

Totally 594 neonates were enrolled in present study. Demographic data are shown in Table 1. Several values were identified as outliers in platelet parameters and we excluded cases test-by-test in data analyses (see Fig. 1). Except for PLT, other platelet indices were not normally distributed. RIs for platelet parameters represent the central 95% out of all data (Table 2). As a result, capillary blood RI of PLT ranged from 152 to 464 (× 10 9 /L).

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of MEK1 inhibitor-induced cardiotoxicity [^117JoV8E]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Health evaluation of mice

Body weights and detailed clinical observations were made thrice weekly. Endpoint criteria included noticeable signs of toxicity or 20% body weight reduction. The survival rate of trametinib-treated mice was markedly lower compared with vehicle (Figure 1A). Upon euthanasia, 88% of mice (16 of 18) exhibited reductions in body weight, consistent with clinical findings (Figure 1B). Terminal complete blood counts were assessed for signs of immunotoxicity. Trametinib-treated animals exhibited leukocytosis, with marked neutrophilia and monocytosis, with no detectable changes in lymphocyte count (Figure 1C). These results are consistent with clinical reports of patients chronically administered trametinib.

### Perioperative leukocyte-plateletcrit shift as a prognostic signature in glioblastoma [^114ysfd1]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glioblastoma (GB) remains the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults, with median overall survival near 14–15 months despite maximal safe resection and temozolomide-based chemoradiation. Routine complete blood count (CBC)–derived inflammatory indices have drawn interest as pragmatic prognostic markers, with multiple studies and meta-analyses linking neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and related composites to poorer survival in glioma and GB. Emerging work further suggests that temporal dynamics in these ratios — rather than single preoperative snapshots — may carry stronger prognostic information after standard chemoradiation.

Beyond lymphocyte-normalized indices, growing evidence implicates the platelet compartment in glioma biology through platelet–tumor crosstalk, pro-angiogenic signalling, and treatment-related shifts, with higher or rising platelet measures often associating with worse outcomes. These observations motivate platelet-centric metrics that capture not only counts but also the effective platelet mass and activation state.

Plateletcrit (PCT) — the fraction of whole blood volume occupied by platelets — is an underused, volumetric platelet index reported on many hematology analyzers; conceptually analogous to hematocrit, it integrates information from platelet count and mean platelet volume (MPV). Outside neuro-oncology, higher preoperative or baseline PCT has been linked to inferior outcomes in several solid tumors, supporting its biological plausibility as a prognostic signal. In GB specifically, platelet-focused markers are beginning to emerge: the MPV-to-platelet count ratio (MPV/PC) has been associated with progression and survival, and studies of PLR in GB also report adverse associations, albeit with heterogeneity across cohorts.

What remains insufficiently defined is whether leukocyte–platelet coupling that incorporates platelet mass — particularly leukocyte-to-PCT — and, critically, its peri-treatment trajectory, provides independent prognostic information in GB. We therefore quantified cross-sectional values and inter-timepoint changes (Δ) in leukocyte- and platelet-derived indices across pre-operative, post-operative, pre-adjuvant, and post-adjuvant windows, with a prespecified focus on PCT, and tested associations with overall survival in Cox models adjusted for standard covariates. We hypothesized that peri-operative Δ leu/PCT would be associated with OS beyond static, single-timepoint measures. This study addresses that gap by quantifying both cross-sectional values and inter-timepoint changes in leukocyte- and platelet-derived indices, with particular focus on PCT.

### Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean platelet volume (MPV) as early diagnostic markers for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and anemia: a systematic review of clinical evidence and mechanisms [^112FB3Y7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key mechanistic insights

Our findings reveal three pathophysiological pathways linking MPV/MCV to pregnancy complications:
Endothelial Dysfunction Pathway: Elevated MPV (> 10.2fL) reflects platelet activation secondary to vascular injury in preeclampsia. MPV correlates with anti-angiogenic factors (sFlt-1/PlGF ratio ρ = 0.62, p < 0.001).
Metabolic Inflammation Axis: MPV elevation in GDM associates with IL-6 levels (β = 0.34, 95%CI:0.21–0.47). MCV < 80fL with elevated RDW predicts 89% of B12/folate deficiencies.
Genetic Modulators: Middle Eastern populations show 23% higher baseline MPV due to ITGA2B gene variants.

While ITGA2B variants explain MPV differences, avoid deterministic interpretations. Genetic data must be used to refine diagnostics, not stereotype populations.

Platelet Activation in Preeclampsia
Prior View: MPV elevation attributed solely to platelet consumption.
New Evidence: MPV correlates with: sFlt-1/PlGF ratio (ρ = 0.62, p < 0.001) Endothelial glycocalyx shedding (r = 0.54).

GDM Pathophysiology

Earlier studies linked MPV only to insulin resistance. We identify:
IL-6 mediation: 34% of MPV variance explained by IL-6 levels (β = 0.34, 95%CI:0.21–0.47).
Gut microbiome link: Low MCV associates with Prevotella-dominant microbiota (OR 2.1).

### Large and small platelets-(when) do they differ? [^111rq1V8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Platelets are most important in providing cellular hemostasis but also take part in inflammation and immune processes. Increased platelet size has been regarded as a feature describing a young and more reactive subpopulation until studies were published which questioned this concept. Moreover, changes of platelet size given by the mean platelet volume (MPV) were described for immune thrombocytopenia, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, venous thromboembolism, chronic lung disease, sepsis, cancer-associated thrombosis, autoimmune disorders, and others. This review summarizes the literature on what is known about platelets with different size and describes controversies of studies with large and small platelets putting a focus on their thrombogenicity, age, and on the association of MPV with the mentioned diseases.

### The value of the platelet count and platelet indices in differentiation of COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia [^114SktJU]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

It is difficult to distinguish coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) from other viral respiratory tract infections owing to the similarities in clinical and radiological findings. This study aims to determine the clinical importance of platelet count and platelet indices in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza and the value of these parameters in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. The medical records of the patients and the electronic patient monitoring system were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, admission symptoms, laboratory findings, radiological involvement, comorbidities, and mortality of the patients were recorded. Forty-three patients diagnosed with influenza and 54 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The average age of the COVID-19 patients was lower than that of the influenza patients (influenza: 60.5 years, COVID-19: 52.4 years; pp = 0.024),.024), and the male gender was predominant in the COVID-19 group (influenza: 42%, COVID-19: 56%). According to laboratory findings, the mean platelet volume (MPV) and MPV/platelet ratio were statistically significantly lower, whereas the eosinophil count and platelet distribution width levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the COVID-19 group. It was found that the most common symptom in both groups was dyspnea and that the symptom was more prevalent among influenza patients. In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the platelet count and platelet indices are easily accessible, inexpensive, and important parameters in terms of differential diagnosis and can help in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza during seasonal outbreaks of the latter.

### Mean platelet volume, red cell distribution width, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio before and after surgery in patients with carotid body tumors [^111USaGb]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are rare hypervascular benign tumors that originate from the paraganglia at the carotid bifurcation. The red cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and mean platelet volume (MPV) may serve as markers in inflammatory, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases. However, their prognostic value in CBTs is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the leukocyte count, MPV, RDW, and NLR before and after surgery in patients with CBTs.

Methods

This retrospective trial included data from 80 patients with CBTs and 65 age-matched healthy controls. The leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, RDW, and MPV were extracted and NLR was calculated from the complete blood count results of participants.

Results

The leukocyte and neutrophil counts as well as RDW levels were significantly increased in patients with CBTs compared with healthy controls (P = 0.005, P = 0.003, and P = 0.026; respectively). Patients with CBTs had lower lymphocytes counts (P = 0.241) and higher NLRs (P = 0.054); however, the difference was statistically insignificant. Moreover, no statistically significant difference was detected between groups in terms of platelet counts and MPV levels. Furthermore, the leukocyte count, platelet numbers, MPV, RDW, and NLR levels in patients with CBTs were not statistically significant after surgery (all; P > 0.05).

Conclusion

This is the first study that documents the increased RDW levels and leukocyte count in patients with CBTs. The combined use of RDW and the leukocyte count along with other clinical assessments can be used as a biomarker for CBTs. Further clinical trials with larger cases series are required to determine the actual predictive roles of these systemic biomarkers.

### Platelet count and indices as postpartum hemorrhage risk factors: a retrospective cohort study [^1158ukoY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

A low MPV and an IPF of ≥ 6% were only related to SPPH in primary caesarean deliveries. Given the mixed results of other studies regarding MPV and bleeding risk, and that we have no clear explanation for this finding, we consider the MPV of limited value in clinical practice. A low IPF is known to be related to bone marrow failure and increased bleeding risk in subjects with Immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and a high IPF has been shown to correlate with acute coronary syndromes. This is in contrast to our finding that a high IPF is related to an increased bleeding risk. However, the IPF is generally higher in smokers and diabetics, and thus could have been subject to confounding in our study.

### A rise in mean platelet volume during hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia predicts poor prognosis: a retrospective observational cohort study [^112Qza8W]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A strength of this study is the evaluation in detail of demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic characteristics associated with MPV changes during hospitalization for CAP. Information regarding the association of clinical characteristics with dynamic MPV changes is scarce. In three available studies of patients with coronary artery disease and sepsis, rising MPV was associated with increasing age, renal failure and peripheral artery disease. We also observed that rising MPV is associated with age and renal dysfunction. Moreover, our patients with a rise in MPV were more likely to present with cerebrovascular disorder and severe pneumonia than patients with no rise in MPV. The main potential mechanism for rising MPV in our patient population is severe inflammation caused by pneumonia. In severe infection, increased release of thrombopoietin and various inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, −3 and −6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, result in increased thrombopoiesis and enhanced expression of younger large platelets into the blood circulation. On the other hand, rising MPV may be attributed to increased thrombocyte consumption in the peripheral tissue and spleen, induced by severe inflammatory status. Indeed, in our patient population, a rise in MPV was associated with higher pneumonia severity scores, higher levels of leukocytes and neutrophils at discharge, and lower platelet counts on discharge. Another possible contributing factor to a rise in MPV in our patients is renal dysfunction which is known to be associated with increasing MPV. Hypoxemia, which may cause increased platelet consumption and bone marrow stimulation is an additional explanation for a rise in MPV.

### Platelet reference ranges for neonates, defined using data from over 47, 000 patients in a multihospital healthcare system [^117GMG2N]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Identifying a platelet count as abnormal (thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis) can facilitate recognizing various disease states. However, the published reference ranges for platelet counts in neonates may be imprecise, as they were generated from relatively small sample sizes and compiled before modern platelet enumeration methods.

Study Design

We derived new neonatal reference ranges for platelet counts and mean platelet volume (MPV) measurements using electronic data accumulated during a recent 6-year period from a multihospital healthcare system.

Result

Platelet counts were obtained between the first and the 90th day after birth, from 47,291 neonates delivered at 22 to 42 weeks gestation. The first platelet counts obtained in the first 3 days of life, increased over the range of 22 to 42 weeks gestation. In those born ≤ 32 weeks gestation, the lower reference range (5th percentile) was 104,200 microl(-1), but it was 123,100 microl(-1) in late-preterm and -term neonates. Advancing postnatal age had a significant effect on platelet counts; during the first 9 weeks, the counts fit a sinusoidal pattern with two peaks; one at 2 to 3 weeks and a second at 6 to 7 weeks. The upper limit of expected counts (95th percentile) during these peaks were as high as 750,000 microl(-1).

Conclusion

The figures herein describe reference ranges for platelet counts and MPV determinations of neonates at various gestational ages during their first 90 days. Expected values differ substantially from the 150,000 microl(-1) to 450,000 microl(-1) range previously used to define neonatal thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis. The new definitions will render the diagnoses of neonatal thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis less commonly than when the old definitions were used, because the new ranges are wider than 150,000 microl(-1) to 450,000 microl(-1).

### Increased mean platelet volume is related to histologic severity of primary biliary cirrhosis [^115h7ZaE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the main platelet volume (MPV) as a severity marker in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).

Materials and methods

Thirty-nine patients with biopsy-proven and as yet untreated PBC followed between January 2008 and January 2015 were included in this study. Liver biopsies were categorized as early stage (stage 1 and 2 according to Scheuer's histological stage) and late stage (Scheuer's stage 3 and 4). As part of the routine evaluation, all PBC patients had their full blood count and biochemistry profile determined, where MPV, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, red cell distribution width (RDW), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin values were evaluated. Both groups were compared in terms of the RDW/platelet ratio, the AST platelet ratio index, and the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio.

Results

Eighteen patients had early-stage disease (46.2%), whereas 21 PBC patients had late-stage disease (53.8%). There were no differences between groups in terms of routine hematological parameters (white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin, RDW) or biochemical parameters (alanine aminotransferase, AST, gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin) (P > 0.05). Similarly, there were no differences in AST platelet ratio index, RDW/platelet ratio, or neutrophil lymphocyte ratio values between groups (P values 0.08, 0.19, and 0.14, respectively). The MPV and direct bilirubin were significantly higher in the advanced stage group compared with the early-stage group (11.08 vs. 9.73 fl, respectively, P = 0.01 and 0.44 vs. 0.28 mg/dl, respectively, P = 0.03). The area under the curve, cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity of MPV and direct bilirubin for detecting advanced stage were 0.721, 10.3, 71%, and 66%, respectively, and 0.698, 0.23, 71%, and 66%, respectively.

Conclusion

MPV can be used as a noninvasive, simple, and effective parameter in patients with PBC to predict histological severity of the disease.

### Variation in complete blood count reports across US hospitals [^11525EnS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

We collected CBC values from 139 hospitals across 43 states and 102 cities (Figure 1). Fifty-four percent were community hospitals while 46% were academic hospitals. The median number of values reported by all hospitals was 21 (range, 12–24). This was not significantly different between academic (median 22 [range, 12–24]) and community hospitals (median 21 [range, 14–24]) (Figure 2). The distribution of hospitals according to the number of CBC values reported were: 12 to 16 (11 [8%]), 17 to 19 (14 [11%]), 20 (35 [25%]), 21 (10 [7%]), 22 (27 [19%]), 23 (25 [18%]), and 24 (17 [12%]). A substantial minority of the hospitals did not report the percentages of white blood cell differential count (13 [9%]) or mean platelet volume (29 [21%]). Absolute nucleated red blood cell and immature granulocyte counts were reported frequently, by 36 (26%) and 80 hospitals (58%), respectively. However, the frequency of reporting these 4 values were similar between academic and community hospitals.

### Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean platelet volume (MPV) as early diagnostic markers for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and anemia: a systematic review of clinical evidence and mechanisms [^1119ZPHc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In resource-limited settings, timely and affordable diagnostics can significantly impact maternal health outcomes. Among the most accessible are MPV and MCV — readily accessible within standard CBC parameters.

Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) and Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) are fundamental hematological parameters routinely measured in complete blood count (CBC) tests. While traditionally utilized for assessing anemia and thrombocytopenia, recent studies have highlighted their potential as early diagnostic markers for pregnancy-related complications.

During normal pregnancy, significant physiological adaptations occur in the maternal hematological system. Plasma volume increases by 40–50%, while red blood cell mass rises by 20–30%, leading to physiological anemia of pregnancy. Concurrently, platelet production accelerates, with MPV values typically increasing across trimesters. These changes reflect the body's response to meet fetal demands and prepare for delivery-associated blood loss.

In Yemen and neighboring low-resource regions, the combined burden of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and iron-deficiency anemia affects over 30% of pregnant women, contributing to maternal morbidity and neonatal complications. Recent Ministry of Health data (2023) report a 12% prevalence of preeclampsia, 9% for GDM, and 22% for anemia among antenatal clinic attendees in Lahej and Aden governorates. These high rates underscore the urgent need for affordable and early diagnostic tools in maternal care.

Pathological alterations in these parameters may signal developing complications:
Preeclampsia: Elevated MPV (> 10.2 fL) reflects increased platelet activation and consumption, a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction. Studies demonstrate 78% sensitivity for predicting preeclampsia when MPV exceeds this threshold.
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM): MPV > 9.8 fL correlates with insulin resistance (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8–3.0), suggesting subclinical inflammation.
Iron-Deficiency Anemia: MCV < 80 fL shows 85% specificity for iron deficiency, the most common anemia etiology in pregnancy.

### Abnormal platelet parameters in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162YDLi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Platelet dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite clinical observations indicating abnormalities in platelet parameters among IBD patients, inconsistencies persist, and these parameters lack standardization for diagnosis or clinical assessment.

Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant articles published up to December 16th, 2023. A random-effects model was employed to pool the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT) between IBD patients and healthy controls, and subgroup analyses were performed.

Results

The meta-analysis included 79 articles with 8,350 IBD patients and 13,181 healthy individuals. The results revealed significantly increased PLT and PCT levels (WMD: 69.910, 95% CI: 62.177, 77.643 10 9 /L; WMD: 0.046%, 95% CI: 0.031%, 0.061%), and decreased MPV levels (WMD: -0.912, 95% CI: -1.086, -0.739 fL) in IBD patients compared to healthy individuals. No significant difference was found in PDW between the IBD and control groups (WMD: -0.207%, 95% CI: -0.655%, 0.241%). Subgroup analysis by disease type and disease activity showed no change in the differences for PLT, PCT, and MPV in the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease groups, as well as the active and inactive groups. Notably, the active group exhibited significantly lower PDW levels than the control group (WMD: -1.138%, 95% CI: -1.535%, -0.741%).

Conclusions

Compared with healthy individuals, IBD patients display significantly higher PLT and PCT and significantly lower MPV. Monitoring the clinical manifestations of platelet abnormalities serves as a valuable means to obtain diagnostic and prognostic information. Conversely, proactive measures should be taken to prevent the consequences of platelet abnormalities in individuals with IBD.

### Mean platelet volume in preterm infants as a predictor of late-onset neonatal sepsis: a retrospective comparative study [^111Dm7oe]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we have shown that MPV may be considered a predictor for LOS in preterm infants.

Recently, Guney Varal et al published a case study that defined MPV as a potential early predictor of LOS in preterm infants. He showed that MPV could play a role in the early detection of sepsis as a result of the concurrent inflammatory response.

During systemic inflammation, the expression of P-selectin on the platelet surface enhances the adhesion of platelets to leucocytes, and their subsequent aggregation, in addition to promoting the expression of tissue factor by monocytes. In septic neonates, the interaction of platelets with the activated endothelium leads to platelet consumption and thrombus formation, resulting in thrombocytopaenia.

Thrombocytopaenia is a well-known marker for sepsis, with a significant reduction in platelet count corresponding with the severity of the disease. In sepsis, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that foster thrombus formation lead to the exhaustion of fibrinolytic and fibrinogenic agents, causing an increased destruction of platelets.

Platelet consumption and destruction in sepsis lead to increased production of young platelets by the bone marrow, which are not only larger but also more functionally active. An increase in MPV is consequently observed, serving as an early indication for the onset of sepsis.

According to the publication by Wiedmeier et al, average MPV values increased during the first two postnatal weeks, peaking at 9.5 fL, thereafter gradually decreasing with a plateau mean value of 8.5 fL.

In our ROC analysis, the cut-off of 8.495 for MPV indicates the likelihood of LOS with a sensitivity of 81.7%. These newborns should be supervised with a high index of suspicion for LOS development.

Interestingly, the elevated MPV in the septic group persisted in the subsequent CBCs up to 2 weeks after the septic event. This might be explained by the platelet's half-life of 7–10 days.

Forest et al showed that CRP is an acute phase reactant in sepsisand can be elevated on the day of the event or later, as was shown in our data too, whereas the early elevated levels of MPV might serve as an early predictor of LOS even a week prior to the event.

While the study presents compelling evidence for the utility of MPV as an early marker for LOS, it is not without its limitations.

The retrospective nature of the study might introduce potential biases. Furthermore, while the results are promising, larger multicentre studies are required to validate these findings and ascertain the generalised applicability of the MPV threshold identified.

### Immature platelet count: a simple parameter for distinguishing thrombocytopenia in pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia from immune thrombocytopenia [^116T2bZS]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Platelet counts below normal values define thrombocytopenia. However, platelet counts alone do not reveal the underlying pathomechanism. New blood cell counters provide additional information on platelet size and volume, and enable the distinction of sub-populations. In this preliminary study, we evaluate whether one of these markers can be used for diagnosis of isolated thrombocytopenia in children.

Procedure

We provide normal values for mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), plateletcrit (PCT), platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR), platelet mean-frequent volume (P-MFV), relative immature platelet fraction (IPF%), and absolute IPF (IPF#) for 100 healthy children and analyzed 87 children with thrombocytopenia.

Results

In children with platelet production defects, IPF% was low, while in acute immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), IPF% was markedly increased (median 25.2%, P < 0.01), representing accelerated platelet turnover. Interestingly, children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) also had elevated IPF% (median 10%, P < 0.01), suggesting that thrombopoiesis is stimulated despite virtual absence of bone marrow progenitors. Low IPF# was only found in patients with acute ITP.

Conclusions

IPF% is a marker for thrombocytopenia due to defective platelet production while IPF#, representing the immature platelet count, might become a practical parameter to distinguish acute ITP from thrombocytopenia in children with newly diagnosed ALL (P < 0.01).

Data collection

We collected laboratory test data and demographic characteristics of mTBI patients from the hospital's medical record information. During the collection process, features with over 70% missing values were excluded in the following analyses to minimize the bias caused by missing data.

Finally, 51 features were utilized to develop the prediction models, including 28 biochemical test indicators: albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium (Ca), cholinesterase (CHE), cholesterol (CHOL), chlorine (Cl), carbon dioxide (CO 2), creatinine (CRE), cystatin C (Cys-C), direct bilirubin (DBIL), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), globulin (GLB), glucose (GLU), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), potassium (K), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), phosphorus (P), total bile acids (TBA), total bilirubin (TBIL), triglyceride (TG), total protein (TP), uric acid (UA); 6 coagulation indicators: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-Dimer (D-D), fibrinogen (FIB), prothrombin time (PT), prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR), thrombin time (TT); 17 complete blood cell count indicators: basophil count (BAS#), eosinophil count (EOS#), hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), lymphocyte count (LYM#), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), monocytes count (MON#), mean platelet volume (MPV), neutrophil count (NEU#), plateletcrit (PCT), platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet-large cell rate (P-LCR), platelet (PLT), red blood cell (RBC), red cell distribution width coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), red cell distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD), white blood cell (WBC). The proportions of missing data per variable are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^1112tXWp]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Distinguishing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) from inherited thrombocytopenias (ITs) is not always easy, and several patients with inherited forms have received unnecessary medical treatments or even splenectomy because they were misdiagnosed with ITP (Bader-Meunier et al; Noris et al; Kunishima et al; Gunay-Aygun et al; Savoia et al). Differential diagnosis may be especially difficult when a low platelet count, which can be used to decide whether thrombocytopenia is acquired or congenital, is incidentally discovered in asymptomatic subjects who have never had a blood count performed before. In some cases, family history may solve the diagnostic dilemma, in that the presence of other relatives with low platelet counts strongly argues against ITP and supports an inherited form. Conversely, the absence of affected family members by no means excludes genetic disorders because many ITs are transmitted in a recessive fashion or derive from de novo mutations.

As many forms of IT are characterized by platelet macrocytosis (Balduini & Savoia,), it is commonly accepted that the evaluation of platelet size is an important tool to provoke suspicion of these disorders. However, the accurate measurement of platelet size in IT subjects presents notable difficulties because some of the less rare forms, such as MYH9 -related disease (MYH9 -RD), monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) and biallelic BSS, may present platelets that, due to their very large size, are not recognized by the electronic counters, which therefore underestimates not only the platelet count but also the mean platelet volume (MPV) (Balduini et al; Savoia et al; Noris et al). Moreover, instruments operating on different principles also induce variability into the measurement of MPV in healthy subjects or in subjects with non-macrocytic thrombocytopenias, thus making difficult the direct comparison of MPV values obtained in different centres (Latger-Cannard et al).

### Altered platelets' morphological parameters in children with type 1 diabetes-a case-control study [^112CPm6K]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study group

The study group were children with T1DM treated with insulin in the Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Haematology and Diabetology between years 2008–2010. The study was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Lodz and carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written parental consent for participation of their children in the study was obtained. All patients were treated intensively with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSII). Criteria for inclusion were set as: complete blood count and HbA1c measurement performed on the same day, duration of diabetes longer than 6 months and age lower than 18 years. Patients with: known monogenic diabetes, acute complications of diabetes (severe hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis – defined according to International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Guidelines 2014), ongoing infectious disease or children treated with lipid-lowering or non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents were excluded from the study group. Acute infection in the control group was ruled out on the basis on elevated CRP protein (> 5 mg/L) results or elevated leukocyte count (> 11.000/μl). Patients with PLT (platelet counts) higher than 500 or lower than 100 (10 3 /μl) were excluded from the study. In the study group acute complications of diabetes or infection were excluded on the basis of medical records from our Department.

Control group

The control group constituted of non-diabetic, healthy children with blood count results who underwent minor, planned surgical procedures in our hospital in 2008–2010. Patients with infection or comorbidities, which may affect significantly complete blood count parameters, were excluded from the study. The control group was age- and sex-matched to the study group.

Data collection

Platelets morphology parameters e.g. platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) were extracted from routinely performed complete blood count results. The blood counts were performed with Pentra XLR (Horiba ABX Ltd. Warsaw, Poland).

HbA1c measurements were performed with the VARIANT device (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Results of HbA1c measurements were in line with NGSP (National Glycohaemoglobin Standardization Program) guidelines on HbA1c measurement standardization as meeting the DCCT standard.

In the thrombocytosis group and normal platelet count group, MPV, CRP, and LD levels were lower than those in the thrombocytopenia group. Lymphocyte and AT levels were higher. MPV was significantly lower in the thrombocytosis group than in the normal and thrombocytopenia groups. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in neutrophils, lipase or elastase among the three groups.

### Mean platelet volume in preterm infants as a predictor of late-onset neonatal sepsis: a retrospective comparative study [^1162967D]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

The combination of a PLT decrement and a high MPV might be predictive in diagnosing LOS and could be considered for incorporation into clinical practice. As platelet count and MPV are routinely reported in the CBC, they represent a potential low cost and easily available option, further increasing their utility.

Future studies should be conducted for understanding the underlying pathophysiology and the potential clinical applications of these findings.

### Increased mean platelet volume is related to histologic severity of primary biliary cirrhosis [^111SVY9P]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The NLR is a marker that can be calculated easily from routine blood count parameters showing subclinical inflammation and immune response. Low NLR has been shown to be correlated negatively with fibrosis in inactive hepatitis B patients. In contrast, it is shown to be correlated positively with histological activity and fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients. The NLR was not found to be a significant marker for predicting PBC disease severity in our study. NLR can be affected by various factors such as coronary artery disease, smoking, and obesity. As this was a retrospective study, these factors could not be investigated in our PBC patients. Furthermore, NLR might not be specific enough to predict disease severity. As a result, all of these factors might be responsible for our negative results with NLR.

MPV is a routine parameter of full blood count. MPV is closely related to platelet activation and function. MPV has been investigated in various clinical fields, especially cardiovascular and hematological diseases. MPV tends to increase or decrease depending on inflammation severity and disease-specific pathophysiological reasons. MPV generally decreases in diseases with high-grade inflammation, whereas MPV has been proposed to increase in diseases with low-grade inflammation. MPV was also found to decrease significantly in early-stage PBC patients in our study. This implies that there may be significant inflammation in the early stage of the PBC. Prominent destruction of liver architecture and decreased inflammation in late-stage disease might be responsible for increased MPV levels in these patients.

### Platelet count, mean platelet volume, and red cell distribution width as markers for psoriasis severity [^112J9GNn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is growing in prevalence globally. Routinely available options to assess psoriasis severity and progression are limited. More options are needed to monitor disease progression as therapeutic management is based on disease severity.

Objectives

This study evaluates the usage of complete blood count components (CBC) including platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and red cell distribution width (RDW) as hematological markers for assessing psoriasis severity.

Materials and Methods

In this cross-sectional study of 120 patients with psoriasis, disease severity was assessed using the PASI score followed by a blood draw to determine whether correlations existed between each marker and PASI score.

Results

A significant, positive correlation was found between total platelet count and PASI while no such correlation was found in MPV and RDW. When stratifying for age, duration of disease, sex, and body parts involved, we found intriguing relationships and offer potential explanations for their occurrence.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that hematological parameters MPV, platelet count, and RDW found in the CBC are useful in identifying psoriasis severity to some extent. We foresee the use of RDW, MPV, and platelet count biomarkers as a complement to the PASI score in assessing severity for psoriasis patients, while also as a gauge for likelihood of developing comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.

### Utility of mean platelet volume in differentiating intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma [^116kaa87]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although our study observed a new biomarker to distinguish ICC from HCC, some limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings. Firstly, the heterogeneity of selected patients and statistical bias, such as the overfitting of the model, cannot be fully eliminated. Secondly, because many factors (such as comorbidities, lifestyle, drug usage, and physiology) could influence MPV levels, a stricter prospective trial should be designed to confirm the results before the clinical utility of this marker. Lastly, some preanalytical and analytical variables are responsible for the differences in MPV values. The venipuncture procedure, the anticoagulant used for blood collection, the temperature during measurement, different hematological analyzers and measuring methods are the common reasons for the imprecision of MPV evaluation. Standardization of these phases will contribute to a more accurate and reproducible measurement.

### A rise in mean platelet volume during hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia predicts poor prognosis: a retrospective observational cohort study [^112kQAdd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Platelets play an important role in processes of hemostasis, inflammation and immunity. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a routine laboratory test that is measured in complete blood count and considered a marker of platelet function and activation. A single measurement of elevated MPV has been reported to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality in various patient populations. Moreover, MPV is a dynamic parameter that may change significantly within several days or weeks. In a number of studies consisting of patients with critical illness, bacteremia, coronary artery disease and heterogeneous disorders, a rise in MPV over time was identified as a powerful predictor of morbidity and mortality.

Patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are at an increased risk of death in the hospital and following discharge. The prognostic significance of MPV has been reported in only two small studies on CAP patients, which were based on single MPV determinations. The clinical characteristics and prognosis of time-dependent MPV changes have not been investigated in the CAP population. Therefore, we aimed to compare demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic characteristics, as well as short- and long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized for CAP, according to changes in MPV.

### Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean platelet volume (MPV) as early diagnostic markers for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and anemia: a systematic review of clinical evidence and mechanisms [^113N54tF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This systematic review (2018–2023) evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of MCV and MPV in pregnancy-related disorders.

Objectives

Evaluate diagnostic accuracy of MCV/MPV for pregnancy complications.

Methods

PRISMA 2020 review of 36 studies (2018–2023) using automated analyzers.

Results

- MPV > 10.2 fL predicts preeclampsia (78% sensitivity, AUC 0.81). - MCV < 80 fL indicates iron-deficiency anemia (85% specificity). - MPV > 9.8 fL associates with gestational diabetes (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8–3.0). - $0.20/test cost advantage.

Conclusion

These low-cost markers could enhance early detection in resource-limited settings. These hematological markers are associated with up to 60% reduction in diagnostic costs when compared to conventional testing methods, making them viable for LMICs.

### Thrombocytosis in COVID-19 patients without myeloproliferative neoplasms is associated with better prognosis but higher rate of venous thromboembolism [^116pPVQi]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Platelet count associations with clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

A Associations of platelet count (×10 9 /L) on admission with in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation (MV), bacteriemia, venous thromboembolism (VTE), arterial thrombosis and major bleeding. B Overall survival stratified by platelet count on admission.

Above mentioned associations of platelets and MPV with clinical outcomes (with the exception of MPV and MV) remained statistically significant in the multivariate analyses adjusted for platelets, MPV, age, sex, COVID-19 severity, and CCI. Independent prognostic factors and associated adjusted hazard/odds ratios are shown in Supplementary Table S2.

There are several important points that we would like to emphasize. A much smaller proportion of COVID-19 patients presents with thrombocytosis (5%) than with thrombocytopenia (19%). Platelet count seems to be dominantly affected by specific comorbidities and duration of COVID-19 as opposed to its severity on presentation. Patients with higher platelets were more likely to have a longer duration of COVID-19 symptoms, stronger stimulation of myelopoiesis, and different, probably more mature inflammatory profile (higher WBC subsets, CRP and D-dimers but lower ferritin and IL-6). Elevated platelets were accompanied by a more favorable course of the disease, with less need for MV and less deaths. Even among patients with low, normal, and elevated platelets, further subgroups of patients could be stratified over whom a linear trend of improved survival with increasing platelets exists. Mechanisms behind these observations are elusive but could be attributable to the protective role of platelets for the lung parenchyma and more effective viral clearance by a higher number of platelets. Higher platelets were also associated with a lower rate of bacterial sepsis highlighting their important role in the immune system. It is of special interest that the frequency of VTE was significantly higher among COVID-19 patients with higher platelet count. These findings highly resemble phenomena reported in MPN patients with COVID-19 where patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) who presented with higher platelet count in comparison to other MPN subsets were reported to have a higher risk for VTE but favorable disease course. Hence, our data suggest that these observations might not be MPN-specific and could represent biological phenomena present in patients with non-clonally elevated platelet count as well. Arterial thromboses had no association with platelet count but were significantly associated with higher platelet volume. Similar to platelets, MPV reflected the need for MV and survival in univariate analyses. Associations of lower platelets and higher MPV with shorter survival seem to be independent of each other and of older age, male sex, more severe COVID-19, and higher comorbidity burden. Nevertheless, an association of MPV with MV was diminished after adjustments for platelet count and severity of COVID-19, probably due to baseline correlations with these parameters. Higher MPV might represent an influx of younger platelets due to their increased consumption and a higher degree of platelet activation due to inflammatory COVID-19 milieu.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^115gAJwa]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

The most frequent forms of inherited thrombocytopenia (IT) are characterized by platelet size abnormalities and it has been suggested that this parameter is useful for their differentiation from immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Recently, a monocentric study identified cut-off values for mean platelet volume (MPV) and mean platelet diameter (MPD) with good diagnostic accuracy in this respect. To validate these cut-off values in a different and larger case series of patients, we enrolled 130 subjects with ITP and 113 with IT in six different centres. The platelet count and MPV was each measured by the instrument routinely used in each institution. In some centres, platelet count was also measured by optical microscopy. MPD was evaluated centrally by image analysis of peripheral blood films. The previously identified cut-off value for MPV had 91% specificity in distinguishing ITP from inherited macrothrombocytopenias (mono and biallelic Bernard-Soulier, MYH9-related disease), while its sensitivity was greatly variable depending on the instrument used. With an appropriate instrument, specificity was 83%. The diagnostic accuracy of MPD was lower than that obtained with MPV. We concluded that MPV is a useful parameter for differentiating ITP from IT provided that it is measured by appropriate cell counters.

### Genetic platelet depletion is superior in platelet transfusion compared to current models [^115XnxEd]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

However, MPV was slightly but significantly increased, adding to the contradictory discussion in the literature. While some studies failed to observe a difference during depletion, we, like others, detected an increase of MPV during the thrombocytopenic phase. We hypothesize that the few "remaining" platelets were freshly produced by megakaryocytes that were not yet eliminated. These young platelets are reported to have a higher MPVand are therefore thought to be more reactive. Clinically, MPV distinguishes between different etiologies of thrombocytopenia. Thus, it may be a more sensitive biomarker than platelet count in a variety of disorders, yet it is discussed controversially for different diseases. MPV is higher in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), compared to those with non-cardiac chest pain, associates with poor prognosis after ACSand closely correlates with arterial stiffness. However, diagnosis of coronary artery disease does not associate with MPV. Further, viruses can alter MPV in both directions, depending on the virus species, and a high MPV can be used to differentiate between gastric ulcer and gastric cancer.

### Increased mean platelet volume is related to histologic severity of primary biliary cirrhosis [^111MLB4J]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Our study showed that MPV could be a new cheap and easily obtained marker for the determination of PBC severity without liver biopsy. Treatment and follow-up of patients can be optimized when disease severity could be estimated. In terms of MPV cut-off levels, patients with low MPV levels can be treated with effective ursodeoxycholic acid dosing, whereas patients with high MPV can be referred to variceal and hepatocellular carcinoma screening. We believe that our findings need to be confirmed with larger scale prospective studies.

### Complete blood count alterations after six months of continuous positive airway pressure treatment in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea [^116rvykZ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The cardiovascular complications caused by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) decrease after continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP). Mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and red cell distribution width (RDW) are newly recognized tools for assessing cardiovascular risk.

Methods

From a selection of patients with symptoms of nocturnal snoring and/or excessive daytime sleepiness, 36 males with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 30/h and 22 age-matched normal male controls with AHI < 5/h were included. Patients with OSA underwent another night of CPAP titration, and 11 patients were excluded at the 6-month evaluation due to poor compliance with the home CPAP therapy. Complete blood count parameters of compliant patients and the control group were evaluated.

Results

Compared to controls, MPV values were significantly higher (p = 0.025) in OSA patients, but no significant differences in PDW or RDW were found (p > 0.05). Six months of CPAP therapy resulted in significantly lower MPV values but increased values of PDW and RDW in patients with severe OSA (p = 0.001, p = 0.007, p = 0.001, respectively).

Conclusion

Our data suggest that complete blood count parameters in OSA patients such as MPV, PDW and RDW change significantly after CPAP therapy.

### Mean platelet volume in preterm infants as a predictor of late-onset neonatal sepsis: a retrospective comparative study [^116iyAWk]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Background

Neonatal sepsis remains a primary cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns. Rapid and accurate diagnosis poses a significant challenge-the non-specific clinical presentation of neonatal sepsis relies heavily on various laboratory indices for early detection and subsequent management. One such indicator under investigation is the mean platelet volume (MPV), which may serve as a predictive marker. This study aims to evaluate the association between the MPV and late-onset sepsis in preterm infants.

Methods

This retrospective study included 63 newborns born at Sheba Medical Center from 2016 to 2020 with late-onset sepsis as evidenced by positive blood cultures, and 63 newborns in the control group. We analysed blood count data at three intervals: preinfection, intrainfection and postinfection. Electronic medical records provided supplemental data. Each septic neonate was paired with a non-septic control.

Results

Our results revealed a significant elevation of MPV in septic newborns compared with non-septic controls during the days prior to the infection (9.323 and 8.876, respectively, p = 0.043) and persisted up to 2 weeks postinfection (9.39 vs 8.714, p = 0.025). The MPV and the MPV-to-total platelet (PLT) count ratio exhibited significant predictive capabilities in receiver operating characteristics analysis (-0.60 and -0.57, respectively).

Conclusions

High MPV in combination with PLT decrement might be predictive for the diagnosis of late-onset sepsis. Future studies should be conducted in order to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and the potential clinical applications of these findings.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^114AKt1p]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Admission platelet count and indices as predictors of outcome in children with severe sepsis: a prospective hospital-based study [^115BHjyB]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Meanwhile, the non-survivors had significantly larger MPV than the survivors. This situation may be caused by production of many cytokines, endothelial damage, and bone marrow suppression in septic patients. A study by Margetic, in 2012 showed that MPV acts as an acute phase reactant in different inflammatory conditions, they stated that high MPV levels were associated with high-grade inflammation owing to the presence of large platelets in circulation. Two prospective studies demonstrated significant correlations between increased MPV and short-term mortality. Also, a study by Tajarernmuang et al. in 2016, on adults, revealed that the gradual increase in MPV after a few days of admission was associated with increased hospital mortality. An elevation of MPV suggests that the infection is invasive and uncontrolled and is related to the severity of the disease, a finding which was verified in our study, and may be useful as an assessment tool for outcome prognosis.

Furthermore, a study by Sezgi et al. in 2015 showed that in patients with sepsis the MPV level was increasing during the course of the disease in non-survivors, while it was found to be decreasing in the surviving group.

In our study PDW increased in non-survivors than survivors, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. The PDW is increased when there is an increase in number and size of platelet pseudopodia. Platelet activation causes morphologic changes of platelets, including both spherical shape and pseudopodia formation. Platelets with increased number and size of pseudopodia differ in size, which affects PDW. In a previous study, PDW was significantly higher in patients with asserted platelet activation compared with healthy persons.

Platelet ratios calculated in this study, MPV/PLT, MPV/PCT, PDW/PLT, PDW/PCT, were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors. This is in accordance with a previous study in 2016 by Golwala et al. who found these ratios to be predictors of mortality in children.

### Platelet-white cell ratio is more strongly associated with mortality than other common risk ratios derived from complete blood counts [^112LcGGW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The complete blood count is a cornerstone of modern clinical evaluationand has been shown in many studies to have surprising and unexplained associations with adverse outcomes particularly in acute inflammatory states –, but this prognostic information is often unfamiliar to physicians and represents unrealized clinical value. Based on analysis of patient cohorts at three different clinical sites, this study identifies PWR as a convenient summary of patient inflammatory state in rapidly changing acute care settings.

Infection, ischemia, and trauma all trigger inflammatory responses that mobilize WBC and consume PLT with feedback to WBC and PLT proliferation rates. Healthy individuals mount an effective response, and their WBC and PLT populations tend to recover along a universal WBC-PLT trajectory. PWR provides a single marker encapsulation of these dynamics, reducing this WBC-PLT trajectory to one dimension, with abnormally low PWR reflecting failure of PLT recovery, persistent WBC elevation, or both. Low PWR may reflect dysregulation between PLT and WBC populations analogous to the way elevated RDW can reflect perturbations to red cell homeostasis and provide prognostic information on short-term risk –. The consistency of these changes across heterogeneous acute inflammatory settingssuggests that PWR may succinctly quantify key aspects of inflammatory regulation and recovery, and that PWR changes may occur as part of, or in tandem with a normal inflammatory response and recovery. Other non-inflammatory processes that alter WBC or PLT will also influence PWR and may limit its prognostic utility in inflammatory states. The consistency of PWR's stronger association with short-term mortality compared to other CBC-derived markers in 4 heterogenous study cohorts across two medical centers and in a general surgical cohort from a third independent medical center supports the prior finding of universal WBC-PLT dynamics during recovery from acute inflammatory stimuli. This mechanistic explanation, for the associated prognostic signal may facilitate clinical utilization.

### Platelet size distinguishes between inherited macrothrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia [^112qFkEF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Distinguishing inherited thrombocytopenias from immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can be difficult, and patients are therefore at risk of misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatments. Although it is known that the most common inherited forms of thrombocytopenia are characterized by increased platelet size, the diagnostic power of this feature has never been investigated.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that platelet size can be used to differentiate ITP from inherited macrothrombocytopenias.

Patients/Methods

We measured mean platelet volume (MPV) and mean platelet diameter (MPD), within 2 h of blood sampling, in 35 patients with inherited macrothrombocytopenias [15 MYH9-related disease (MYH9-RD), three biallelic and 17 monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS)], and 56 with ITP. Using receiving operating characteristic analysis, we searched for the best cut-off values to differentiate between these conditions.

Results

As expected, platelets were larger in inherited macrothrombocytopenias than in ITP. An MPD larger than 3.3 mum differentiated MYH9-RD and BSS from ITP with 0.89 sensitivity and 0.88 specificity, and an MPV larger than 12.4 fL had 0.83 sensitivity and 0.89 specificity. Combining MPD with MPV increased sensitivity and specificity to 0.97 and 0.89, respectively.

Conclusion

Platelet size evaluation by both an appropriate cell counter and blood film examination is useful for differentiating inherited macrothrombocytopenias from ITP.

### Mean platelet volume may predict early clinical outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting [^114oSxfA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that the MPV level is evaluated for the adverse outcomes after CABG. The current data show a clear association of preoperative MPV and hematocrit levels with post-CABG adverse events. The prognostic value of these measures is independent of other well-defined individual risk factors. In contrast, neither the N/L ratio nor the WBC count including differential leukocyte count demonstrated a significant relation with post-CABG adverse events. The MPV level along with hematocrit levels, which are readily available, may play a role in risk stratification for patients undergoing CABG. However, it is not clear if these measures have a direct contribution to outcomes, so further investigations are required to explain the underlying mechanisms.

### A simple technique to determine thrombopoiesis level using immature platelet fraction (IPF) [^1153k5ix]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Immature platelet fraction (IPF) has been measured by fully automated analyzer (XE-2100) as reticulated platelet (RP) which is reflected with thrombopoiesis in bone marrow. IPF value in the healthy volunteers was 3.3% (1.0–10.3) and upper 95% confidential interval (95% CI) of IPF was determined as 7.7%. IPF was significantly high in the patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; 17.4%, 1.2–53.2%) and recovery phase of post-chemotherapy, and significantly low in nadir phase of post-chemotherapy, and within normal range in the patients with ITP in complete remission (CR) and with aplastic anemia (AA). Total count of IPF was significantly low in patients with ITP, AA or post-chemotherapy. Mean platelet volume (MPV) was significantly high in only patients with ITP. IPF 7.7% is best point for highest sensitivity (86.8%) and specificity (92.6%) in diagnosis of ITP and recovery phase of post-chemotherapy. In receiver operating characteristic curve for diagnosis of ITP and recovery phase of post-chemotherapy, IPF was significantly more useful than MPV. These results show that IPF reflects the pathology of thrombocytopenic disorders, and that measurement of IPF is useful for the differential diagnosis and analysis of platelet kinetics.

### Abnormal platelet parameters in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158e7WH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

PDW directly measures variability in platelet size, varies with platelet activity, and mirrors the heterogeneity in platelet morphology. Under physiological conditions, a direct correlation exists between MPV and PDW, with both typically changing in the same direction. In our study, we found no statistical difference between the PDW levels in IBD patients and healthy people, but PDW levels in the active group were significantly lower than those in the normal control. Similar to our findings, previous studies have also found that patients with active IBD have significantly lower PDW levels than healthy controls. Moreover, patients with active IBD were found to have significantly lower PDW levels than those in remission. PCT is a measurement method derived from PLT and MPV, and is numerically equal to the product of the two indicators. In the present study, PCT levels were significantly higher in the IBD population than in the healthy control group. Several other studies have also shown that PCT is significantly higher in IBD populations, with PCT demonstrating a significant association with ESR and white blood cell count. It was also revealed that PDW was positively and PCT was negatively correlated with disease activity in UC. In a diagnostic study by Galijašević M. et al. the AUROC for the differentiation of UC and CD activity by PDW was 0.722 and 0.798, respectively, indicating fair diagnostic accuracy. However, this accuracy was surpassed by PCT, whose AUROC for the differentiation of UC and CD activity was 0.731 and 0.891, respectively. Tang J. et al.'s study demonstrated that PCT emerged as the most effective index for monitoring disease activity in CD patients with high-sensitivity CRP levels lower than 10.0 mg/L (sensitivity 71%, specificity 85%, AUROC 0.77). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that PDW and PCT were often underestimated, and the number of studies conducted on these platelet parameters was far less than those on PLT and MPV.

Data collection

At the baseline visit in the weeks 6–12 of gestation, data on maternal demographics (age, BMI, relationship to the father, education level, occupation), lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, substance use), medical history (diabetes, hypertension), reproductive history (infertility, use of assisted reproductive techniques), and obstetric history (gravidity, parity, miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, GDM, preeclampsia) were collected by ten trained interviewers using standardized checklists during structured interviews. Additionally, maternal blood samples were collected and analyzed in a centralized laboratory (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) for the following variables: complete blood count (CBC) parameters including hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil to WBC ratio, lymphocyte to WBC ratio, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and biochemistry parameters including fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, vitamin D 3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

### Increased mean platelet volume is related to histologic severity of primary biliary cirrhosis [^115V3hpk]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating MPV in PBC patients. This study shows that MPV can be a simple and efficient parameter to discriminate early-stage and late-stage disease. In patients with PBC, MPV can be as effective as liver biopsy in predicting prognosis and evaluating response to the treatment. Also, RDW, RPR, and NLR, which are parameters proposed to indicate fibrosis, have been first evaluated in PBC patients in this study.

PBC is a rare autoimmune liver disease mainly affecting females characterized by immune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. Disease is usually slowly progressive and asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients, pruritus and fatigue generally predominate. Signs of decompensated liver cirrhosis can be seen in late-stage disease. Cholestatic-type liver enzyme elevation, mainly elevation of ALP and AMA positivity, is generally enough for diagnosis. Liver biopsy is generally performed in AMA-negative cases or if there is a suspicion of liver disease other than PBC. Nonetheless, liver histology is very useful in predicting disease prognosis. Information on the histological stage of the disease can help in predicting the response to the treatment. Patients with early-stage disease generally show good clinical and biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. Being invasive, histological staging is not usually used despite the fact that it is very important in predicting the prognosis and response to the treatment.

Routine hematological and biochemical parameters are easy to obtain, and inexpensive and noninvasive tools presenting an attractive alternative to determine the clinical and histological severity of the disease. There are several studies comparing hematological and biochemical parameters with histological stages in patients with chronic liver disease, especially in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C. In contrast, studies investigating the role of noninvasive markers in predicting the stage of PBC are limited.

Recently, routine blood count parameters such as RDW, RPR, NLR, and determination of their ratios have gained popularity in predicting the degree of liver fibrosis. Elevated RDW and RPR levels have been reported to be predictors of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B patients. However, factors that increase RDW and RPR levels such as iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency were not evaluated in this study. In our study, no significant decrease was detected in terms of RDW and RPR levels between PBC histological stages.

### Abnormal platelet parameters in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SkgaN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals that individuals with IBD exhibit significantly elevated PLT and PCT, alongside a significant decrease in MPV compared to healthy individuals. Moreover, PDW demonstrates a significant reduction only in patients with active IBD compared to those in a healthy state. The platelet parameters can offer reliable insights for assessing the severity of IBD and understanding potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Monitoring the clinical manifestations of platelet abnormalities serves as a valuable means to obtain diagnostic and prognostic information. Conversely, proactive measures should be taken to prevent the consequences of platelet abnormalities in individuals with IBD. Furthermore, there is a pressing requirement for more rigorous clinical trials to establish diagnostic criteria and advance the clinical evaluation of IBD at the platelet parameters level.

### A rise in mean platelet volume during hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia predicts poor prognosis: a retrospective observational cohort study [^112gxXkN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Rising MPV during hospitalization for CAP is associated with more severe clinical and laboratory characteristics than no rise in MPV. Rising MPV is a powerful predictor of in-hospital and long-term mortality. We suggest that repeated MPV determinations throughout hospitalization may improve risk stratification for CAP patients.

### Increased mean platelet volume is related to histologic severity of primary biliary cirrhosis [^113cZpqW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study population

This was a retrospective case–control study evaluating patients with PBC. Sixty-three patients were diagnosed with PBC during the aforementioned period. A total of 23 patients without liver biopsies and one patient whose MPV values could not be measured in the complete blood count were excluded from the study. As a result, 39 patients with biopsy-proven and untreated PBC at the time of liver biopsy were included in the final analyses.

Laboratory assessment

The following data were obtained retrospectively from the computerized patient registry database and personal patient files: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase, ALP, total bilirubin, white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin, red cell distribution width (RDW), MPV, and AMA. The AST platelet ratio index (APRI) was obtained by dividing serum AST levels into serum platelet levels, whereas the RDW platelet ratio (RPR) was obtained by dividing serum RDW levels into serum platelet levels. Finally, the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was obtained by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute serum lymphocyte count. Laboratory values closest to the date of liver biopsy were chosen for analyses.

Histological assessment

Histological evaluation was performed on the basis of the staging system defined by Scheuer. Disease stage can be categorized into four stages according to this histologic staging system. Florid duct lesions are seen in stage 1, ductular proliferation in stage 2, scarring in stage 3, and finally cirrhosis in stage 4. The cases were divided into two groups as early stage (Scheuer's stage 1 and 2) and late stage (Scheuer's stage 3 and 4) of PBC.

Statistical analysis

Preliminary analyses were completed for frequencies, means, SEs, and percentages where applicable. Categorical variables were analyzed using the χ 2 -test. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U -test. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off value of MPV to identify sensitivity and specificity for the detection of PBC stage. Statistical significance was set at P less than 0.05 for all analyses. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA).

### Revisiting the full blood count: circulating blood cells and their role in coagulation [^113Lw5Eg]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

There has been an expansion in our understanding of the multifaceted roles of circulating blood cells in regulating haemostasis and contributing to thrombosis. Notably, there is greater recognition of the interplay between coagulation with inflammation and innate immune activation and the contribution of leucocytes. The full blood count (FBC) is a time-honoured test in medicine; however, its components are often viewed in isolation and without consideration of their haemostatic and thrombotic potential. Here, we review how the individual components of the FBC, that is, haemoglobin, platelets and leucocytes, engage with the haemostatic system and focus on both their quantitative and qualitative attributes. We also explore how this information can be harnessed into better management of people with multiple long-term conditions because of their higher risk of adverse clinical events.

### Masked polycythemia vera (mPV): results of an international study [^112xdhxz]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

We examined the baseline features and clinical outcomes of 140 patients presenting with JAK2V617F positivity and a bone marrow morphology conforming with WHO criteria of polycythemia vera (PV), but a hemoglobin level of < 18.5 g/dL in males (range 16.0–18.4) and < 16.5 g/dL in females (range 15.0–16.4). This cohort operationally referred to as masked PV (mPV) was compared with 257 patients with overt PV and displayed male predominance, a more frequent history of arterial thrombosis and thrombocytosis. Incidence of thrombosis was similar between the two groups but mPV displayed significantly higher rates of progression to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia and inferior survival. In multivariable analysis mPV diagnosis was an independent predictor of poor survival along with age > 65 years and leukocyte count > 10 × 10(9) /L. Our data suggest that mPV is a heterogeneous myeloproliferative neoplasia and not necessarily an early/ pre-polycythemic form of classical PV that at onset in a small fraction of patients clinically may mimic essential thrombocythemia. On the other hand, the majority mPV may have a longer prodrome of undiagnosed PV or a disease biology akin to primary myelofibrosis-post PV myelofibrosis that could explain the worsening of outcome in comparison to overt/classical manifestations.

### Mean platelet volume and red cell distribution width to platelet ratio for predicting the severity of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111qhsfQ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We designed this study to investigate the relationship between the severity of fibrosis and mean platelet volume (MPV), red cell distribution width, and red cell distribution width to platelet ratio (RPR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).

Design

Overall, 98 biopsy-proven naïve CHC cases were enrolled in the study. Complete blood count variables, including white blood cell, hemoglobin, platelet count, MPV, red cell distribution width, platelet distribution width as well as aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, albumin, and other routine biochemical parameters, were tested. Liver biopsy samples were assessed according to the Ishak scoring system. Data analyses were carried out using SPSS-15 software. Statistical significance was set at a P-value of less than 0.05.

Results

Of the 98 cases, 80 (81.6%) were men and 18 (18.4%) were women. Fibrosis scores of 69 cases (70.4%) (group 1) were less than 3, whereas 29 cases had fibrosis scores at least 3 (29.6%) (group 2). Significant differences in MPV and RPR were observed between these two groups (MPV: 8.19 ± 1.002 vs. 8.63 ± 0.67fl, P < 0.05; RPR: 0.0526 ± 0.02 vs. 0.0726 ± 0.02, P = 0.001). The areas under the curve of the RPR and MPV for predicting significant fibrosis were 0.705 and 0.670, which was superior to the aspartate transaminase-to-alanine transaminase ratio and aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index scores of the study group. Cut-off values were calculated for diagnostic performance, and the cut-off values for MPV and RPR were 8.5 and 0.07fl, respectively.

Conclusion

MPV and RPR values were significantly higher in patients with CHC, associated with severity, and can be used to predict advanced histological liver damage. The use of MPV and RPR may reduce the need for liver biopsy. Further studies are required to determine the relationship between these parameters and the severity of fibrosis in hepatitis C patients.

### Longitudinal study of platelet size changes in gestation and predictive power of elevated MPV in development of pre-eclampsia [^113Jun36]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this cohort is to investigate whether any haematologic changes detectable by simple complete blood count (CBC) precede pre-eclampsia development and the diagnostic value of these markers in clinical practice for prediction of pre-eclampsia.

Methods

All pregnant women, in the first trimester, attending to GATA Haydarpasa Teaching Hospital Obstetric Outpatient Clinic for routine obstetric care were enrolled. Routine obstetric care consisted of monthly visits until 32nd week, bimonthly visits between 32nd and 36th week, and weekly thereafter. According to the study, protocol CBC was taken from women at each visit and recorded. After delivery, outcome data were obtained.

Results

A total of 1336 women were included into the statistical analysis and 107 (8%) of them developed pre-eclampsia. Parameters of CBC were similar between groups other than mean platelet volume (MPV) values. MPV values of pre-eclamptic women were significantly higher than normotensive counterparts from 24th gestational week up to gestational week at birth. In pre-eclamptic group, mean gestational age of diagnosis was 33.8 weeks and significant MPV increase was detected to precede the diagnosis by approximately 4.6 weeks (range 2.8–5.9 weeks).

Conclusions

Our study provides evidence that MPV gradually increases in pregnant women affected by pre-eclampsia compared to women with normal pregnancies.

### Challenges in interpreting mendelian randomization studies with a disease as the exposure: using COVID-19 liability studies as an exemplar [^111RENV8]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Examples of correct interpretation, incorrect interpretation, and inconsistent interpretation

We noticed there were substantial variations in how these associations were described and interpreted. Even amongst studies which correctly mentioned any observed associations were reflection of genetic liability to COVID-19 (e.g. "… host genetic liability to severe covid-19 was causally associated with increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and reduced platelet count"(page 4735)), certain studies interpreted the findings incorrectly, such as attributing the lack of association as absence of evidence for an effect of COVID-19 in the diseases concerned (e.g. "Similarly, contrary to one study, we found no evidence of COVID-19 influencing risk of psychiatric disorders"(page 8)), where some of the excerpts from these studies were listed in the textbox for illustrative purposes (Textbox 1). –

### Is elevated mean platelet volume associated with a worse outcome in patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular events? [^114iuhJT]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Increased mean platelet volume (MPV), indicating higher platelet reactivity, is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Higher levels of MPV have been found in patients with acute ischemic stroke than in control subjects. Data from smaller studies regarding an association between MPV and stroke severity and outcome have been controversial. If such an association exists, MPV might help to identify patients at increased risk of a severe course of acute cerebrovascular disease.

Methods

Within a multicenter, cross-sectional study nested in a cohort, we analyzed the relation between MPV and stroke severity as determined by the modified Rankin Scale after 1 week in 776 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. By multivariate logistic regression modeling, we determined the influence of MPV on stroke severity, adjusting for potential confounding factors.

Results

Patients within the highest quintile of MPV had a significantly higher risk of suffering a severe stroke, defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 3 to 6, compared with patients within the lowest quintile (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.1; P < 0.001). This association remained significant after adjustment for possible confounding factors (odds ratio = 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 4.0; P = 0.013).

Conclusions

Our results indicate that an elevated MPV is associated with a worse outcome for acute ischemic cerebrovascular events independent of other clinical parameters.

### Normal range of mean platelet volume in healthy subjects: insight from a large epidemiologic study [^111Qexay]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Mean platelet volume (MPV) in the healthy population has not been studied before. Therefore, the aim of the study was to measure MPV in normal subjects in a large cohort of Turkish adults.

Methods

A total of 2298 subjects with a mean age of 50 (age range 18 to 92) were interviewed. Subjects who had smoking habit, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, chronic use of any drugs including antiplatelets, heavy drinkers, metabolic syndrome, ejection fraction < 55%, creatinine > 1.4 in men and > 1.1 in women, abnormal liver function tests and an abnormal TSH were excluded in a in a stepwise manner. Complete blood counts were done on the same day within 6 hours by a CELL-DYN 3700 SL analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics).

Results

Three hundred twenty-six participants (204 females (63%) and 122 males (37%) with a mean age of 41 ± 16) constituted the final healthy cohort. Mean MPV of the cohort was 8.9 ± 1.4 fL. There was no significant difference among age groups regarding MPV.

Conclusion

Ninety-five percent of the individuals had a MPV between 7.2 and 11.7 fL. A patient having a MPV beyond this range should be evaluated carefully especially for occlusive arterial diseases.

### Platelet-white cell ratio is more strongly associated with mortality than other common risk ratios derived from complete blood counts [^1166TD7J]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Complete blood count (CBC) indices and their ratios, including neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), are widely reported to have significant associations with adverse clinical outcomes in many acutely ill cohorts –. These markers have been studied in diverse clinical settings for their potential to inform diagnosis and prognosis –, assist with triage, and guide treatment decisions. The pathophysiologic mechanisms generating these associations in diverse disease settings are not fully understood, and this mechanistic uncertainty may contribute to reduced clinical utilization of these markers. Recent work has identified co-regulation of white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) populations as a feature of healthy inflammatory recoverythat is preserved across heterogeneous pathologic processes including different types of trauma, ischemia, and infection. Favorable inflammatory recoveries are defined by exponential WBC decrease followed by linear PLT increase. This finding provides a potential unifying mechanism for CBC ratio associations with mortality across the diversity of acute inflammatory disease settings.

If a universal WBC-PLT inflammatory recovery trajectory helps generate the widely observed associations between CBC index ratios and clinical outcomes, then a ratio specifically designed with this trajectory in mind, PLT/WBC (PWR), should reliably increase during successful inflammatory recoveries and be at least as strongly associated with clinical outcomes as other ratios that do not as directly reflect these WBC-PLT recovery dynamics. Thus, we hypothesized that PWR would provide significant risk stratification in inflammatory settings by reducing the WBC-PLT trajectory to one dimension, with low PWR reflecting failure of PLT recovery, or persistent WBC elevation, or both. However, PWR has not been studied systematically in contrast to NLR, PLR, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and other CBC-derived statistics.

Here, we show that PWR provides stronger stratification of mortality risk than other CBC markers and ratios in the setting of four different diseases involving acute inflammation: COVID-19, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We validate these findings in a cohort from an independent medical center. Our results are consistent with recently identified inflammatory dynamicsand suggest that PWR may provide a convenient and interpretable summary of patient inflammatory state.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1112wTtN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Acute Myeloid Leukemia — post-remission therapy monitoring includes CBC and platelets 2 times per week during chemotherapy; chemistry profile and electrolytes daily during chemotherapy; outpatient monitoring post chemotherapy with CBC, platelets, differential, and electrolytes 2–3 times per week until recovery; BM aspirate/biopsy only if peripheral blood counts are abnormal or if counts have not recovered within 5 weeks; and patients with AML with high-risk features, including poor-prognosis cytogenetics, therapy-related AML, prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or possibly 2 or more inductions to achieve a complete remission (CR), are at increased risk for relapse and should be considered for early alternate donor search.

### Automated blood cell counts: state of the art [^115MT3GP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The CBC count and leukocyte differential count (LDC) are among the most frequently requested clinical laboratory tests. These analyses are highly automated, and the correct interpretation of results requires extensive knowledge of the analytic performance of the instruments and the clinical significance of the results they provide. In this review, we analyze the state of the art regarding traditional and new parameters with emphasis on clinical applications and analytic quality. The problems of some traditional parameters of the CBC count, such as platelet counts, some components of the LDC such as monocyte and basophil counts, and other commonly used indices such as red cell volume distribution width and platelet indices such as mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are considered. The new parameters, evaluated from analytic and clinical viewpoints, are the available components of the extended differential count (hematopoietic progenitor cells, immature granulocytes, and erythroblasts), the immature reticulocyte fraction, the reticulocyte indices, the fragmented RBCs, and the immature platelet fraction.

### Predictors of serious bacterial infections using serum biomarkers in an infant population aged 0 to 90 days: a prospective cohort study [^116woSjx]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

We obtained demographic data, clinical history and physical examination, laboratory investigations including complete blood count, CRP, PCT, blood cultures, urine cultures and lumbar puncture investigation results from the electronic medical records. The complete blood count was determined using an automated haematology analyser (Sysmex XN-1000 and XN-3000, Kobe, Japan). Total white cell count with differential count was measured using flow cytometry method, while platelet count was determined using impedance method. CRP measurement was performed using a quantitative immunoturbidimetric assay (Alinity c analyser, Abbott Laboratories, Italy). From the complete blood count, we retrieved data including WBC and platelet count, ANC, absolute lymphocyte count and MPV. NLR was calculated as the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes, PLR as the ratio of platelets to lymphocytes and MPV/PC as the ratio of MPV to platelet count.

Statistical analysis

All data were entered into a Microsoft Excel database. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, V.26 and SAS software, V.9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). At baseline, categorical variables were summarised as counts and percentages (%), and continuous variables as mean and SD or median and IQR. Continuous variables were assessed for normality using q-q plots and histograms. After applying a normalising log transformation on variables with right-skewed distributions, the normality assumption was found to be tenable. Statistical comparisons between groups on normal and normalised variables were performed using a two sample t-test. In addition, variables with right-skewed distributions were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test.

We performed a univariate analysis for each potential predictor and presented these using unadjusted OR estimates, with 95% CIs. In the multivariable analyses, we studied the performance of the specific variables of interest that were statistically significant on univariate analysis (complete blood count indices WBC, ANC and NLR) and adjusted for age of the infant, gender and duration of fever before presentation. We derived predictive models with and without CRP to address the primary aim of the paper. Adjusted OR (aOR) were presented with their corresponding 95% CIs and statistical significance was taken at p < 0.05. We presented discriminative ability using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analyses and optimal cut-off values were calculated using the Youden's index (sensitivity+specificity −1). We compared the area under the ROC curves for significant differences, using DeLong's method.

### Mean platelet volume in acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111EssTJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our results suggest that MPV is lower at the onset of AP than at remission of the disease, independently of the disease severity. As MPV constitutes an inexpensive and undemanding marker, it would be reasonable to further investigate its potential prognostic value. Therefore, further specially designed clinical evaluations would be needed to assess the clinical usefulness of MPV in everyday clinical practice.

Summary Box

What is already known:

- A higher activated platelet ratio has been observed at the onset of acute pancreatitis (AP)
- Greater platelet adhesiveness and aggregation has been documented in the early stages of AP
- Studies have reported statistically significant differences in mean platelet volume (MPV) between the onset and remission of AP

What the new findings are:

- MPV is smaller at the onset of AP
- MPV is independent of the severity of AP
- MPV, an inexpensive and undemanding marker, deserve further investigation of its potential prognostic value in AP

### Platelets in pediatric and neonatal sepsis: novel mediators of the inflammatory cascade [^117Kr8sC]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Platelet indices and paediatric sepsis

Several platelet indices have been utilised as non-specific means of both prognostication and diagnosis in paediatric sepsis. Thrombocytopenia is a well-recognised component of both neonatal sepsis and severe paediatric sepsis.– Thrombocytosis is a rarer finding in the septic child, and may represent a rebound phenomenon following a period of relative thrombocytopenia. Metrics such as platelet distribution width (PDW), which describes the range in platelet size, and mean platelet volume (MPV), the measure of average platelet size, have been used to predict outcomes in paediatric and neonatal sepsis. Changes in these parameters during sepsis offer a crude insight into the multiple roles played by platelets in sepsis pathophysiology (Fig. 1).

### Complete blood count and derived indices: evolution pattern and prognostic value in adult burned patients [^116WUoDY]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Certain parameters of complete blood count (CBC) such as red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean platelet volume, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and RDW-to-platelet ratio (RPR) have been associated with inflammatory status and outcome in diverse medical conditions. The aim of this study was to describe the evolution pattern of these parameters in adult burned patients. Adult burned patients admitted to the National Burn Center in Uruguay between May 2017 and February 2018 (discovery cohort) and between March 2018 and August 2019 (validation cohort) were included. Patients' characteristics and outcomes were recorded, as well as CBC parameters on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after thermal injury. Eighty-eight patients were included in the discovery cohort. Total body surface area burned was 14 [7–23]% and mortality was 15%. Nonsurvivors presented higher RDW and mean platelet volume (P < .01). NLR decreased after admission in all patients (P < .01), but was higher in nonsurvivors (P < .01). Deceased patients also presented higher RPR on days 3, 5, and 7 (P < .001). On the contrary, PLR was reduced in nonsurvivors (P < .05). There was a significant correlation between NLR on admission and burn extension and severity. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that NLR, PLR, and RPR could identify patients with increased mortality. These findings were confirmed in the validation cohort (n = 95). Basic CBC parameters and derived indices could be useful as biomarkers to determine prognosis in adults with thermal injuries.

### Mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, and platelet count, in connection with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and essential thrombocytopenia [^115H7WLX]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the kinetic characteristics of platelet (PLT) destruction and thrombopoiesis by using mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW).

Methods

Using the ADVIA2120i instrument, we measured PLT counts, MPV, and PDW in 153 healthy individuals, 35 patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and 48 patients with essential thrombocytopenia (ET).

Results

In the ITP group, the MPV and PDW were higher than those values in healthy individuals. In the ET group, the MPV was lower than in the ITP group and in healthy individuals, and the PDW was lower than in the ITP group. When the ITP group was subdivided (PLT counts < 45 × 103/µL vs ≥ 45 × 103/µL), the MPV and PDW tended to be higher in patients with PLT counts less than 45 × 103 per µL. When patients with ET were subdivided (PLT counts < 770 × 103/µL vs ≥ 770 × 103/µL), the MPV and PDW were lower in patients with PLT count of 770 or greater × 103 per µL.

Conclusions

In ITP, the overall PLT composition varies, and PLT sequestration is nondiscriminatory. In ET, PLTs quickly shrink and remain small, resulting in a high proportion of small-sized PLTs.

### Cross-sectional association between blood cell phenotypes, cognitive function, and brain imaging measures in the community-based framingham heart study [^116vshUx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral inflammation is associated with increased risk for dementia. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV), are easily measured circulating blood cell phenotypes reflecting chronic peripheral inflammation, but their association with dementia status is unclear.

Objective

We sought to investigate the cross-sectional association of these inflammatory measures with neuropsychological (NP) test performance, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring, Third-generation, and Omni cohorts.

Methods

We identified FHS participants who attended an exam that included a complete blood cell count (CBC) and underwent NP testing (n = 3,396) or brain MRI (n = 2,770) within five years of blood draw. We investigated the association between NLR, RDW, and MPV and NP test performance and structural MRI-derived volumetric measurements using linear mixed effect models accounting for family relationships and adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

Participants were on average 60 years old, 53% female, and about 80% attended some college. Higher NLR was significantly associated with poorer performance on visual memory, and visuospatial abilities, as well as with larger white matter hyperintensity volume. We also observed associations for higher RDW with poorer executive function and smaller total cerebral brain volume.

Conclusion

Chronic peripheral inflammation as measured by NLR and RDW was associated with worse cognitive function, reduced brain volume, and greater microvascular disease in FHS participants. If confirmed in other samples, CBC may provide informative and cost-effective biomarkers of abnormal brain aging in the community.

### Evaluating the efficacy of LDH and inflammatory indices in discriminating neonatal respiratory distress syndrome from transient tachypnea of the newborns [^1169jVHX]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory evaluation

Blood samples were collected at admission time within 24 h postpartum. Four mL of venous blood was collected under complete aseptic conditions; 2 mL of blood was added to an EDTA tube for a complete blood count (CBC) with differential (cross-referenced with normal reference ranges for Neonates, by using cell dyne-Ruby (Abbott Diagnostics-Santa Clara- California-USA), automated cell counter and in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, background checks, and machine maintenance were carried out to maintain the complete blood count analyzer's quality for commercially manufactured known blood samples (normal, low, and high). The other 2 mL of blood was added to a plain tube and left to clot at room temperature for 10–20 min; the tube was then centrifuged for 20 min at 2000–3000 rpm; and serum was collected for the estimation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Beckman Coulter AU 480-CA-USA) where in under normal conditions, serum LDH levels in newborn are less than 580 U/L. Capillary blood gas was performed (ABL800-FLEX, Radiometer, Denmark) for the RDS and TTN groups. Hypoxemia was identified as Po2 < 60 mmHg or SpO2 < 90%.

Platelet indices provided from a full blood picture include platelet count, platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet large cell ratio (PLCR). Other indexes are computed, as follows: Platelet Mass Index (PMI) = mean platelet volume x platelet count /1000 (fL/mL). The P2/MS = [platelet count (10 9 /l)] 2 / [monocyte fraction (%) × segmented neutrophil fraction (%)].

The systemic inflammatory indicators were computed, such as the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) = (neutrophil count × platelet count) / lymphocyte count. The platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was obtained by dividing the platelet count by the lymphocyte count. The monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) is determined by dividing the monocyte count by the lymphocyte count. To calculate the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), divide the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. The systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) is derived as (neutrophil count x monocyte count) divided by lymphocyte count.

### The effect of prolactin levels on MPV in women with PCOS [^112KqMUE]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidaemia and glucose intolerance. Several studies demonstrated the link between PCOS and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Platelets play a crucial role in the development of atherothrombotic disease. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker of platelet size that reflects its activity. Research points to a link between prolactin (PRL) and platelet activation. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether prolactin levels are associated with MPV in women with PCOS.

Design

The research was designed as a cross-sectional study.

Patients

Participants were divided into three groups-PCOS patients with mildly elevated PRL levels (n = 72), patients with PCOS with normal PRL levels (n = 207) and healthy controls (n = 90). They were body mass index and age-matched and consecutively recruited.

Measurements

Complete blood counts, serum glucose, prolactin, insulin, lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and free-testosterone levels were measured.

Results

Among the three groups, MPV levels were higher in women with PCOS having mildly elevated PRL levels (P < 0·001) and MPV was found to be correlated with PRL levels (r = 0·387, P < 0·001). Multiple regression analysis showed that PRL levels were associated with MPV levels (R(2) = 0·239, β = 0·354, P < 0·001).

Conclusion

Mean platelet volume levels are significantly increased in women with PCOS having mildly elevated PRL. Our results suggest that there is a link between prolactin and MPV levels. In women with PCOS, elevated PRL levels may increase the risk of developing atherothrombotic events via the activation of platelets.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^113GgFab]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were computed as median and 25th–75th percentiles for continuous variables and as counts and % for categorical variables. The Kruskall–Wallis test was used to compare MPV (transformed, see above) and MPD between diagnostic groups. The diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values, and 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) to distinguish inherited macrothrombocytopenia from ITP according to MPD (cut-off > 3·3 μm) and MPV (cut-off > 51%) was assessed. Receiver-operated characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify optimal cut-offs for MPV and MPD and selected diagnostic groups.

Stata 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and Medcalc 12.3 (MedCalc Software, Broekstraat 52, 9030 Mariakerke, Belgium) were used for computation. A 2-sided P -value < 0·05 was considered statistically significant. The Bonferroni correction was used for post-hoc comparisons.

### Platelet parameters (PLT, MPV, P-LCR) in patients with schizophrenia, unipolar depression and bipolar disorder [^113awGoa]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

There are no studies comparing platelet parameters platelet parameters (platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR)) between patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine and compare differences in PLT, MPV and P-LCR in patients with schizophrenia, unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, naturalistic study of 2377 patients (schizophrenia n = 1243; unipolar depression n = 791; bipolar disorder n = 343, including bipolar depression n = 259 and mania n = 84). There were significant differences for PLT, MPV and P-LCR values between study groups. A significant percentage of patients with bipolar disorder had abnormal (too low or too high) number of platelets. Negative correlation between PLT and age was found in all study groups and positive correlation between age and MPV and P-LCR was found in patients with schizophrenia.

### Mean platelet volume, a novel biomarker in adolescents with severe primary dysmenorrhea [^112cLzvP]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate whether mean platelet volume (MPV) would be a profitable marker in predicting disease severity in adolescents with severe primary dysmenorrhea (PD). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A total of 67 patients diagnosed with PD and 37 healthy adolescents with regular menstrual cycles were included in the study. Hemoglobin, MPV, and white blood cell, platelet, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts were measured as part of the automated complete blood examination. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet to lymphocyte ratio were obtained from the absolute neutrophil or platelet count, respectively, divided by the absolute lymphocyte count. The visual analog scale was used to assess the level of pain, as mild (< 40 mm), moderate (40–60 mm) and severe (> 60 mm) PD.

Results

The MPV level of the combined severity of PD and control groups were similar. However, the MPV was significantly lower in the severe PD group compared with the control group (P = .04). There were no significant differences in the other hematological parameters between the groups. The mean visual analog scale score of the PD and control subjects were 7.35 ± 2.25 and 1.07 ± 1.96, respectively (P < .01). There was a poor negative correlation, which was statistically insignificant, between MPV and white blood cell count.

Conclusion

The present study showed that MPV is decreased in adolescents with severe PD. Further studies with larger numbers of subjects are necessary to clarify the roles of platelets in the pathogenesis of severe PD and evaluate the changes in MPV value in response to treatment.

### Evaluation of the association of platelet count, mean platelet volume, and platelet transfusion with intraventricular hemorrhage and death among preterm infants [^116xQr2r]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The MPV reflects platelet size. An increased MPV is suggestive of increasing platelet production and activation. Larger platelets also contain more granules and prothrombotic materials. Whether the initial MPV value can be prognostic of mortality in critically ill adult patients remains unclear. The role of MPV in this process is even more puzzling in neonates. It has been reported that high MPV in the first hours of life may be associated with IVH in extremely preterm infants. In our study, a higher MPV was found to be independently associated with reduced risk of mortality after adjusting for PC. As neonatal hemostasis is strikingly different from adult hemostasis, further research is warranted.

In the PlaNeT-2 study, the high-threshold group (50 × 10 3 /μL) had a higher rate of mortality and major bleeding than the low-threshold group (25 × 10 3 /μL). However, it is difficult to conclude whether this result was caused by the different PC levels at the time of transfusion or the different proportions of infants receiving transfusion between the groups (90% in the high-threshold group vs 53% in the low-threshold group received transfusion). In our study, the platelet transfusion–associated risk of both IVH and mortality increased when transfusion was performed at a higher PC level. However, the benefit of transfusing platelets at a lower threshold might be offset by an increased risk of bleeding owing to a decreased PC.

Regardless of the PC, the platelet transfusion–associated risks of severe IVH and mortality varied with the MPV level at transfusion. Adult platelets appear to be more hyperreactive than neonatal platelets. The presence of adult platelets might tilt the neonatal primary hemostatic balance toward a prothrombotic state. A high MPV in infants might attenuate posttransfusion risks because larger platelets are functionally, metabolically, and enzymatically more active than smaller ones; thus, a hemostatic system with more platelets and a larger portion of larger platelets would probably be more compatible with exogenous adult platelets. If this finding holds true, transfusion might be performed in infants more safely at a higher MPV level before the PC decreases to a certain threshold, and potential comorbidities associated with a decreased PC can thus be avoided.

### Perioperative leukocyte-plateletcrit shift as a prognostic signature in glioblastoma [^114cYQMU]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Circulating inflammatory indices derived from routine blood counts may offer pragmatic prognostic information in glioblastoma (GB), yet the prognostic role of plateletcrit (PCT) and of peri-treatment dynamics in leukocyte-platelet coupling remains underexplored.

Methods

We retrospectively studied 95 adults with histologically confirmed GB (48 men, 47 women; median age 64.5 years) treated adjuvantly with radiotherapy and chemotherapy with complete blood counts obtained at four windows: pre-operative, post-operative, pre-adjuvant, and post-adjuvant. From leukocytes, platelets (PLT), plateletcrit (PCT), and mean platelet volume (MPV) we derived all within-timepoint ratios and inter-timepoint differences (Δ). Overall survival (OS) in days was modeled using Cox proportional hazards (per +1 SD), with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery summaries; a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, extent of resection, radiotherapy, concomitant temozolomide (TMZ), and number of adjuvant TMZ cycles was calculated.

Results

Median overall survival (OS) was 406 days, with 80 deaths. In univariate models, dynamic indices predominated: the post-operative rise in leukocytes relative to plateletcrit (Δ post-op-pre-op leu/PCT) showed the strongest adverse association (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.22–2.10; p = 0.0007; BH-FDR q = 0.09), with concordant signals for Δ leu/PLT (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14–1.79; p = 0.002) and a protective inverse for Δ PCT/leu (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.87; p = 0.003). Cross-sectionally, higher post-operative leu/PCT and leu/PLT and higher post-adjuvant leukocytes and leu/MPV were adverse (all p < 0.05). In the multivariable model adjusting for age, sex, extent of resection, radiotherapy, concomitant temozolomide (TMZ), and number of adjuvant TMZ cycles, Δ leu/PCT remained independently associated with worse OS (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.04–2.52; p = 0.031), while concomitant TMZ (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05–0.68; p = 0.012) and greater adjuvant TMZ exposure (per +1 SD; HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29–0.78; p = 0.003) were protective.

Conclusions

Dynamic leukocyte-platelet coupling-especially Δ (post-op-pre-op) leu/PCT-provides independent prognostic information beyond standard covariates. CBC-based trajectories are low-cost and scalable and warrant prospective validation. Interpretation is limited by the absence of systematic MGMT methylation data and requires external validation and comparison with other prognostic scoring systems.

### Mean platelet volume and the ratio of mean platelet volume to platelet count in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^112qc8Fw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is an inflammatory marker. Recent studies have shown that there is a negative correlation between platelet count (PC) and MPV and that the ratio of these two values may be more meaningful. The aim of our study was to investigate the diagnostic value of MPV and the MPV/PC ratio in acute appendicitis.

Methods

Patients who were admitted to the emergency department and underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis between January 2013 and May 2016 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into three groups based on their histopathological findings: the control group (negative appendicectomy) and the uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis groups. Leukocyte count, CRP (C-reactive protein) levels, PC, MPV and the MPV/PC ratio were compared among the groups.

Results

A total of 424 patients, including 231 men, were included in the study. The average age of all patients was 34.9 ± 13.2 years. There was no statistically significant difference between the uncomplicated appendicitis, complicated appendicitis and control groups in terms of MPV, PC and the MPV/PC ratio. Leukocyte count had a strong discriminatory property based on the area under curve (AUC) 0.73, (p < 0.001). CRP levels, MPV, PC and the MPV/PC ratio had weak discriminatory power with AUC values < 0.65. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of MPV were 83.79% and 23.21%, respectively, and 66.48% and 48.21%, respectively, for the MPV/PC ratio.

Conclusions

In our study, MPV and the MPV/PC ratio were not useful in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

### Platelet indices: universally available clinical adjunct for diagnosing necrotizing enterocolitis [^116BSEgT]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Platelet function parameters can be predictive of several adult diseases and their severity. However, few studies report on the association between platelet indices and neonatal diseases, specifically necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The objective of this study is to investigate whether platelet indices are associated with NEC diagnosis and NEC-related mortality.

Study Design

We retrospectively examined records from infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a diagnosis of NEC, verified by the presence of pneumatosis on X-ray or pathology at surgery. We compared them with an age-matched group of prematures without NEC. We investigated platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width and red cell distribution width to platelet ratio (RPR) and delta platelets from birth to the time of NEC diagnosis or day of life 14 in the control group.

Results

Sixty-nine infants with NEC and 78 control infants were studied. Basic sociodemographic data were similar in both groups. All platelet parameters measured-except for MPV-were significantly associated with NEC diagnosis. Although MPV was not associated with the diagnosis of NEC (p = 0.800), it was significantly associated with NEC-related mortality (p < 0.001). Only total platelet count and RPR were significantly associated with both NEC diagnosis (p < 0.0001) and mortality (p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). On multivariable analysis only the change in platelet count from birth to time of diagnosis remained significant.

Conclusion

While not definitive, this study demonstrates that these routinely available, inexpensive, and easily calculated platelet indices can provide a clinical adjunct in the often-elusive attempts to definitively diagnose NEC in preterm neonates.

Key Points

· Platelet indices were associated with NEC diagnosis. · MPV was predictive of NEC-related mortality. · Delta platelet count from birth was significantly related to NEC diagnosis.

### Mean platelet volume is a predictive and prognostic marker for patients with acute myeloid leukemia: a two-center retrospective analysis [^113Faawh]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2021). Medium credibility.

There are only a few predictive markers that can truly aid therapy decisions in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The current study aimed to examine the impact of easily available common laboratory parameters on the course and prognosis of patients with AML. Gender, initial bone marrow blast percentage, mean platelet volume (MPV), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, treatment regimen, and complete remission (CR1) were found to have a statistically significant effect on both OS and PFS (p < 0.05). Only MPV, LDH, and initial treatment regimen were found to have a significant effect on CR1 achievement (p < 0.05). According to the current study, besides the induction regimen, only MPV was seen to affect short and long-term outcomes including both CR achievement, OS and PFS. MPV can be considered as a predictive or prognostic marker in patients with AML. Patients with higher MPV at the time of diagnosis should be evaluated carefully.

### Mean platelet volume in preterm infants as a predictor of late-onset neonatal sepsis: a retrospective comparative study [^114zNbMc]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Thrombocytopaenia in neonates, defined as platelet counts below 150 x10ˆ9/L, is frequently perceived as an indicator of severity during sepsis. This finding is often concurrent with early infection signs and might worsen rapidly, with the platelet count nadir typically noted between 24 and 48 hours.

The half-life of platelets in the blood circulation is 7–10 days. Newly released platelets are comparatively large relative to 'older' platelets. The average size and maturity of circulating platelets are expressed as mean platelet volume (MPV), which is calculated as the plateletcrit divided by the total platelet count (TPC) and is part of a complete blood count (CBC). The average volume of the platelets in the blood circulation is between 7 and 9 fL. A high MPV value indicates an increased production of platelets by the bone marrow to compensate for destroyed platelets. Platelet volume in the blood offers a more comprehensive picture of platelet functionality when compared with platelet count.

There are several studies that have demonstrated the use of a high MPV as a predictor of mortality in early sepsis. There is one case–control study that suggests a relationship between MPV and LOS in preterm infants.

Our study aims to evaluate the association between MPV and LOS in preterm infants.

### Increased mean platelet volume in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^11295AS2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Despite remarkable progress, the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is still challenging.

Objective

The mean platelet volume (MPV), a simple and reliable indicator of platelet size that correlates with platelet activation, might be an emerging cardiovascular risk marker and potentially helpful in stratifying cardiovascular risk.

Design

We analyzed MPV values in 2304 adult patients who were consecutively admitted during a 1-year period to the emergency department of the University Hospital of Verona for chest pain suggestive of ACS. In all patients, a baseline blood sample was collected for routine hematologic testing, whereas cardiac troponin T measurements were collected both at baseline and after 4, 6, and 12 hours.

Results

A total of 456 patients (19.8% of total) had ACS. These patients, all having cardiac troponin T levels of 0.03 ng/mL or greater in addition to ischemic electrocardiographic changes, had higher MPV values than non-ACS patients with normal cardiac troponin T levels (median, 8.0 fL [5th to 95th percentiles, 6.7–10.0 fL] versus median, 7.4 fL [5th to 95th percentiles, 6.5–9.5 fL]; P < .001). The diagnostic accuracy of MPV, calculated as the area under the curve by the receiver operating characteristic analysis, was 0.661 (P < .001). At the 9.0-fL cutoff, the negative and positive predictive values of MPV were 83% and 43%, respectively.

Conclusions

Because MPV is a simple and inexpensive laboratory measurement, it might be considered a useful rule-out test along with other conventional cardiac biomarkers for the risk stratification of ACS patients admitted to the emergency departments.

### A nomogram based on peripheral blood count between 12 and 18 weeks of gestation for predicting early-onset pre-eclampsia in pregnant women: a retrospective case-control study [^116Wrk58]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

A cost-effective and readily available method for predicting early-onset PE in the general population could be the peripheral blood complete blood count. This test is commonly included in routine prenatal screening for pregnant women in China. Numerous studies have shown that pre-eclampsia affects the blood microenvironment, leading to various changes in blood cells. Previous studies have shown that peripheral blood cells and their ratios, such as NLR(neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), PLR(platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio), and PC/MPV(platelet-to-mean platelet volume), hold significant value in predicting and aiding in the diagnosis of PE. However, a comprehensive analysis of peripheral complete blood count, especially definitive cut-off value range and predictive model for predicting the occurrence of early-onset PE, has not been established. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the predictive value of peripheral complete blood cell count between 12 and 18 weeks of gestation (wks) and develop an effective nomogram for predicting the risk of early-onset PE in general population, which could be used in clinical application and management.

### Can platelet indices Be new biomarkers for subjective tinnitus? [^116mR9Zd]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is one of the platelet function indices that reflect the platelet production rate and functions. The MPV levels are increased by vascular occlusion, acute or chronic syndromes, and vasculitis, whereas infections, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory situations reduce these levels. In this study, the authors investigated whether there was a relationship between platelet indices and subjective tinnitus.

Methods

In this retrospective study, the authors evaluated platelet indices in subjective tinnitus patients. One hundred patients with subjective tinnitus and 100 healthy, age and sex-matched subjects were enrolled to the study. Audiometer and laboratory results were recorded. Comparative multivariate analyses between indicator factors and hearing outcomes were conducted.

Results

Mean platelet volume is significantly lower in subjective tinnitus group (P < 0.001). Platelet count and platelet distribution width are higher in the subjective tinnitus than control group (P < 0.001, P < 0.003, respectively).

Conclusion

The authors' findings indicate that subjective tinnitus appears to be characterized by autoimmune and inflammatory events. Considering the decreasing MPV levels, MPV may be used to evaluate subjective tinnitus as an helper indicator.

### Platelet count and sepsis in very low birth weight neonates: is there an organism-specific response? [^1145W9qK]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Thrombocytopenia is commonly observed in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates with sepsis. Specific platelet responses to different infectious agents have not been extensively characterized. The objectives of this study were to examine platelet counts and platelet indices in preterm neonates with culture-proven sepsis to determine if there are organism-specific platelet responses.

Study Design

We analyzed a cohort of all VLBW neonates (birthweight < 1500 g) born over a 4-year period and admitted to a single level III neonatal intensive care unit (N = 943). Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count < 100,000/mm(3). Platelet count, nadir, duration of thrombocytopenia, and mean platelet volume (MPV) were examined during episodes of culture-proven sepsis. Analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and chi(2) tests were used to compare groups, and data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

Results

Sepsis was diagnosed in 154 (16%) of 943 patients in the study population. Of the sepsis episodes, 54% were associated with thrombocytopenia and 61% with an elevation in MPV. Infections were grouped by organism type: Gram-positive bacteria (117/154, 76%), Gram-negative bacteria (24/154, 16%), and fungi (13/154, 8%). When compared with patients with Gram-positive sepsis, those with Gram-negative or fungal sepsis had a significantly lower initial platelet count, a lower platelet nadir, a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, and a greater duration of thrombocytopenia. The decrease in platelet count from baseline was also significantly less in the Gram-positive infections than in the fungal infections. Although there was an overall increase in MPV from baseline, there were no differences between groups.

Conclusions

In our population of VLBW infants, sepsis is frequently associated with thrombocytopenia and an elevation in MPV. However, fungal and Gram-negative pathogens are associated with a lower platelet count and more prolonged thrombocytopenia compared with Gram-positive pathogens. We conclude that common pathogens causing sepsis have different effects on platelet kinetics.

### Reference intervals of complete blood count constituents are highly correlated to waist circumference: should obese patients have their own "normal values? " [^1132Yiut]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Body mass index (BMI), the prevalent indicator of obesity, is not easily grasped by patients nor physicians. Waist circumference (WC) is correlated to obesity, is better understood and has a stronger relationship to the metabolic syndrome. We compiled WC, complete blood count (CBC) parameters as well as other pertinent data of 6766 25–55-year-old US volunteers sampled in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in the years 2005–2010. To determine reference intervals of typical US patients visiting their clinician, we used minimal exclusion criteria. We compiled hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count, mean platelet volume, and counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. In addition, we also compiled serum C reactive protein and serum iron. The three major US races were studied and reference interval diagrams were constructed for each CBC parameter plotted against WC. WBC count, RDW, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and red blood cell count increase with WC. Conversely, serum iron and MCH and MCV decrease. These relationships may be related to insulin resistance and chronic activation of the immune system and the resulting low-grade inflammatory state. WC is a strong predictor for many CBC parameters, suggesting that WC should be taken into account when evaluating blood count results. Clinicians who take care of obese patients should be aware of altered hematology and investigate and treat accordingly.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^111G16oz]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study showed that platelet size evaluation is a useful tool for distinguishing inherited macrothrombocytopenias from ITP and that the better differentiation is obtained by the use of the MPV values given by appropriate cell counters. Inappropriate instruments can be identified either by comparison of platelet counts measured by the counter with those obtained by manual counting or by the evaluation of peripheral blood films, which show very large platelets in subjects with normal or only slightly enlarged MPV. From a practical point of view, we suggest that microscope evaluation of blood films and measurement of MPV by cell counters should be used in combination. Blood film examination enables the easy identification of very large platelets, which suggest a diagnosis of inherited macrothrombocytopenias. If very large platelets are not identified, a MPV increased by more than 51% with respect to controls represents an important element that supports the suspicion of a hereditary macrothrombocytopenia.

### Abnormal platelet parameters in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yV7Az]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammation of the intestinal tract, characterized by recurring periods of relapse and remission. It encompasses two primary disorders, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), both of which have demonstrated a global increase in incidence over the past decade. Although the etiology remains incompletely elucidated, Growing experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the initiation and progression of IBD involve an intricate interplay among immune, genetic, and environmental factors.

Platelets, as multifunctional cells, play a crucial role in regulating immunity and inflammation, in addition to their hemostatic function. IBD is linked to various alterations in platelets, encompassing changes in number, shape, and function. These abnormalities are primarily attributed to the highly activated state of circulating platelets in IBD patients. IBD patients have an imbalance between inflammation and coagulation function; inflammatory cytokines can induce abnormal coagulation processes, and the coagulation cascade promotes the progression of inflammation, initiating a vicious cycle where each process propagates and intensifies the other. The significance of activated platelets in the pathogenesis of IBD becomes more pronounced when considering that patients with IBD are prone to developing arterial thromboembolic events and venous thromboembolism.

While platelet dysfunction is implicated in IBD pathogenesis, the existing evidence remains insufficient. Moreover, there are variations in reported results of platelet parameters in the IBD population in clinical studies, and platelet parameters have not yet been established as guidelines for the diagnosis or clinical evaluation of IBD. Therefore, accumulating evidence is crucial to elucidate the diagnostic and prognostic value of platelet parameters in IBD. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis to provide more comprehensive conclusions on changes in platelet parameters in IBD, including platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT). As a cost-effective and straightforward laboratory indicator, examining the correlation between platelet parameters and IBD has the potential to contribute to more comprehensive clinical insights for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of IBD and related platelet disorders.

### Increased mean platelet volume is related to histologic severity of primary biliary cirrhosis [^113dLFga]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the main platelet volume (MPV) as a severity marker in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).

Materials and Methods

Thirty-nine patients with biopsy-proven and as yet untreated PBC followed between January 2008 and January 2015 were included in this study. Liver biopsies were categorized as early stage (stage 1 and 2 according to Scheuer's histological stage) and late stage (Scheuer's stage 3 and 4). As part of the routine evaluation, all PBC patients had their full blood count and biochemistry profile determined, where MPV, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, red cell distribution width (RDW), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin values were evaluated. Both groups were compared in terms of the RDW/platelet ratio, the AST platelet ratio index, and the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio.

Results

Eighteen patients had early-stage disease (46.2%), whereas 21 PBC patients had late-stage disease (53.8%). There were no differences between groups in terms of routine hematological parameters (white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin, RDW) or biochemical parameters (alanine aminotransferase, AST, gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin) (P > 0.05). Similarly, there were no differences in AST platelet ratio index, RDW/platelet ratio, or neutrophil lymphocyte ratio values between groups (P values 0.08, 0.19, and 0.14, respectively). The MPV and direct bilirubin were significantly higher in the advanced stage group compared with the early-stage group (11.08 vs. 9.73fl, respectively, P = 0.01 and 0.44 vs. 0.28mg/dl, respectively, P = 0.03). The area under the curve, cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity of MPV and direct bilirubin for detecting advanced stage were 0.721, 10.3, 71%, and 66%, respectively, and 0.698, 0.23, 71%, and 66%, respectively.

Conclusion

MPV can be used as a noninvasive, simple, and effective parameter in patients with PBC to predict histological severity of the disease.

Entire sample

Data for the 976 patients who were included in the study are presented in Table 1. Groups A (no rising MPV) and B (rising MPV) comprised 83.8% and 16.2% of the patients, respectively. MPV values > 8.5 fL on admission and discharge were found among 48.3% and 43.0% of patients, respectively.

Table 1
Characteristics of the patients analyzed in the study

Data are presented as means ± SD or percentages of presented cases. MPV mean platelet volume; ΔMPV: MPV on discharge minus MPV on admission; CURB-65: assigning 1 point each for confusion, blood urea nitrogen > 19 g/dl, respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, low blood pressure and age ≥ 65 years; WBC white blood cell. Bold entries in the table indicate a p -value of ≤ 0.05

Comparisons according to MPV changes (group A vs. B, Table 1)

Patients with a rise in MPV were more likely to be older, and to present with renal dysfunction and cerebrovascular disorder than patients with no rise in MPV. Mean values of CURB-65 and PSI scores were significantly higher in group B (rising MPV). Moreover, on discharge, lower values of platelets, as well as higher levels of leukocytes and neutrophils were observed in group B.

### Platelet function is modified by common sequence variation in megakaryocyte super enhancers [^112MzH9C]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Blood cells traits such as counts and mean cellular volumes are highly heritable and can be readily measured using hematology analysers as part of a complete blood count (CBC). We identified, by genome-wide association study (GWAS), 2,706 independent sentinel variants associated with 36 CBC-measured traits of blood cells. Of these variants, 674 are associated with the count, the mean volume, the width of the volume distribution or the mass (also known as crit, count × mean volume) of platelets (CBC-P hereafter). Platelets are the smallest cells of the blood and their functions are to initiate repair at sites of vascular injury and to maintain haemostasis; furthermore, they are implicated in the aetiologies of myocardial infarction and stroke, among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Platelets and red cells are formed by megakaryocytes (MKs) and erythroblasts (EBs), which originate through a stepwise differentiation of the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC). Red cell production depends on iron homeostasisand oxygen sensing, whereas platelet production is controlled by a negative feedback loop. This is based on circulating thrombopoietin level, which is directly linked to platelet count, because platelets bind and degrade thrombopoietin via its receptor myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL) on their surface. Platelets and MKs therefore provide an excellent model to link trait-associated variants to the genes they may regulate.

The majority of CBC-P-associated variants are located in the non-coding genomic space and therefore it remains challenging to explain their mechanism of action. GWAS signals are enriched in enhancer elements. Enhancers function through chromatin loops, physically connecting them with the promoters of their target gene(s)often bypassing the nearest gene. Here, to determine the mechanisms underpinning variant association with platelet quantitative traits, we integrate MK and EB promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C), a core set of histone modifications and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-binding data generated as part of this and the BLUEPRINT consortium studies. We propose a mapping strategy able to identify potential regulatory functions for 423 of 565 (75%) of CBC-P non-coding variants. Moreover, we provide examples of the effect of common variation on transcriptional mechanisms, which reveal that CBC-P in MK super enhancers (SEs) modify platelet functions.

### Predictors of serious bacterial infections using serum biomarkers in an infant population aged 0 to 90 days: a prospective cohort study [^114FXS7D]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Platelet and lymphocytes derangements are also measures of systemic inflammation. Mean platelet volume to platelet count ratio (MPV/PC) has been suggested in adult studies as an early prognostic marker of outcome in critically ill states secondary to sepsis or trauma. Platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is another novel biomarker, reflecting the balance between inflammation and thrombosis. It has been shown to be useful in adult studies to diagnose inflammatory conditions. However, these markers have not been as widely studied in the paediatric population.

The primary aim of our study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of these easily available biomarkers to predict SBI: WBC, ANC, NLR, PLR, MPV/PC and to compare them with CRP in febrile infants less than 3 months old. Our secondary aim was to determine cut-off values for these biomarkers that would be useful to risk stratify young febrile infants.

### Mean platelet volume as a predictive biomarker for in-hospital mortality in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation [^117S5MPA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The ability of MPV for predicting in-hospital mortality among patients undergoing IMV has not been studied before. The study suggested that MPV is a more useful maker for predicting in-hospital mortality, and MPV > 11.4 fl was an independent predictor factor for in-hospital mortality. This relationship was much stronger in female patients. MPV is reported in routine blood counts with low cost and availability, making it a profitable marker with immediate clinical applicability, especially in limited resource sites.

### Intermittent low platelet counts hampering diagnosis of X-linked thrombocytopenia in children: report of two unrelated cases and a novel mutation in the gene coding for the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein [^1128yjdn]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is a broad differential diagnosis for thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients. However, ITP is often considered the main cause of this finding, which can occur in up to 1 per 20,000 children per year in the United States. In this report, we described two cases of inherited thrombocytopenia previously misdiagnosed as ITP. Both cases presented small platelets with persistently low MPV, illustrating the importance of platelet morphology assessment by combining peripheral blood smear evaluation, and platelet parameters in the automated blood count.

In pediatric population, ITP is usually triggered by previous infection or vaccination, and by six months after the onset, 75% of cases are expected to achieve complete remission. In this way, those cases presenting with persistent or recurrent thrombocytopenia should be carefully evaluated for alternative diagnoses.

A differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia should always consider platelet size, as proposed in Table 1. In addition, further characteristics of clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, can contribute for diagnosis in cases with thrombocytopenia. Both the presence of giant platelets and Döhle-like inclusion bodies in neutrophils are consistent to an autosomal dominant disorder, known as MYH9-related macrothrombocytopenia. In contrast, presence of parental consanguinity increases the probability of autosomal recessive disorders, such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Furthermore, wide variation of platelet counts, severe thrombocytopenia in very young children (e.g. < 20 × 10 9 /L), and the history of preceding infection are more frequently seen in patients with ITP.

1 Hospital Central de las Fuerzas Armadas, Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos, Montevideo, Uruguay, 2 Hospital de Clinicas, Universidad de la Republica, Fisiopatologia, Montevideo, Uruguay

Critical Care 2025, 29(S1) :P033

Introduction: Acute liver failure (ALF) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are two life-threatening conditions characterized by severe hepatic dysfunction. Systemic inflammation is a hallmark in both conditions. Our objective was to compare the inflammatory status of patients with ALF and ACLF admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) using complete blood count (CBC) parameters.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at the Hospital Central de las Fuerzas Armadas in Uruguay, including patients (> 16 years old) admitted to the ICU with ALF or ACLF between January 2012 and January 2024. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected. Various inflammatory indexes were calculated from CBC data (at ICU admission and 48 h post-admission), including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), mean platelet volume (MPV)-to-lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR), red cell distribution width (RDW)-to-lymphocyte ratio (RLR), RDW-to-platelet ratio (RPR), MPV-to-platelet ratio (MPVPR) and hemoglobin-to-RDW ratio (HRR).

### PAN-immune inflammation value: a new biomarker for diagnosing appendicitis in children? [^116iokud]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) is easy to perform, cost-effective, and provides information on various cell types and morphological parameters (white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, platelet count, and mean platelet volume). For example, the diagnostic value of low-cost and routinely measured markers such as mean platelet volume (MPV) and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been investigated. However, meta-analyses conducted in the pediatric population have shown that MPV does not significantly differ between children with acute appendicitis and healthy controls (WMD = -0.42, p = 0.19), and RDW similarly lacks discriminatory power (WMD = 0.23, p = 0.28). These findings indicate the limited clinical utility of MPV or RDW as standalone diagnostic tools. Additionally, combined ratios of these parameters are used as inflammation indices, assisting in the diagnosis, progression, and risk stratification of many diseases. The diagnostic value of CBC parameters is not limited to appendicitis alone; Growing evidence suggests that composite scores based on CBC can serve as prognostic biomarkers in cancer and inflammatory diseases. For example, parameters such as MPV and WBC (white blood cell count), when combined with machine learning models, have achieved an accuracy of 85% in COVID-19 diagnosis. Similarly, LYM (lymphocyte count) and PDW (platelet distribution width) have been used by automated algorithms to distinguish between influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections, achieving an accuracy of 98.4%. However, since many of these markers show non-specific elevations in infections, their use alone in diagnosing appendicitis is limited. In this context, several markers have been developed, including the recently introduced pan-immune-inflammation values (PIV), which encompasses levels of neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes. By reflecting inflammatory and immune response dynamics that cannot be captured by a single biomarker, these markers may enhance diagnostic accuracy.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the recently developed PIV index, which includes levels of neutrophils, platelets, monocytes, and lymphocytes, can be used as a biomarker for diagnosing acute appendicitis in children and to compare the performance of PIV with other commonly used systemic inflammatory markers, such as the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI), Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), and Platelet/Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR).
