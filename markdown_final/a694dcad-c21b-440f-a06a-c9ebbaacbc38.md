## Question

Pathophysiology of ADHD does it involves serotonin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether serotonin is involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD and how strong the evidence is for a causal role versus mere association. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the traditional dopamine–norepinephrine model of ADHD and whether it leaves room for serotonin. Then, I should review genetic evidence linking serotonergic genes to ADHD. Next, I will examine neuroimaging data on the serotonin transporter and interregional coupling. After that, I need to check pharmacologic and interventional studies that manipulate serotonin and their clinical implications. I will then consider developmental and circuit-level mechanisms by which serotonin could modulate ADHD phenotypes. Finally, I should weigh contradictory findings and synthesize a cautious, clinically relevant conclusion with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational model. ADHD has long been framed as a disorder of catecholamine dysregulation, with convergent evidence that stimulants and atomoxetine improve symptoms via modulation of dopamine and norepinephrine in frontostriatal circuits; this catecholamine-centric model is robust and remains central to treatment mechanisms, but it does not preclude additional neurotransmitter contributions, including serotonin, especially in subdomains like impulsivity and emotional dysregulation [^111oxBEY] [^113xyo2F] [^111RLS1t].

> Wait, let me verify the genetic signals pointing to serotonin. Multiple candidate gene and meta-analytic studies implicate serotonergic genes in ADHD, albeit with small effect sizes: the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4, 5-HTT), the 5-HT1B receptor gene (HTR1B), and the brain-specific tryptophan hydroxylase gene (TPH2) have all shown replicated associations in some datasets, supporting a contributory, though not deterministic, role for serotonin in ADHD susceptibility [^117FG1CM] [^112ymAmu] [^113U94aA] [^113twH2w] [^112Yjn6X] [^114a4rkv].

> Hold on, I should verify the imaging evidence before drawing conclusions. PET studies of the serotonin transporter (SERT) have been mixed: some report no group differences in SERT availability, whereas others find altered interregional coupling of SERT binding between regions such as the precuneus and hippocampus in ADHD, suggesting network-level serotonergic dysconnectivity rather than a uniform global deficit; this pattern fits with a modulatory, circuit-specific role rather than a primary serotonergic pathology [^111YPPxw] [^116hPDPt] [^114J6pEq].

> I need to check whether manipulating serotonin changes ADHD-relevant brain function or behavior. Acute SSRI administration (fluoxetine) in youth with ADHD upregulates activation in right inferior frontal cortex, insula, and striatum and downregulates default mode regions during temporal discounting, with performance trending toward normalization; this supports a modulatory effect of serotonin on impulsivity-related circuits, even though SSRIs are not effective standalone treatments for core ADHD symptoms [^11544SSy] [^113UbtKz]. But wait, what if serotonin's clinical role is mainly in comorbidity? Indeed, SSRIs are often used for co-occurring depression or anxiety in ADHD, and recent real-world data suggest combining SSRIs with methylphenidate is generally safe in adults, which aligns with serotonin's relevance to affective comorbidity rather than primary ADHD symptom control [^117HgaZQ].

> Let me consider developmental and mechanistic plausibility. Serotonin shapes neurodevelopmental processes such as synaptogenesis, cortical maturation, and network pruning; dysregulation during sensitive periods could bias frontostriatal and frontoparietal circuits toward impaired attention and impulse control, providing a biologically credible pathway for serotonergic variation to modulate ADHD risk and expression, particularly in the hyperactive–impulsive domain [^112aYdx9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should not jump to conclusions about causality. The genetic associations are modest and not uniformly replicated across ancestries and phenotypes, and some pathway-based analyses in population samples fail to detect a serotonergic contribution to symptom dimensions, underscoring heterogeneity and the risk of false positives in candidate gene approaches; moreover, SSRIs have limited efficacy for core ADHD symptoms, arguing against a primary causal serotonergic deficit in most patients [^11113a37] [^113UbtKz] [^117FG1CM].

> I should double-check pharmacogenetic clues that might refine this. Variants in SLC6A4 and HTR1B have been linked to differences in treatment response, side effects, and comorbidity profiles, and atomoxetine — though primarily noradrenergic — has measurable interactions with serotonergic systems, reinforcing a model in which serotonin tunes catecholamine-mediated cognitive control rather than driving the disorder per se [^1177hGYt] [^116yFrgM] [^114J6pEq].

> Let me synthesize and make sure the conclusion matches the weight of evidence. Serotonin is involved in ADHD pathophysiology, but its role appears to be indirect and modulatory: genetic variation in serotonergic genes contributes small increments of risk, imaging suggests network-level serotonergic dysconnectivity rather than a global deficit, and serotonergic manipulation can normalize dysfunctional activation during impulsive choice tasks without reliably treating core ADHD symptoms; thus, serotonin likely modulates catecholamine-driven executive control circuits and may particularly influence impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, including via gene–environment interactions such as stress sensitivity moderated by SLC6A4 [^117FG1CM] [^116hPDPt] [^11544SSy] [^116NkY2C] [^111RLS1t].

> Clinically, I need to ensure the implications are practical. Routine ADHD treatment should still prioritize dopamine–norepinephrine modulation with stimulants or atomoxetine, while recognizing that serotonergic agents may be appropriate for comorbid mood or anxiety symptoms and that combined regimens can be safe in selected adults; precision approaches targeting serotonin are not yet ready for prime time, but ongoing work on druggable genome and circuit-informed strategies may eventually personalize serotonergic modulation in specific ADHD subtypes or comorbidity profiles [^1179TF8k] [^113UbtKz] [^117HgaZQ] [^117Fz7PS].

---

Yes, serotonin is involved in ADHD pathophysiology, but its role is **modulatory and indirect** rather than primary [^112Yjn6X]. Serotonin helps regulate impulsivity, emotional control, and executive function via interactions with dopamine and norepinephrine [^112aYdx9]; **dysregulation of serotonin likely contributes to ADHD symptoms**, especially impulsivity and emotional dysregulation [^114J6pEq]. Evidence includes genetic associations (e.g. HTR1B, SLC6A4) [^117FG1CM], altered serotonin transporter binding [^116hPDPt], and modulation of fronto-striatal circuits [^11544SSy]. However, serotonin is not the main driver; dopamine and norepinephrine remain central, and serotonin's contribution is best viewed as part of a broader monoaminergic imbalance [^1143NGZ3].

---

## Serotonergic neurotransmission and ADHD symptoms

Serotonin (5-HT) is a **monoamine neurotransmitter** that regulates mood, impulse control, and executive function — domains commonly affected in ADHD [^112aYdx9]. Serotonergic neurons originate in the **raphe nuclei** and project widely, modulating dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems implicated in ADHD [^112Yjn6X]. Dysregulation of serotonin signaling may contribute to impulsivity, **emotional dysregulation**, and executive dysfunction in ADHD [^114J6pEq].

---

## Genetic evidence linking serotonin to ADHD

Several **genetic studies** have implicated serotonergic genes in ADHD:

- **HTR1B (5-HT1B receptor gene)**: Polymorphisms in HTR1B have been associated with ADHD, particularly hyperactive/impulsive symptoms [^112Yjn6X] [^114a4rkv].
- **SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter gene)**: Variants such as the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism have been linked to ADHD susceptibility and symptom severity [^113DhCLv] [^116NkY2C].
- **TPH2 (tryptophan hydroxylase 2)**: TPH2, a rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, has shown associations with ADHD in candidate gene studies [^113twH2w] [^112fLT4o].

These findings suggest that **genetic variation in serotonergic pathways contributes to ADHD risk**, though effects are modest and likely interact with environmental factors [^114jtZPA].

---

## Neuroimaging evidence

Neuroimaging studies provide further support for serotonergic involvement in ADHD:

- **Serotonin transporter (SERT) binding**: PET studies have shown altered SERT binding in ADHD, indicating abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission [^116hPDPt].
- **Fronto-striatal circuits**: Serotonin modulates fronto-striatal circuits involved in impulse control and executive function, which are disrupted in ADHD [^11544SSy] [^1143NGZ3].

---

## Interaction with dopamine and norepinephrine systems

Serotonin interacts with dopamine and norepinephrine systems, which are central to ADHD pathophysiology [^112Yjn6X] [^111oxBEY]. Serotonergic modulation of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways may influence attention, impulse control, and emotional regulation, suggesting a **multimodal neurotransmitter imbalance** in ADHD [^114uj3oi].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment considerations

While serotonin is not the primary target of ADHD treatments, its modulation may have clinical implications:

- **SSRIs**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not effective for core ADHD symptoms but may help with comorbid emotional dysregulation and anxiety [^113UbtKz] [^114shnrH].
- **Combination therapy**: SSRIs combined with stimulants may be beneficial in patients with ADHD and comorbid depression or anxiety, though careful monitoring is required [^117HgaZQ] [^112XeivE].
- **Emerging treatments**: Research is exploring serotonergic agents targeting specific receptors (e.g. 5-HT2C) for ADHD, but evidence remains preliminary [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Despite growing evidence, several **limitations and controversies** persist:

- **Heterogeneity**: ADHD is highly heterogeneous, and serotonergic involvement may vary across subtypes and individuals [^111RLS1t].
- **Inconsistent findings**: Genetic and neuroimaging studies have yielded inconsistent results, partly due to small sample sizes and methodological differences [^117FG1CM].
- **Non-specificity**: Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders, limiting specificity to ADHD [^113N6kBj].

---

Serotonin is involved in ADHD pathophysiology, particularly in modulating impulsivity, emotional regulation, and executive function [^11544SSy] [^114J6pEq]. Its role is **indirect and modulatory**, interacting with dopamine and norepinephrine systems [^112Yjn6X]. Genetic and neuroimaging studies support serotonergic involvement, but further research is needed to clarify its specific contributions and clinical implications [^114J6pEq].

### Current strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^115GdCx6]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Symptoms of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affect cognitive, academic, behavioral, emotional, social, and developmental functioning. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents. An estimated 2 to 16 percent of school-aged children have been diagnosed with the disorder. The prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the primary care setting is similar to that in the general community, depending on the diagnostic criteria and population studied. The causality of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is relatively unknown. Most recent studies focus on the role of dopamine; norepinephrine; and, most recently, serotonin neurotransmitters. The disorder is classified into three general subtypes: predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, predominantly inattentive, and combined. Screening tools and rating scales have been devised to assist with the diagnosis. Appropriate treatment can dramatically improve the function and quality of life of the patient and family. Pharmacologic treatment includes stimulants, such as methylphenidate and mixed amphetamine salts, or nonstimulants, such as atomoxetine. Behavioral approaches, particularly those that reward desirable behavior, are also effective. A combination of pharmacologic and behavioral therapies is recommended.

Conclusion

The ADHD neurobiology is intricate and involves multiple neural pathways, but dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin are the critical neurotransmitters highlighted in ADHD pathogenesis. The combined efforts from psychologists, psychiatrists, geneticists, and neuroscientists have resulted in an improved understanding of ADHD etiology. Given the multifaceted symptomatology and multifactorial origin of ADHD, significant research efforts have been made over the past years to explore ADHD-related genetic and neural modifications. Notwithstanding the involvement of candidate genes and neurotransmitter systems in ADHD, genome-wide correlations between ADHD symptoms and individual genetic variants have yet to be established. Therefore, their contributions to our understanding of the etiology of ADHD are limited. Larger-scale, multicenter neuroimaging genetic approaches are now in progress, however, representing one hopeful avenue to translate this polygenic disorder's genetic architecture. Besides, there has been considerable progress in finding vital brain circuits and regions whose structure, function, and connectivity are impaired in ADHD. One of the biggest challenges yet to be faced is developing causal relationships between these neural fluctuations and the disorder. Improved neuroimaging methods combined with experimental manipulations such as advanced neuromodulation and pharmacological approaches would probably require a deeper understanding of neural circuits and their functions. Also, relying on well-characterized animal models and the latest technologies, such as in vivo optogenetics, could allow selective manipulation of the neural circuitry involved during ADHD-related tasks. A critical future direction for ADHD research is to couple human and animal neuroimaging genetic studies to explore how the risk genes associated with ADHD neurobiology affect the brain changes in knock-out rodent models. This will help to identify the abnormal biological pathways involved in ADHD pathophysiology.

The intermediate or endophenotype approach allows mapping the effects of individual risk genes on neurobiological parameters, such as brain structure, chemistry, and ultimately function. In addition, the combination of neuroimaging-related endophenotypes with genetic networks is now seen as an explanatory combinatorial model for understanding detailed ADHD pathogenesis including the generation of polygenic risk scores. The combination of neuroimaging, psychiatric genetics, and behavioral genetics will not only contribute to the diagnosis of ADHD but can also be a useful tool for personalized medicine. In the years to come, we will gain a more comprehensive understanding of ADHD, thereby allowing for new medications that are more successful than those currently in use.

### Neurobiology of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^115KqeHN]. Pediatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, has been associated with various structural and functional CNS abnormalities but findings about neurobiological mechanisms linking genes to brain phenotypes are just beginning to emerge. Despite the high heritability of the disorder and its main symptom dimensions, common individual genetic variants are likely to account for a small proportion of the phenotype's variance. Recent findings have drawn attention to the involvement of rare genetic variants in the pathophysiology of ADHD, some being shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Traditionally, neurobiological research on ADHD has focused on catecholaminergic pathways, the main target of pharmacological treatments. However, more distal and basic neuronal processes in relation with cell architecture and function might also play a role, possibly accounting for the coexistence of both diffuse and specific alterations of brain structure and activation patterns. This article aims to provide an overview of recent findings in the rapidly evolving field of ADHD neurobiology with a focus on novel strategies regarding pathophysiological analyses.

### Moving towards causality in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: overview of neural and genetic mechanisms [^113xyo2F]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity. The heterogeneity of its clinical manifestations and the differential responses to treatment and varied prognoses have long suggested myriad underlying causes. Over the past decade, clinical and basic research efforts have uncovered many behavioural and neurobiological alterations associated with ADHD, from genes to higher order neural networks. Here, we review the neurobiology of ADHD by focusing on neural circuits implicated in the disorder and discuss how abnormalities in circuitry relate to symptom presentation and treatment. We summarise the literature on genetic variants that are potentially related to the development of ADHD, and how these, in turn, might affect circuit function and relevant behaviours. Whether these underlying neurobiological factors are causally related to symptom presentation remains unresolved. Therefore, we assess efforts aimed at disentangling issues of causality, and showcase the shifting research landscape towards endophenotype refinement in clinical and preclinical settings. Furthermore, we review approaches being developed to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of this complex disorder, including the use of animal models, neuromodulation, and pharmacoimaging studies.

### The genetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^112ymAmu]. Human Molecular Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable, disruptive, childhood-onset condition, the aetiology and pathogenesis of which is poorly understood. There have been relatively few genome-wide linkage studies, and no chromosomal region has yet been unequivocally implicated. In contrast, evidence from pharmacological, neuroimaging and animal studies has suggested the involvement of specific neurotransmitter systems, notably dopaminergic pathways, in ADHD and these aetiological clues have inspired a fruitful application of the candidate gene association approach. Meta-analyses or pooled data analyses have supported association between ADHD and polymorphisms in DRD4, DRD5 and SLC6A3 which encode dopamine D4 and D5 receptors and the dopamine transporter, respectively. A weaker, but nevertheless replicated, body of evidence also supports associations with SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kDa) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter). There is increasing research interest in gene-phenotype links, clinical phenotypic markers of heterogeneity and gene — environment interaction, which are likely to be important in the next generation of genetic studies.

### A review of the pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^113HGfmF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Data Sources and Data Extraction

A literature search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE using the terms attention deficit hyperactive disorder, ADHD, pathophysiology, etiology, and neurobiology. Limits applied were the following: published in the past 10 years (January 2003 to August 2013), humans, review, meta-analysis, and English language. These yielded 63 articles in PubMed and 74 in EMBASE. After removing duplicate/irrelevant articles, 86 articles and their relevant reference citations were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

ADHD is a neurological disorder that affects children, but symptoms may persist into adulthood. Individuals suffering from this disorder exhibit hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, and problems in social interaction and academic performance. Medications used to treat ADHD such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, and atomoxetine indicate a dopamine/norepinephrine deficit as the neurochemical basis of ADHD, but the etiology is more complex. Moreover, these agents have poor adverse effect profiles and a multitude of drug interactions. Because these drugs are also dispensed to adults who may have concomitant conditions or medications, a pharmacist needs to be aware of these adverse events and drug interactions. This review, therefore, focuses on the pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of ADHD and details the adverse effects and drug interaction profiles of the drugs used to treat it.

Conclusions

Published research shows the benefit of drug therapy for ADHD in children, but given the poor adverse effect and drug interaction profiles, these must be dispensed with caution.

### The nature and heritability of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112YTQ9C]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

This article reviews family, twin, and adoption studies, along with segregation analyses and molecular genetic studies, suggesting that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of ADHD. Findings also indicate that the genetic mechanisms that predispose individuals to ADHD are likely to be complex, and the literature on ADHD raises many questions regarding clinical and pathophysiologic heterogeneity of the disorder. Although there is no single pathophysiologic profile of ADHD, data do implicate dysfunction in the frontosubcortical pathways that control attention and motor behavior. Moreover, the effectiveness of stimulants, along with animal models of hyperactivity, point to catecholamine dysregulation as at least one source of ADHD brain dysfunction.

### Pharmacotherapy for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: from cells to circuits [^111oxBEY]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent disorder of childhood and adulthood, with a considerable impact on public health. There is a substantial pharmacopoeia available for safe and effective treatment of ADHD, and newly available agents diversify the treatment options. With the burgeoning scientific literature addressing the genetic, neurochemical, and neural systems basis for this condition, increasing attention is directed at establishing the neural basis for the efficacy of existing treatments. ADHD remains the only highly prevalent, nondegenerative neuropsychiatric disorder for which effective medications remediate the principal cognitive disturbances in concert with clinical efficacy. Therefore, deeper insight into the neural mechanisms of cognitive remediation may serve to advance treatment development not only in ADHD, but across a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders in which cognitive dysfunction is a cardinal feature and a strong predictor of clinical outcome. To date, all effective medications for ADHD act on 1 or both of the major catecholamine neurotransmitter systems in the brain. These 2 systems, which arise from subcortical nuclei and use norepinephrine (NE) or dopamine (DA) as transmitters, exert strong modulatory effects on widely distributed cortical-subcortical neural circuits, with important effects on cognition, mood, and behavior, in both health and illness. The present review outlines the actions of ADHD medications from subcellular effects to effects on neural systems and cognition in ADHD patients. This is a very active area of investigation at all phases of the translational cycle, and near-term work is poised to firmly link cellular neuropharmacology to large-scale effects, and point the way toward advances in treatment.

### Neurobiology of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: historical challenges and emerging frontiers [^117QLDSH]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Extensive investigations spanning multiple levels of inquiry, from genetic to behavioural studies, have sought to unravel the mechanistic foundations of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with the aspiration of developing efficacious treatments for this condition. Despite these efforts, the pathogenesis of ADHD remains elusive. In this Review, we reflect on what has been learned about ADHD while also providing a framework that may serve as a roadmap for future investigations. We emphasize that ADHD is a highly heterogeneous disorder with multiple aetiologies that necessitates a multifactorial dimensional phenotype, rather than a fixed dichotomous conceptualization. We highlight new findings that suggest a more brain-wide, 'global' view of the disorder, rather than the traditional localizationist framework, which asserts that a limited set of brain regions or networks underlie ADHD. Last, we underscore how underpowered studies that have aimed to associate neurobiology with ADHD phenotypes have long precluded the field from making progress. However, a new age of ADHD research with refined phenotypes, advanced methods, creative study designs and adequately powered investigations is beginning to put the field on a good footing. Indeed, the field is at a promising juncture to advance the neurobiological understanding of ADHD and fulfil the promise of clinical utility.

### An updated review on animal models to study attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^113LAdpH]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional genetic variations are present in other models (dopamine transporter gene knockout mice, coloboma mice, Naples hyperexcitable rats, steroid sulfatase, alpha-synuclein-lacking mice, and neonatal lesioning of dopaminergic neurons with 6-hydroxydopamine). However, none of them are fully comparable to clinical ADHD. The pathophysiology involved varies, including both deficient and excessive dopaminergic functioning, and there is probable involvement of other monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline. Therefore, improved models as well as further testing of their ability to predict treatment responses are required. Some aspects of ADHD behavior may result from an imbalance between increased noradrenergic activity and decreased dopaminergic regulation of neural circuits that involve the prefrontal cortex. In addition to providing unique insights into the neurobiology of ADHD, animal models are also used to test new drugs that can alleviate ADHD symptoms.

The evidence addressed in this study suggests that currently available animal models may be useful for studying human behavioral disorders. Furthermore, our current knowledge of ADHD neurobiology is insufficient, making it challenging to identify an optimal model for investigating ADHD.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113p8UYm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarise current literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Gene-environment interactions in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^114jtZPA]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity in children and adults. Putative environmental risk factors for ADHD include toxin and prenatal smoke exposure, low socioeconomic status, and parental marital instability and discord. Genetic associations with ADHD have been found in the dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems, but findings are inconsistent across studies. Herein, we review studies of gene-environment interactions for ADHD to better understand how genetic and environmental risk factors may contribute to the disorder in a nonindependent fashion, which may account in part for the inconsistent findings on genetic associations. Although evidence of interactions between prenatal substance exposure and the dopamine genes DAT1 and DRD4 was found, findings across studies have been mixed. We discuss these findings and the future directions and limitations of current gene-environment research.

### Paradigm shift required for translational research on the brain [^113VwqBw]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Other brain diseases

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of children globally. Its exact cause is unknown, but many risk factors, including norepinephrine and dopamine imbalances, have been identified. The most common and effective medications to regulate norepinephrine are psychostimulants, including methylphenidate and dexamphetamine. These treatments are effective; however, they have many side effects, such as decreased appetite, behavioral rebound, irritability, sleep problems, and tic exacerbation. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting approximately 65 million people globally. The exact cause of epilepsy is unknown; however, it is closely associated with neurodegeneration, ADHD, and stroke –. There have been significant advances in epilepsy treatment, including calcium ion channel and GABA transporter modulators, over the past few decades; however, one-third of patients are still fighting the disease, even with the currently available medications. As described above, there are different types of brain diseases, including neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, but their treatments overlap and are limited. This is because the exact etiologies are unknown, and in most cases, the cause has been identified as an imbalance of neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed in translational brain research. Brain diseases are more complex than systemic diseases. Consequently, special attention should be given to interdisciplinary efforts that provide a comprehensive view of the entire brain. Table 3 summarizes the available drugs for psychiatric disorders and other brain diseases, excluding treatments that are also used for various psychiatric diseases.

### Serotonergic system and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a potential susceptibility locus at the 5-HT (1B) receptor gene in 273 nuclear families from a multi-centre sample [^112Yjn6X]. Molecular Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous disorder, which usually becomes apparent during the first few years of childhood. Imbalance in dopamine neurotransmission has been suggested as a factor predisposing to ADHD. However, evidence has suggested an interaction between dopamine and serotonin systems in the pathophysiology of the disorder. Studies using selective agonists of the different 5-HT receptors microinjected into selected brain structures have shown a positive modulating effect on the functional activities of the mesotelencephalic dopaminergic system. This suggests that some of the genetic predisposition to ADHD might be due to DNA variation at serotonin system genes. In this study, we investigated polymorphisms in HTR(1B) and HTR(2A) (which encode the serotonin receptors 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(2A) respectively) in a European ADHD sample. Using haplotype based haplotype relative risk (HHRR) and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analyses, we observed significant preferential transmission of the allele 861G of the HTR(1B) in the total sample (for HHRR; χ² = 7.4, P = 0.0065 and TDT; (χ² = 6.4, P = 0.014). Analysis of HTR(2A) failed to reveal evidence of association or linkage between the His452Tyr polymorphism and ADHD in the total sample. However, a significantly increased transmission of the allele 452His was observed in the Irish sample alone (χ² = 4.9, P = 0.026). These preliminary data suggest an important role for the serotonin system in the development of ADHD. Further studies, preferentially including different ethnic groups are required to substantiate these findings.

### Genetic variations influence brain changes in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^116822fB]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Genetic changes in ADHD

Studies on the family, sibling, and adoption indicate that ADHD has significant genetic components. First and second-degree ADHD families are at higher risk for the disorder. Different molecular genetic studies have been conducted to identify ADHD risk genes (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Risk genes and associated altered brain regions in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Multiples genes are associated with altered structural and functional brain changes, mainly in the frontal lobe, basal ganglion, limbic system, and cerebellum.

Numerous meta-analysis studies have found significant relationships in the multiple genes for common genetic polymorphisms/variants –. Though several multiple twin studies found that heritability estimates in ADHD could reach up to 90%, it is still challenging to identify ADHD risk genes, due to the complex and polygenic nature of ADHD pathophysiology. Besides genetic factors, many external risk factors, such as environment and possible interactions between gene and environment, are also associated with the increased risk of ADHD. Genes encoding for dopamine and serotonin transporters are associated with ADHD (Fig. 3) –.

### Overview and neurobiology of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1144u47n]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) impairs millions of people worldwide, both the prevalence and existence of the disorder are being reevaluated at the phenotypic level. To safeguard against overdiagnosis, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), demands that individuals with ADHD have pervasive impairment, that is, impairment in more than 1 setting. However, the appropriateness of the DSM-IV classification of ADHD is also undergoing reevaluation. Like the symptoms of a developmental disability, the symptoms of ADHD must be evaluated in the context of age-based norms; therefore, the current criteria for ADHD, which are not age referenced, may minimize the rate of persistence of ADHD into adulthood. In an effort to better understand the pathophysiology of ADHD, recent research has focused on identifying the etiology of ADHD. These studies have revealed that the disorder is highly heritable and may be associated with neurobiological deficits in the prefrontal cortex and related subcortical systems. Etiologic studies have also identified candidate genes and prenatal and perinatal risk factors for ADHD. As the causes and course of ADHD are better understood, a new generation of medications is being developed for the disorder. Although stimulants are often effective in reducing the symptoms of the disorder, as a class they have limitations such as a lack of 24-hour-a-day coverage, unwanted side effects, potential for abuse, and lessened effectiveness in the context of some comorbidities. Therefore, the treatment characteristics of newer, more selective treatments such as atomoxetine should continue to be explored in ADHD.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic, pharmacogenetic and biochemical studies [^114W8bZp]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

ADHD is a complex and heterogeneous disorder and its etiology is not yet completely understood. Despite evidences that environmental factors have an important role in its etiology, classical genetics studies support a strong genetic contribution for ADHD with the heritability estimates averaging 75% in children. Genetic liability comprises a polygenic liability with both common and rare variants involved. Individuals with large, rare copy-number variations (CNVs) require less loading of multiple common genetic risk variants for developing ADHD.

In adults, initial heritability estimates of ADHD were substantially lower (~30–50%), even though other evidence had suggested a stronger genetic component to the etiology of adult ADHD. A more recent review suggests that the low heritability of ADHD in adults is unlikely to reflect a true developmental change. Instead, the drop in heritability is better explained by rater effects related to a switch from using one rater for both twins in a pair (parent/teacher) in childhood, to relying on self-ratings (where each twin rates themselves) of ADHD symptoms in adulthood. When rater effects are addressed using cross-informant approaches, the heritability of ADHD in adults appears to be comparable to the heritability of ADHD in childhood. Many candidate gene association studies, several meta-analyses including the most recent, genome-wide association (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP-GWA) and CNV studies, summarized in some recent reviews, have been reported for children with ADHD. These studies have implicated dopaminergic, serotoninergic and glutamatergic signaling along with synaptic vesicle, neurite outgrowth and cell adhesion pathways. A recent review of the literature on ADHD pharmacogenetics in childhood supported a significant effect of neurodevelopmental and noradrenergic systems in the MPH response, whereas no or contrasting results were obtained for dopaminergic and serotonininergic signaling, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), metabolic enzymes. Finally, the results of a series of meta-analyses reviewed in Scassellati et al. on biochemical studies performed in childhood, showed a significant association with peripheral biomarkers linked to monoaminergic pathways and to the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis.

### Candidate gene studies of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^113U94aA]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

A growing body of behavioral and molecular genetics literature has indicated that the development of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. Family, twin, and adoption studies provide compelling evidence that genes play a strong role in mediating susceptibility to ADHD. Molecular genetic studies suggest that the genetic architecture of ADHD is complex, while the handful of genome-wide scans conducted thus far is not conclusive. In contrast, the many candidate gene studies of ADHD have produced substantial evidence implicating several genes in the etiology of the disorder. For the 8 genes for which the same variant has been studied in 3 or more case-control or family-based studies, 7 show statistically significant evidence of association with ADHD based on pooled odds ratios across studies: the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4), the dopamine D5 receptor gene (DRD5), the dopamine transporter gene (DAT), the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene (DBH), the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), the serotonin receptor 1B gene (HTR1B), and the synaptosomal-associated protein 25 gene (SNAP25). Recent pharmacogenetic studies have correlated treatment nonresponse with particular gene markers, while preclinical studies have increased our understanding of gene expression paradigms and potential analogs for human trials. This literature review discusses the relevance and implications of genetic associations with ADHD for clinical practice and future research.

### Candidate genetic pathways for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show association to hyperactive / impulsive symptoms in children with ADHD [^111G5cDp]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Because multiple genes with small effect sizes are assumed to play a role in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) etiology, considering multiple variants within the same analysis likely increases the total explained phenotypic variance, thereby boosting the power of genetic studies. This study investigated whether pathway-based analysis could bring scientists closer to unraveling the biology of ADHD.

Method

The pathway was described as a predefined gene selection based on a well-established database or literature data. Common genetic variants in pathways involved in dopamine/norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission and genes involved in neuritic outgrowth were investigated in cases from the International Multicentre ADHD Genetics (IMAGE) study. Multivariable analysis was performed to combine the effects of single genetic variants within the pathway genes. Phenotypes were DSM-IV symptom counts for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (n = 871) and symptom severity measured with the Conners Parent (n = 930) and Teacher (n = 916) Rating Scales.

Results

Summing genetic effects of common genetic variants within the pathways showed a significant association with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms ((p)empirical = .007) but not with inattentive symptoms ((p)empirical = .73). Analysis of parent-rated Conners hyperactive/impulsive symptom scores validated this result ((p)empirical = .0018). Teacher-rated Conners scores were not associated. Post hoc analyses showed a significant contribution of all pathways to the hyperactive/impulsive symptom domain (dopamine/norepinephrine, (p)empirical = .0004; serotonin, (p)empirical = .0149; neuritic outgrowth, (p)empirical = .0452).

Conclusion

The present analysis shows an association between common variants in 3 genetic pathways and the hyperactive/impulsive component of ADHD. This study demonstrates that pathway-based association analyses, using quantitative measurements of ADHD symptom domains, can increase the power of genetic analyses to identify biological risk factors involved in this disorder.

### Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene variants associated with ADHD [^113twH2w]. Molecular Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Genetic and pharmacological studies have emphasised the role of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a possible etiologic factor in the development of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin from tryptophan. Originally, the TPH gene was thought to be widely expressed, but a second form of TPH, TPH2, was recently identified and the TPH2 gene was found to be solely expressed in the brain. We examined eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the TPH2 gene for association with ADHD in 179 Irish nuclear families. Transmission disequilibrium test analysis revealed significant association between the T allele of marker rs1843809 with the disorder (χ² = 12.2, P = 0.0006, OR = 2.36). Stratifying data by the sex of the transmitting parent showed that this association was enhanced when paternal transmission was considered (OR = 3.7). In addition, several haplotypes (all including the associated marker) were associated with ADHD. These preliminary findings suggest that TPH2 is a susceptibility locus for ADHD. Further confirmation, preferably from different ethnic groups, is required to firmly implicate TPH2 in the pathophysiology of ADHD.

Fig. 3
Major pathways related to the pathogenesis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (dopaminergic and serotonergic).

Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons are primarily located respectively in the midbrain and hindbrain and control various functions. Anomalies in dopamine and/or serotonin levels contribute to the symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Figure inspired from the manuscript by Fontana BD et al. 2019).

An International Multi-site ADHD Genetics (IMAGE) project performed an in-depth analysis of more than 50 candidate genes from European multicenter samples of around 674 families showed significant associations of several candidate genes with ADHD. Another meta-analysis based on seven linkage studies showed that the small arm of chromosome 16 might be associated with ADHD symptoms. A study using cadherin 13 (CDH13) knock-out mouse model observed that CDH13 modulates the synaptic activity of hippocampal interneurons and cognitive domains and it was suggested to be a risk gene for ADHD. A linkage analysis-based study on multigenerational families identified the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L3 (ADGRL3) gene (previously known as LPHN3) variants susceptibility in developing ADHD. Another GWAS found enrichment of rare copy number variants, such as CHRNA7, NPY genes, and genes encoding for glutamate receptors, suggesting that rare variant involvement in ADHD neuropsychobiology is very mixed and is similar to a common variant contribution. ADHD-related genes are spread across the entire genome but, as found on clustering analysis, they tend to be clustered into specific functional groups. A study using group comparison enrichment analyses observed that enriched functions for the ADHD-GWAS association were linked to neuronal projections, synaptic structures, nervous system structures, neuronal morphogenesis, cell–cell interaction, glutamatergic signaling. Another GWAS on five common psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, found the association of calcium channel signaling genes with multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders, suggesting that gene variants in calcium channel activity may have pleiotropic effects in the evolution of ADHD neuropsychobiology.

### The serotonin 5-HT1B receptor gene and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^114a4rkv]. Molecular Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Recent research has suggested that serotonin, in addition to dopamine, may be involved in the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Serotonin regulates dopaminergic neurotransmission in some areas of the brain via several 5-HT receptors including 5-HT1B. Animal studies have suggested the involvement of the 5-HT1B receptors in locomotor behaviour. For these reasons, we hypothesized that the 5-HT1B receptor gene may be a good candidate for genetic studies of ADHD. We tested for linkage disequilibrium between the 5-HT1B G861C polymorphism and ADHD in 115 families using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). We found evidence for a trend towards excess transmission of the 861G allele (χ² = 2.91, P = 0.09) that when further analysed for parental allele transmissions exhibited significantly greater paternal transmission of the G allele (χ² = 4.80, P = 0.03) to the affected child. Although preliminary, results from this study provide additional evidence that serotonin genes may be important risk factors for the development of ADHD.

### Mutations in sphingolipid metabolism genes are associated with ADHD [^1177ZNMw]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined as a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent, cross-situational and developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness that leads to various degrees of functional impairment. It is the most common neuro-behavioral disorder in childhood, affecting 5.29–7.1% of children and adolescents. Prevalence in adults is also high, with best estimates between 2.5 and 2.8% worldwide.

Genetic factors account for ~75–80% of the phenotypic variance of the ADHD phenotype –. Interesting results have emerged from studies of candidate genes involved in the monoamine neurotransmitter systems, which had been implicated in the pathophysiology of ADHD by the mechanisms of action of drugs used in clinical management. Family-based and case–control studies of candidate genes have replicated significant linkage and/or association between ADHD and variants in dopamine receptors (DRD4, DRD5), dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), serotonin receptor (HTR1B), and proteins involved in synaptic transmission (SNAP25, LPHN3). all of them contributing to small- to medium-sized effects. The first 12 genome-wide significant ADHD risk loci were published recently. Several of the identified loci are located in or near genes (e.g. FOXP2, SORCS3, and DUSP6) that implicate neurodevelopmental processes likely to be relevant to ADHD pathogenesis. Historically, the lack of success in identifying genome-wide significant variants supports the complex multifactorial etiology of ADHD and likely reflects important biases in patient ascertainment and phenotyping strategies. Therefore, continued efforts are required to elucidate the missing heritability of ADHD.

No significant group differences in [11C]MADAM binding potential were noted.

### What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? [^116icnvP]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Causes of ADHD

ADHD, like other common medical and psychiatric disorders (eg, asthma, schizophrenia), is influenced by multiple genes, non-inherited factors and their interplay. There is no single cause of ADHD and exposure to a risk factor does not necessarily result in disorder. This means that any given risk factor will only be observed in a proportion of cases and will also be found in those who are unaffected. Also, risk factors that contribute to the origins of ADHD might not necessarily be the same as those that influence its course and outcomes.

A further complexity is that genetic factors can exert indirect risk effects through interplay with environmental factors. Genes can alter sensitivity to environmental risks (gene–environment interaction), for example, environmental toxins or psychosocial adversity. Inherited factors can also influence the probability of exposure to certain environmental risks (gene–environment correlation; see later). This means that environmental and genetic risk effects cannot be considered as entirely distinct.

### Mechanism of action of agents used in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1153AoQ9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Several medications have been demonstrated effective in treating individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There appears to be some commonality in the physiologic mechanisms of action of these agents relevant to the treatment of ADHD. Either direct or indirect attenuation of dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission appears related to both the stimulant and nonstimulant medications efficacious in ADHD. However, important differences exist both between and within the specific classes of agents. Elucidating the various mechanisms of action of ADHD medications may lead to better choices in matching potential response to the characteristics (e.g., genotype) of individuals.

### A case-control genome-wide association study of ADHD discovers a novel association with the tenascin R (TNR) gene [^114J1jau]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder of childhood. It is typically characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention, impulsivity and/or hyperactivity. Longitudinal studies indicate that approximately 66–77% of individuals who experience childhood ADHD continue to experience at least subthreshold symptoms of ADHD that significantly impact adulthood functioning. The global prevalence of ADHD has been estimated at 5.2–7.2%. Although the aetiology of ADHD is not well defined, genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the disorder. Despite minor disparities across individual samples and study designs, the overall heritability of ADHD is estimated at 70–90%.

The efficiency of indirect dopamine agonists in reducing the symptoms of ADHD led to the development of the 'dopamine hypothesis of ADHD', which postulated that dysregulated dopamine signalling is central to the pathophysiology of ADHD. Putative disruption of other monoamines such as noradrenaline and serotonin in ADHD has also been proposed. Accordingly, genetic markers mapped to these monoamine pathways have historically been pursued as candidate genes for ADHD. Although a number of replicated findings exist within this candidate gene literature, a key limitation remains the a priori selection of genes based upon incomplete knowledge of the biology of ADHD, which may ultimately impede the identification of novel risk markers.

### An updated review on animal models to study attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^112wkubm]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder affecting both children and adolescents. Individuals with ADHD experience heterogeneous problems, such as difficulty in attention, behavioral hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Recent studies have shown that complex genetic factors play a role in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders. Animal models with clear hereditary traits are crucial for studying the molecular, biological, and brain circuit mechanisms underlying ADHD. Owing to their well-managed genetic origins and the relative simplicity with which the function of neuronal circuits is clearly established, models of mice can help learn the mechanisms involved in ADHD. Therefore, in this review, we highlighting the important genetic animal models that can be used to study ADHD.

### The emerging neurobiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: the key role of the prefrontal association cortex [^112YdvDB]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and locomotor hyperactivity. Recent advances in neurobiology, imaging, and genetics have led to a greater understanding of the etiology and treatment of ADHD. Studies have found that ADHD is associated with weaker function and structure of prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits, especially in the right hemisphere. The prefrontal association cortex plays a crucial role in regulating attention, behavior, and emotion, with the right hemisphere specialized for behavioral inhibition. The PFC is highly dependent on the correct neurochemical environment for proper function: noradrenergic stimulation of postsynaptic α₂A adrenoceptors and dopaminergic stimulation of D₁ receptors is necessary for optimal prefrontal function. ADHD is associated with genetic changes that weaken catecholamine signaling and, in some patients, with slowed PFC maturation. Effective pharmacologic treatments for ADHD all enhance catecholamine signaling in the PFC and strengthen its regulation of attention and behavior. Recent animal studies show that therapeutic doses of stimulant medications preferentially increase norepinephrine and, to a lesser extent, dopamine, in the PFC. These doses reduce locomotor activity and improve PFC regulation of attention and behavior through enhanced catecholamine stimulation of alpha-2A and D1 receptors. These findings in animals are consistent with improved PFC function in normal human subjects and, more prominently, in patients with ADHD. Thus, a highly cohesive story is emerging regarding the etiology and treatment of ADHD.

### Association between cord blood metabolites in tryptophan pathway and childhood risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^111c3P3L]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social and communication disabilities as well as restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests with 1 in 54 children in the US diagnosed with ASD. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), another neurodevelopmental disorder, is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, or both, with a prevalence of about 8.8% in the U.S. The etiology of ASD and ADHD is unknown, although both disorders have genetic as well as environmental underpinnings, including prenatal and perinatal factors. A well-observed phenomenon is that both of these conditions often co-occur and are known to share symptoms. However, it is unclear whether ASD and ADHD share a molecular pathway.

Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, serves as a precursor to neurotransmitters through multiple metabolic pathways (Fig. 1). Some of these are well known such as serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), and melatonin and have been implicated in a number of conditions including depression, mood disorders, ASD, and ADHD.

Fig. 1
Pathway of tryptophan and its metabolites.

Beyond tryptophan, serotonin, and melatonin, very few studies to date have assessed other less known tryptophan metabolites, especially in the context of neurodevelopmental conditions. One such metabolite is 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTX) which is shown to exhibit diurnal rhythm in humans and animal models. Emerging evidence from clinical trials and other studies suggests that 5-MTX may be involved in major depressive disorder (MDD), developmental processes in humans and possesses cortical electrical activity. While studies have hypothesized 5-MTX's potential role in ASD, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies have formally examined this association in a prospective birth cohort, especially along with other metabolites in the tryptophan pathway.

Built on the previous observations and to address the major knowledge gaps, we set out to assess the association of tryptophan and select metabolites (serotonin, 5-MTX, 5-HTP, N-acetyltryptophan) measured in the cord blood plasma collected at birth and subsequent risk of physician diagnosis of ASD and ADHD. We will leverage a well-defined prospective birth cohort, which allows us to examine the temporal and dose-response associations of cord tryptophan metabolites and the risk of ASD, ADHD, and other developmental disabilities (DD), considering the extent of comorbidity between these conditions possibly suggesting a common underlying etiology.

### A positron emission tomography study of nigro-striatal dopaminergic mechanisms underlying attention: implications for ADHD and its treatment [^111emPUU]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Despite its declining prevalence with age, ADHD symptoms in some affected patients persist into adulthood, affecting ∼2.5% of the adult population. The clinical effectiveness of stimulants such as methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD suggests a putative role for both dopamine and noradrenaline in the manifestation of the disorder. However, despite decades of genetic, clinical and neuroimaging research, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying the disorder and its treatment remain poorly understood.

Long-standing cognitive theories of ADHD postulate a deficiency in top–down cognitive control processes underpinning attention and executive function deficits (for review see). Providing support to these theories, one of the best replicated findings in ADHD is that of reduced grey matter volume in the catecholamine-rich fronto-striato-cerebellar circuits known to subserve these cognitive functions. Notwithstanding the growing evidence on fronto-striatal dysfunction and the efficacy of stimulant drugs in the clinical management of patients with ADHD, the precise role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of the disorder is still unclear. Indeed, in vivo nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have often yielded inconsistent findings regarding the state of the dopamine system in this patient population. A recent set of case–control PET studies in adult medication-naïve patients found that ADHD is associated with reduced dopamine transporter and dopamine D₂/D₃ receptor availability in selected brain regions of the left hemisphere, including the nucleus accumbens, caudate and midbrain. Although these impressive studies had substantial numbers of patients, there was considerable overlap with the control population in terms of both dopamine receptor and transporter availabilities, implying that the diagnostic utility of these markers is limited.

### Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children [^114M3dJx]. Health Psychology Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:

- **Definition**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by pervasive and impairing symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity according to DSM-V.
- **Pathophysiology**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is caused by biological (genetics, brain structure and their influence on neuropsychology) and environmental (pregnancy or birth complications, exposure to environmental toxins, chaotic parenting, and diet) factors.
- **Disease course**: The interplay of environmental, genetic factors, and dysfunction in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and cerebellum results in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, which results in clinical manifestations of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is associated with poor motor coordination, impaired academic functioning, unintentional physical injury, sleep disturbances, and poor QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is not associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality.

### Management of ADHD in adults [^114Fbm3h]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Although first identified in children in the 19th century, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults was not described in the literature until 1976. The symptoms of adult ADHD resemble the symptoms of childhood ADHD, but symptom intensity, especially hyperactivity, may decrease over time. However, due to the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood, a normal day is extremely complicated for the ADHD adult. Molecular genetics and neuroimaging studies confirm that ADHD is a heterogeneous, neurobiological disorder, mainly of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways. Trials of pharmacologic treatments in adults with ADHD have produced mixed results due to considerable variability in diagnostic criteria, dosing, and response. This article reviews the history, neurobiology, and pharmacologic management of adult ADHD.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111RLS1t]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; also known as hyperkinetic disorder) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that affects children and adults worldwide. ADHD has a predominantly genetic aetiology that involves common and rare genetic variants. Some environmental correlates of the disorder have been discovered but causation has been difficult to establish. The heterogeneity of the condition is evident in the diverse presentation of symptoms and levels of impairment, the numerous co-occurring mental and physical conditions, the various domains of neurocognitive impairment, and extensive minor structural and functional brain differences. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard diagnostic criteria. Curative treatments for ADHD do not exist but evidence-based treatments substantially reduce symptoms and/or functional impairment. Medications are effective for core symptoms and are usually well tolerated. Some non-pharmacological treatments are valuable, especially for improving adaptive functioning. Clinical and neurobiological research is ongoing and could lead to the creation of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder.

### Neuroimaging of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: can new imaging findings be integrated in clinical practice? [^115itQvT]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Recent advances in neuroimaging research have helped elucidate the neurobiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the mechanisms by which medications used to treat ADHD exert their effects. The complex nature and array of imaging techniques, however, present challenges for the busy clinician in assessing possible clinical uses of brain imaging. Even though currently there are no accepted uses for imaging in diagnosing ADHD (other than ruling out identifiable medical or neurologic conditions that may mimic ADHD), this review introduces the main imaging techniques used to study ADHD, identifies relevant complexities facing psychiatric researchers in implementing neuroimaging techniques for clinical purposes, and provides benchmarks to help determine when imaging modalities have advanced to a point that they are deemed clinically useful.

### Understanding the causal relationships of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder with mental disorders and suicide attempt: a network mendelian randomisation study [^1117H9yx]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this two-sample network MR analysis we evaluated the causal links between ADHD and a range of psychiatric disorders. We identified an impact of ADHD on PTSD, suicide attempt and AN and a bidirectional association between ADHD and MDD. Regarding the bidirectional relationship between ADHD and MDD, a common underlying pathophysiological pathway can be hypothesised, so that both mental disorders may separately and jointly increase the risk of suicide attempts or PTSD. In this context, however, the increased risk of AN can be attributed entirely to ADHD. There was no evidence for a causal link between ADHD and bipolar disorders, anxiety or schizophrenia.

ADHD and MDD

A number of studies consistently found that approximately 35–50% of adults with ADHD experience one or more major depressive episodes during their lifetime; this percentage is significantly higher than the risk for a major depressive episode in the general population (approximately 15%). Data from family studies suggest a familial association and shared genetic risk between ADHD and depression. The present finding that ADHD is associated with MDD underlines previous results from observationaland a recent MR analysis. Imaging studies have shown that patients with ADHD exhibit alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits and demonstrate weaker activation of the PFC when attempting to regulate attention and behaviour. The PFC requires optimal levels of norepinephrine and dopamine for proper functioning. Genetic studies have consistently found alterations in genes involved in catecholamine transmission in patients with ADHD. The monoamine hypothesis of depression postulates that depression is caused by decreased modulatory function of serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine in the brain. Based on the biological aspects of depression and ADHD, the two disorders might share similar pathophysiological brain regions including decreased activity in the PFC, amygdala and hippocampus regions. Anhedonia, the neurobiology of which is complex and involves disruption of pathways regulating reward and motivation, represents a major feature of both MDD and ADHD. The activity of various components of the limbic–cortical–striatal–pallidal–thalamic pathway correlates with hedonic tone in healthy individuals and is altered in patients with MDD and ADHD.

Note that the observed bidirectional relationship between ADHD and MDD should be seen with caution. ADHD often develops at an early age, which is why the majority of cases considered in the GWAS were diagnosed in childhood (14 878 in childhood vs 6961 in adulthood).MR estimates the mean lifetime effect and is not able to model effects that occur within a specific time period. Thus, the reverse direction may be biased.

### Recent advances in the genetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^114vexCi]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

In the past few years, interest in the molecular genetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has grown enormously, with many groups searching for susceptibility genes, often through large collaborative efforts facilitated by the International ADHD Genetics Consortium. Association findings for several candidate genes within the dopaminergic system, the DRD4 and DRD5 receptor genes and the dopamine transporter gene, DAT1, have been well replicated, and the first of several ongoing genome linkage scan study results have been published. Current challenges in this field are to identify the actual functional variant(s) in these genes conferring susceptibility and other genetic and environmental risk factors for ADHD.

### Druggable genome in attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and its co-morbid conditions. new avenues for treatment [^1179TF8k]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and highly heritable childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder that often persists into adulthood. The prevalence of the disorder in children is 6.5%, while in adults the estimates vary between 2.5 and 3.4%. ADHD patients are at high risk of experiencing difficulties in their education and social integration, elevated rates of incarceration, unemployment and accidental deaths, all resulting in high societal and economic burden. To date, no treatments cure ADHD, although available therapies offer symptomatic relief.

Current management of ADHD is based on either non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic treatments as well as the combination of the two. The non-pharmacologic treatments usually involve psychological and/or behavioural therapies, while the pharmacologic interventions include stimulant and/or non-stimulant drugs. For ADHD treatment, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the stimulants methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine (AMP) along with three non-stimulants: atomoxetine, clonidine and guanfacine. In many guidelines, MPH and AMP are the first-line agents for ADHD pharmacotherapy, exerting their primary effect by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine activity. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor, while both clonidine and guanfacine are alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists. Although all the pharmaceuticals used to manage ADHD are believed to act on biological pathways underlying the disorder, their complete mechanisms of action remain unknown, as are the causal biological mechanisms of ADHD.

### Altered interregional molecular associations of the serotonin transporter in attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder assessed with PET [^116hPDPt]. Human Brain Mapping (2017). Low credibility.

Altered serotonergic neurotransmission has been found to cause impulsive and aggressive behavior, as well as increased motor activity, all exemplifying key symptoms of ADHD. The main objectives of this positron emission tomography (PET) study were to investigate the serotonin transporter binding potential (SERT BP ND) in patients with ADHD and to assess associations of SERT BP ND between the brain regions. 25 medication-free patients with ADHD (age ± SD; 32.39 ± 10.15; 10 females) without any psychiatric comorbidity and 25 age and sex matched healthy control subjects (33.74 ± 10.20) were measured once with PET and the highly selective and specific radioligand [11 C]DASB. SERT BP ND maps in nine a priori defined ROIs exhibiting high SERT binding were compared between groups by means of a linear mixed model. Finally, adopted from structural and functional connectivity analyses, we performed correlational analyses using regional SERT binding potentials to examine molecular interregional associations between all selected ROIs. We observed significant differences in the interregional correlations between the precuneus and the hippocampus in patients with ADHD compared to healthy controls, using SERT BP ND of the investigated ROIs (P < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). When correlating SERT BP ND and age in the ADHD and the healthy control group, we confirmed an age-related decline in brain SERT binding in the thalamus and insula (R² = 0.284, R² = 0.167, Ps < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). The results show significantly different interregional molecular associations of the SERT expression for the precuneus with hippocampus in patients with ADHD, indicating presumably altered functional coupling. Altered interregional coupling between brain regions might be a sensitive approach to demonstrate functional and molecular alterations in psychiatric conditions.

Serotonin is under-researched in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), despite accumulating evidence for its involvement in impulsiveness and the disorder. Serotonin further modulates temporal discounting (TD), which is typically abnormal in ADHD relative to healthy subjects, underpinned by reduced fronto-striato-limbic activation. This study tested whether a single acute dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine up-regulates and normalizes reduced fronto-striato-limbic neurofunctional activation in ADHD during TD.

Method

Twelve boys with ADHD were scanned twice in a placebo-controlled randomized design under either fluoxetine (between 8 and 15 mg, titrated to weight) or placebo while performing an individually adjusted functional magnetic resonance imaging TD task. Twenty healthy controls were scanned once. Brain activation was compared in patients under either drug condition and compared to controls to test for normalization effects.

Results

Repeated-measures whole-brain analysis in patients revealed significant up-regulation with fluoxetine in a large cluster comprising right inferior frontal cortex, insula, premotor cortex and basal ganglia, which further correlated trend-wise with TD performance, which was impaired relative to controls under placebo, but normalized under fluoxetine. Fluoxetine further down-regulated default mode areas of posterior cingulate and precuneus. Comparisons between controls and patients under either drug condition revealed normalization with fluoxetine in right premotor-insular-parietal activation, which was reduced in patients under placebo.

Conclusions

The findings show that a serotonin agonist up-regulates activation in typical ADHD dysfunctional areas in right inferior frontal cortex, insula and striatum as well as down-regulating default mode network regions in the context of impulsivity and TD.

### A candidate gene analysis of methylphenidate response in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1177hGYt]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examines the potential role of candidate genes in moderating treatment effects of methylphenidate (MPH) in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Eighty-two subjects with ADHD aged 6 to 17 years participated in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, crossover titration trial of immediate release MPH three times daily. The subjects were assessed on a variety of parent and clinician ratings and a laboratory math test. Data reduction based on principal components analysis identified statistically derived efficacy and side effect outcomes.

Results

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom response was predicted by polymorphisms at the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) intron 2 VNTR (p = .01), with a suggested trend for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (p = .04). Gene × dose interactions were noted on math test outcomes for the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) promoter (p = .008), DRD4 exon 3 VNTR (p = .006), and SLC6A4 promoter insertion/deletion polymorphism (5HTTLPR) (p = .02). Irritability was predicted by COMT (p = .02). Vegetative symptoms were predicted by 5HTTLPR (p = .003). No significant effects were noted for the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) or synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25).

Conclusions

This article confirms and expands previous studies suggesting that genes moderate ADHD treatment response. The ADHD outcomes are not unitary but reflect both behavioral and learning domains that are likely influenced by different genes. Future research should emphasize candidate gene and genome-wide association studies in larger samples, symptom reduction as well as side effects outcomes, and responses over full therapeutic dose ranges to assess differences in both gene and gene × dose interactive effects.

### Treatment strategies for ADHD: an evidence-based guide to select optimal treatment [^112ijMBk]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing disorder affecting children, adolescents, and adults. Several treatment strategies are available that can successfully ameliorate symptoms, ranging from pharmacological to dietary interventions. Due to the increasing range of available options, an informed selection or prioritization of treatments is becoming harder for clinicians. This review aims to provide an evidence-based appraisal of the literature on ADHD treatment, supplemented by expert opinion on plausibility. We outline proposed mechanisms of action of established pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments, and we review targets of novel treatments. The most relevant evidence supporting efficacy and safety of each treatment strategy is discussed. We review the individualized features of the patient that should guide the selection of treatments in a shared decision-making continuum. We provide guidance for optimizing initiation of treatment and follow-up of patients in clinical settings.

### A population-based imaging genetics study of inattention / hyperactivity: basal ganglia and genetic pathways [^11113a37]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 1 of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, little is known about the neurobiology. Clinical studies suggest basal ganglia morphology plays a role. Furthermore, hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms have recently been linked to genetic pathways involved in dopamine/norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission and neuritic outgrowth. We aimed to assess the association between ADHD symptoms, basal ganglia volume, and the 3 proposed genetic pathways in a pediatric population-based sample. With this, we aimed to investigate the generalizability of earlier clinical findings to the general population.

Method

This study included a population-based sample of 1,871 children with data on ADHD symptoms and genetic data, and 344 children with additional neuroimaging data. Regression analyses between ADHD symptom severity and volumetric data of the basal ganglia were performed. Also, gene-set analyses investigating the association between both ADHD symptom severity and basal ganglia volume with the dopamine/norepinephrine, serotonin, and neuritic outgrowth pathways were performed.

Results

More inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms were associated with a smaller volume of the putamen (β = -0.13, p = .034), which was regarded as trend-level after correction for multiple testing. Stratified analyses showed a stronger putamen-hyperactivity association in children with clinical scores, although a similar trend was visible in the nonclinical subsample. The genetic pathways were not related to either ADHD symptoms or basal ganglia volume.

Conclusion

ADHD symptoms were marginally related to putamen volume in our population-based sample. We found no evidence for a role of dopamine/norepinephrine, serotonin, or neuritic outgrowth genetic pathways in ADHD symptom severity.

### Neuroimaging of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: current neuroscience-informed perspectives for clinicians [^113xHbkm]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The neuroimaging literature on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is growing rapidly. Here, we provide a critical overview of neuroimaging studies published recently, highlighting perspectives that may be of relevance for clinicians. After a comprehensive search of PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and EMBASE, we located 41 pertinent papers published between January 2011 and April 2012, comprising both structural and functional neuroimaging studies. This literature is increasingly contributing to the notion that the pathophysiology of ADHD reflects abnormal interplay among large-scale brain circuits. Moreover, recent studies have begun to reveal the mechanisms of action of pharmacological treatment. Finally, imaging studies with a developmental perspective are revealing the brain correlates of ADHD over the lifespan, complementing clinical observations on the phenotypic continuity and discontinuity of the disorder. However, despite the increasing potential to eventually inform clinical practice, current imaging studies do not have validated applications in day-to-day clinical practice. Although novel analytical techniques are likely to accelerate the pace of translational applications, at the present we advise caution regarding inappropriate commercial misuse of imaging techniques in ADHD.

### Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112tuRA4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has expanded beyond stimulant medications to include alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. These agents exert their actions through presynaptic stimulation and likely involve facilitation of dopamine and noradrenaline neurotransmission, both of which are thought to play critical roles in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Furthermore, frontostriatal dysfunction giving rise to neuropsychological weaknesses has been well-established in patients with ADHD and may explain how alpha-2 agents exert their beneficial effects. In the following review, we consider relevant neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD with respect to why alpha-2 agents may be effective in treating this condition. We also review new formulations of alpha-2 agonists, emerging data on their use in ADHD, and implications for clinical practice. Integrating knowledge of pathophysiologic mechanisms and mechanisms of drug action may inform our medication choices and facilitate treatment of ADHD and related disorders.

### The role of phenotypes (diagnoses) in genetic studies of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and related child psychopathology [^114L78M8]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The new medical genetics and its molecular, population, and statistical techniques offer a cadre of tools that will improve the child psychiatrist's ability to diagnose and treat children who exhibit emotional and behavioral disorders. To take advantage of these remarkable advances, child psychiatry must enhance the likelihood that scientific expeditions into gene discovery are informed by a taxonomy that meets the criteria of a genetic nosology. As the taxonomic approach is refined, there may be more success in identifying genetic and environmental risks for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

### Machine learning classification of ADHD and HC by multimodal serotonergic data [^114J6pEq]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Genetics were expected to resolve disparate findings and explain heterogeneity, especially in ADHD with heritability estimated to exceed 70%. Some candidate gene studies associated variants implicated in the monoaminergic neurotransmission with ADHD, while the GWAS mostly highlighted genes that previously received less attention and are trickier to mesh with established etiologic theories. However, genetic studies did not impact ADHD diagnosis or treatment yet. Consequently, the translation to the clinic is lacking so far.

Neuroimaging and data-driven diagnostics that naturally come along with it were considered a corrective to the issues of subjective symptoms and heterogeneity. Basic tools like electro-encephalography (EEG) as well as more advanced techniques as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have now been fully established in ADHD research. While misbalance of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission is putatively the main biological substrate of ADHD, data on in vivo neuroreceptor binding are scarce due to the resource intensive nature of positron emission tomography (PET). While serotonergic neurotransmission is considered a pivotal substrate of affective disorders, the role of serotonin is not sufficiently understood in ADHD. Data from animal models as well as pharmacological and genetic studies point toward involvement of serotonin in ADHD and atomoxetine, a well-established drug in ADHD treatment, has been demonstrated to block the serotonin transporter in addition to its noradrenergic properties. Emotional dysregulation with mood swings and irritability, closely linked to serotonergic pathways, has lately been discussed as an additional core symptom of ADHD. Additionally, comorbid mood disorders are frequent in ADHD. Nevertheless, only few PET studies have targeted the serotonin system in ADHD so far. Earlier studies on the serotine transporter (SERT) binding did not support differences while recently altered interregional connectivity of SERT binding in the hippocampus and precuneus of ADHD patients compared to control subjects was demonstrated.

With the influx of advanced statistics into neuropsychiatric research, a copious amount of machine learning studies targeted ADHD classification. Algorithms based on EEG and MRI features reported accuracies ranging from hardly above chance level to beyond 90%. However, no studies combined imaging and genetic predictors up to this point. A reliable diagnostic tool for ADHD may be especially relevant to precision medicine in psychiatry. Since serotonergic transmission has to some extent been demonstrated to pilot the disorders, the focus of this study was classification of ADHD and healthy individuals based on multimodal serotonergic data.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic, pharmacogenetic and biochemical studies [^117Kap5w]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

It is intriguing that we found much more heterogeneity of results for the child studiescompared with the adult studies. This may be due to the fact that child samples comprise those who will persist with ADHD in adulthood and those who will not. Also, because biological and psychological development change markedly in childhood, differences in developmental stage could account for the greater heterogeneity in childhood. Another possibility is that there is greater phenotypic heterogeneity in the child samples. We could not, however, address these issues with the data available to us. Nevertheless, future studies should use these heterogeneity findings to better design studies and to more thoroughly report dimensions of phenotypic heterogeneity in their sample.

All data suffer from one important limitation, which is their specificity for ADHD. In fact SLC6A3, DRD4, COMT have each been associated to other psychiatric pathologies such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The issue of comorbidity is vital because it is pervasive among adults with ADHD. Despite this fact, many studies of Axis-I disorders in adults do not address comorbidity, possibly because, for many years, ADHD had been perceived as a childhood disorder. For example, most of the adult studies used the SCID as diagnostic interview. As ADHD is not included in the SCID, it would have been overlooked. Thus, the lack of specificity for genetic associations could be due to the fact that studies of these other disorders did not assess ADHD. Non-specificity also suggests the possibility that common biological mechanisms linked to dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems are shared among different psychiatric disorders, as was recently supported. Future studies should include ADHD in the assessment of comorbidities and also address the concomitant treatment of ADHD and comorbid Axis-I disorders, which is new and an important issue.

This work presents some limitations. (1) For some meta-analyses, the sample sizes were small and with only two studies. (2) Differential proportion of remitting and persisting ADHD within the children samples may also explain discordant results among studies. (3) With regard to the pharmacogenetic studies, one study included a placebo arm.

In conclusion, we found that there were not enough genetic, pharmacogenetic and biochemical studies of ADHD in adults and that more investigations are needed. Moreover we confirmed significant role of BAIAP2 and DHA in the etiology of ADHD exclusively in adults. Future research should be focused on the replication of these findings and to assess their specificity for ADHD.

### Evidence that variation at the serotonin transporter gene influences susceptibility to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): analysis and pooled analysis [^113DhCLv]. Molecular Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Reduced central serotonergic activity has been implicated in poor impulse regulation and aggressive behaviour in animals, adults and also young children.(1,2) Two recently published studies have implicated variation at a polymorphism in the promoter of the serotonin transporter (5HTT; hSERT) in influencing susceptibility to ADHD.(3,4) Consistent with these results we have also found a trend for the long allele of the promoter polymorphism to influence susceptibility to ADHD in a sample of 113 ADHD parent proband trios (65 transmissions vs 49 non-transmissions, χ² = 2.25, P = 0.13). A pooled analysis of our, and these published results demonstrated a significant over representation of the long allele of the promoter in ADHD probands compared to controls (χ² = 7.14, P = 0.008). We have also examined two other 5HTT polymorphisms (the VNTR in intron 2 and the 3' UTR SNP). TDT analysis demonstrated preferential transmission of the T allele of the 3' UTR SNP (χ² = 4.06, P = 0.04). In addition, ETDT analysis of haplotypes demonstrated significant preferential transmission of haplotypes containing the T allele of the 3' UTR SNP with the long allele of the promoter polymorphism (χ² = 13.18, 3 df, P = 0.004) and the 10 repeat of the VNTR (χ² = 8.77, 3 df, P = 0.03). This study provides further evidence for the possible involvement of the serotonin transporter in susceptibility to ADHD.

### The role of the gut-brain axis in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^113en6F6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the cause and development of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent studies have suggested an important role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) and intestinal microbiota in modulating the risk of ADHD. Here, the authors provide a brief overview of the clinical and biological picture of ADHD and how the GBA could be involved in its cause. They discuss key biological mechanisms involved in the GBA and how these may increase the risk of developing ADHD. Understanding these mechanisms may help to characterize novel treatment options via identification of disease biomarkers.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^112XeivE]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Areas for future research — there is a need to conduct research on topics pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in primary care, including assessment of ADHD and its common comorbidities; identification and/or development of reliable primary care instruments to assess functional impairment and monitor improvement; refinement of developmentally informed assessment procedures for evaluating ADHD in preschoolers; study of medications and other therapies used clinically but not FDA approved for ADHD; determination of the optimal schedule for monitoring children and adolescents with ADHD, including factors for adjusting by age, symptom severity, and progress reports; evaluation of the effectiveness and adverse effects of medications used in combination (such as a stimulant with an α-adrenergic agent, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or atomoxetine); evaluation of processes of care to assist PCCs to identify and treat comorbid conditions and of the effectiveness of various school-based interventions; comparisons of medication use and effectiveness across ages, including harms and benefits; development of methods to involve families and improve adherence to psychosocial and medication treatments; and research into psychosocial treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive training.

### Integrative proteomics and pharmacogenomics analysis of methylphenidate treatment response [^113feSE6]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely used stimulant for pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Its safety and efficacy for ADHD treatment in both adults and children are supported by meta-analyses; however, a considerable proportion of patients do not present a satisfactory response –. The main direct targets of MPH are the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET, respectively). In addition, the interactions of MPH with other proteins of these neurotransmission systems, such as dopaminergic, adrenergic, and AMPA receptors –, as well as the modulation of signaling of other neurotransmitters, including serotonin, glutamate, and GABA –, are suggested to be involved in its pharmacological actions. Moreover, several other pathways such as those involved in neuronal plasticity, energy metabolism, cell differentiation, circadian rhythm, and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation are also affected by MPH, as evidenced by transcriptomics and candidate gene/protein expression studies –. Although these studies used different methodologies, including in vivo and in vitro treatments, the overall evidence indicates that MPH actions involve a complex biological scenario, but the most relevant mechanisms for treatment response are still unclear.

### Dopamine transporter imaging in adult patients with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112jkfUP]. Psychiatry Research (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to provide in vivo evidence for the hypothesis that dopaminergic neurotransmission is altered in adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We used high-resolution brain-dedicated single-photon emission computed tomography and the dopamine transporter (DAT) marker [(123)I]FP-CIT in 17 adult treatment-naïve ADHD patients and 14 age-matched controls. Magnetic resonance imaging-based region of interest analysis was performed to quantify the DAT availability (expressed as a ratio of specific to non-displaceable binding, V(3)") in the striatum. Additionally, the specific radiotracer binding was assessed in the thalamus and the midbrain/brainstem regions (reflecting also the availability of the serotonin transporter to which [(123)I]FP-CIT binds with moderate affinity). In the striatal areas of the ADHD patients, a significantly reduced specific tracer binding was found (V(3)": 5.18 ± 0.98; controls 6.36 ± 1.34). In contrast, the specific [(123)I]FP-CIT binding did not differ from controls in the thalamus and midbrain/brainstem areas. These data indicate a reduced dopaminergic but not serotonergic transmitter reuptake function in adult ADHD. Further studies will have to deal with the question of whether these findings have the potential to influence treatment decisions in this complex disorder.

### Fundamentals of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: circuits and pathways [^1143NGZ3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Neuropsychological and imaging studies have shown that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections to striatum and cerebellum. Research in animals, in combination with observations of patients with cortical lesions, has shown that the PFC is critical for the regulation of behavior, attention, and affect using representational knowledge. The PFC is important for sustaining attention over a delay, inhibiting distraction, and dividing attention, while more posterior cortical areas are essential for perception and the allocation of attentional resources. The PFC in the right hemisphere is especially important for behavioral inhibition. Lesions to the PFC produce a profile of distractibility, forgetfulness, impulsivity, poor planning, and locomotor hyperactivity. The PFC is very sensitive to its neurochemical environment, and optimal levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are needed for proper PFC control of behavior and attention. Recent electrophysiologic studies in animals suggest that norepinephrine enhances "signals" through postsynaptic α₂A-adrenoceptors in PFC, while dopamine decreases "noise" through modest levels of D₁-receptor stimulation. Blockade of α₂-receptors in the monkey PFC re-creates the symptoms of ADHD, resulting in impaired working memory, increased impulsivity, and locomotor hyperactivity. Genetic alterations in catecholamine pathways may contribute to dysregulation of PFC circuits in this disorder. Stimulant medications may have some of their therapeutic effects by increasing endogenous stimulation of alpha2A-adrenoceptors and dopamine D1-receptors in the PFC, optimizing PFC regulation of behavior and attention.

### From structural disparities to neuropharmacology: a review of adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication treatment [^114QzqJ6]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early-onset disorder with many functional impairments and psychiatric comorbidities. Although no treatment fully mitigates impairments associated with ADHD, effective management is possible with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. The etiology and pathophysiology of ADHD are remarkably complex and the disorder is continuously distributed in the population. While these findings have been well documented in studies with predominantly white samples, ADHD may affect racial and ethnic minorities differentially, given diagnostic and treatment disparities. This review provides an updated overview of the epidemiology, etiology, neurobiology, and neuropharmacology of ADHD, addressing racial and ethnic disparities whereby data are available.

### DRD4 48 bp multiallelic variants as age-population-specific biomarkers in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112r1xwY]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Polymorphisms within key monoaminergic genes have been associated with the response to stimulant medication, albeit through conflicting evidence. This is mechanistically intuitive as MPH modulates extracellular catecholamine levels through interaction with dopaminergic, adrenergic and serotonergic system components. MPH inhibits catecholamine reuptake and modulates dopamine and norepinephrine levels, by binding to and blocking dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, thereby increasing extracellular concentrations.

The most recent pharmacogenetics meta-analysis on the DRD4 48 bp VNTRreported a significant association between MPH efficacy and the 4R allele. ADHD children with 4R/4R genotypes showed a 66% increased chance for efficacious MPH response; compared with others, where the efficacy measure was defined by changes at Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and Severity (CGI-S), and ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), whereas the 7R allele versus others did not reach significant association, even though a trend towards to poor MPH response was observed. Thus, these data are in line with the European susceptibility/protection role of 7R"long"/4R alleles, respectively. This is also consistent with the evidence that, as already evidenced, the 4R leads to higher receptor expression and increased sensitivity to dopamine, as compared with the 7R variant. MPH works by blocking the pre-synaptic dopamine transporter, thus increasing synaptic dopamine. Since 7R shows weaker transduction effects, the response to an increased level of synaptic dopamine will be weak. These results further implicate that the children with ADHD homozygotes for 4R alleles would require lower doses of MPH to achieve symptom improvement.

The identification of predictors of pharmacotherapy is needed and always in development, to further the clinical implementation of precision medicine. Of note, patients receiving precision treatment were found to be more medication adherent. Only half of children with ADHD followed pharmacological treatment regimens consistently over the course of a 5-year prospective study, and many reported adverse effects, and also the perceived tolerability may also be an impediment to adherence to treatments. Myer and colleaguesanalysed DNA variants in different genes linked to the effectiveness of MPH treatment. Leveraging individual genetic variants within not only DRD4 but also in SLC6A2, COMT, ADRA2A and SLC6A3 the authors presented a plausible multivariate to assess risk for poor MPH efficacy. It is possible that, as they suggest, a multivariate predictor would be sufficiently accurate for clinical use. Furthermore, collectively evaluating genetic variability among plausible biological markers for treatment success would eliminate trial-and-error treatment used today.

### Epistasis between neurochemical gene polymorphisms and risk for ADHD [^111ozYbR]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

A number of genes with function related to synaptic neurochemistry have been genetically associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, susceptibility to the development of common psychiatric disorders by single variants acting alone, can so far only explain a small proportion of the heritability of the phenotype. It has been postulated that the unexplained 'dark heritability' may at least in part be due to epistatic effects, which may account for the small observed marginal associations, and the difficulties with replication of positive findings. We undertook a comprehensive exploration of pair-wise interactions between genetic variants in 24 candidate genic regions involved in monoaminergic catabolism, anabolism, release, re-uptake and signal transmission in a sample of 177 parent-affected child trios using a case-only design and a case-pseudocontrol design using conditional logistic regression. Marker-pairs thresholded on interaction odds ratio (OR) and P-value are presented. We detected a number of interaction ORs > 4.0, including an interesting correlation between markers in the ADRA1B and DBH genes in affected individuals, and several further interesting but smaller effects. These effects are no larger than you would expect by chance under the assumption of independence of all pair-wise relations; however, independence is unlikely. Furthermore, the size of these effects is of interest and attempts to replicate these results in other samples are anticipated.

### The analysis of 51 genes in DSM-IV combined type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: association signals in DRD4, DAT1 and 16 other genes [^112fLT4o]. Molecular Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, starting in early childhood and persisting into adulthood in the majority of cases. Family and twin studies have demonstrated the importance of genetic factors and candidate gene association studies have identified several loci that exert small but significant effects on ADHD. To provide further clarification of reported associations and identify novel associated genes, we examined 1,038 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 51 candidate genes involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter pathways, particularly dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin pathways, in addition to circadian rhythm genes. Analysis used within family tests of association in a sample of 776 DSM-IV ADHD combined type cases ascertained for the International Multi-centre ADHD Gene project. We found nominal significance with one or more SNPs in 18 genes, including the two most replicated findings in the literature: DRD4 and DAT1. Gene-wide tests, adjusted for the number of SNPs analysed in each gene, identified associations with TPH2, ARRB2, SYP, DAT1, ADRB2, HES1, MAOA and PNMT. Further studies will be needed to confirm or refute the observed associations and their generalisability to other samples.

### The pharmacogenomic era: promise for personalizing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder therapy [^11356fA4]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment is often determined empirically through trial and error until an adequate response is obtained or side effects occur. ADHD is highly heritable and individuals experience wide individual variability in response to ADHD medications, suggesting that the mechanism of action of stimulant medications may provide clues for genetic predictors of response. The promise of ADHD pharmacogenetics is far-reaching and includes the potential to develop individualized medication regimens that improve symptom response, decrease risk for side effects, improve long-term tolerability, and thus contribute to long-term treatment compliance and improved effectiveness. Early ADHD pharmacogenetic studies have focused predominantly on catecholamine pathway genes and response to methylphenidate. Future efforts will also examine a wider range of stimulant and nonstimulant medications on a range of outcome measures and durations. Based on these studies, the potential for personalizing ADHD treatment in clinical practice will be determined.

### Novel treatments for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children [^113UbtKz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Optimal medications for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would be effective, well tolerated, and long acting and not cause mood swings or worsen comorbid conditions. Current medications work on brain dopamine and/or norepinephrine systems, which are thought to be involved in ADHD. The medication class with the most evidence of efficacy in ADHD is stimulants, but they may be abused, are effective for only 4 to 12 hours, and may cause mood swings or increase tic severity. In recent years, alternative treatments have been explored. Tricyclic antidepressants have efficacy comparable to that of stimulants but may cause constipation, dry mouth, tremors, blood pressure changes, and potentially serious side effects including cardiac conduction and repolarization delays. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may improve ADHD symptoms but are associated with severe dietary restrictions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have little or no effect in ADHD but may improve comorbid depression. Bupropion, although less effective than stimulants, may improve both ADHD symptoms and comorbid depression. Antihypertensive agents may improve impulsivity, hyperactivity, and comorbid tics but cause sedation or rebound hypertension. Atomoxetine, which is being developed for ADHD, reduces symptoms of ADHD without exacerbating comorbid conditions and is associated with only minor side effects, including subtle changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Before prescribing a treatment, physicians should consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any medication for children with ADHD, who may be less tolerant of side effects and less able to monitor and express concerns about their well-being than adults.

Conclusion

For the first time, the current study demonstrates decreased NET availability in adult ADHD patients in specific brain areas. Our findings indicate the pathophysiological involvement of NET availability in adult ADHD and warrant further clinical intervention studies targeting these specific areas.

### Brain correlates of the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and psychosocial stress mediating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder severity [^116NkY2C]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR genotype has been found to moderate the effect of stress on severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with stronger effects of stress in carriers of the short allele than in individuals homozygous for the long allele. The underlying neurobiological mechanism of this gene-environment interaction in ADHD is unknown. The authors aimed to determine whether 5-HTTLPR moderates the effect of stress on brain gray matter volume and, if so, which brain regions mediate the effect of this gene-environment interaction on ADHD severity.

Method

Structural MRI, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and stress exposure questionnaire data were available for 701 adolescents and young adults participating in the multicenter ADHD cohort NeuroIMAGE study (from 385 families; 291 with ADHD, 78 with subthreshold ADHD, 332 healthy comparison subjects; 55.8% male; average age: 17.0 years). ADHD symptom count was determined through multi-informant questionnaires. For the analysis, a whole-brain voxel-based morphometry approach was combined with mediation analysis.

Results

Stress exposure was associated with significantly less gray matter volume in the precentral gyrus, middle and superior frontal gyri, frontal pole, and cingulate gyrus in S-allele carriers compared with participants homozygous for the l-allele. The association of this gene-environment interaction with ADHD symptom count was mediated by gray matter volume in the frontal pole and anterior cingulate gyrus.

Conclusions

5-HTTLPR genotype moderates the effect of stress on brain regions involved in social cognitive processing and cognitive control. Specifically, regions important for cognitive control link this gene-environment interaction to ADHD severity.

### Comprehensive exploration of the genetic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways to psychiatric disorders [^113N6kBj]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (SERT) are two important neurotransmitters that participate in the regulation of a wide range of essential functions of the organism (e.g. motor control, cognition, motivation, regulation of emotions or reward), and have been related to the physiopathology and treatment of many psychiatric disorders.

Dopaminergic dysfunction has been described in ADHD, ASD, OCD, TS, SCZ, mood disorders, and substance use disorders (SUD) among others. For example, the positive symptoms of SCZ seem to be associated with hyperdopaminergic neurotransmission, especially in the mesolimbic system, while the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits might be caused by hypodopaminergic activity in the mesocortical pathway. Therefore, most of the antipsychotic treatments block the dopamine D 2 receptor (e.g. chlorpromazine and haloperidol), and some of them are combined with serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists (e.g. clozapine and risperidone). Moreover, several studies have reported a reduction of dopaminergic receptor density in several brain regions of ADHD patients, which is in agreement with the mechanism of action of the ADHD treatments, like methylphenidate or amphetamine, that enhance dopamine transmission in prefrontal cortex.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^113X3kmx]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurocognitive behavioral developmental disorder most commonly seen in childhood and adolescence, which often extends to the adult years. Relative to a decade ago, there has been extensive research into understanding the factors underlying ADHD, leading to far more treatment options available for both adolescents and adults with this disorder. Novel stimulant formulations have made it possible to tailor treatment to the duration of efficacy required by patients, and to help mitigate the potential for abuse, misuse and diversion. Several new non-stimulant options have also emerged in the past few years. Among these, cognitive behavioral interventions have proven popular in the treatment of adult ADHD, especially within the adult population who cannot or will not use medications, along with the many medication-treated patients who continue to show residual disability.

### Associations between serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) methylation and clinical characteristics and cortical thickness in children with ADHD [^1151TSQd]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, highly heritable psychiatric disorder. Additionally, environmental factors such as perinatal stress and early adversities contribute to the occurrence and severity of ADHD. Recently, DNA methylation has emerged as a mechanism that potentially mediates gene-environmental interaction effects in the aetiology and phenomenology of psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated whether serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) methylation patterns were associated with clinical characteristics and regional cortical thickness in children with ADHD.

Method

In 102 children with ADHD (age 6–15 years), the methylation status of the SLC6A4 promoter was measured. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was obtained and ADHD symptoms were evaluated.

Results

A higher methylation status of the SLC6A4 promoter was significantly associated with worse clinical presentations (more hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and more commission errors). Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between SLC6A4 methylation levels and cortical thickness values in the right occipito-temporal regions.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that the SLC6A4 methylation status may be associated with certain symptoms of ADHD, such as behavioural disinhibition, and related brain changes. Future studies that use a larger sample size and a control group are required to corroborate these results.

### A positron emission tomography study of nigro-striatal dopaminergic mechanisms underlying attention: implications for ADHD and its treatment [^1154TZdT]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Our findings define a role for D₂/D₃ receptor availability in the manifestation of attentional deficits that can be explained in the light of the previously hypothesized continuum model of cognitive deficits and underlying dopaminergic dysregulation associated with ADHD. Consistent with the model, the attentional deficits observed in ADHD fall along a single normal continuum extending into the healthy population, with patients with ADHD predominantly representing the lower end of the distribution. However, the lack of overall group differences in 18 F-fallypride binding argue against a primary nigro-striatal-dependent dopamine dysfunction in adult ADHD. Thus, although our data suggest that dopamine plays a key role in attention deficits, they also imply that dopaminergic deficits alone do not account for an ADHD diagnosis. What is then different in ADHD in neural terms?

Of course it is possible that such differences in dopamine function may exist within other regions not addressed here such as the frontal cortex (e.g. but see alsofor discussion). However, the sensitivity of 18 F-fallypride to the methylphenidate dose administered in the current design was arguably suboptimal for detecting robust changes in dopamine levels in regions with low D₂/D₃ receptor density such as the prefrontal cortex. A further possibility is that the central noradrenergic system is selectively affected in ADHD. In support of this hypothesis, atomoxetine, a selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, has been reported to be effective in the treatment of ADHD and some of its associated cognitive deficits. Finally, it may also be argued that ADHD as described in the DSM-IV encompasses an array of phenotypes and underlying mechanisms too broad and heterogeneous to be associated with a primary neurobiological dysfunction common to all patients. The Research Domain Criteria project (RDoC) recently launched by the National Institute of Mental Health, which encourages the development of new ways of classifying psychopathology based on dimensions of observable behaviour and neurobiological measures, represents an important step forward for future research which may help encapsulate the heterogeneity in ADHD. However, it is striking that although no group differences were found in terms of dopamine activity in our study, the same group of adult patients with ADHD had significant brain tissue abnormalities in frontostriatal and limbic structures compared with control subjects.

### Mapping the cortico-striatal transcriptome in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^1151CmrL]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in identifying rare and common genetic variants conferring risk for ADHD, the lack of a transcriptomic understanding of cortico-striatal brain circuitry has stymied a molecular mechanistic understanding of this disorder. To address this gap, we mapped the transcriptome of the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex in post-mortem tissue from 60 individuals with and without ADHD. Significant differential expression of genes was found in the anterior cingulate cortex and, to a lesser extent, the caudate. Significant downregulation emerged of neurotransmitter gene pathways, particularly glutamatergic, in keeping with models that implicate these neurotransmitters in ADHD. Consistent with the genetic overlap between mental disorders, correlations were found between the cortico-striatal transcriptomic changes seen in ADHD and those seen in other neurodevelopmental and mood disorders. This transcriptomic evidence points to cortico-striatal neurotransmitter anomalies in the pathogenesis of ADHD, consistent with current models of the disorder.

### Evidence of sexual dimorphism of HTR1B gene on major adult ADHD comorbidities [^116yFrgM]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2017). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a very common psychiatric disorder across the life cycle and frequently presents comorbidities. Since ADHD is highly heritable, several studies have focused in the underlying genetic factors involved in its etiology. One of the major challenges in this search is the phenotypic heterogeneity, which could be partly attributable to the sexual dimorphism frequently seen in psychiatric disorders. Taking into account the well-known sexual dimorphic effect observed in serotonergic system characteristics, we differentially tested the influence of HTR1B SNPs (rs11568817, rs130058, rs6296 and rs13212041) on ADHD susceptibility and on its major comorbidities according to sex. The sample comprised 564 adults with ADHD diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and 635 controls. There was no association of any HTR1B SNPs tested in relation to ADHD susceptibility. As for the comorbidities evaluated, after correction for multiple tests, significant associations were observed for both rs11568817 and rs130058 with substance use disorders (P corr = 0.009 and P corr = 0.018, respectively) and for rs11568817 with nicotine dependence (P corr = 0.025) in men with ADHD. In women with ADHD, the same rs11568817 was associated with generalized anxiety disorder (P corr = 0.031). The observed effects of rs11568817 G allele presence conferring risk to either substance use disorders or generalized anxiety disorder according to sex, suggest an overall scenario where a higher transcriptional activity of HTR1B, resulting from the presence of this allele, is related to externalizing behaviors in men and internalizing behaviors in women. These results are consistent with and expand previous evidence of sexual dimorphism of the serotoninergic system.

### Genetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^117FG1CM]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Candidate gene association studies

Early molecular genetic studies of ADHD sought to associate ADHD with genes that had some a priori plausibility as being involved in its etiology. Because the drugs that treat ADHD target dopaminergic or noradrenergic transmission, many studies examined "candidate genes" in these pathways. Results were frequently contradictory. In the meta-analyses of Gizer et al. eight candidate DNA variants showed a statistically significant association with ADHD across multiple studies. These variants implicated six genes: the serotonin transporter gene (5HTT), the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 dopamine receptor gene (DRD4), the D5 dopamine receptor gene (DRD5), the serotonin 1B receptor gene (HTR1B) and a gene coding for a synaptic vesicle regulating protein known as SNAP25. A meta-analysis covering all genetic association studies of adults with ADHD reported a significant association between adult ADHD and BAIAP2 (brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2). BAIAP2 is involved in neuronal proliferation, survival, and maturation and dendritic spine morphogenesis and may affect neuronal growth-cone guidance. These findings were significant even after Bonferroni correction. For both the child and adult meta-analyses, the strength of each association, as measured by the odds ratio, is small, less than 1.5.

Many studies examined the dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3), especially a 40-base pair variable number of tandem repeats regulatory polymorphism located in the 3′-untranslated region of the gene. This variant produces two common alleles with 9- and 10-repeats (9R and 10R). In humans, the 10R allele of this polymorphism has been associated with ADHD in youth while the 9R allele is associated with ADHD in adults. A meta-analysis showed that the 9R allele is associated with increased DAT activity in human adults as measured by positron emission tomography.

### Platelet monoamine oxidase activity in children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^116K8Vuf]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable developmental disorder characterized by symptoms of impulsivity, hyperactivity and/or inattention, and associated with structural and biochemical abnormalities in cortical and limbic structures innervated by dopamine, noradrenalin and serotonin. The enzyme monoamine oxidase, type B (MAO-B), is expressed in platelets, and metabolizes endogenous amines. Its activity has been proposed to represent a peripheral marker of various traits and forms of psychopathology. This study evaluated platelet MAO activity with a spectrofluorimetric method in 72 boys and 12 girls with predominantly hyperactive, predominantly inattentive, and combined subtype of ADHD (DSM-IV criteria), and in 64 control children. The results showed significantly lower platelet MAO activity in children with hyperactive, inattentive, and combined subtype of ADHD than in control children. There was no significant association between platelet MAO activity and gender or age. The limitation of the study was in the small sample of girls with ADHD (N = 12), and in the determination of only one peripheral marker. In line with hypotheses of lower platelet MAO activity in different types of psychopathology, children with different subtypes of ADHD had significantly lower platelet MAO-B activity than control children.

### Insights into attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder from recent genetic studies [^112TvWeh]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). In this narrative review, we summarize recent advances in quantitative and molecular genetic research from the past 5–10 years. Combined with large-scale international collaboration, these advances have resulted in fast-paced progress in understanding the etiology of ADHD and how genetic risk factors map on to clinical heterogeneity. Studies are converging on a number of key insights. First, ADHD is a highly polygenic NDD with a complex genetic architecture encompassing risk variants across the spectrum of allelic frequencies, which are implicated in neurobiological processes. Second, genetic studies strongly suggest that ADHD diagnosis shares a large proportion of genetic risks with continuously distributed traits of ADHD in the population, with shared genetic risks also seen across development and sex. Third, ADHD genetic risks are shared with those implicated in many other neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and somatic phenotypes. As sample sizes and the diversity of genetic studies continue to increase through international collaborative efforts, we anticipate further success with gene discovery, characterization of how the ADHD phenotype relates to other human traits and growing potential to use genomic risk factors for understanding clinical trajectories and for precision medicine approaches.

### Updates in pharmacologic strategies in adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111my1vz]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) significantly worsens quality of life and long-term functional outcomes in adults. Individual impairments in adults with ADHD can be further contextualized within considerable costs to society at large. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved stimulants and nonstimulant medications can significantly improve ADHD symptoms in adults. In the past 2 decades, the United States FDA has expanded approval of pharmacotherapeutic options for adult ADHD. However, limitations still persist in available psychotropics for certain patient populations such as those with comorbid substance use or cardiovascular illness. Clinicians therefore must appreciate several ongoing investigations into medications with unique mechanisms of action. This article reviews the current FDA approved and emerging medication options while providing guidelines for pharmacologic management of adult ADHD.

### Reinforcement, dopamine and rodent models in drug development for ADHD [^116hsxnG]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Transgenic Animal Models

Several pieces of evidence suggest that abnormal dopamine transporter (DAT) function may be important in ADHD. Overexpression of DAT has been found in human ADHD, and 1 of the major actions of the psychostimulants is to block DAT. Thus, DAT dysfunction has been proposed as a possible cause of ADHD, and mice with genetically engineered changes of DAT function have been proposed as models for use in ADHD research. For example, DAT knockout mice show increased locomotion. In the open-field environment, high doses of methylphenidate (30 mg/kg) increased locomotion in wild-type mice and decreased locomotion in DAT knockout mice. The effects in knockout mice were mediated by increases in serotonin, suggesting that therapies directed at serotonin may be useful in ADHD. Although genetic engineering offers powerful approaches to develop models, only a small fraction of variance in human populations is accounted for by variation in dopamine transporter, and unconditionally increased locomotor activity is not a key component of ADHD.

### Genetic variations influence brain changes in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^113uqBz6]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Functional neuroimaging-genetics studies in ADHD.

The N -methyl — aspartate (NMDA) and dopamine receptor genes are found to have significant effects on functional connectivity in ADHD. A recent study investigated the effects of NMDA receptor gene glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B (GRIN2B) and dopamine receptor gene (DRD4) variants on ReHo in the ADHD group and healthy controls by using rs-fMRI. They found that the ADHD group with GRIN2B TC/TT genotype showed lower static and dynamic ReHo in the left superior parietal surface than the healthy controls. In contrast, the ADHD group with DRD4 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)2 polymorphism showed lower dynamic ReHo in the right superior parietal surface. Considering the role of the superior parietal region in the selective attention process, decreased static and dynamic ReHo in the ADHD group in the superior parietal region may lead to worse performance outcomes during active states and may reduce the ability to respond to attention-based tasks in ADHD. Based on these findings, this study concluded that alterations in dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems contribute to impaired local functional connectivity leading to attention deficits in ADHD patients.

A stop-signal task-based fMRI study was performed to measure response inhibition task in individuals carrying ADHD risk alleles of the DRD4 and SLC6A3 genes. The authors found that carriers of DRD4 7-repeat allele showed reduced activation in the superior frontal and middle gyrus during successful response inhibition and reduced activation in the supramarginal gyrus and parietal lobule during failed response inhibition. In contrast, SLC6A3 risk variants showed lower cerebellar activity during failed trials of successful response inhibition. Another study explored to find interactions between variants in candidate plasticity genes (SLC6A3, SLC6A4, and DRD4) and social environments (maternal expressed emotion and peer affiliation). The study showed that exposure to high positive peer affiliation was associated with the least reward speeding in serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region (HTTLPR) short allele carriers, while exposure to low positive peer affiliation or low maternal warmth was associated with the most reward speeding in HTTLPR short allele carriers. On the other hand, SLC6A3 10-repeat homozygotes carriers displayed the most extended reaction times when exposed to low maternal warmth. In contrast, DRD4 7-repeat carriers showed high neural activation when exposed to little maternal warmth and vice versa. Taken together, these findings emphasize the relevance of supportive social environments in sensitivity rewards and task performance with specific genotypes has differential environmental impacts.

### Functional gene group analysis reveals a role of synaptic heterotrimeric G proteins in cognitive ability [^114c486d]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

In the past decade, the scale of genotyping and genetic association studies has increased rapidly, from single-locus analysis to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that allow the screening of 500,000–1,000,000 SNPs, covering 65%–95% of the human genome, depending on the array of choice. This has proven a successful method of identifying common genes of relatively large effect, but has been less effective when rare variants of large effect are of importance or when identifying genes of small effect for complex traits, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD [MIM]) or schizophrenia (MIM).

Collective testing of genes involved in biological pathways has emerged as an alternative strategy for testing the combined effects of genetic variants with small effect size. Such pathways are usually defined as a set of proteins that participate in cascades of intracellular reactions, often triggered by extracellular ligands, involving enzyme-catalyzed posttranslational modifications of proteins and/or changes in their subcellular distribution. This ultimately leads to changes in cellular responses, such as altered gene expression or adaptation of cell morphology. Indeed, testing the combined effect of multiple genetic variants in such pathways has been shown to be more powerful than testing single-gene effects. Many proteins, however, are known to act across pathways, suggesting that they are not exclusively linked to one pathway. For instance, different neuromodulators, such as dopamine or 5HT, activate receptors in the plasma membrane, which are functionally and often structurally similar to the receptors in other pathways. A higher degree of convergence exists for downstream signaling steps, such as guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins), effector enzymes, second messengers, kinases, and classes of substrates. It is conceivable that genetic variation that influences complex traits accumulates at foci of convergence that act across different pathways — but have similar cellular function — and that can influence multiple biological pathways in a similar manner. We refer to grouping genes according to cellular function as "horizontal grouping", as opposed to the classical grouping of genes in pathways, which we refer to as "vertical grouping" (Figure 1).

### Serotonin transporter genotype 5HTTLPR as a marker of differential susceptibility? A meta-analysis of child and adolescent gene-by-environment studies [^112mzTom]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Hypotheses

A series of meta-analyses tested two contrasting hypotheses about the role of 5HTTLPR in G × E interactions. The dominant diathesis-stress or cumulative-risk hypothesis stipulates that carriers of the s allele are more vulnerable to the negative effects of adverse environments (double risk). The emerging differential-susceptibility model predicts that carriers of the s-allele are not only more vulnerable to the influence of negative environments but also profit more from the beneficial influences of positive environments. From a differential-susceptibility perspective, we expect the interactive effects of the 5HTTLPR genotype and positive environments on development to be as large as the interaction effects of the same genotype and risk environments.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for the treatment of children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder symptomatology: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117EU9vL]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Several studies have demonstrated differences in omega-3 fatty acid composition in plasma and in erythrocyte membranes in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared with unaffected controls. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and can alter central nervous system cell membrane fluidity and phospholipid composition. Cell membrane fluidity can alter serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission. The goal of this meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in children with ADHD.

Method

PubMed was searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials examining omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in children with ADHD symptomatology. The primary outcome measurement was standardized mean difference in rating scales of ADHD severity. Secondary analyses were conducted to determine the effects of dosing of different omega-3 fatty acids in supplements.

Results

Ten trials involving 699 children were included in this meta-analysis. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation demonstrated a small but significant effect in improving ADHD symptoms. Eicosapentaenoic acid dose within supplements was significantly correlated with supplement efficacy. No evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity between trials was found.

Conclusion

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, particularly with higher doses of eicosapentaenoic acid, was modestly effective in the treatment of ADHD. The relative efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was modest compared with currently available pharmacotherapies for ADHD such as psychostimulants, atomoxetine, or α₂ agonists. However, given its relatively benign side-effect profile and evidence of modest efficacy, it may be reasonable to use omega-3 fatty supplementation to augment traditional pharmacologic interventions or for families who decline other psychopharmacologic options.

### Serotonin in the modulation of neural plasticity and networks: implications for neurodevelopmental disorders [^112aYdx9]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

Serotonin (5-HT) shapes brain networks during development and modulates a wide spectrum of essential neuronal functions ranging from perception and cognitive appraisal to emotional responses in the mature brain. Deficits in 5-HT-moderated synaptic signaling fundamentally impact the pathophysiology and long-term outcome of neurodevelopmental disorders. Our understanding of how 5-HT-dependent modulation of circuit configuration influences social cognition and emotional learning has been enhanced by recent insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synapse formation and plasticity. In this review, we discuss emerging concepts as to how defects in synaptic plasticity impact our biosocial brain and how recent findings regarding 5-HT's role in brain development and function provide insight into the cellular and physiological basis of neurodevelopmental disorders.

### New potential leads in the biology and treatment of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder [^111HqGs2]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights recent neuroimaging and genetic studies of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder that may inform biologically targeted interventions and treatments.

Recent Findings

The findings suggest that attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder is characterized by specific learning and cognitive deficits due to abnormalities in dopamine-rich prefrontal circuitry, of genetic or environmental origins. In addition to prefrontal cortical areas, the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and parietal cortex have been implicated in the condition. These regions are part of unique circuits that project both to and from the prefrontal cortex, thus providing a means for signaling prefrontal regions when top-down control of behavior needs to be imposed. Ineffective signaling of control systems by any one of these regions can lead to poor regulation of behavior. Likewise, intact signaling but inefficient top-down control could result in poor regulation of behavior.

Summary

Identification of which cognitive and neural processes are altered in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and acknowledgement of different casuses of the condition will lead to more individualized, biologically targeted interventions and treatments. This new direction in research and treatment has occurred as the result of a shift from diagnosis as a phenotype, to refined phenotypes of core cognitive deficits that can be more easily tied to the underlying biology.

We used VBM to investigate differences in local distribution of gray matter between ADHD patients and age-matched and sex-matched healthy control participants. The modulated and spatially normalized gray matter images were fed into SPM12, where we applied a two-sample t -test with total intracranial volume as a confound to correct for different brain sizes. All clusters with a combined threshold of p < .001 uncorrected at peak level and p < .05 family-wise error corrected at cluster level were considered as significantly different.

### X-ray structure of leuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation reveals mechanism of substrate release [^113poCv9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) constitute a large family of Na + -coupled, secondary active transmembrane transporters conserved across all kingdoms of life that includes carriers for a broad variety of solutes, including amino acids and neurotransmitters. Key mammalian NSS members include the transporters for dopamine (DAT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GAT-1–4), glycine (GlyT1–2), norepinephrine (NET), and serotonin (SERT) that serve central roles in clearing released neurotransmitters from the extracellular space in the brain. Malfunctions of NSS proteins play important roles in many pathophysiological conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, epilepsy, and schizophrenia –. Concurrently, NSS are targets for several medicines (e.g. ADHD medication, antidepressants, antiepileptics) and for drugs of abuse, including amphetamines, cocaine, and MDMA (ecstasy).

### Underlying mechanisms of gene-environment interactions in externalizing behavior: a systematic review and search for theoretical mechanisms [^114gBrdP]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2015). Low credibility.

Genes, Postnatal Family Adversity, and Externalizing Behaviors: A Systematic Review of G × E Findings

Methods

This systematic review considers candidate genes that are studied most extensively in the context of externalizing behaviors, namely polymorphisms regulating the activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, which are associated with various aspects of human behavior: the MAOA, DRD4, DRD2, DAT1, 5 - HTTLPR, and COMT val/met. We conducted a literature search for studies on interactions between these polymorphisms and indices of postnatal family adversity in predicting externalizing behaviors (i.e. aggression, behavioral problems, antisocial behavior, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD), delinquency, psychopathy). Our review focus is on externalizing behavior, because these behaviors are relatively common in childhood, and a childhood onset of such problem behavior is known to be a strong predictor of psychopathological outcomes later in life (e.g. Jokela et al; Von Stumm et al.). However, externalizing behavior is a very heterogeneous behavioral cluster, which has different etiologies in different children and across symptoms (e.g. Frick). Specifically, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) might be a distinct disorder in symptomatology (i.e. attention deficits) and etiology (e.g. stronger heritability than other externalizing disorders, Burt). Therefore, to narrow the scope of our review, we did not include studies that focused specifically and solely on ADHD as an outcome variable, but did include studies that included ADHD as one of multiple (comorbid) outcome measures. Family adversity (i.e. family and parental characteristics that are associated with increased risks of child maladjustment) is one of the most well-studied and documented contributors to child externalizing behaviors, as well as an important target for interventions aimed at reducing externalizing behaviors (for an overview see Tolan et al.).

### The stress-wnt-signaling axis: a hypothesis for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and therapy approaches [^114wNvx6]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric neurodevelopmental disorders in children and adolescents. Although ADHD has been studied for nearly a century, the cause and pathophysiology of ADHD is yet largely unknown. However, findings from previous studies have resulted in the formation of a new hypothesis: Apart from the well-known multifactorial etiology of ADHD, recent evidence suggests that the interaction between genetic and environmental factors and especially Wnt- and mTOR-signaling pathways might have an important role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. The Wnt-signaling pathway is known to orchestrate cellular proliferation, polarity, and differentiation, and the mTOR pathway is involved in several significant processes of neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. As a result, dysregulations of these pathways in a time-dependent manner could lead to neurodevelopmental delays, resulting in ADHD phenotype. This review presents further evidence supporting our hypothesis by combining results from studies on ADHD and Wnt- or mTOR-signaling and the influence of genetics, methylphenidate treatment, Omega-3 supplementation, and stress.

### The effects of methylphenidate and atomoxetine on drosophila brain at single-cell resolution and potential drug repurposing for ADHD treatment [^112CY8WR]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, and its prevalence is approximately 7.2% worldwide and 6.4% in China. The pathogenesis of ADHD remains unclear and its etiology is complicated. Pharmacological interventions are effective in some patients with ADHD, including the stimulants MPH and amphetamine, and the non-stimulants ATX, extended-release clonidine, and guanfacine. Most drug treatments for ADHD aim to regulate inter-synaptic neurotransmitter levels, and MPH and ATX are frequently used to treat ADHD since they help with the primary symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. A reasonable mechanism of action for MPH and ATX would be the regulation of inter-synaptic neurotransmitter levels, since MPH inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) in presynaptic neurons by inhibiting norepinephrine transporters (NETs) and dopamine transporters (DATs); and ATX selectively inhibits presynaptic NET, having secondary effects on the dopaminergic system. However, the "neurotransmitter regulation hypothesis" does not offer a satisfactory explanation for the current experimental or clinical findings. For instance, the extracellular concentration of DA in neuronal cell lines devoid of DATs is significantly decreased following treatment with MPH, indicating the inhibition of NETs or the existence of other possible targets. MPH also has a weak effect on the regulation of serotonin (5-HT) and glutamate (Glu), and even other general cellular processes; therefore, the underlying mechanisms of these ADHD medications require further investigation. It is noteworthy that different doses of ADHD drugs such as MPH have been shown to work differently, not only treating disease but also significantly increasing locomotor activity (hyperactivity-like behavior typical of ADHD) in the control group. These drugs, originally approved to treat ADHD, produce the same paradoxical effects in humans as well as in rodent and fly models.

### Overlapping and differential neuropharmacological mechanisms of stimulants and nonstimulants for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a comparative neuroimaging analysis [^117V6zu9]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by problems of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (Battle,), which approximately affect 84.7 million individuals worldwide (Collaborators). Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate, are widely prescribed to ameliorate ADHD symptoms, at least in improving attention span and reducing distractibility (Janssen et al.). These medications work by increasing levels of specific neurotransmitters in the brain, especially dopamine and norepinephrine. For individuals who respond poorly to stimulants, nonstimulant alternatives may be considered, including norepinephrine modulators like atomoxetine and certain antidepressants such as bupropion. (Mechler, Banaschewski, Hohmann, & Häge). However, individualized management for ADHD cases in clinical settings is still hard to achieve due to the elusive neuropsychological mechanisms of first-line medications. At the same time, the factors of age and sex also complicate individual medication selection as they influence the effectiveness of medication treatment (Childress, Newcorn, & Cutler; Dafny & Yang; Wigal, Kollins, Childress, & Adeyi).

From a neurobiological perspective, psychostimulants exert their therapeutic effects as indirect catecholamine agonists by blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), and atomoxetine, the most commonly used nonstimulant for ADHD treatment, is a selective NET inhibitor. Through their common neuropsychological actions and partially overlapping pharmacological targets, both psychostimulants and nonstimulants may mitigate the dysfunctional inhibition and execution processing deficits seen in ADHD (Gilbert et al.). Finding similarities of mechanisms between of stimulants and nonstimulants in clinical application may enhance the understanding of their biochemistry pathways and lead to the development of targeted medications. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have found that treatment with methylphenidate and atomoxetine produces clinical improvement for ADHD via both common and divergent neurophysiologic actions in frontoparietal regions. Given that youth with ADHD may have a preferential or atypical response to either stimulants or nonstimulants based on their dissociable therapeutic targets (Elliott et al; Schulz et al.), it is reasonable that approximately 56% of ADHD cases may achieve clinical improvement with stimulants, while 45% of cases achieve so with non-stimulants (Mechler et al; Newcorn et al.).

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by behavioral manifestations such as impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. Prevalence of ADHD is around 6% during childhood and 4% during adulthood. While ADHD, per definition, starts before the 12th birthday, it persists into adulthood in up to 60% of patients, although a shift in symptoms can be observed. Externalizing symptoms such as fidgeting and talking excessively attenuate, while internalizing symptoms (e.g. particularly restlessness, impulsivity, and inattention) prevail in adults with ADHD (aADHD). Pharmacological treatment of ADHD is effective in ~70–80%, but the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to ADHD are still incompletely understood. Next to an imbalance of the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA), genetic, environmental and etiopathological factors, recent literature suggests (neuro-)inflammation and defective immune regulation as potential contributing factors to ADHD.

### Neuropharmacological modulation of cognition [^114dvSWk]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Problems relating to impulsivity, attention, and working memory occur in many neuropsychiatric disorders and represent important targets for pharmacological intervention. The purpose of this article is to review recent neuropharmacological manipulation studies in humans relating to these domains.

Recent Findings

Serotonin manipulations in healthy volunteers did not affect response inhibition, a cognitive function implicated in impulsive symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, trichotillomania, and substance abuse. Serotonin manipulations did affect performance on cognitive tests involving emotionally salient rewards and feedback, suggesting involvement of this neurochemical in affective aspects of impulsivity. Attentional deficits in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and visuospatial neglect were ameliorated by noradrenergic drugs. Noradrenergic beta-blockade suppressed the encoding of emotionally arousing unpleasant stimuli and reduced amygdala activation in healthy volunteers, with potential implications for posttraumatic stress disorder. Dopaminergic manipulations affected aspects of working memory in healthy volunteers and in patients with Parkinson's disease, with evidence for bidirectional effects depending on baseline performance.

Summary

Recent findings raise exciting prospects for modulating impulsivity, attention, and working memory in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Future studies should use computerized cognitive assessment, measures of functional genetic polymorphisms, and neuroimaging techniques, in order to further elucidate the neurochemical substrates of cognition and optimize treatment approaches.

### Effects of norepinephrine transporter gene variants on NET binding in ADHD and healthy controls investigated by PET [^116RAE71]. Human Brain Mapping (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequent neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed in children. It is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness which frequently leads to severe social, academic, and vocational dysfunction [De La Fuente et al. 2013]. In around 30% of ADHD cases, the symptoms persist through adolescence into adulthood [Barbaresi et al. 2013]. Symptoms differ in adults compared to children, such as hyperactivity decreases while problems with inattention persist [Volkow and Swanson, 2013]. ADHD has a strong genetic component with a heritability estimated to be around 0.77 [Curatolo et al. 2009]. Though the heritability is rather high in ADHD, studies have failed to indicate a single gene responsible for the course of ADHD, suggesting complex polygenetic mechanisms and gene environment interactions to be of importance [Banaschewski et al. 2010].

### Clinical response to a single-dose methylphenidate challenge is indicative of treatment response at two months in adults with ADHD [^114FBLZM]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined by developmentally inappropriate inattentive and/or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, and is one of the most common neurodevelopmental conditions. Prevalence ranges between 2–7% in childhood, and impairing symptoms persist in up to 75% of adults with childhood ADHD. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamines, represent the first line pharmacological option. Stimulants ameliorate ADHD symptoms and associated cognitive deficits by modulating dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission in cortico-striatal brain networks, which promotes engagement of task-related brain networks, reduces interference from the default mode network, and increases perceived saliency. Fronto-striatal pathways have been the most investigated in ADHD. These are GABA-glutamatergic circuits modulated by dopamine and contribute to cognitive, motor, and affective regulation by connecting the cerebral cortex to the basal ganglia and thalamus, which then projects back to the cortex. These circuits contribute to executive functions and affect regulation, which are often affected in ADHD. Additionally, ADHD has been associated with noradrenergic pathways dysfunction. These originate from the locus coeruleus (LC), which is in the brainstem and is reciprocally connected with cortical regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. The balance between tonic and phasic noradrenaline release in the prefrontal cortex is crucial for optimal cognitive performance. Conversely, both excessive and insufficient stimulation negatively impacts on prefrontal functions and has been implicated in ADHD. By acting on catecholamine transporters, stimulants enhance endogenous dopaminergic stimulation and noradrenaline-dependent activation of post-synaptic receptors. Thus, they optimize prefrontal function by respectively reducing 'noise' and enhancing 'signal' within glutamatergic circuits, enabling effective 'top-down' regulation of response inhibition, attention, and motivation. Prescription rates of stimulants have been increasing in recent years, especially in adults. Data from the Massachusetts Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) showed that stimulant prescriptions increased 70% from 2011–2021, with a tree-time increase in adults aged 35–44 years. Similarly, the UK NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) reported that prescription rates in 2022–23 increased by 32% in adults and 12% in children as compared to the previous year and that, as a result, stimulants were among the most prescribed psychopharmacological treatments. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have clearly demonstrated superiority, at a group level, of both MPH and amphetamines over placebo across the lifespan. However, individual response varies, and this may negatively impact on outcomes, from educational attainment and occupation rates to substance misuse and legal offences. There is no current evidence to guide decision on which type of medication may be most beneficial for a specific individual. Indeed, in clinical practice, the most effective and best tolerated medication is selected using a trial-and-error approach, which may delay recovery and is not cost-effective. Therefore, there have been increasing efforts to identify pre-treatment characteristics associated with stimulant treatment response.

### Druggable genome in attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and its co-morbid conditions. new avenues for treatment [^117Fz7PS]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite ADHD being a highly heritable disorder, it has been challenging to utilise genetic information in its treatment. Nonetheless, the more insight we gain into the molecular genetics of ADHD, the more options for its treatment may become available. In this study, we explored the druggable genome in ADHD, its co-morbid conditions and quality of life phenotypes utilising large-scale GWA studies. We aimed to address three questions: (1) do any of the genes encoding targets of FDA-approved ADHD drugs show association with ADHD and/or its co-morbidities, (2) are ADHD and/or its co-morbidities and quality of life phenotypes associated with genetic variation and expression within the known druggable genome and if so, (3) can we use those association signals to identify gene targets for novel drug development and/or repurposing to treat ADHD.

To answer the first question, we examined the association between the genes encoding the immediate targets of the first-line ADHD pharmacotherapeutics and ADHD as well as its co-morbidities. We observed no significant association between these genes and ADHD, suggesting that these drugs may act through mechanisms different to those underlying ADHD. However, as the current GWA study on ADHD reveals only a small fraction of the biological processes underlying this condition, larger studies are needed to draw any definitive conclusions.

Overall, drugs that are FDA-approved or currently undergoing clinical trials to treat ADHD (e.g. dasotraline) target only a limited number of known pharmacological targets, essentially enhancing catecholamine signalling. This illustrates that all active ADHD drugs belong to a small pharmacological niche and we should aim to move beyond it. Hence, we examined whether any known druggable genes and pathways are associated with ADHD and/or its co-morbidities and quality of life phenotypes (second question), following by pharmacological characterisation of identified associations (third question). These analyses aimed to pinpoint novel avenues for ADHD drug development as well as repurposing. Because the de novo discovery and development of entirely new drugs targeting unique biology of a disorder is a tedious and expensive process with a low success rate, the possibility of repurposing already existing drugs towards new indications may be more effective. Here, we highlight some of these potential new targets, although this list is not comprehensive.

### Atomoxetine: a new pharmacotherapeutic approach in the management of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^114fK1Pg]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Atomoxetine is a novel, non-stimulant, highly selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor that has been studied for use in the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Data from clinical trials show it to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults. Improvements were seen not only in core symptoms of ADHD, but also in broader social and family functioning and self esteem. Once-daily dosing of atomoxetine has been shown to be effective in providing continuous symptom relief. Atomoxetine does not appear to have abuse potential and is associated with a benign side effect profile. The development of atomoxetine thus represents an important advance in the pharmacological management of ADHD.

### Combined methylphenidate and SSRIs in adults with ADHD… [^117HgaZQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Is the combination of methylphenidate and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors safe in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Findings In this cohort study of 17 234 adults with ADHD, use of SSRIs combined with methylphenidate demonstrated a safe profile and was associated with a reduced risk of headaches. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that combining SSRI and methylphenidate is not associated with increased risk of adverse events in adults with ADHD and comorbid depression. Importance Depression is a common comorbidity of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and the combination of methylphenidate and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is a frequently prescribed treatment. However, there is limited clinical evidence on the safety of this medication combination in adults with ADHD. % and 53. 3%.

9, 10 Adults with both ADHD and depression experience more severe illness trajectories than adults with ADHD alone. 11 A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor may be added to the stimulant medication for adults with ADHD and comorbid depression. 12 Although there is limited interaction information, stimulants are known to increase the plasma concentration of SSRIs, which may have adverse effects. 13, 14. In this study, the risk of headaches was lower when SSRIs were added to methylphenidate. The association between ADHD and headache may be mediated by internalization symptoms and sleep disturbances. 27–29 Considering that antidepressants can play a role in effective reduction of emotional symptoms and sleep problems, 30, 31 improvements in the mediated symptoms may have been a factor in the difference in headache risk between the SSRI and methylphenidate-only groups. Additionally, fluoxetine and paroxetine have been reported to be moderately effective for migraine.

32–34 Enhancing serotonin levels may be advantageous for headache prevention under the migraine pathophysiological process. 35, 36 Although headache is frequently noted as an adverse effect of antidepressants, a meta-analysis found that it is seldom linked to the use of antidepressants. 37 In addition to headache, the risk of tremor decreased when SSRIs were combined with methylphenidate in several settings of this study. Compared with males, females using SSRIs and methylphenidates together were found to have an increased risk of hypertension. In this cohort study of adults with ADHD, there was no significant increase in risks of adverse events associated with use of the combination of SSRI plus methylphenid.

### Association of the adrenergic α ₂ A receptor gene with methylphenidate improvement of inattentive symptoms in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder… [^115gohzk]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

subcortical areas. 8 Adrenergic α₂A receptor is a key component of the noradrenergic system, 7 with a putative role on methylphenidate action demonstrated in animal models. 9, 10 Moreover, adrenergic α₂A receptor agonists, such as guanfacine hydrochloride and clonidine hydrochloride, are efficacious in the treatment of ADHD.
11. The adrenergic α2A receptor gene is located on chromosome 10q24–26. A –1291 C > G single-nucleotide polymorphism creating an MspI site in the promoter region of the gene was identified by Lario et al. 12 Six of 8 studies13–20 that evaluated the association between ADRA2A and ADHD suggest a role for this polymorphism in the susceptibility for the disorder. This finding concurs with recent preclinical studies in animals that provide evidence for the contribution of the blockade of the adrenergic α2A receptor in producing ADHD-like symptoms and in impairing the response to methylphenidate.

Arnsten and Dudley10 studied the effect of methylphenidate on rats performing a delayed alternation task. In the same direction as our findings, previous molecular genetic investigations suggest a relationship between ADHD and the ADRA2A –1291 C > G polymorphism. One study15 demonstrated an association between the G/GADRA2A genotype and inattentive scores in a sample of 92 subjects with ADHD. In a subsequent independent sample of children with ADHD, the relationship between inattentive symptoms and the G/G genotype was again observed. 18 Similar findings were obtained by Park et al, 16 who investigated a possible role of ADRA2A in ADHD by assessing 3 different SNPs, including the –1291 C > G SNP. In both cases, the presence of the G allele of the –1291 C > G SNP seemed to contribute to an increased risk, especially when inattentive symptoms were considered.

These previous findings and those from the present study suggest that ADRA2A may be independently associated with the ADHD phenotype and with the response to methylphenidate treatment relative to inattentive scores. One can speculate whether the presence of 2 G alleles would confer an additional effect on the reduction of inattentive symptoms.

### Dopamine and serotonin metabolism in neuropsychiatrically disturbed children… [^113KzcYh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and probenecid were measured in four subgroups of neuropsychiatrically disturbed children and a contrast group of pediatric patients. With the exception of a serotonin metabolite difference between autistic and nonautistic psychotic children, there were no significant differences in metabolite concentrations among autistic, nonautistic psychotic, aphasic, and cognitively and attentionally impaired groups, or between the developmentally disabled and contrast groups of children. Younger children had higher concentrations of HVA than older children. Girls had significantly lower HVA/probenecid ratios than boys, which did not appear to be related to underlying neuropsychiatric disorder. Significant probenecid-metabolite correlations indicate the importance of measuring probenecid in the cerebrospinal fluid in clinical studies. Cohen DJ, Caparulo BK, Shaywitz BA, Bowers MB.

### Norepinephrine transporter in ADHD… [^114shnrH]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder research has long focused on the dopaminergic system's contribution to pathogenesis, although the results have been inconclusive. However, a case has been made for the involvement of the noradrenergic system, which modulates cognitive processes, such as arousal, working memory, and response inhibition, all of which are typically affected in ADHD. Furthermore, the norepinephrine transporter is an important target for frequently prescribed medication in ADHD. Therefore, the NET is suggested to play a critical role in ADHD. However, the proposition that methylphenidate, amphetamine, and atomoxetine may induce therapeutic response via NET modulation suggests that noradrenergic factors, and more specifically changes in the NET, may play a role in ADHD pathogenesis. Therefore, we proposed a thorough investigation of ADHD-related NET distribution, as has been performed for the serotonin transporter and dopamine transporter.

We further excluded 2 patients exhibiting predominantly inattentive symptoms and 1 exhibiting predominantly hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and, in a separate analysis, 2 patients with past drug abuse. Exclusion of these participants did not change the results. Methylphenidate-induced dopamine transporter blockade has been causally linked to an increase in striatal extracellular dopamine in the human brain, 14 and this effect has been associated with therapeutic responses to methylphenidate in ADHD. 62 Moreover, striatal dopamine transporter availability in patients with ADHD was correlated with improvement of clinical symptoms after methylphenidate treatment. 63 Brain imaging studies, 31, 63–65 however, have reported an array of partially contradictory results ranging from dopamine transporter increases to a lack of change66 to decreases29, 67 in the brain of adults with ADHD. receptors, are similarly inconsistent.

29, 32 In addition, serotonergic alterations have been discussed in the context of ADHD68 and are primarily based on the relationship between serotonergic innervation and impulsivity and hyperactivity, which are 2 core ADHD symptoms. 69 However, serotonergic involvement in ADHD is contradicted by data showing the limited clinical efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the improvement of ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, serotonin transporter imaging studies67, 70 showed no difference in serotonin transporter distribution between patients with ADHD and healthy controls. Therefore, although existing evidence neither affirms nor disproves the neurotransmitter systems discussed above to be involved in ADHD, background pharmacologic evidence supporting, in particular, dopaminergic and noradrenergic contribution, is strong.
