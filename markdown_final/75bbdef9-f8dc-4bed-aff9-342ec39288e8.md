## Question

How do you treat dengue fever?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat dengue fever, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that dengue care is supportive and not curative. Then, I should verify how to classify severity and identify warning signs. Next, I will review outpatient management for non-severe cases, followed by inpatient management for severe disease with emphasis on fluid strategy, monitoring, and transfusion thresholds. After that, I need to check special populations and what to avoid therapeutically. Finally, I will consider emerging therapies and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with WHO/PAHO guidance and high-quality evidence where available [^1144kinC] [^117NrG6w].

> Let me first confirm the core principle: there is no specific antiviral therapy for dengue; management is entirely supportive, and with timely, protocolized care, case fatality can be reduced to less than 1% even in severe dengue, which anchors all subsequent decisions [^115hEkMw] [^114vkigv].

> I need to ensure accurate severity classification and recognition of warning signs because treatment pathways hinge on this. WHO 2009 classifies dengue as non-severe (with or without warning signs) and severe dengue; warning signs include abdominal pain/tenderness, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleeding, fluid accumulation, hepatomegaly, lethargy/restlessness, postural hypotension, and a rising hematocrit with concurrent platelet decline, which should prompt closer monitoring or hospitalization [^116xa4Vt] [^115hEkMw].

> For non-severe dengue managed as an outpatient, I should confirm that oral hydration is emphasized and that antipyretic choices avoid NSAIDs. WHO recommends protocolized oral fluids tailored to age and comorbidities, and to use acetaminophen or metamizole for fever/pain while avoiding NSAIDs due to bleeding risk; I initially thought NSAIDs were absolutely contraindicated, but wait, let me verify — WHO advises avoidance, and a recent observational study suggests low-dose ibuprofen may be safe in non-severe cases, yet guidelines still prefer acetaminophen or metamizole given bleeding risk and lack of definitive safety data, so I should align with WHO/PAHO and individualize decisions for patients already on NSAIDs for chronic indications [^115vqG5k] [^1144kinC] [^113aU8tN] [^116n2FwV] [^114LhtKS] [^114NwfZ5].

> Hold on, I should verify antipyretic hepatotoxicity concerns in dengue. A randomized trial showed standard-dose acetaminophen increased transaminase elevations compared with placebo in adult dengue, so I need to use the lowest effective dose, avoid exceeding 2.5–3 g/day in adults, and be cautious in those with baseline liver disease or transaminitis, adjusting the dose accordingly [^116NCtzF] [^1144kinC].

> Next, I will examine inpatient management for severe dengue, where the priorities are hemodynamic stabilization, careful fluid titration, and close monitoring. I should confirm that crystalloids are preferred over colloids initially, with isotonic saline or Ringer's lactate as first-line, and that fluid administration should be guided by clinical parameters such as pulse pressure, capillary refill time, hematocrit trends, and urine output; passive leg raise can help assess fluid responsiveness when uncertain, and lactate can be used to refine perfusion assessment in shock states [^112NFsra] [^113W5WRA] [^111K9pnT] [^116LBoGj] [^117SiR39] [^1174xQvT].

> Let me think about the critical phase timing and fluid strategy nuances. The critical phase typically begins around defervescence (days 4–6) with capillary leak and hemoconcentration; fluids should be titrated to restore perfusion while avoiding overload, and large rapid boluses (> 15 mL/kg in < 30 minutes) should be avoided unless the patient is hypotensive, with a shift to maintenance or even cessation as leak resolves to prevent pulmonary edema [^111K9pnT] [^113oB7kg].

> I should double-check transfusion thresholds because overuse is common. Prophylactic platelet transfusion solely for low platelets is not recommended; transfuse only for active bleeding, need for invasive procedures, or high-risk contexts like pregnancy or anticoagulation, using platelets, FFP, or cryoprecipitate as indicated by the bleeding phenotype rather than the platelet count alone [^114dBpXV] [^1143YupA] [^111K9pnT].

> But wait, what about corticosteroids or other immunomodulators? I need to ensure I do not overstate unproven therapies. Multiple RCTs and Cochrane reviews show no benefit of corticosteroids in dengue shock or early dengue, and WHO advises against their use; similarly, IVIG and other adjuncts lack supportive evidence, so these should not be used outside trials [^114uhWzE] [^116pfcVb] [^1137AeAo].

> Next, I should review special populations. In pregnancy, monitor closely for preterm labor and consider delivery planning if disease occurs near term; in infants and young children, capillary leak and shock risk can be pronounced, so early recognition and conservative fluid titration are essential; in patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disease, tailor fluids and transfusion decisions carefully to avoid overload and bleeding complications [^113uunyk] [^111K9pnT] [^113oB7kg].

> I will now examine what to avoid beyond NSAIDs. Aspirin and other antiplatelet agents should be avoided due to bleeding risk; prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear bacterial coinfection; and importantly, I should avoid hypotonic IV fluids, which have been associated with harm in dengue and are not recommended by WHO/CDC guidance [^117NrG6w] [^11218wun].

> Let me consider emerging therapies and why they are not yet standard. Antivirals like balapiravir failed to show virologic or clinical benefit in early trials, and no antiviral is approved; micronutrient supplementation remains investigational; and while TPO receptor agonists such as eltrombopag have been explored for thrombocytopenia, they are not established therapy for dengue and should not be used routinely outside research settings [^1169txQ6] [^114vkigv] [^117S9eKK] [^116v4D2D].

> Next, I should review prognostic markers to guide vigilance. Lower platelet counts, lower serum albumin, higher AST/ALT, clinical fluid accumulation, persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, and mucosal bleeding during the febrile phase are associated with progression to severe disease; incorporating these into monitoring plans can improve early detection and timely escalation of care [^116KTFeY] [^116xa4Vt].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical algorithm to ensure it is coherent. Non-severe cases without warning signs are managed outpatient with oral hydration and acetaminophen or metamizole, with clear return precautions; patients with warning signs or severe disease require hospitalization, IV crystalloids guided by pulse pressure, capillary refill, hematocrit, and urine output, avoidance of prophylactic platelets, and ICU-level monitoring for shock or organ dysfunction; throughout, I should avoid NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and hypotonic fluids, and tailor decisions in pregnancy and comorbid states [^1144kinC] [^111K9pnT] [^113uunyk].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention and public health steps are not overlooked. Patients should use mosquito repellent and bed nets during the febrile viremic period to limit transmission, and in endemic settings, vaccination strategies are evolving but require serostatus-informed use; clinicians should also remember to include dengue in the differential of undifferentiated febrile illness in endemic areas and consider coinfections such as COVID-19 when clinically indicated [^113uunyk] [^115hEkMw] [^1127gtLL].

---

Dengue fever treatment is **supportive care only** [^1154p52a], with no specific antiviral therapy [^117NrG6w]. Management centers on **hydration** [^115vqG5k], **acetaminophen** for fever and pain [^1144kinC], and close monitoring for warning signs of severe disease [^116xa4Vt]. Hospitalize patients with warning signs or severe dengue for IV crystalloids [^112NFsra], careful fluid titration [^111K9pnT], and lab monitoring; avoid NSAIDs [^116n2FwV], aspirin, and prophylactic platelet transfusions [^114dBpXV]. With timely supportive care, mortality remains below 1% [^113u2Sc4].

---

## General principles of management

- **Supportive care**: Dengue has no specific antiviral therapy [^115hEkMw]; management is supportive, focusing on symptom control, hydration, and monitoring for complications [^117NrG6w].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients and caregivers on warning signs [^116xa4Vt] and when to seek medical attention [^117NrG6w].

- **Prevention of transmission**: Patients should avoid mosquito bites during the febrile phase to prevent further transmission [^1154p52a].

---

## Management of non-severe dengue fever

### Outpatient care

- **Hydration**: Encourage oral rehydration [^115vqG5k] with water, oral rehydration solutions, or electrolyte-rich fluids [^117NrG6w].

- **Antipyretic and analgesic therapy**: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the preferred agent for fever and pain control [^1144kinC]; avoid NSAIDs and aspirin due to bleeding risk [^1154p52a].

- **Activity and rest**: Advise rest and avoid strenuous activities until recovery [^117NrG6w].

- **Follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up to monitor for warning signs and complications [^notfound].

---

### Warning signs requiring close monitoring

Abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, liver enlargement (> 2 cm), and a **progressive increase in hematocrit** [^116xa4Vt] with a rapid decrease in platelet count warrant close monitoring [^116KTFeY].

---

## Management of severe dengue fever

### Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated for patients with warning signs [^1144Qd2i], severe dengue (shock, severe bleeding, or organ impairment), inability to tolerate oral fluids, pregnancy, infancy, elderly patients, or those with comorbidities [^1144Qd2i].

---

### Inpatient management

#### Fluid management

- **Initial fluid resuscitation**: Use isotonic crystalloids (normal saline or Ringer's lactate) [^111K9pnT] for initial resuscitation [^113W5WRA].

- **Fluid titration**: Titrate fluids based on clinical response, hematocrit, and urine output to avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload [^111K9pnT].

- **Colloids**: Consider colloids (e.g. dextran-40) only in cases of severe shock refractory to crystalloids [^notfound].

---

#### Monitoring and laboratory investigations

- **Vital signs**: Monitor frequently (every 1–2 hours initially) [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: Regularly check hematocrit, platelet count, liver enzymes, renal function, and electrolytes [^116KTFeY].

- **Capillary refill time and lactate**: Use capillary refill time [^116LBoGj] and lactate measurement [^117SiR39] to guide fluid management.

---

#### Management of complications

- **Shock**: Rapid volume replacement with crystalloids; consider vasopressors if shock persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation [^1135FbxD].

- **Bleeding**: Transfuse blood products only if there is active bleeding or a bleeding tendency; avoid prophylactic platelet transfusions [^114dBpXV].

- **Organ impairment**: Provide supportive care for hepatic, renal, or cardiac involvement [^115hEkMw].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

Children are at **higher risk of severe dengue** [^1146cmgc]; monitor closely and ensure early intervention. Use weight-based fluid calculations and avoid fluid overload [^111K9pnT].

---

### Pregnant patients

Pregnant patients require **close monitoring** for complications, including preterm labor and hemorrhage. Consider **delivery timing** based on maternal and fetal conditions [^notfound].

---

## Medications to avoid

Avoid **NSAIDs and aspirin** because of the increased bleeding risk [^1154p52a]. Corticosteroids are not recommended due to a lack of benefit and potential harm [^1137AeAo] [^114uhWzE]. Prophylactic platelet transfusions should not be given in the absence of active bleeding [^114dBpXV].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

With appropriate supportive care, mortality from severe dengue is **less than 1%** [^113u2Sc4]. Early recognition and management of complications significantly improve outcomes [^115hEkMw].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention relies on **vector control** — eliminating standing water, using insecticides, and employing biological control methods [^1166u9xd] [^114vkigv]. Personal protective measures include using repellents, wearing protective clothing, and using bed nets [^notfound]. Vaccination is recommended in endemic areas where available [^115hEkMw] [^113iVWCo].

---

Dengue fever treatment is supportive, emphasizing hydration, symptom control, and close monitoring for complications. Hospitalization is required for severe cases, with careful fluid management and monitoring. Avoid NSAIDs, aspirin, and prophylactic platelet transfusions. With timely supportive care, **mortality is low** [^114vkigv].

Introduction

Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are major causes of hospital admission and mortality in children.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of supportive treatments for dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding blood component transfusion to standard intravenous fluids; adding corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin to standard intravenous fluids; and crystalloids versus colloids.

### Current status of dengue therapeutics research and development [^117LMRfP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Dengue is a significant global health problem. Even though a vaccine against dengue is now available, which is a notable achievement, its long-term protective efficacy against each of the 4 dengue virus serotypes remains to be definitively determined. Consequently, drugs directed at the viral targets or critical host mechanisms that can be used safely as prophylaxis or treatment to effectively ameliorate disease or reduce disease severity and fatalities are still needed to reduce the burden of dengue. This review will provide a brief account of the status of therapeutics research and development for dengue.

### Dengue [^116L4Lze]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because efforts to control dengue are flagging, this review focuses on the mechanisms underlying severe disease and on treatment options, good and bad.

Recent Findings

The year 2001 witnessed unprecedented global dengue epidemic activity in the American hemisphere, the Pacific islands and continental Asia. Early diagnosis of dengue is important but what is the value and appropriate use of the tourniquet test? A negative test does not rule out dengue infection, a positive test should be followed by close surveillance for early signs of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Low platelet counts do not predict clinically significant bleeding in dengue. It follows that platelet or blood transfusions should not be administered based upon platelet count alone. Dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome cases frequently have compensated consumptive coagulopathy that seldom requires treatment. Bleeding is most likely caused by activated platelets resulting from damaged capillary endothelium. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome can be safely treated with just normal saline. Colloids should be immediately given to children presenting with a pulse pressure at or below 10 mmHg. Human leukocyte antigen alleles correlate with both protection and susceptibility to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome; studies in Haiti suggest that blacks have a gene providing nearly complete protection against severe dengue illness.

Summary

The role that antibodies play in protecting and enhancing dengue infections has been largely ignored. Such studies require definitive knowledge of what cells are infected in human dengue and an understanding of all the early antibody-accessible steps of infection of these target cells.

### Febrile illness in a young traveler: dengue fever and its complications [^114VL4iL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dengue fever, a tropical disease once confined mostly to endemic areas in developing countries, is becoming more prevalent. Globalization has led to an increased incidence of the virus both in foreign travelers returning home and local outbreaks in traditionally nonendemic areas, such as the southern United States and southern Europe. Advances in diagnostic tests, therapies, and vaccines for dengue virus have been limited, but research is ongoing.

Objectives

To review the current literature regarding the diagnosis and management of dengue fever.

Case Report

This case report describes a young woman returning from Central America with many of the common signs and symptoms who was misdiagnosed both abroad and at home. We explore the epidemiology, disease course, complications, and treatment of dengue fever.

Conclusion

Emergency physicians should consider dengue fever in patients with acute febrile illnesses, especially among those with recent travel.

### Role of T cells, cytokines and antibody in dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever [^111LS49U]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Dengue infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. There is no vaccine for dengue and also there are no anti-viral drugs to treat the infection. Some patients, typically those experiencing a secondary infection with a different dengue serotype, may progress from an acute febrile disease to the more severe forms of disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Here we discuss the significant immunopathological component to severe disease and how T cells, cytokines and cross-reactive antibody combine to contribute to the progression to dengue haemorrhagic fever. These events are thought to lead to vascular leakage, the signature event in dengue haemorrhagic fever, and are addressed in this review by incorporating the concept of heterologous T cell immunity. The need for effective measures against dengue and dengue-related illness is clear. We propose that drugs against dengue virus, or the symptoms of severe dengue disease, are a viable goal.

### Dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndromes [^112t8yNn]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide a comprehensive review of dengue, with an emphasis on clinical syndromes, classification, diagnosis, and management, and to outline relevant aspects of epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, and prevention strategies. Dengue, a leading cause of childhood mortality in Asia and South America, is the most rapidly spreading and important arboviral disease in the world and has a geographic distribution of > 100 countries.

Data Source

Boolean searches were carried out by using PubMed from 1975 to March 2009 and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1993 to March 2009 to identify potentially relevant articles by key search terms such as: "dengue"; "dengue fever"; "dengue hemorrhagic fever"; "dengue shock syndrome"; "severe dengue" and "immunopathogenesis", pathogenesis", "classification", "complications", and "management". In addition, authoritative seminal and up-to-date reviews by experts were used.

Study Selection

Original research and up-to-date reviews and authoritative reviews consensus statements relevant to diagnosis and therapy were selected.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We considered the most relevant articles that would be important and of interest to the critical care practitioner as well as authoritative consensus statements from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dengue viral infections are caused by one of four single-stranded ribonucleic acid viruses of the family Flaviviridae and are transmitted by their mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The clinical syndromes caused by dengue viral infections occur along a continuum; most cases are asymptomatic and few present with severe forms characterized by shock. Management is predominantly supportive and includes methods to judiciously resolve shock and control bleeding while at the same time preventing fluid overload.

Conclusions

Dengue is no longer confined to the tropics and is a global disease. Treatment is supportive. Outcomes can be optimized by early recognition and cautious titrated fluid replacement, especially in resource-limited environments.

### Corticosteroids for treating dengue shock syndrome [^114uhWzE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dengue shock syndrome is the most severe from of dengue haemorrhagic fever, one of the leading causes of death in children. Observational studies have suggested corticosteroids may benefit people with dengue shock syndrome.

Objectives

To compare corticosteroids with placebo or no corticosteroids for treating dengue shock syndrome.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register (January 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE, (1974 to January 2006), LILACS (1982 to January 2006), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids with no corticosteroids or placebo in people diagnosed with dengue shock syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. We calculated the relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, and presented them with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Four trials involving 284 participants met the inclusion criteria. Corticosteroids were no more effective than placebo or no treatment for reducing the number of deaths (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.11; 284 participants, 4 trials), the need for blood transfusion (RR 1.08, 0.52 to 2.24; 89 participants, 2 trials), or the number of serious complications (convulsions and pulmonary haemorrhage) as reported in one trial (63 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to justify the use of corticosteroids in managing dengue shock syndrome. As corticosteroids can potentially do harm, clinicians should not use them unless they are participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing corticosteroids with placebo.

### Dengue – how best to classify it [^111SmCnr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Dengue has emerged as a major public health problem worldwide. Dengue virus infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations. Since the 1970s, clinical dengue has been classified according to the World Health Organization guideline as dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The classification has been criticized with regard to its usefulness and its applicability. In 2009, the World Health Organization issued a new guideline that classifies clinical dengue as dengue and severe dengue. The 2009 classification differs significantly from the previous classification in both conceptual and practical levels. The impacts of the new classification on clinical practice, dengue research, and public health policy are discussed.

### Corticosteroids for dengue infection [^116pfcVb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dengue is a common and important mosquito-borne viral infection. In many low- and middle-income countries it is endemic and is an important public health problem. Severe dengue is an important cause of death in children. There is no specific treatment for dengue, but observational studies suggest corticosteroids may have a benefit in dengue-related shock, and some people believe corticosteroids may prevent the progression to severe illness if given early in the course of the illness.

Objectives

To compare treatment of dengue with and without use of corticosteroids or placebo in relation to preventing shock-related death and disease progression in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Centralized Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; and LILACS, up to 6 January 2014. We screened reference lists and contacted the relevant study authors for additional information where required.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids with placebo or no corticosteroids in patients diagnosed with dengue-related shock, or patients in an early symptomatic state of dengue with positive serology.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two researchers independently screened eligibility of records, extracted data and assessed quality of the studies. We presented findings in meta-analysis and summary of findings tables and evaluated the quality of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included eight studies enrolling 948 participants in this review. Paitents with dengue-related shock Four studies enrolled children younger than 15 years with dengue-related shock at hospitals in Southeast Asia and evaluated intravenous corticosteroids. The trials did not detect an effect on death (four trials, 284 participants, very low quality evidence), the need for blood transfusion (two trials, 89 participants, very low quality evidence), pulmonary haemorrhage (one trial, 63 participants, very low quality evidence), convulsions (one trial, 63 participants, very low quality evidence), or duration of hospitalization (one trial, 63 participants, very low quality evidence). The body of evidence is too small to confidently prove or exclude clinically important effects. Furthermore, the trials are more than 20 years old with several methodological limitations. Patients with dengue at an early stage Four studies enrolled 664 children and adults with dengue at an early stage of infection (without shock) in Columbia, India, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. In these participants there were no evidence of effects of oral or intravenous corticosteroids on mortality (four trials, 664 participants, low quality evidence), or on the development of complications of severe dengue such as shock (two trials, 286 participants, very low quality evidence), severe bleeding (two trials, 425 participants, very low quality evidence), severe thrombocytopaenia (one trial, 225 participants, very low quality evidence), ascites (one trial, 178 participants, very low quality evidence) and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (two trials, 286 participants, very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence from trials using corticosteroids in dengue is inconclusive and the quality of evidence is low to very low. This applies to both the use of corticosteroids in dengue-related shock and for dengue at an early stage. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of early stage dengue fever and dengue-related shock outside of the context of a randomized controlled trial.

### Is new dengue vaccine efficacy data a relief or cause for concern? [^114vkigv]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Supportive treatment (antipyretics, judicious intravascular volume repletion) delivered by clinicians with experience treating dengue is very effective with low case fatality rates. Unfortunately, variance in clinical care exists and dengue has high morbidity and mortality in many endemic countries. Currently, no anti-DENV antivirals or immune-based (monoclonal antibodies) prophylactics or therapeutics are approved for use, but promising efforts are underway.

Reducing human arboviral infections through mosquito control strategies has had intermittent success. The widely held opinion that mosquito control is a necessary component of a comprehensive dengue control strategy requires the expanded study of available and novel approaches. The recent development and deployment of mosquito control methods using genetic- or microbial-based alterations to mosquito populations offers the potential for improved outcomes.

### Dengue in children [^1146cmgc]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease of expanding geographical range and increasing incidence. The vast majority of dengue cases are children less than 15 years of age. Dengue causes a spectrum of illness from mild fever to severe disease with plasma leakage and shock. Infants and children with secondary heterologous dengue infections are most at risk for severe dengue disease. Laboratory diagnosis of dengue can be established within five days of disease onset by direct detection of viral components in serum. After day five, serologic diagnosis provides indirect evidence of dengue. Currently, no effective antiviral agents are available to treat dengue infection. Therefore, treatment remains supportive, with emphasis on close hematological monitoring, recognition of warning signs of severe disease and fluid-replacement therapy and/or blood transfusions when required. Development of a dengue vaccine is considered a high public health priority. A safe and efficacious dengue vaccine would also be important for travelers. This review highlights the current understanding of dengue in children, including its clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnostic tests, management and prevention.

### Dengue research opportunities in the americas [^112k5fA4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Dengue is a systemic arthropod-borne viral disease of major global public health importance. At least 2.5 billion people who live in areas of the world where dengue occurs are at risk of developing dengue fever (DF) and its severe complications, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Repeated reemergences of dengue in sudden explosive epidemics often cause public alarm and seriously stress healthcare systems. The control of dengue is further challenged by the lack of effective therapies, vaccines, and point-of-care diagnostics. Despite years of study, even its pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. This article discusses recent advances in dengue research and identifies challenging gaps in research on dengue clinical evaluation, diagnostics, epidemiology, immunology, therapeutics, vaccinology/clinical trials research, vector biology, and vector ecology. Although dengue is a major global tropical pathogen, epidemiologic and disease control considerations in this article emphasize dengue in the Americas.

### Severe dengue: questioning the paradigm [^115qRX9G]. Microbes and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Severe dengue has been recognised for more than 200 years, but attempts to define, categorize and explain the condition have hotly contested for more than four decades. Resolution of this controversy may provide new insights for the management of patients.

### Predicting outcome from dengue [^113u2Sc4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dengue is the most important arboviral infection affecting humans, and presents a major challenge for public health services worldwide. Infection can be caused by any of four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 to 4), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Over half the world's population is thought to live in areas at risk for transmission, and recent estimates suggest that around 400 million infections occur annually, of which 100 million are clinically apparent. The clinical phenotype varies from a mild self-limiting febrile illness through to severe and occasionally life-threatening disease. Symptomatic disease typically follows three phases: an initial febrile phase lasting 3 to 7 days; a critical phase around defervescence, during which complications appear in a small proportion of patients; and a spontaneous recovery phase. Complications primarily affect the vascular system, and include an unusual plasma leakage syndrome that may result in hypovolaemic shock – the potentially fatal dengue shock syndrome (DSS); a coagulopathy sometimes accompanied by bleeding; and organ impairment. Because these severe manifestations occur relatively late in the disease course, often when the infecting virus is no longer detectable in plasma, immune-mediated mechanisms are postulated to play a significant role in pathogenesis. Currently no vaccine is available, and neither antiviral drugs nor immunomodulatory agents have been shown to be effective in reducing morbidity or improving disease outcome. However, with good supportive care (primarily judicious use of parenteral fluid therapy to offset plasma volume losses due to leakage), mortality rates of less than 1% are possible even among DSS cases.

Although the vast majority of symptomatic infections do not progress to severe disease, areas of high dengue transmission can have seasonal epidemics, which can quickly overwhelm health service capacity. Thus, the ability to identify patients at high risk of progression, who are likely to benefit from close observation and early intervention with supportive therapy, has become the focus of intense research efforts in recent years. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised the classification system for dengue, defining two major entities – dengue and severe dengue – to replace the more complicated dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) system used previously. The new classification also encompasses a set of 'warning signs' intended to help clinicians identify patients likely to develop complications during the critical phase of the illness (Figure 1). These signs and symptoms were derived in part from a dataset describing almost 2,000 patients with dengue across Asia and Latin America, but owing to the small number of patients progressing to severe disease during the study, further work is needed to validate the findings.

### Dengue viral infection in children: a perspective [^112z5TZM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Dengue is a vector-borne viral infection of global importance. Several pathogenetic mechanisms such as immune enhancement and selection pressure have been proposed and febrile, critical and recovery phases have been identified. A new classification proposed by WHO has recently been introduced where definitions have been changed to 'probable dengue', 'dengue with warning signs' and 'severe dengue'. The majority of dengue viral infections are self-limiting, but complications have high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of dengue viral infection is essentially clinical, although confirmation requires laboratory tests including serology, NS1 antigen detection, PCR and viral cultures. There are no specific anti-dengue drugs and treatment is basically supportive and consists of early recognition of complications and appropriate fluid therapy. A number of candidate vaccines are under development.

### Dengue: a continuing global threat [^112eDFTi]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever are important arthropod-borne viral diseases. Each year, there are ∼50 million dengue infections and ∼500,000 individuals are hospitalized with dengue haemorrhagic fever, mainly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific and the Americas. Illness is produced by any of the four dengue virus serotypes. A global strategy aimed at increasing the capacity for surveillance and outbreak response, changing behaviours and reducing the disease burden using integrated vector management in conjunction with early and accurate diagnosis has been advocated. Antiviral drugs and vaccines that are currently under development could also make an important contribution to dengue control in the future.

Dengue is a resurging mosquito-borne disease that is often contracted in U.S. travelers to Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean. The clinical symptoms range from a simple febrile illness to hemorrhagic fever or shock. The clinical course has a wide range of outcomes, and adequate supportive care can reduce mortality rates dramatically. Repeated exposures to the virus can lead to a more complicated clinical course.

### Micronutrient supplementation and clinical outcomes in patients with dengue fever [^117S9eKK]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dengue fever (DF) is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is common in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Symptoms are variable but often include fever, rash, retro-orbital pain, thrombocytopenia, and severe myalgias. Although DF is often self-limited, some DF patients will progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever, a syndrome characterized by plasma leakage, changes in consciousness, and internal bleeding. Dengue hemorrhagic fever can ultimately lead to dengue shock syndrome, a severe condition consisting of circulatory collapse and sometimes death. The pathophysiology of these syndromes is complex, but dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are thought to be caused in part by an excessive cytokine response leading to increased vascular permeability, which contributes to vascular leakage and subsequent shock. Growing evidence also suggests that oxidative stress may play a role in DF pathogenesis.

Dengue fever and its complications are a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with approximately 300 million infections and 10,000 deaths per year. – Treatment options for DF patients remain limited, as no effective antiviral drugs are currently available. Current guidelines for clinical treatment of DF patients largely focus on supportive measures, with specific attention paid to management of fluid status and hemodynamic parameters among those patients who develop dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.

Providers caring for DF patients sometimes provide micronutrient supplements as an adjunct to standard supportive care, – as these supplements are generally inexpensive and some may offer hypothetical benefits to dengue patients via numerous potential mechanisms, including modulation of the host immune response – and antioxidant effects. Proposed mechanisms of clinical benefit in DF for several micronutrients are outlined in Table 1.

Table 1
Micronutrients and proposed mechanisms of clinical benefit in patients with dengue fever

Several recent studies have sought to evaluate the efficacy of micronutrient supplementation among DF patients. These studies have investigated associations between clinical outcomes and supplementation of various micronutrients, including vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, folic acid, and zinc. No prior literature review has summarized the findings of these clinical studies. Our goals in this review, therefore, were to consolidate and synthesize the findings of studies between 2010 and 2020, which investigated the role of micronutrient supplementation in the clinical care of patients with DF, and to identify gaps in the current literature to guide future research on this topic.

### A randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial of balapiravir, a polymerase inhibitor, in adult dengue patients [^1169txQ6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dengue is the most common arboviral infection of humans. There are currently no specific treatments for dengue. Balapiravir is a prodrug of a nucleoside analogue (called R1479) and an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus replication in vivo.

Methods

We conducted in vitro experiments to determine the potency of balapiravir against dengue viruses and then an exploratory, dose-escalating, randomized placebo-controlled trial in adult male patients with dengue with < 48 hours of fever.

Results

The clinical and laboratory adverse event profile in patients receiving balapiravir at doses of 1500 mg (n = 10) or 3000 mg (n = 22) orally for 5 days was similar to that of patients receiving placebo (n = 32), indicating balapiravir was well tolerated. However, twice daily assessment of viremia and daily assessment of NS1 antigenemia indicated balapiravir did not measurably alter the kinetics of these virological markers, nor did it reduce the fever clearance time. The kinetics of plasma cytokine concentrations and the whole blood transcriptional profile were also not attenuated by balapiravir treatment.

Conclusions

Although this trial, the first of its kind in dengue, does not support balapiravir as a candidate drug, it does establish a framework for antiviral treatment trials in dengue and provides the field with a clinically evaluated benchmark molecule.

### An evidence-based algorithm for early prognosis of severe dengue in the outpatient setting [^111UKkWY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Dengue is the most common arboviral infection of humans and a public health burden in much of tropical Asia and Latin America. Seasonal epidemics, with children and young adults most affected, place enormous stress on healthcare systems in endemic countries. The burden of dengue in 10 endemic countries was revealed with precision in phase 3 vaccine trials of the now licensed Dengvaxia vaccine, in which approximately 10% of all febrile episodes in the control groups were confirmed to be dengue cases. Among these dengue cases, the percentage requiring hospitalization was 19.1% in the Asian cohort and 11.1% in the Latin American cohort.

The pathophysiological hallmarks of severe dengue are increased capillary permeability, coagulopathy, and a hemorrhagic diathesis. For some patients this can lead to hypovolemic shock, called dengue shock syndrome (DSS), with or without clinically severe bleeding. Other rare complications can include hepatic dysfunction, central nervous system involvement, and myocarditis. Progress in clinical management, particularly fluid resuscitation and monitoring in intensive care, has led to a decline in the dengue case fatality rate over the last 2 decades; it is now < 1% of hospitalized cases in many settings, but can exceed 20% if treatment is inadequate. There are no specific antiviral or disease-modifying treatments for dengue despite recent efforts.

DSS typically manifests between the fourth and sixth day of illness, during the so-called critical phase. Features such as abdominal pain, lethargy, rapidly rising hematocrit level, and persistent vomiting have anecdotally been associated with progression to DSS or other clinically severe manifestations. However, the prognostic value of these signs and symptoms, which usually occur near the time of shock, have not been formally evaluated. Thus emergency department physicians seeing a patient with 3 days of fever in whom dengue is suspected are faced with a dilemma; to send the patient home with a request that they return for follow-up or to admit them for observation as they approach the critical phase. The hospitalization of a large number of dengue cases for observation inevitably places a burden on healthcare resources and has direct and indirect costs to patients and their families.

### Severe dengue: the need for new case definitions [^115eTHJy]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Dengue fever imposes a societal burden that is difficult to measure because of the disease's non-specific symptoms and the lack of easily applied case definitions for its more severe manifestations. An efficacy trial of a tetravalent vaccine is expected in the near future, but only one of the severe dengue syndromes-the continuum of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome-is well defined. One of the results of the focus on dengue haemorrhagic fever is the false perception of low disease burden in the Americas, which is an obstacle to the mobilisation of political and economic resources to fight the disease. Three improvements are necessary to standardise the dengue haemorrhagic fever definition and to allow it to do well in different populations: (1) redefine the threshold for thrombocytopenia, (2) clarify the standard practice and value of the tourniquet test, and (3) incorporate a criterion to measure intravenous fluid replacement. In addition, for an accurate estimation of dengue burden, locally appropriate definitions of severe dengue must be devised and standardised so they will be considered valid in the global research community.

### Use of pentoxifylline in treatment of children with dengue hemorrhagic fever [^1169Usmj]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The current treatment for dengue hemorrhagic fever largely consists of supportive care. The drug pentoxifylline has been shown to blunt the proinflammatory actions of tumor necrosis factor-α, a key mediator of dengue hemorrhagic fever. We performed a pilot study evaluating pentoxifylline's effect on 55 children with dengue hemorrhagic fever. We believe our findings support the existing literature on its potential use in severe infection.

### Clinical management of patients with dengue infection in Japan: results from national database of health insurance claims [^11218wun]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Dengue guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control (WHO, 2011) recommend acetaminophen and isotonic fluid for patients with dengue infection but do not recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hypotonic fluid. Other research showed no evidence of efficacy of platelet infusion in prophylactic. This research aims to clarify to what extent dengue patients were managed in accordance with the guidelines in Japan. We extracted claim data of patients with either dengue fever (DF) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan between 2011 and 2015. The total number of patients was 1,370, which consisted of 1,306 DF patients and 64 DHF patients; 185 patients were younger than (<) 20 years and 1,185 patients were aged 20 years or older (≥). Among them, 24.5% of DF patients and 48.4% of DHF patients received hypotonic intravenous fluid, 12.9% and 18.8% NSAIDs, and 1.3% and 17.2% platelet transfusion, respectively. Comparing patients aged < 20 years with patients aged ≥ 20 years, 57.8% and 54.5% received acetaminophen, 6.5% and 14.3% received NSAIDs, 40.0% and 38.3% received isotonic fluid, and 37.8% and 23.7% received hypotonic fluid, respectively. Platelet transfusion was used for 1.3% of DH and 17.2% of DHF patients. The study indicated that dengue patients in Japan might have increased risks of developing adverse events because of receiving the treatment that the guidelines do not recommend. More effort is needed to facilitate medical practitioners to follow the guidelines.

### The increasing importance of dengue virus infection in Saudi arabia: a review [^113GCWx9]. Virus Research (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Current management strategies

Despite dengue infection being prevalent worldwide, there is presently no effective antiviral therapy available, and the conventional treatment approach continues to focus on providing supportive care. Hence, there is an urgent demand for antiviral medications with the potential to effectively treat severe dengue infections. Since there is no specific recommended treatment for dengue, the primary approach is to provide supportive care. This typically involves fluid replacement therapy, with 0.9% saline as the initial choice, administered through either infusion or bolus dose in cases of shock. This approach is backed by evidence to prevent hypovolemia and the occurrence of any complications. While acetaminophen can be used to reduce fever, it's important to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as they can raise the risk of bleeding. Whether hospitalization is necessary depends on the patient's condition, and they should be carefully assessed and closely monitored for any concerning signs.

Creating a safe and effective dengue vaccine has proven immensely challenging, despite being a vital element in the multifaceted strategy to combat dengue on a global scale. Over the past 75 years, scientists and developers have made significant efforts to design such vaccines, but they have faced formidable challenges. While various approaches have been under investigation, only vaccines using live attenuated viruses have progressed to licensure or advanced stages of clinical development. At this time, only Denvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur Inc. USA) has been permitted licensing, as well as Takeda: TAK-003. The initial findings from the long-term safety study of Dengvaxia trials showed promising efficacy in reducing hospitalization, but this effectiveness is significantly influenced by the individual's prior exposure to dengue virus and their age at vaccination. There is a need for more research to uncover the reasons behind the reduced efficacy in seronegative individuals and the increased risk of hospitalization in children under 9 years old. These questions remain unresolved and are the subject of ongoing investigation. Vaccination for dengue and programs aimed at controlling the spread of the disease could provide a cost-efficient strategy, and could be explored as a strategy in Saudi Arabia.

### A randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial of balapiravir, a polymerase inhibitor, in adult dengue patients [^113oB7kg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Dengue is an acute illness caused by 1 of 4 single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses and is the commonest arboviral infection of humans. In countries where dengue is endemic, the case burden strains already fragile healthcare systems and has an economic cost. There are currently no licensed vaccines for dengue (although late-stage trials are in progress), and mosquito vector control has been mostly unsuccessful or unsustainable.

Clinically apparent dengue manifests with a spectrum of symptoms. High fever, erythema, headache, and myalgia are common symptoms, and laboratory findings of leukopenia and mild thrombocytopenia are typical. The critical phase occurs around the time of defervescence, typically on days 4–6 of illness, during which a transient capillary permeability syndrome manifests in some patients. In children particularly, capillary permeability can be significant enough to precipitate life-threatening circulatory shock, called dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Treatment is supportive, and the mortality rate for DSS in experienced hospital settings is < 1%.

Dengue Clinical Disease

Dengue clinical disease ranges from a mild, undifferentiated febrile illness to severe disease complicated by shock, bleeding, or severe organ impairment. Approximately 75% of dengue infections are mild or asymptomatic. The most common presentation of symptomatic disease is sudden onset of fever accompanied by headache, retro-orbital pain, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, flushing of the face, anorexia, abdominal pain, and nausea. A generalized erythematous, macular rash developing within 3–4 days of fever onset frequently is observed. Laboratory-detected findings can include leukopenia, hemoconcentration, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies dengue illness as 1) dengue with or without warning signs for progression toward severe dengue and 2) severe dengue. Warning signs of severe dengue include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation (e.g. ascites, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion), mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, postural hypotension, liver enlargement of > 2 cm, or an increased hematocrit level concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count. Criteria for the case definition of severe dengue include any sign of severe plasma leakage leading to shock or fluid accumulation with respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or severe organ impairment.

Patients with severe dengue need in-hospital medical treatment to mitigate poor clinical outcomes commonly due to vascular permeability, which results in plasma leakage and leads to hypovolemic shock or clinically significant ascites or pleural effusions, and less commonly, to severe bleeding due to various host or viral factors. Because of the risk for complications due to plasma leakage and bleeding, severe dengue requires monitoring and treatment in intensive care settings. Although rare, dengue can affect the liver, heart, central nervous system, kidneys, eyes, muscles, or bone marrow. These severe manifestations of dengue carry a high risk for death and must be recognized and appropriately managed in a timely manner. Age, comorbidities, host genetics, and the infecting virus strain are risk factors for severe dengue, and heterotypic secondary infections are the most prominent factor associated with severe dengue.

Dengue Treatment

No effective antiviral treatments against dengue are available; therefore, the mainstay for preventing severe disease and death is timely and supportive management with volume replacement, particularly among patients with severe dengue. The case-fatality ratio for severe dengue has been reported to be as high as 13% and can be < 1% with access to timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### The intracerebral haemorrhage in patients with dengue fever: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GoVCG]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dengue virus infection poses a significant health threat, affecting at least 3.6 billion people across more than 125 countries in tropical and subtropical regions who are at high risk. Dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito‐borne disease in worldwide and recent study estimated the global burden of dengue to be approximately 390 million infections per annually. Dengue is a febrile illness with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe infection with multi‐organ dysfunction. A majority of patients with dengue fever (DF) recover without complication, but the mortality rate ranges from 1% to 5% without treatment, but it decreases to less than 1% when adequate treatment is administered.

However, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), also known as severe dengue, presents a wide spectrum of bleeding manifestations and carries a mortality rate of 26%. Neurological involvement, which may include encephalopathy, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), or infarction, is a rare but potentially fatal complication of dengue. The incidence of ICH in dengue infections is approximately 1.1%.

ICH, a condition characterised by bleeding within the brain, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Dengue virus is a neurotropic virus with the ability to infect the supporting cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Neural injury during the acute stage of the infection results from direct neuro‐invasion and/or the phenomenon of antibody‐dependent enhancement, resulting in plasma leakage and coagulopathy.

Dengue fever poses a significant public health challenge due to the potentially fatal outcomes associated with severe infections, including ICH. Consequently, assessing the risk of ICH and implementing appropriate clinical management strategies are crucial for preventing mortality related to dengue fever. The objective of this article is to systematically review and analyse the existing literature on this subject, offer insights into the risk of potential neurological complications of dengue, particularly ICH, and identify gaps in research that could inform clinical practice and public health strategies.

### Current status of dengue therapeutics research and development [^115WFyA8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The geographic distribution of dengue has expanded globally in the past 5 decades. This mosquito-borne acute disease is now endemic in > 100 countries, with an estimated 400 million infections each year. Recently, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), a tetravalent vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur that consists of genes encoding the premembrane (prM) and E proteins of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1–4 (DENV 1–4) inserted onto the genomic backbone of live attenuated yellow fever vaccine strain, was licensed in several dengue-endemic countries. The vaccine efficacy, however, varied by age and serostatus of the vaccine recipient at baseline and by the DENV serotype causing the infection; lower efficacy was observed for DENV 1 and 2 as compared to DENV 3 and 4. Hence, despite the availability of a dengue vaccine, improvements in case management to reduce the risk of severe dengue are still needed. Current approaches are entirely supportive care in the form of judicious fluid replacement and close clinical monitoring during the critical phase of illness. No antiviral drug has been developed despite the association between higher viremia levels and severe dengue. The current status of dengue burden and impact of various countermeasures is summarized in Figure 1.

### Case management of dengue: lessons learned [^112tgPna]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The global burden of dengue and its geographic distribution have increased over the past several decades. The introduction of dengue in new areas has often been accompanied by high case-fatality rates. Drawing on the experience in managing dengue cases at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health in Bangkok, Thailand, this article provides the authors' perspectives on key clinical lessons to improve dengue-related outcomes. Parallels between this clinical experience and outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials, results of efforts to disseminate practice recommendations, and suggestions for areas for further research are also discussed.

### Dengue: a growing problem with new interventions [^113iVWCo]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Dengue is the disease caused by 1 of 4 distinct, but closely related dengue viruses (DENV-1–4) that are transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquito vectors. It is the most common arboviral disease worldwide, with the greatest burden in tropical and sub-tropical regions. In the absence of effective prevention and control measures, dengue is projected to increase in both disease burden and geographic range. Given its increasing importance as an etiology of fever in the returning traveler or the possibility of local transmission in regions in the United States with competent vectors, as well as the risk for large outbreaks in endemic US territories and associated states, clinicians should understand its clinical presentation and be familiar with appropriate testing, triage, and management of patients with dengue. Control and prevention efforts reached a milestone in June 2021 when the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended Dengvaxia for routine use in children aged 9 to 16 years living in endemic areas with laboratory confirmation of previous dengue virus infection. Dengvaxia is the first vaccine against dengue to be recommended for use in the United States and one of the first to require laboratory testing of potential recipients to be eligible for vaccination. In this review, we outline dengue pathogenesis, epidemiology, and key clinical features for front-line clinicians evaluating patients presenting with dengue. We also provide a summary of Dengvaxia efficacy, safety, and considerations for use as well as an overview of other potential new tools to control and prevent the growing threat of dengue.

### Febrile illness mapping-much of the world without data and without evidence-based treatments [^113rQ3ae]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the world-changing impact of infectious diseases to all 7.8 billion people. Our distant ancestors were aware of the enormous impact of epidemic fevers on their lives and the havoc that they wrought, as we continue to do today. However, before urbanisation, endemic infectious diseases would probably have had greater impact on people's daily lives. Endemic infectious diseases, with the exception of those such as TB, HIV, malaria and dengue that have grabbed public, research and policy attention, have tended to be relatively neglected. Epidemics of Chikungunya, Ebola and Zika have hit the media spotlight in the last decade, but were often perceived as regional tropical issues. Endemic diseases may become epidemic and epidemic diseases endemic. We need to know what infectious diseases are where in order to inform prevention and public engagement programmes and treatment guidelines, both for specific pathogens and for syndromic empirical treatment, and to prioritise interventions and funding. Without such public health intelligence, we will wait for the next disaster blindfolded. The large scale implementation of affordable and accurate malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), usable by health workers with minimal training in rural malarious areas has demonstrated that malaria, although remaining a focally important cause of fever in many areas, has been overestimated as a cause. There have been decreases in malaria incidence in most endemic regions. Hence, there is a great need to understand the epidemiology of fevers other than malaria to inform many policy and implementation decisions.

The three papers (a fourth describing the data from China is awaited) in this series, that evolved from the work of Acestor et al. describe systemic reviews of what we know about where different non-malarial fevers occur in south and southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America. A total of 69,104 records (29,558 from Asia, 16,523 from Africa, 23,023 from Latin America), published 1980–2015, were screened from 101 countries (19 in Asia, 48 in Africa, 34 in Latin America). Of these, 4099 (2410 in Asia, 1065 in Africa, 624 in Latin America) met selection criteria. A wide diversity of pathogens and their distribution are described (see in press, in press, in press).

### Living guidance for clinical management of COVID-19 [^1127gtLL]. WHO Living Guidance 2023 Aug 18 (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for dengue, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis (COVID-19 infection), WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to include arbovirus infections (including dengue and chikungunya) in the differential diagnosis of undifferentiated febrile illness in endemic areas, particularly in the presence of thrombocytopenia. Test for dengue in patients with a febrile illness in endemic areas, irrespective of the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms. Recognize that coinfection with COVID-19 may also occur, and a positive diagnostic test for dengue (such as dengue rapid diagnostic tests) does not exclude the testing for COVID-19 virus.

### Effects of short-course oral corticosteroid therapy in early dengue infection in Vietnamese patients: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^111hst1m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Dengue is the most common vector-borne viral infection of humans, with around 50 million infections estimated to occur annually and some 2.5 billion people living in areas of risk. A broad spectrum of disease manifestations is seen, ranging from asymptomatic infection to a systemic plasma leakage syndrome typically accompanied by thrombocytopenia and coagulation derangements. Severe plasma leakage may progress to life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Globally the burden of severe disease falls primarily on children, and dengue ranks among the leading causes of hospitalization and death for pediatric populations in Asia. Currently neither vaccines nor effective antiviral agents are available and treatment remains supportive with particular emphasis on careful fluid management during the period of plasma leakage.

Relatively little is known about the specific mechanisms responsible for the microvascular dysfunction that results in plasma leakage. Although occasionally reported during primary infections, complications such as DSS are strongly associated with sequential or secondary infections. Antibody-dependent enhancement resulting in increased viral replication is one factor thought to underlie this phenomenon, although a variety of other mechanisms likely also contribute to the final disease phenotype. Severe complications rarely develop until 4–5 days after fever onset, at a time when intrinsic viral clearance mechanisms have reduced measurable plasma viremia to low levels, suggesting that immunopathogenic responses triggered by the virus are crucial. Although no specific pathway has been identified linking such immunopathogenic events with definitive effects on the microvasculature, preliminary evidence points to transient disruption of the surface glycocalyx, a matrix of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans lining the vascular endothelium that regulates microvascular filtration.

Corticosteroids are highly effective anti-inflammatory agents, frequently employed as adjunctive therapy in disease states where the host immune response is thought to contribute significantly to disease pathogenesis. In the 1980s parenteral steroids were used to treat patients with DSS in several small studies, but without evidence of benefit. However, for established shock, recent research indicates that steroid use is only helpful in patients with inadequate cortisol responses. Among patients with less severe sepsis there is some evidence that early administration of corticosteroids improves outcome and/or reduces the need for hospitalization. There is also a growing body of work indicating that steroids modulate the function of the endothelial glycocalyx and may prevent damage to this layer. Extensive experience has been gained using short-course oral steroid therapy to suppress the inflammatory response associated with acute asthma, and children now commonly receive 1–2 mg/kg oral prednisolone for 3 days at the onset of an exacerbation. Side effects are rarely reported, although there have been concerns regarding behavioral disturbance with 2 mg/kg doses, and the trend is now toward using lower doses.

### Travel-associated dengue cases-United States, 2010–2021 [^112SiugV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Dengue, the leading cause of arboviral disease worldwide, can be fatal without appropriate treatment. Among 7,528 confirmed or probable travel-associated U.S. dengue cases reported during 2010–2021, one in five (1,474, 20%) was reported in 2019. This is 168% higher than the annual average number of cases reported during 2010–2018 and 2020–2021 (approximately 550 per year) and 61% higher than the 913 cases reported in 2016, the second highest year on record. The number of cases as a fraction of air traffic volume to international destinations outside North America or Europe was also highest in 2019, with 41.9 cases per million trips, compared with 21.0 per million in other years during 2010–2021. This report compares the number and characteristics of travel-associated dengue cases reported to national surveillance in the United States in 2019 with cases reported during 2010–2018 and 2020–2021. Areas with conditions suitable for dengue transmission as well as the population at risk for dengue are expected to increase, placing U.S. travelers at higher risk for infection. Health care providers should be aware that dengue is a common cause of fever in the returning traveler and be familiar with its signs and symptoms, testing, and management. Dengue vaccines are not currently recommended for U.S. travelers; therefore, persons should review areas of dengue risk and follow guidance for preventing mosquito bites.

### Dengue: a focused review for the emergency clinician [^113e3YL1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Dengue is an arbovirus transmitted by the Aedes spp. mosquito. Approximately 390 million infections occur annually per World Health Organization estimates, with significant increases in infections throughout the last decade. The disease is endemic in warmer climates throughout the world, though cases may also be imported to non-endemic regions by returning travelers. Patients experience a wide variety of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe disease requiring critical care. Emergency clinicians should consider the diagnosis of dengue in patients from endemic areas presenting with a flu-like illness, rash, and evidence of bleeding.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for dengue, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, PAHO/WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider assessing for the following warning signs to identify patients with an increased risk of progression to severe disease:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Abdominal pain|- Progressive until it is continuous or sustained and intense, and at the end of the febrile stage|
|Sensory disorder|- Irritability, drowsiness, and lethargy|
|Mucosal bleeding|- Gingivorrhagia, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding not associated with menstruation or more menstrual bleeding than usual, and hematuria|
|Fluid accumulation|- Clinical, on imaging, or both, at the end of the febrile stage|
|Hepatomegaly|- > 2 cm below the costal margin and abrupt onset|
|Vomiting|- Persistent (≥ 3 episodes in 1 hour or 4 episodes in 6 hours)|
|Progressive increase in hematocrit|- On at least 2 consecutive measurements during patient monitoring.|

### Effect of standard dose paracetamol versus placebo as antipyretic therapy on liver injury in adult dengue infection: a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^116NCtzF]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Dengue is a common cause of acute liver failure in tropical countries. Paracetamol is the recommended antipyretic for dengue. Related observational studies in dengue have suggested that excessive paracetamol intake is related to hepatic injury. We aimed to evaluate whether standard dose paracetamol as an antipyretic in dengue infection caused transaminase elevation, and to evaluate the efficacy of paracetamol.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult participants (aged ≥ 18 years) with dengue, as confirmed by either positive NS1 antigen, positive dengue IgM antigen with thrombocytopenia, or positive PCR test, were enrolled at three Royal Thai Army hospitals in Thailand. Key exclusion criteria were baseline AST or ALT concentrations of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal, cirrhosis, indication of paracetamol other than dengue infection, concurrent diagnosis of other causes of fever, or pregnancy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by a computer-generated block randomisation procedure (block size of six), to receive either paracetamol (500 mg) or placebo (500 mg) every 4 h when body temperature exceeded 38°C during hospitalisation. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with transaminase elevation, defined as serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) concentrations of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal on recovery day, in the intention-to-treat population. Prespecified interim analyses for safety and efficacy were performed with group sequential stopping boundaries. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02833584.

Findings

Between Sept 1, 2016, and Dec 12, 2017, 125 participants were randomly assigned to receive either paracetamol (n = 63) or placebo (n = 62). 123 participants were included in the intention-to-treat population. The median daily dose of study medication was 1·5 g (IQR 0·8–2·0). The study was terminated early owing to a higher rate of transaminase elevation in the paracetamol group than in the placebo group (22% vs 10%; incidence rate ratio 3·77, 95% CI 1·36–10·46, p = 0·011). The change of AST and ALT concentrations in the paracetamol group was higher than in the placebo group (mean difference 12·43 U/L per day, 7·16–17·71, p < 0·0001 for AST; 7·40 U/L per day, 95% CI 3·68–11·13, p = 0·0001 for ALT). Three participants in the paracetamol group had severe dengue: two had upper gastric haemorrhage and one had acute kidney injury. No patients died or had liver failure.

Interpretation

Use of standard dose paracetamol in dengue infection increased the incidence of transaminase elevation, and also overall transaminase concentrations in the absence of a counterbalancing reduced fever or pain score.

### Febrile illness in Asia: gaps in epidemiology, diagnosis and management for informing health policy [^1138gdhL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing evidence is becoming available on the aetiology and management of fevers in Asia; the importance of these fevers has increased with the decline in the incidence of malaria.

Aims

To conduct a narrative review of the epidemiology and management of fevers in South and South-East Asia and to highlight gaps in our knowledge that impair evidence-based health policy decisions.

Sources

A narrative review of papers published since 2012 on developments in fever epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment in South and South-East Asia. The papers that the authors felt were pivotal, from their personal perspectives, are discussed.

Content

We identified 100 studies. Among the 30 studies (30%)-including both children and adults-that investigated three or more pathogens, the most frequently reported fever aetiology was dengue (reported by 15, 50%), followed by leptospirosis (eight, 27%), scrub typhus (seven, 23%) and Salmonella serovar Typhi (six, 20%). Among four studies investigating three or more pathogens in children, dengue and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent, followed by non-typhoidal Salmonella spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella serovar Typhi, and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Increased awareness is needed that rickettsial pathogens are common but do not respond to cephalosporins, and that alternative therapies, such as tetracyclines, are required.

Implications

Many key gaps remain, and consensus guidelines for study design are needed to aid comparative understanding of the epidemiology of fevers. More investment in developing accurate and affordable diagnostic tests for rural Asia and independent evaluation of those already on the market are needed. Treatment algorithms, including simple biomarker assays, appropriate for empirical therapy of fevers in different areas of rural Asia should be a major aim of fever research. Enhanced antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and openly accessible databases of geography-specific AMR data would inform policy on empirical and specific therapy. More investment in innovative strategies facilitating infectious disease surveillance in remote rural communities would be an important component of poverty reduction and improving public health.

### Dengue [^115gJjDh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dengue:

- **Definition**: Dengue fever is an acute arthropod-borne viral illness caused by an RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family.
- **Pathophysiology**: Dengue fever is caused by the dengue virus of the family Flaviviridae that includes four different serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4) and is transmitted through Aedes aegypti mosquito.
- **Epidemiology**: The average incidence of dengue in the Americas is 58.02 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Younger population, poor and crowded socioeconomic living conditions, increased human proximity to dense mosquito populations, rainy season (increased incidence between May and December), presence of mosquito larvae in pooled water in old tires, discarded cans, and plastic containers within household compounds, and low dengue fever health awareness increase the risk of dengue fever.
- **Disease course**: The host-viral interaction, viral replication, and/or direct skin infection by the virus trigger humoral, cellular, and innate host immune response that leads to alterations in endothelial microvascular permeability and thromboregulatory mechanisms causing increased plasma and protein loss resulting in thrombocytopenia associated with platelet dysfunction, damage, or depletion causing significant hemorrhages, breakbone fever, multiorgan damage, and DIC.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality associated with a lack of early appropriate intervention is around 10–20%. The recurrence rate associated with shock is approximately 30%.

### Predicting outcome from dengue [^116PUSLq]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Predicting outcome in dengue remains challenging, and the search for more robust methods continues. Although warning signs are considered a key component for early recognition of potentially severe disease, the current evidence for any particular clinical or laboratory marker is weak. A major global study currently in progress, aiming to recruit 10,000 to 12,000 suspected dengue cases during the early febrile phase, should provide useful information for risk prediction(ClinicalTrials.govID:NCT01550016). However, given the rather broad range of signs and symptoms seen in dengue, inclusion of one or more specific biomarkers is likely to be needed in order to develop a robust algorithm. A number of viral, immunological and endothelial biomarkers have been proposed from small studies, and there is hope that, if these arevalidated in a large patient cohort, algorithms incorporating such biomarkers might prove sufficiently sensitive and specific to be clinically useful, particularly in endemic areas where the case burden is high. However, as the vascular system is the essential target in severe dengue, alternative approaches that focus primarily on the clinical vascular function tests described above could also prove to be helpful. Although these are relatively expensive and limited to centres with specialist expertise at present, if these are shown to be reliable, their non-invasive nature makes them an attractive option, especially for repeated assessments on children, and costs are likely to come down if the techniques are widely deployed. Finally, ongoing research efforts directed towards identifying robust early predictors for severe disease are crucial to ensure that if effective antiviral or disease-modifying drugs do become available in the future, these agents can be used to maximal advantage for the patients most at risk.

### Age and clinical dengue illness [^111vH23d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Dengue fever has emerged as a serious international public health threat with almost half of the world's population at risk for infection. Although > 50 million cases of dengue fever are estimated to occur each year, a large proportion of infections are asymptomatic. Why infection progresses to clinical disease in some persons, but not in others, is not clear. Some evidence suggests that risk for disease, with both classic dengue fever and the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever, varies by age; however, the relationships have never been rigorously quantified. We used data from patients with laboratory-confirmed clinical dengue to describe the relationship between age and the relative risk of becoming ill with classical disease after primary infection with dengue virus. A clearer understanding of this relationship has implications for strategies aimed at controlling dengue fever.

### Dengue: knowledge gaps, unmet needs, and research priorities [^114coPt6]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes up to about 100 million cases of disease each year, placing a major public health, social, and economic burden on numerous low-income and middle-income countries. Major advances by investigators, vaccine developers, and affected communities are revealing new insights and enabling novel interventions and approaches to dengue prevention and control. Such research has highlighted further questions about both the basic understanding of dengue and efforts to develop new tools. In this report, the third in a Series on dengue, we discuss existing approaches to dengue diagnostics, disease prognosis, surveillance, and vector control in low-income and middle-income countries, as well as potential consequences of vaccine introduction. We also summarise current knowledge and recent insights into dengue epidemiology, immunology, and pathogenesis, and their implications for understanding natural infection and current and future vaccines.

### Recommendations for the management of severe malaria and severe dengue in resource-limited settings [^115mWQwW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis in resource-limited settings will often have different aetiologies to those in western settings, including severe malaria, severe dengue, viral haemorrhagic fevers, mellioidosis, typhus, and leptospirosis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines are mainly based on evidence from studies on bacterial sepsis. These guidelines are widely applicable, but there are also exceptions. We focus here on disease-specific recommendations for the management of severe falciparum malaria and severe dengue. An international team with extensive practical experience in resource-limited intensive care units (ICUs) identified key questions concerning the SSC's management recommendations on these diseases. Pertinent evidence from resource-limited settings was evaluated using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) tools.

### Recommendations for the management of severe malaria and severe dengue in resource-limited settings [^111K9pnT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Severe dengue

Severe dengue is caused by dengue virus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Approximately 1–5% of patients will develop severe manifestations. The defining feature is a vasculopathy with increased capillary permeability, causing plasma leakage, reduced intravascular volume and, if severe, life-threatening hypovolemic shock. This 'critical phase' typically starts during the period of defervescense, and lasts for approximately 48 h. Bleeding complications and organ involvement of the brain, liver, kidney and heart may be additional features, and occur more frequently in adult cases. Diagnosis is commonly with combined dengue antigen (NS1) and antibody RDT. No antiviral treatment is currently available (Table 1).

Unlike in bacterial sepsis, capillary leak in patients with severe dengue results in haemoconcentration. Haemorrhage, in particular from the gut, can contribute to hypovolemic shock. Myocarditis is rare, but some depression of myocardial contractility is common. The World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines on fluid resuscitation recommend restoration of the circulation guided by pulse pressure, capillary refill time, haematocrit and urine output. Cautious but prompt fluid administration is essential and should be restricted as soon as the critical phase is over to avoid pulmonary oedema. We recommend fluid administration according to the WHO guidelines (1C). We recommend that rapid (< 30 min) administration of large (> 15 ml/kg) fluid boluses are avoided, unless the patient is hypotensive (1D). In patients with compensated shock, colloids are not superior to normal saline or Ringer's lactate for shock reversal, or for the prevention of recurrent shock, and we recommend that colloids are not used (1A). There is insufficient evidence to recommend fluid choice in dengue hypotensive shock. The use of corticosteroids is not recommended (1B). Although thrombocytopenia is an inherent feature of severe dengue, the cause of bleeding is multifactorial, including a prominent vasculopathy. Bleeding is not prevented by platelet transfusion; we do not recommend platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia in the absence of active bleeding complications or other risk factors (1C). In cases of bleeding complications, we suggest transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma (or cryoprecipitate) and platelet concentrate (ungraded).

### Dengue human infection models supporting drug development [^1135FbxD]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The 4 serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to DENV-4) are the most important arboviral pathogens of humans. The global burden of dengue, recently estimated at approximately 100 million cases per year, remains unchallenged by licensed vaccines or sustainable vector control strategies. The scale of the dengue burden in the endemic countries of Asia and Latin America has a negative economic impact and places a significant clinical burden on often fragile health care systems.

Dengue is an acute systemic febrile illness that manifests with abrupt onset as an undifferentiated fever that is difficult to distinguish from other infections without laboratory diagnostic tests. Headache, malaise, myalgia, retro-orbital pain are common symptoms in adults. The clinical features differ by age group, with symptoms such as cough, vomiting and abdominal pain more common in children. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory features.

In most cases, fever and symptoms resolve uneventfully after 3–7 days with no long-term sequelae. In a subset of cases, a transient vascular leakage syndrome develops after 3–4 days of illness, which, when severe, can lead to life-threatening hypovolemic shock (called dengue shock syndrome) and/or hemorrhage. The vascular leak syndrome may be associated with complement activation and a coagulopathy that can contribute to the risk of hemorrhage. Signs of vascular leakage include an increasing hematocrit, microalbuminuria, or the accumulation of fluids at serosal surfaces (eg, pleural effusions).

Supportive care and the careful titration of minimum volumes of parenteral crystalloid fluids to maintain stable cardiac output during the 1–3-day period of vascular permeability are critical elements in dengue case management. Vasopressors are commonly used in cases with prolonged shock. Clinically significant hemorrhage requiring use of blood products is more common in adults than in children.

Improvements in the management of severe dengue cases have seen the case mortality rate decline over the last decade in many but not all endemic settings. At present there is no validated way of identifying which patients will progress to more severe disease, meaning that health facilities in endemic areas are often overwhelmed with patients with dengue who require ongoing observation as outpatients or are admitted for inpatient observation.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^114gYyx3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale.

Among patients with COVID-19 infection, coexisting bacterial, parasitic, or some viral infections may necessitate appropriate antimicrobial treatments for the coinfection. Whether these patients should be screened depends on the prevalence of such coinfections in the local setting.

Recommendations from other guidelines.

WHO COVID-19 guidelines: Depending on local epidemiology and clinical symptoms, test for other potential etiologies (e.g. malaria, dengue fever, and typhoid fever) as appropriate.

Search strategy and MeSH terms.

Searches were performed in PubMed using the following MeSH and free-text terms through August 15, 2020: "COVID-19 AND coinfection", "COVID-19 AND shock", "COVID-19 AND bacterial infection, fungal infection, parasitic infection", and "Shock/septic AND coinfection". Last, references of selected articles were reviewed for relevant publications.

This search yielded 1,206 studies; four were clinical trials and/or randomized clinical trials; 33 were meta-analyses, reviews, and/or systematic reviews; and 317 were from LMICs.

Evidence.

In a recent review of the literature, 8% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were reported to have bacterial or fungal coinfections during hospital admission. However, the prevalence of coinfection among COVID-19 patients among those with shock is not precisely known. In a retrospective study of 393 hospitalized patients in New York City, 32.6% of whom required vasopressor support, bacteremia was reported in 5.6% during the hospital course. In a subgroup of 130 patients who required mechanical ventilation in the same study, nearly all had shock (95.4% needed vasopressor support), and bacteremia was observed in 11.9%. Moreover, there is some evidence to suggest that patients with secondary infection may have a higher mortality, as seen in a Chinese study reporting 50% of non-survivors having had a secondary infection. Importantly, no studies to date have reported on coinfection with parasites, including malaria, or other common causes of febrile illness in LMICs, such as dengue.

### Risk stratification of dengue cases requiring hospitalization [^115XBttW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito‐borne human disease and is caused by the dengue virus (DENV). Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe and sometimes fatal disease. Severe cases often require hospitalization where timely monitoring and intervention can reduce the overall mortality rate to less than 1%. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies symptomatic dengue into three clinical categories: dengue without warning signs (DF; dengue fever), dengue with warning signs (DWS), and severe dengue (SD). Warning signs, such as mucosal bleeding, persistent vomiting, hepatomegaly, low platelet counts, and abruptly elevated liver enzymes, indicate the need to monitor patients closely, while milder cases can be treated at home. Furthermore, cases with warning signs can eventually progress to SD leading to life‐threatening complications, such as hypovolaemic shock, severe bleeding, and multiorgan failure.

The symptoms of dengue are often difficult to differentiate from other viral fevers and concomitant illnesses, even during critical phases of infection. This presents a significant challenge for clinicians attempting to provide an accurate diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, particularly in countries with a high prevalence of dengue. An inaccurate diagnosis may result in unnecessary hospitalization and subsequently an increased burden on the healthcare system. On the other hand, the accurate identification of severe cases is critical to prevent fatalities. Clinical and conventional laboratory markers, including white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet counts (PLT), and liver enzyme levels can help to distinguish severe cases of dengue from DF. However, clinical manifestations may be delayed and can either follow or be triggered by changes in humoral inflammatory profiles. Therefore, inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines may serve as early direct indicators of the systemic inflammatory status and have potential for prognostication of tissue damage before clinical manifestations of disease severity.

### Cepharanthine inhibits dengue virus production and cytokine secretion [^11448oxP]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is a major public health problem worldwide. It is endemic in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world, especially Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Annually, approximately 390 million people are at risk for dengue virus (DENV) infection, including 500,000 dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases and 22,000 deaths, mostly children. The severity of dengue fever ranges from asymptomatic to undifferentiated fever (UF) and dengue fever (DF). Dengue fever can develop into more severe forms of the illness, i.e. DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). An association between disease severity and viremia titer has been reported. Many reports have identified secondary DENV infection as a risk factor for severe dengue disease. Previous studies in Thailand found that DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) caused more severe disease among hospitalized patients. Dengvaxia, a chimeric yellow fever-dengue-tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV), is the first FDA-approved dengue vaccine. However, the efficacy of this vaccine after three injections at 0, 6, and 12 months is only about 56%. There remains no specific treatment for DENV-infected patients; treatments only provide relief of symptoms by close monitoring of vital signs in the critical period between days two and seven of fever, and may include both supportive treatment and broad-spectrum antiviral agents. Thus, the development of anti-DENV agents for the treatment of DENV-infected patients is a high priority.

### Investigation of the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag to correct thrombocytopenia in moderate to severe dengue patients-a phase II randomized controlled clinical trial [^116v4D2D]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The incidence of dengue fever (DF) – one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne infectious diseases, has increased at a rapid rate with an astounding 400% increase over just a span of the last thirteen years. The emergence of DF as one of the fastest spreading infectious diseases worldwide, with substantial morbidity and mortality, has largely been attributed to growing urbanization and climate change. The causative agents of the DF are a group of genetically similar but serotypically distinct dengue viruses (DENV 1–4) which are transmitted primarily by the mosquito – Aedes aegypti. The prevalence of DF is high in the tropical and sub-tropical regions including South-East Asian, Western Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, American and African regions. Dengue fever has three distinct phases –acute or febrile phase, critical phase, and recovery or convalescent-phase. The acute phase is defined by the high viral loads causing a high fever period that typically lasts 3 to 7 days from the onset of infection. The acute phase is followed by a critical phase in which the pathological manifestations are the thrombocytopenia, plasma leakage into the peritoneal/pleural cavities, and bleeding that becomes clinically detectable between days 4 to 6 of illness. The convalescent phase is characterized by the cessations of plasma leakage and reabsorption of leaked fluids. According to the WHO classification, dengue infected patients can be classified into 2 major categories: dengue (symptomatic/asymptomatic) and severe dengue. The patients infected with a distinct DENV serotype who are already primed with a different DENV serotype are most susceptible to develop severe dengue. Severe dengue patients exhibit combined manifestations of plasma leakage, coagulopathy, and platelet (PLT) count < 100 × 10 9 /L, and a marked rise of hematocrit (hct) followed by bleeding that may result in the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Based on the severity, DHF is further classified into four grades: Grade-I (fever with positive tourniquet test), Grade-II (spontaneous bleeding in addition to Grade-I symptoms), Grade-III (presence of weak and rapid pulse), and Grade-IV (profound shock with an undetectable pulse). Diagnosis of dengue virus infection includes the detection of viral genomic RNA, secreted NS1 protein, or the detection of virus-specific host immunoglobulins (IgM/IgG). The current clinical management of symptomatic DF includes but is not limited to intravenous hydration therapy, cautious monitoring of the PLT count, and hematocrit (hct) for the patients suffering from significant vascular leakage.

### Knowledge and perceptions about diagnosis, clinical management, and prevention of dengue fever among physicians during the 2023 outbreak: a cross-sectional study in Peru [^112ZMt42]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge level and perception of dengue fever management among Peruvian physicians and to determine the factors associated with higher knowledge. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study based on an online survey. To evaluate the factors associated with a high level of knowledge (≥ 70% of correct answers), we used crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios by the Poisson regression model. Of 359 respondents (median age: 33 years; male: 56.5%), 78.8% achieved a high level of knowledge. Multivariable analysis showed an independent association with having read the Peruvian clinical practice guidelines for dengue management (aPR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12–1.49), having experience in treating patients (aPR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03–1.68), and having treated cases frequently (aPR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.02–1.46). Residing in the eastern macroregion (aPR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71–0.97) was associated with a low level of knowledge. In conclusion, Peruvian physicians had a high level of knowledge about dengue fever. This was associated with having clinical experience in dengue management. However, given the low level of knowledge in the eastern macroregion, educational campaigns are necessary in this area.

### Challenges and opportunities in controlling mosquito-borne infections [^114YJK1X]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Mosquito-borne diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality across the tropical regions. Despite much progress in the control of malaria, malaria-associated morbidity remains high, whereas arboviruses-most notably dengue-are responsible for a rising burden of disease, even in middle-income countries that have almost completely eliminated malaria. Here I discuss how new interventions offer the promise of considerable future reductions in disease burden. However, I emphasize that intervention programmes need to be underpinned by rigorous trials and quantitative epidemiological analyses. Such analyses suggest that the long-term goal of elimination is more feasible for dengue than for malaria, even if malaria elimination would offer greater overall health benefit to the public.

### Knowledge and perceptions about diagnosis, clinical management, and prevention of dengue fever among physicians during the 2023 outbreak: a cross-sectional study in Peru [^116K2jz6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge level and perception of dengue fever management among Peruvian physicians and to determine the factors associated with higher knowledge. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study based on an online survey. To evaluate the factors associated with a high level of knowledge (≥ 70% of correct answers), we used crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios by the Poisson regression model. Of 359 respondents (median age: 33 years; male: 56.5%), 78.8% achieved a high level of knowledge. Multivariable analysis showed an independent association with having read the Peruvian clinical practice guidelines for dengue management (aPR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12–1.49), having experience in treating patients (aPR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03–1.68), and having treated cases frequently (aPR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.02–1.46). Residing in the eastern macroregion (aPR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71–0.97) was associated with a low level of knowledge. In conclusion, Peruvian physicians had a high level of knowledge about dengue fever. This was associated with having clinical experience in dengue management. However, given the low level of knowledge in the eastern macroregion, educational campaigns are necessary in this area.

### Severe disease during both primary and secondary dengue virus infections in pediatric populations [^115eDB8Q]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Dengue is a global epidemic causing over 100 million cases annually. The clinical symptoms range from mild fever to severe hemorrhage and shock, including some fatalities. The current paradigm is that these severe dengue cases occur mostly during secondary infections due to antibody-dependent enhancement after infection with a different dengue virus serotype. India has the highest dengue burden worldwide, but little is known about disease severity and its association with primary and secondary dengue infections. To address this issue, we examined 619 children with febrile dengue-confirmed infection from three hospitals in different regions of India. We classified primary and secondary infections based on IgM:IgG ratios using a dengue-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the World Health Organization guidelines. We found that primary dengue infections accounted for more than half of total clinical cases (344 of 619), severe dengue cases (112 of 202) and fatalities (5 of 7). Consistent with the classification based on binding antibody data, dengue neutralizing antibody titers were also significantly lower in primary infections compared to secondary infections (P ≤ 0.0001). Our findings question the currently widely held belief that severe dengue is associated predominantly with secondary infections and emphasizes the importance of developing vaccines or treatments to protect dengue-naive populations.

### Knowledge and perceptions about diagnosis, clinical management, and prevention of dengue fever among physicians during the 2023 outbreak: a cross-sectional study in Peru [^1157F7h4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Independent variables.

We evaluated sociodemographic variables such as gender (male, female); age; macro-region of residence (Lima and Callao, Center, North, East, and South); undergraduate university (public, private); years since graduation from medical school; medical position (general practitioner, resident, or specialist); medical specialty; postgraduate degree (doctorate, master's, or none); area of work (urban, rural), health sector (public, private); workplace (health post, health center, polyclinic, public hospital, private clinic, research center, university). Other variables included knowledge of the current outbreak; having read the Peruvian clinical practice guideline for dengue; training on dengue clinical management in the past 3 months; any medical experience treating dengue, treating dengue cases in the past 3 months; frequency of treating dengue cases. We also evaluated variables related to perceptions toward the Peruvian government measures for the outbreak, and perceptions regarding the dengue fever vaccine.

Dependent variable.

To define the variable "level of knowledge about clinical management and prevention about dengue fever", we used 13 items from questions 20 to 32 of the questionnaire, each question had four response alternatives and only one correct answer. If the respondent answered ≥ 70% of the items correctly, they were considered to have a high level of knowledge. The ≥ 70% cutoff was based on previous KAP studies.

RESULTS

Of 384 respondents, 23 did not meet the inclusion criteria, and two submitted incomplete information, resulting in a final sample of 359 (Figure 1). The majority of participants were men (56.5%) between 29 and 49 years of age (49.0%). The majority resided in Lima and Callao (42.9%) and were originally from Peru (98.3%). The majority completed undergraduate studies in Peru (96.4%), at a public university (66.0%), and graduated between 0 and 9 years earlier (67.1%). The majority were general practitioners (71.6%) who worked in the public sector (62.4%) and in urban areas (76.6%). A total of 99.7% were aware of the increase in dengue cases, 65.5% had read the current Peruvian technical guidelines, 52.9% had not received training on dengue management in the past 3 months, 77.7% had seen at least a patient with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of dengue during their entire career, but only 62.4% had seen at least one patient in the past 3 months (Table 1).

General characteristics of the population

Regarding knowledge, 78.8% obtained more than 70% correct answers. Almost all participants knew about Aedes aegypti as a transmitter (99.7%), incubation period (81.6%), stages of the disease (87.7%), recognized a probable case of dengue (98.6%), knew about paracetamol for symptomatic treatment (97.5%), and knew that there was currently no vaccine against dengue in Peru (93.9%). Also, only 59.6% of the participants were aware of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine (Table 2).

Percentage of correct answers for each question of the questionnaire

Regarding perception, 50% considered that MINSA was not adequately training physicians during the current outbreak (47.9%), that it was not adequately applying vector prevention and control measures (50.7%), and that it did not have the necessary resources (63.2%). Likewise, most of the participants believed that MINSA should have implemented vaccination against dengue (71.3%) (Figure 2).

### Safety of low-dose ibuprofen in non-severe dengue patients for managing fever is consistent with acetaminophen: a retrospective observational study [^114NwfZ5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dengue fever is an acute infectious disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV). Data on the safety of ibuprofen in patients with dengue fever remains scarce. This study included hospitalized patients with dengue fever who were treated with ibuprofen and/or acetaminophen for fever management. At admission, none of the patients were diagnosed with severe dengue. The patients were divided into three groups: ibuprofen-exposed group (those receiving ibuprofen alone or in combination with acetaminophen), ibuprofen group (patients who received ibuprofen alone), and acetaminophen group (patients who received acetaminophen alone for fever management). Key safety parameters were compared across groups. A total of 262 patients participated. The cumulative dose of ibuprofen administered during hospitalization was 0.6 (0.4–0.8) g. No significant differences were found between ibuprofen-exposed/ibuprofen groups and acetaminophen group in terms of platelet reduction, bleeding events, severe thrombocytopenia, or the incidence of severe dengue (all p > 0.05). Ibuprofen group had a significantly shorter fever duration (p = 0.046), while acetaminophen group showed a significantly greater elevation in alanine aminotransferase levels (p = 0.029). All patients were followed up post-discharge, and none experienced gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months. This study suggests that safety of low-dose ibuprofen is consistent with acetaminophen for fever management in non-severe dengue patients.

### Advances in the understanding, management, and prevention of dengue [^115qh7nU]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Dengue causes more human morbidity globally than any other vector-borne viral disease. Recent research has led to improved epidemiological methods that predict disease burden and factors involved in transmission, a better understanding of immune responses in infection, and enhanced animal models. In addition, a number of control measures, including preventative vaccines, are in clinical trials. However, significant gaps remain, including the need for better surveillance in large parts of the world, methods to predict which individuals will develop severe disease, and immunologic correlates of protection against dengue illness. During the next decade, dengue will likely expand its geographic reach and become an increasing burden on health resources in affected areas. Licensed vaccines and antiviral agents are needed in order to effectively control dengue and limit disease.

### Risk predictors of progression to severe disease during the febrile phase of dengue: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116KTFeY]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Background

The ability to accurately predict early progression of dengue to severe disease is crucial for patient triage and clinical management. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found significant heterogeneity in predictors of severe disease due to large variation in these factors during the time course of the illness. We aimed to identify factors associated with progression to severe dengue disease that are detectable specifically in the febrile phase.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify predictors identifiable during the febrile phase associated with progression to severe disease defined according to WHO criteria. Eight medical databases were searched for studies published from Jan 1, 1997, to Jan 31, 2020. Original clinical studies in English assessing the association of factors detected during the febrile phase with progression to severe dengue were selected and assessed by three reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Meta-analyses were done using random-effects models to estimate pooled effect sizes. Only predictors reported in at least four studies were included in the meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q and I 2 statistics, and publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. We did subgroup analyses of studies with children and adults. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018093363.

Findings

Of 6643 studies identified, 150 articles were included in the systematic review, and 122 articles comprising 25 potential predictors were included in the meta-analyses. Female patients had a higher risk of severe dengue than male patients in the main analysis (2674 [16·2%] of 16481 vs 3052 [10·5%] of 29142; odds ratio [OR] 1·13 [95% CI 1·01–1·26) but not in the subgroup analysis of studies with children. Pre-existing comorbidities associated with severe disease were diabetes (135 [31·3%] of 431 with vs 868 [16·0%] of 5421 without; crude OR 4·38 [2·58–7·43]), hypertension (240 [35·0%] of 685 vs 763 [20·6%] of 3695; 2·19 [1·36–3·53]), renal disease (44 [45·8%] of 96 vs 271 [16·0%] of 1690; 4·67 [2·21–9·88]), and cardiovascular disease (nine [23·1%] of 39 vs 155 [8·6%] of 1793; 2·79 [1·04–7·50]). Clinical features during the febrile phase associated with progression to severe disease were vomiting (329 [13·5%] of 2432 with vs 258 [6·8%] of 3797 without; 2·25 [1·87–2·71]), abdominal pain and tenderness (321 [17·7%] of 1814 vs 435 [8·1%] of 5357; 1·92 [1·35–2·74]), spontaneous or mucosal bleeding (147 [17·9%] of 822 vs 676 [10·8%] of 6235; 1·57 [1·13–2·19]), and the presence of clinical fluid accumulation (40 [42·1%] of 95 vs 212 [14·9%] of 1425; 4·61 [2·29–9·26]). During the first 4 days of illness, platelet count was lower (standardised mean difference -0·34 [95% CI -0·54 to -0·15]), serum albumin was lower (-0·5 [-0·86 to -0·15]), and aminotransferase concentrations were higher (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 1·06 [0·54 to 1·57] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 0·73 [0·36 to 1·09]) among individuals who progressed to severe disease. Dengue virus serotype 2 was associated with severe disease in children. Secondary infections (vs primary infections) were also associated with severe disease (1682 [11·8%] of 14252 with vs 507 [5·2%] of 9660 without; OR 2·26 [95% CI 1·65–3·09]). Although the included studies had a moderate to high risk of bias in terms of study confounding, the risk of bias was low to moderate in other domains. Heterogeneity of the pooled results varied from low to high on different factors.

Interpretation

This analysis supports monitoring of the warning signs described in the 2009 WHO guidelines on dengue. In addition, testing for infecting serotype and monitoring platelet count and serum albumin, AST, and ALT concentrations during the febrile phase of illness could improve the early prediction of severe dengue.

### Dengue fever and dengue virus in the people's republic of China [^115YxRcq]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Infection with dengue virus (DENV) leads to symptoms variable from dengue fever to severe dengue, which has posed a huge socioeconomic and disease burden to the world population, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. To date, four serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to DENV-4) have been identified to sustain the transmission cycle in humans. In the past decades, dengue incidences have become more frequent, and four serotypes and various genotypes have been identified in PR China. Several large-scale dengue outbreaks and frequent local endemics occurred in the southern and coastal provinces, and the imported dengue cases accounted primarily for the initiation of the epidemics. No antiviral drug exists for dengue, and no vaccine has been approved to use in PR China, however strategies including public awareness, national reporting system of infectious diseases and public health emergencies, vector mosquito control, personal protection, and improved environmental sanitation have greatly reduced dengue prevalence. Some new technologies in vector mosquito control are emerging and being applied for dengue control. China's territory spans tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates, hence understanding the dengue status in China will be of beneficial for the global prevention and control of dengue. Here, we review the dengue status in PR China for the past decades and the strategies emerging for dengue control.

### Fever in the returning traveler [^114LRBfR]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Millions of children travel annually, whether they are refugees, international adoptees, visitors, or vacationers. Although most young travelers do well, many develop a febrile illness during or shortly after their trips. Approaching a fever in the returning traveler requires an appropriate index of suspicion to diagnose and treat in a timely manner. As many as 34% of patients with recent travel history are diagnosed with routine infections, but serious infections such as malaria, enteric fever, and dengue fever should be on the differential diagnosis due the high morbidity and mortality in children.

### Conservative treatment of spontaneous intraperitoneal hemorrhage in severe dengue: a case report and review [^113wkFNs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Dengue fever is a common arboviral illness that can result in severe hemorrhagic complications, although spontaneous intraperitoneal bleeding remains rare. We report the case of a 26-year-old previously healthy female who presented with a 4-day history of high-grade fever and myalgia that was later diagnosed as dengue fever. During hospitalization, she developed vaginal bleeding followed by generalized abdominal pain and shock. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed significant hemoperitoneum, despite a normal coagulation profile and no identifiable bleeding source. She was managed conservatively with supportive care and made a full recovery. A 1-year follow-up was unremarkable. This case underscores the importance of early recognition, prompt imaging, and consideration of differential diagnoses. In the absence of established guidelines for managing spontaneous intraperitoneal hemorrhage in dengue, individualized conservative treatment may be effective. Clinicians should remain vigilant for atypical presentations to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate management.

### The value of warning signs from the WHO 2009 dengue classification in detecting severe dengue in children [^116CN1TK]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Dengue virus infection has a wide spectrum, with manifestations ranging from very mild to severe, sometimes lethal forms. Severe dengue can lead to intravascular leakage and, without adequate supportive therapy, multiple organ failure and even death. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about 3.9 billion people living in 128 countries are at risk of contracting dengue. Annually, an estimated 50–100 million cases of dengue infection occur worldwide, and the number of deaths increased from 16,957 in 1990 to 40,467 in 2017. This makes dengue an important public health problem globally. According to the 1997 WHO Dengue Classification (WHO-1997), symptomatic dengue virus infections are grouped into 3 categories: undifferentiated fever, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The DHF cases are further classified into 4 severity grades, with grades III and IV being defined as dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Changes in the epidemiology of dengue led to criticism on the usefulness and applicability of this classification in clinical care and in 2009 the WHO issued a new guideline that classifies clinical dengue as: (1) dengue without warning signs, (2) dengue with warning signs and (3) severe dengue (WHO-2009).

### Transition in the cause of fever from malaria to dengue, northwestern Ecuador, 1990–2011 [^113wYV3X]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study provides evidence of a transition of febrile disease etiology from Plasmodium spp. traditionally highly prevalent in this area, to reemerging pathogens, such as DENV. Other possible fever-causing agents for which we did not test include Leptospira spp. Rickettsia spp. Brucella spp. and viral agents of encephalitis. Given that malaria has historically been the predominant cause of fever in the developing world, febrile patients are often triaged toward malaria treatment, especially in resource-poor areas. Moreover, the awareness of malaria is embedded culturally and behaviorally in these communities: having a fever is equated with having malaria. Of the 40 febrile patients who sought treatment for malaria, none had malaria but 17% had dengue (positive for DENV by PCR). Further research is needed to refine this estimate and explore how the Ministry of Health and the general population should be directed to manage cases of fever during this etiologic transition. The need to bring attention to this transition is exemplified by our finding of DENV-3 in our study site; this serotype has not been isolated in other parts of Ecuador since 2009. Esmeraldas, therefore, may be a major source of newly introduced dengue serotypes into Ecuador.

### Is new dengue vaccine efficacy data a relief or cause for concern? [^111n9dLy]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

The primary study endpoint for the phase III trial was efficacy against any dengue, of any severity, caused by any DENV type in either dengue immune or non-immune recipients. Within 12 months of the second dose vaccine efficacy was 80.2%. At the 18-month timepoint, vaccine efficacy against all dengue in dengue immune recipients was 76.1% and 66.2% in dengue non-immune recipients. Efficacy against hospitalized dengue was 90.4% and 85.9% against dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (WHO, 1997 criteria). DENV type-specific efficacy was 69.8% for DENV-1, 95.1% for DENV-2, and 48.9% for DENV-3 with variable confidence intervals. At 54 months, overall vaccine efficacy had waned to 61.2% with efficacy of 64.2% in dengue immune recipients and 53.5% in dengue non-immunes. Efficacy against hospitalized dengue was 84.1%. DENV type specific efficacy in dengue non-immunes was 78.4% for DENV-1, 100% for DENV-2, there was no efficacy for DENV-3, and not enough DENV-4 cases to calculate a value. DENV-3 efficacy in dengue immunes was 74%. Efficacy against DHF caused by any DENV type was 70.0% and against severe dengue (determined by an adjudication committee) was 70.2%. These data have not been presented in the peer-reviewed scientific literature but are accessible from the sponsor's Summary of Product Characteristics (accessed 21 January 2023).

### Dengue prevention and 35 years of vector control in Singapore [^1166u9xd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are reemerging diseases that are endemic in the tropical world. Disease is caused by 4 closely related dengue viruses that belong to the genus Flavivirus and are transmitted principally by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Other mosquito species, such as A. albopictus and A. polynesiensis, can transmit epidemic dengue but do so less efficiently. The virus has 4 antigenically similar but immunologically distinct serotypes. Infection confers lifelong immunity to the infecting serotype but not to the remaining 3; therefore, a person can be infected with dengue virus up to 4 times during his or her lifetime. Furthermore, epidemiologic observations suggest that previous infection increases risk for DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in subsequent infections. These conditions are characterized by plasma leakage as a result of alteration in microvascular permeability. While DF may cause substantial morbidity, the death ratio of DHF and DSS can be as high as 30% if the disease is not properly managed. As yet, no specific treatment for DF or DHF is available, although efforts to develop an antidengue drug are in progress.

While vaccines for other flaviviruses such as yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis have been developed, dengue vaccine development is complicated by the need to incorporate all 4 virus serotypes into a single preparation. An approved vaccine is not likely to be available for 5 to 7 years; the only way to prevent dengue transmission, therefore, is to reduce the population of its principal vector, A. aegypti.

Dengue has been successfully prevented through vector control in 3 instances. The first of these was the highly successful, vertically structured paramilitary hemispheric eradication campaign directed by the Pan American Sanitary Board from 1946 to 1970. The second was also a rigorous, top-down, military-like vector control operation in Cuba that was based on intensive insecticidal treatment followed by reduction of available larval habitats (source reduction) in 1981. Neither of these programs, however, was sustainable. The third successful program was in Singapore.

### Remote-controlled and pulse pressure-guided fluid treatment for adult patients with viral hemorrhagic fevers [^113B8vC2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Shock is thought to be a common final pathophysiological pathway to death in Ebola virus disease (EVD) and other high-threat viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) such as Marburg hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. Although there are limited data on the frequency, timing, and nature of shock, intravascular hypovolemia resulting from gastrointestinal losses and capillary leak are thought to be the important drivers of shock. Intravascular fluid resuscitation presents a clinical management challenge in VHFs due to the need to restore adequate intravascular volume while avoiding excessive organ edema, in particular pulmonary edema resulting in respiratory failure. This challenge is greatest in resource-limited settings where most of these infections are managed. In these settings limited staff, protective clothing, and appropriate intensive care facilities and equipment render the clinical monitoring and support of patients difficult.

The optimal fluid resuscitation strategy for EVD and other VHFs is currently unknown. However, the well-studied fluid management of shock in severe dengue may be used as a guide. Severe dengue is associated with a marked increase in capillary permeability, hemoconcentration, and bleeding. A resulting key clinical feature is a reduction in pulse pressure. Fluid resuscitation in severe dengue needs to balance the risk of volume overload with the risk of undertreating intravascular hypovolemia and shock. For this reason, fluid resuscitation strategies in severe dengue are more conservative than in sepsis and septic shock. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) mortality is less than 1% when fluid management strategies are restricted, but higher with more liberal fluid regimens. The limited data on hypovolemia and hemoconcentration in EVD are reminiscent of severe dengue, although there are several important differences between the two diseases. Dehydration from diarrhea and vomiting, electrolyte disturbances, and acute kidney injury are much more prominent in EVD patients, requiring, if available, plasma electrolyte assessments and correction. However, capillary leakage, the pivotal pathophysiological feature of severe dengue, is also a major feature of EVD and other VHFs.

### Dengue vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2021 [^111Tkiis]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Local jurisdictions should prepare materials before dengue epidemics to clearly communicate to parents and the public the low risk for inadvertently vaccinating seronegative children with use of highly accurate tests. Because Dengvaxia vaccine efficacy is approximately 80%, messaging should communicate that although Dengvaxia reduces overall hospitalizations and severe dengue in vaccine recipients, breakthrough DENV infections and hospitalizations will occur in approximately 20% of vaccinated children. Therefore, all patients with symptoms consistent with dengue should be evaluated and treated according to established guidelines, regardless of vaccination status.

### Ongoing dengue epidemic-Angola, June 2013 [^115Wax3A]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Dengue is believed to be endemic in much of Africa, where an estimated 64 million dengue virus (DENV) infections occurred in 2010. Dengue has been documented previously in travelers returning from Angola, but information on the epidemiology of dengue in Angola has not been available.

What is added by this report?

This report documents an ongoing dengue epidemic in Angola that at present appears to be primarily affecting Luanda. Only DENV-1 has thus far been detected, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most closely related virus was isolated in Nigeria in 1968, demonstrating that this virus has been circulating in the region for at least 45 years and strongly suggesting that dengue is endemic in Angola.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Physicians and public health professionals should be aware that dengue is endemic in Angola and throughout much of Africa and that timely initiation of care of dengue patients can be life-saving. Clinicians in Africa and those examining patients with acute febrile illness and recent travel to Africa should suspect dengue and report cases to public health authorities.

The molecular phylogeny of the DENV-1 currently circulating in Luanda indicates that the virus likely has been circulating in the region since at least 1968. This finding, in combination with reports of dengue in travelers to Angola since the 1980s, strongly suggests that dengue is endemic in Angola, as it is in much of the rest of Africa. In support of these observations, a recent study predicted that approximately 16% of all DENV infections worldwide occur in sub-Saharan Africa. This suggests that dengue in Africa is on par with that of the Americas, where the widespread nature of the illness is recognized. Public health and health-care professionals should be aware that dengue is endemic in Africa and should test suspected cases with available diagnostic tests, including RDTs, and ensure that test results are confirmed at reference laboratories experienced in dengue diagnostic testing. Diagnostic and confirmatory testing should be performed to confirm cases and initiate appropriate clinical treatment, enable early detection of outbreaks or epidemics, and identify the DENV-types circulating in the region.

### Successes and failures in the control of infectious diseases in Brazil: social and environmental context, policies, interventions, and research needs [^113Mz4bn]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Despite pronounced reductions in the number of deaths due to infectious diseases over the past six decades, infectious diseases are still a public health problem in Brazil. In this report, we discuss the major successes and failures in the control of infectious diseases in Brazil, and identify research needs and policies to further improve control or interrupt transmission. Control of diseases such as cholera, Chagas disease, and those preventable by vaccination has been successful through efficient public policies and concerted efforts from different levels of government and civil society. For these diseases, policies dealt with key determinants (eg, the quality of water and basic sanitation, vector control), provided access to preventive resources (such as vaccines), and successfully integrated health policies with broader social policies. Diseases for which control has failed (such as dengue fever and visceral leishmaniasis) are vector-borne diseases with changing epidemiological profiles and major difficulties in treatment (in the case of dengue fever, no treatment is available). Diseases for which control has been partly successful have complex transmission patterns related to adverse environmental, social, economic, or unknown determinants; are sometimes transmitted by insect vectors that are difficult to control; and are mostly chronic diseases with long infectious periods that require lengthy periods of treatment.

### Integrating sepsis management recommendations into clinical care guidelines for district hospitals in resource-limited settings: the necessity to augment new guidelines with future research [^111gJvae]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The guidelines take into consideration potential resource constraints, acknowledging that much of the world does not have access to advanced diagnostics or resuscitative techniques. They provide instruction on sepsis management in resource-limited environments throughout a patient's hospitalization course with emphasis on the first 2 hours (Figure 1 a), 2 to 6 hours (Figure 1 b), 6 to 24 hours (Figure 1 c) and post-resuscitation periods (Figure 1 d). The guidelines call for the early recognition of two of the most important indicators of organ dysfunction in sepsis: hypotension and acute respiratory distress. Key management principles reiterated through the guidelines include early recognition, treating infection early and broadly while establishing source control and fixing physiologic aberrations by optimizing tissue perfusion with judicious fluids and oxygen. In addition, the guidelines emphasize regular and frequent monitoring of the patient's response to treatment and a plan for appropriate action based on changes in clinical status. In light of the risk of volume overloading patients with possible acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, the guidelines specify more conservative fluids for such patients (1 ml/kg/hour intravenously or orally) and other appropriate modifications in the resuscitation strategy. Further guidance on the management of conditions which may deviate from these guidelines is provided in the DCM, including a more conservative fluid management strategy for dengue; careful attention to possible development of fluid overload/pulmonary edema in severe malaria; specific antimicrobial recommendations for malaria, tuberculosis, maternal sepsis-related conditions (for example, amnionitis, post-partum sepsis and septic abortion) and certain viral hemorrhagic fevers (such as Lassa fever).

### Dengue encephalitis: what's new? [^116JEQnv]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DENGUE ACUTE NECROTIZING ENCEPHALOPATHY

Dengue acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare but severe neurological complication of dengue infection, characterized by rapid-onset encephalopathy, seizures, and multifocal brain lesions. Radiology reveals symmetric lesions in the thalamus, brainstem, and cerebral white matter. This clinical picture is seen with other flaviviral illness as well. The pathogenesis is thought to involve a 'cytokine storm' triggered by dengue virus infection, leading to BBB disruption, endothelial damage, and subsequent haemorrhagic necrosis.

Diagnosis requires neuroimaging (MRI showing characteristic symmetric thalamic lesions with haemorrhage), CSF analysis with a lymphocytic pleocytosis suggestive of a viral meningoencephalitis and a positive dengue serology. Treatment remains supportive, including intensive care management, seizure control, and measures to reduce intracranial pressure. Despite limited evidence, immunomodulatory therapies (steroids, IVIG) have been attempted. Prognosis is often poor, with high mortality or severe neurological sequelae in survivors. Early recognition and aggressive, supportive care are crucial. Further research is needed to understand the exact mechanisms and develop targeted therapies for this devastating complication of dengue infection.

Background

Dengue virus (DENV) transmission is endemic in more than 120 countries with an estimated 100 million clinically apparent infections occurring annually, making it the world's most important arthropod-borne viral disease. The spectrum of clinical phenotypes following infection may include a nonspecific viral syndrome, classic dengue fever, severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF], or dengue shock syndrome [DSS]). Severe dengue is characterized by plasma leakage, intravascular volume depletion, hemorrhagic manifestations, end-organ dysfunction, and the potential for significant morbidity and/or death. The clinical and immunopathologic mechanisms responsible for mild, uncomplicated, and severe dengue are incompletely understood. It is theorized complex interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses following infection result in a high DENV burden and a predominantly pro-inflammatory response impairing vascular integrity and coagulation mechanisms. The risk of severe dengue is significantly increased when experiencing a second dengue infection with a DENV type different from the one that caused the first infection. Currently, no vaccine or specific antiviral therapeutic is available to U.S. military members to prevent or treat dengue.

### Comparing the usefulness of the 1997 and 2009 WHO dengue case classification: a systematic literature review [^11135QrS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

The dengue case definition is important for diagnosing a dengue case, especially when diagnosing without laboratory confirmation in resource-poor settings. The D/SD framework uses the same criteria for case definitions as defined by the DF/DHF/DSS framework (which is based on expert opinion), with some modifications also driven by expert opinion. However, it is well-known that using only clinical criteria for discriminating between different febrile illnesses is difficult or impossible. Similar to the WS, this question can only be addressed with large prospective global studies, which are under way (IDAMS study above).

This finding leads to the question of whether a clinically based dengue diagnosis and the application of WS can be useful for triage. Some studies, based on qualitative argumentsand expressing the viewpoints of clinicians, come to a positive answer; others refer to the fact that the ease of application is also documented in studies. One retrospective study argues that the caseload for hospitalization increases dramatically. However, the same study acknowledges that only 68% of cases with SD disease can be classified with the DF/DHF/DSS framework. In other words, 32% of cases are not classifiable and maybe missed, reflecting the low sensitivity of DHF. This result has been summarized in the study in ref. which acknowledges that the workload may potentially increase with the broad use of WS but that cases with severe disease are correctly identified. It seems that the application of the WS in the algorithm needs adjustment to the locally available resources, which was mentioned in the WHO guidelines: "depending on the clinical manifestations and other circumstances, patients may… be referred for in-hospital management (Group B)". Whether increased admissions with early treatment may reduce severe/fatal illnesses needs to be analyzed as well.

INTRODUCTION

Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Dengue is present in at least 129 countries worldwide, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas in tropical and subtropical climates. Its worldwide incidence has grown dramatically in recent decades, with about 390 million children and adults infected annually WHO. Of those infected, a quarter develop clinical manifestations with a spectrum of symptoms of varying severity. Every year, around 500,000 people with severe dengue (SD) require hospitalization, and an estimated 2.5% of these die.

Multiple dengue infections are possible owing to the four existing serotypes: dengue virus (DENV)-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. All could produce overt illness, with fever, headache, eye pain, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and rash lasting days to weeks. Symptomatic infected persons often seek care from healthcare personnel who monitor the evolution and development of complications or organ dysfunction. In some cases, supportive hospital care is needed. Early detection of disease progression and access to appropriate medical care can reduce mortality rates of SD to less than 1%.

Key points
- There is no specific medicine to treat dengue.
- See a healthcare provider if you develop a fever or have symptoms of dengue.
- For mild symptoms, care for a sick person at home.
- Watch out for warning signs of severe dengue as fever goes away. If you think you have dengue See a healthcare provider if you develop a fever or have symptoms of dengue. Tell him or her about any recent travel. Restas much as possible. Take acetaminophen to control fever and relieve pain.
- Do not take aspirin or ibuprofen.
- Do not take aspirin or ibuprofen. Drink plenty of fluidsto stay hydrated. Drink water or drinks with added electrolytes.
- For mild symptoms, care for a sick infant, child, or family member at home. Watch out for warning signs of severe dengue Warning signs usually begin in the 24–48 hours after your fever has gone away.

Immediately go to a local clinic or emergency room if you or a family member has any of the following signs and symptoms:

- Belly pain, tenderness
- Vomiting
- Bleeding from the nose or gums
- Vomiting blood, or blood in the stool
- Feeling tired, restless, or irritable When immediate care is needed Symptoms of dengue can become severe within a few hours. Severe dengue is a medical emergency.

### Clinical care of dengue… [^113uunyk]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- No specific medicines are available for dengue.
- Patients presenting with warning signs or severe dengue should be managed in a hospital.
- Patients managed as outpatients should be advised regarding when to return to the hospital.
- Pregnant patients have special considerations. Treatment recommendations No treatment: no specific antiviral agents exist for dengue. Supportive care is advised: patients should be advised to stay well hydrated and to avoid aspirin, aspirin-containing drugs, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs because of their anticoagulant properties.
- Fever should be controlled with acetaminophen and tepid sponge baths.
- Febrile patients should avoid mosquito bites to reduce risk of further transmission. Severe dengue
- For patients who develop severe dengue, close observation and frequent monitoring in an intensive care unit may be required.
- Prophylactic platelet transfusions in dengue patients are not beneficial and may contribute to fluid overload.
- Administration of corticosteroids has no demonstrated benefit and is potentially harmful to patients; corticosteroids should not be used except in the case of autoimmune-related complication. Dengue During Pregnancy
- The potential for vertical transmission should be considered for pregnant patients with dengue who are symptomatic late in pregnancy or at delivery.
- Newborns usually develop symptoms within 14 days of birth, but most babies are asymptomatic.
- Clinical presentation in babies varies from mild common symptoms of dengue to severe dengue with shock and hemorrhagic manifestations.
