## Question

elevated potassium of 5.5

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a potassium of 5.5 mmol/L, including classification, risk, ECG assessment, medication review, monitoring, and when to escalate therapy or involve specialists. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify 5.5 mmol/L by severity and what that implies for urgency. Then, I should verify the patient's risk profile and whether this level carries increased mortality. Next, I will check for ECG changes and symptoms to decide if emergency measures are needed. After that, I need to review medications, especially RAAS inhibitors, and outline a stepwise management plan. Finally, I should confirm monitoring intervals, thresholds for escalation, and when to refer to nephrology or cardiology, ensuring I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the classification. A potassium of 5.5 mmol/L sits at the lower bound of mild hyperkalemia in several schemes, including UK Renal Association definitions of mild as 5.5–5.9 mmol/L, whereas ESC uses > 5.0 mmol/L as mild and > 5.5 mmol/L as moderate; KDIGO incorporates both concentration and ECG changes, so 5.5 mmol/L without ECG changes is generally mild to moderate depending on the framework, but importantly it is above the normal adult range of 3.5–5.0 mmol/L and warrants action rather than observation alone [^113YXfBL] [^1172XMC2] [^114ypRXH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk just because the number looks "only" 5.5 mmol/L. I should verify the patient's comorbidities and medications because risk escalates with CKD, heart failure, diabetes, and RAAS blockade; in fact, even mild elevations are associated with higher mortality in AMI cohorts, with a U-shaped curve showing increased mortality beginning around 4.5–5.0 mmol/L and rising further at ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, so 5.5 mmol/L is not benign in the right context [^112a5MdK] [^1169uo2j].

> Next, I should review the ECG and symptoms. Wait, let me verify the ECG sensitivity threshold; severe ECG changes like peaked T waves and QRS widening typically emerge at higher levels, often above 7.0 mmol/L, but subtle changes can occur earlier and cannot be relied upon to exclude risk, so a 12-lead ECG is mandatory now and should be repeated if the patient is unstable or the potassium rises; continuous cardiac monitoring is indicated if potassium is ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or if there are any ECG abnormalities, which is not the case at 5.5 mmol/L absent symptoms, but I should still obtain and document a baseline ECG [^1124Vteu] [^116wEk37].

> I will now examine medications and reversible contributors. I need to check for RAAS inhibitors, potassium supplements, NSAIDs, trimethoprim, and other potassium-raising drugs; in CKD or HF, RAAS inhibitors are often indicated and should not be stopped reflexively at 5.5 mmol/L, but I should confirm baseline potassium before initiation and use caution if potassium is > 5.0 mmol/L, with consideration of dose reduction only if potassium remains ≥ 6.0 mmol/L or if mitigation fails; finerenone labeling advises not initiating if potassium > 5.0 mmol/L and to hold if > 5.5 mmol/L, which I should reconcile with guideline strategies that prioritize maintaining RAAS blockade using binders and diet when feasible [^114WwTAf] [^114s2qxh] [^116AU5Ci].

> Let me think about immediate management at 5.5 mmol/L. I should confirm that no membrane-stabilizing calcium or intracellular shifting therapies are indicated here because there are no ECG changes and no severe features; instead, the focus is on removing exogenous sources, optimizing volume and acid-base status, and arranging close follow-up labs, with dietary potassium counseling and consideration of a loop or thiazide diuretic if euvolemic or hypervolemic; if the patient is on RAAS therapy and potassium remains 5.5–5.9 mmol/L, I should increase monitoring frequency and consider a binder before reducing RAAS dose, aligning with a stepwise approach to preserve cardiorenal benefit [^116pRo5x] [^111GoG94] [^1176vexx] [^116AU5Ci].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an MRA or finerenone and potassium is 5.5 mmol/L. I should double-check the label and trial protocols; finerenone trials held the drug at > 5.5 mmol/L and recommended restarting at ≤ 5.0 mmol/L after correction, and heart failure guidelines advise discontinuing MRAs if potassium cannot be maintained < 5.5 mEq/L, so a temporary hold with binder and diet optimization is reasonable, with the goal of re-challenging RAAS therapy once potassium is controlled to protect cardiovascular and renal outcomes [^114s2qxh] [^111RKLXp] [^116HAUpi].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence. For an unexpected outpatient potassium of 5.5 mmol/L, I need to ensure a repeat potassium within 3 days, sooner if symptomatic or if medications were changed; if potassium reaches 6.0–6.4 mmol/L, repeat within 1 day; if ≥ 6.5 mmol/L, urgent hospital assessment is indicated; in patients on RAAS inhibitors, check potassium and renal function about 1 week and 4 weeks after initiation or dose change, then periodically, with tighter intervals if potassium is elevated or eGFR declines [^111t4bJ8] [^112gR5dH] [^111pfUau] [^116HAUpi].

> I should confirm thresholds for escalation. Severe hyperkalemia, typically ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or any potassium with ECG changes, mandates urgent treatment with membrane stabilization, insulin with dextrose, beta-agonists, and consideration of dialysis; at 5.5 mmol/L, escalation is not automatic, but if potassium rises, if the patient becomes unwell, or if ECG evolves, I need to pivot promptly to emergency protocols and continuous monitoring [^112KvyxG] [^115bePMV] [^1124Vteu].

> Let me consider special populations. In heart failure, maintaining RAAS blockade reduces mortality, so I should prioritize potassium binders and diet over RAAS withdrawal whenever possible; in CKD, correcting metabolic acidosis and using binders can mitigate hyperkalemia; in hemodialysis, pre-dialysis targets around 4.0–6.0 mmol/L are acceptable, but recurrent predialysis potassium > 5.5 mmol/L warrants dialysate adjustment, dietary review, and binder use, recognizing peridialytic arrhythmia risk [^111VP5QC] [^111EprnF] [^111cZZL1].

> Hold on, I should verify binder selection and initiation setting. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are appropriate for persistent hyperkalemia, with patiromer often started in secondary care for CKD or HF patients on suboptimal RAAS therapy; SZC has evidence for acute lowering within hours in some studies, though real-world ED data show mixed results versus standard care, so expectations should be calibrated and use individualized based on severity and access [^111k6kg1] [^116L8Ux5] [^112HpmPz] [^112EjyE5].

> I need to ensure the long-term plan addresses root causes. That means reinforcing low-potassium dietary patterns with dietitian input, optimizing volume status and acid-base balance, reviewing and deprescribing nonessential potassium-raising drugs when possible, and scheduling follow-up to reassess potassium, renal function, and the feasibility of reinstating or up-titrating RAAS therapy to maximize cardiorenal benefit while maintaining safety [^111GoG94] [^116pRo5x] [^115MCQ91].

> In summary, potassium 5.5 mmol/L is actionable: confirm with a repeat test, obtain an ECG, review medications with a bias toward preserving RAAS therapy, implement diet and diuretic strategies as appropriate, and arrange close follow-up; escalate urgently if potassium rises to ≥ 6.5 mmol/L, if ECG changes appear, or if the patient deteriorates, and involve nephrology or cardiology early when RAAS optimization is limited by recurrent hyperkalemia despite binders and diet [^113YXfBL] [^1124Vteu] [^116AU5Ci].

A potassium level of 5.5 mmol/L is **mild hyperkalemia** [^1172XMC2] and is not an emergency on its own, but it warrants prompt evaluation and monitoring [^111t4bJ8] because it can progress to dangerous arrhythmias, especially in patients with CKD, heart failure, or on RAAS inhibitors [^114N7A4i]. Immediate steps include confirming the result, checking for hemolysis, obtaining an ECG, and reviewing medications and renal function [^116PPkHq]. Management focuses on removing potassium sources, using diuretics if appropriate, and considering potassium binders if potassium remains elevated or if the patient is on RAAS inhibitors [^116pRo5x] [^111k6kg1]. Urgent treatment is indicated if there are ECG changes, symptoms, or if potassium rises to ≥ 6.0 mmol/L [^115h7Ejq] [^115Lhcuz].

## Clinical significance of potassium 5.5 mmol/L

Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum potassium concentration **> 5.0 mmol/L** [^1169uo2j]; 5.5 mmol/L represents mild hyperkalemia [^111t4bJ8]. Although not immediately life-threatening, it can cause **cardiac arrhythmias**, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac or renal disease [^112a5MdK].

---

## Risk factors and causes

Several factors can contribute to a potassium level of 5.5 mmol/L, including:

- **Impaired renal function**: Reduced potassium excretion is a common cause of hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq].
- **Medications**: RAAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists), potassium-sparing diuretics, and NSAIDs can increase potassium levels [^115MCQ91].
- **Tissue breakdown**: Rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis can release potassium into the bloodstream [^notfound].
- **Acidosis**: Metabolic acidosis can shift potassium extracellularly, increasing serum levels [^notfound].

---

## Clinical symptoms and signs

Patients with mild hyperkalemia (5.5 mmol/L) are often asymptomatic, but some may experience:

- **Muscle weakness or fatigue**: Due to impaired neuromuscular function [^115h7Ejq].
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Palpitations or irregular heartbeats may occur [^1172XMC2].
- **Nausea or abdominal discomfort**: Less common but possible [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When hyperkalemia is detected, the following diagnostic steps are recommended:

- **Confirm the result**: Repeat the serum potassium test to rule out laboratory error or hemolysis [^notfound].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Assess for cardiac conduction abnormalities, even though ECG changes may not correlate strictly with serum potassium levels [^115h7Ejq].
- **Renal function tests**: Evaluate serum creatinine and eGFR to assess renal function [^notfound].
- **Medication review**: Identify and discontinue potential causative medications if possible [^116pRo5x].

---

## Management strategies

Management of mild hyperkalemia (5.5 mmol/L) includes:

- **Dietary modifications**: Reduce potassium intake by avoiding high-potassium foods (e.g. bananas, oranges, tomatoes, potatoes) [^111GoG94].
- **Medication adjustments**: Discontinue or adjust medications that increase potassium levels, such as RAAS inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics, if clinically feasible [^113pqGhr].
- **Diuretics**: Consider loop or thiazide diuretics if clinically appropriate to enhance renal potassium excretion [^116pRo5x].
- **Potassium binders**: Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may be considered if hyperkalemia persists or if RAAS inhibitors cannot be discontinued [^116AU5Ci] [^111VP5QC].

---

## Indications for urgent treatment

Urgent treatment is indicated if any of the following are present:

- **ECG changes**: Peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, or arrhythmias [^114ypRXH].
- **Severe hyperkalemia**: Serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L [^1172XMC2].
- **Clinical instability**: Hypotension, cardiac arrest, or severe muscle weakness [^115h7Ejq].

Urgent treatments include intravenous calcium gluconate for cardiac stabilization, insulin with glucose to shift potassium intracellularly, and dialysis in cases of severe renal impairment or refractory hyperkalemia [^115bePMV] [^115h7Ejq].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of mild hyperkalemia (5.5 mmol/L) is generally favorable with appropriate management. However, if left untreated or if potassium levels continue to rise, it can lead to **life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias**, muscle paralysis, and respiratory failure [^1169uo2j].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure potassium levels return to normal and remain stable. Recommended follow-up includes:

- **Repeat serum potassium**: Within 1–3 days after initial detection [^111t4bJ8].
- **Regular monitoring**: Every 1–3 months, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or those on RAAS inhibitors [^115EgLFb].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients on dietary restrictions, medication adherence, and symptoms of hyperkalemia [^111GoG94].

---

A potassium level of 5.5 mmol/L represents mild hyperkalemia and **requires prompt evaluation and management** to prevent progression to more severe hyperkalemia and associated complications. Management includes confirming the result, assessing cardiac and renal function, adjusting medications, dietary modifications, and considering potassium binders if necessary. Urgent treatment is indicated if there are ECG changes, severe hyperkalemia, or clinical instability.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Potassium chloride for oral solution [^1133WKat]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116AU5Ci]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

RAASi/MRA management in CKD with hyperkalemia includes a stepwise approach: Optimize serum bicarbonate levels; Consider potassium-exchange agents; Third-line (Last resort): Reduce or discontinue RAASi/MRA; restart in future if patient condition allows. Providers may consider reducing or stopping ACEI/ARB when eGFR drops below a given eGFR threshold or when hyperkalemia develops, but hyperkalemia associated with use of ACEI/ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping ACEI/ARB. Protocols for RCTs of finerenone held the medication at potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; however, it may be appropriate to continue these medications in people with potassium of 5.5–6.0 mmol/L. We recommend involvement of nephrology when there is consideration of continuing ACEI/ARB/MRA when potassium > 5.5 mmol/L. The International Society of Nephrology provides an Optimization of RAASi Therapy Toolkit that includes guidance for managing hyperkalemia in patients on RAASi.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to potassium replacement, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to establish adequate renal function (urine output ~0.5 mL/kg/h) and monitor serum potassium levels for potassium replacement:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L|- 10–20 mmol/L/h until serum potassium > 3.5 mmol/L (faster potassium replacement will require central venous access)|
|Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L|- Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to keep serum potassium at 4–5 mmol/L|
|Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L|- Start insulin, but do not administer potassium <br/> - Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.|

### Pillar risk-based treatment for chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^112oMwgr]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Should I Be Concerned About Serum Potassium Levels Following Initiation of a RASi or Finerenone?

RASis can be associated with hyperkalemia, which can be managed by a reduction in potassium intake, as well as prescribing diuretics, sodium bicarbonate, or potassium binders to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the RASi dose or withdrawing treatment, which should only occur if mitigation strategies are ineffective. A meta-analysis comprising seven studies demonstrated an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events with RASi discontinuation in individuals with CKD, suggesting that if the clinical situation is appropriate, RASi treatment should be continued for maximum benefit.

Those treated with finerenone should have a serum potassium concentration ≤ 4.8 mmol/L at initiation, and monitoring should take place 1 month after starting. If levels rise to > 5.5 mmol/L, finerenone should be stopped, with adjustments made to diet or the addition of diuretics and/or potassium binders. Treatment may resume when potassium levels are ≤ 5.0 mmol/L.

Considering the risk of hyperkalemia is increased with MRAs and RASis, implementing the pillar approach would be advantageous over the stepwise approach, as the addition of an SGLT2i to these therapies may decrease the occurrence of hyperkalemia events. Indeed, in CONFIDENCE, the incidence of hyperkalemia was lower with finerenone and empagliflozin combination therapy than finerenone alone, indicating another advantage of simultaneous administration of these drugs. Patient-and-physician-shared decision-making should be at the center of hyperkalemia management.

Should I Expect a Reduction in an Individual's UACR Following Initiation of Appropriate Treatments?

Early changes (i.e. 6 months) in UACR have been previously accepted as a valid surrogate outcome for kidney endpoints. Moreover, patients may be more likely to adhere to medications if they experience an improvement in UACR with the addition of medications.

UACR is highly variable between measurements and is impacted by numerous other factors (for example, glycemic and blood pressure control, diet, and physical activity); therefore, the lack of decline after initiating medication does not necessarily indicate treatment failure and thus treatment should continue. If UACR continues to climb or the eGFR falls significantly, despite using of all the treatment strategies, consider referral to a nephrologist to determine if another etiology may be present or if intensification of therapy is warranted.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^114YNKWn]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Recommendations concerning aldosterone antagonists — scope, thresholds, and combination cautions — state that "the addition of low-dose aldosterone antagonists should be considered" in carefully selected patients with moderately severe or severe heart failure or "LV dysfunction early after MI". Trial enrollment generally excluded patients with creatinine "in excess of 2.5 mg per dL", and "few patients were actually enrolled with serum creatinine levels over 1.5 mg per dL"; in the MI trial, the "average serum creatinine" was "1.1 mg per dL, above which there was no demonstrable benefit for survival". To minimize life-threatening hyperkalemia, patients "should have initial serum creatinine less than 2.0 to 2.5 mg per dL" and "serum potassium less than 5.0 mEq per dL". For some with mild to moderate symptoms, "it may be reasonable to consider" adding aldosterone antagonists to loop diuretics, but the committee notes "insufficient data or experience to provide a specific or strong recommendation", and "it is not currently recommended" to give aldosterone antagonists without other concomitant diuretic therapy in chronic HF. Use with both ACEIs and ARBs is cautioned, as "this combination cannot be recommended".

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111RKLXp]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

### Effect of patiromer on reducing serum potassium and preventing recurrent hyperkalaemia in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease on RAAS inhibitors [^113hcD9Y]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Following the initial treatment phase was a randomized withdrawal phase (an 8‐week, single‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel group assessment of patiromer withdrawal). Patients who completed the initial treatment phase were eligible to start the randomized withdrawal phase if they had moderate‐to‐severe hyperkalaemia (serum K + ≥ 5.5 mEq/L to < 6.5 mEq/L) at baseline of the initial treatment phase and were normokalaemic (serum K + level within target range of ≥ 3.8 mEq/L to < 5.1 mEq/L) at week 4 of the initial treatment phase (baseline of the randomized withdrawal phase). Patients were eligible for continuation to the randomized withdrawal phase if they were still taking patiromer and ≥ 1 RAASi. Eligible patients were randomized in a single‐blind manner to either continue patiromer at the daily dose they were receiving at week 4 of the initial treatment phase or to switch to placebo, in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization was performed centrally and stratified based on the presence of type 2 diabetes as well as baseline serum K + [moderate (≥ 5.5 mEq/L to < 5.8 mEq/L) vs. severe (≥ 5.8 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia].

Use of RAASi and recurrence of hyperkalaemia were monitored during the randomized withdrawal phase. Hyperkalaemia was defined as a serum K + measurement ≥ 5.5 mEq/L during the first 4 weeks of the randomized withdrawal phase, and ≥ 5.1 mEq/L during the last 4 weeks of this phase. Recurrences of hyperkalaemia were managed with a pre‐specified treatment algorithm (see the Supplementary material online, Table S2) either by increasing the patiromer dose (patiromer group) or by RAASi modification (placebo group) at the time of the first occurrence of hyperkalaemia. Subsequent occurrences required discontinuation of RAASi. Neither of these interventions was to be used during the first 4 weeks of the randomized withdrawal phase (unless serum K + reached ≥ 5.5 mEq/L) to facilitate the interpretation of the primary efficacy endpoint.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

4.1 Recommendations for the management of potassium with Finerenone

In accordance with the US labelling prescribing information for finerenone, serum potassium and eGFR should be measured and finerenone should be dosed appropriately in all patients prior to initiation of treatment. Treatment with finerenone should not be initiated if serum potassium is > 5.0 mmol/L. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically, on a schedule similar to study visits in FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD (Month 1, Month 4, and at 4‐month intervals thereafter) to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia. Importantly, such a schedule is actually similar with the usual biological monitoring recommended in CKD patients by the KDIGO 2012 guidelines (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Protocol for potassium management

If serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 4.8 mmol/L, the dose should be continued or increased to 20 mg per day (if the starting dose was 10 mg per day, i.e. for patients with a baseline eGFR 25 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2). If serum potassium concentrations are > 4.8‐ ≤ 5.5 mmol/L, the dose should be maintained at 10 mg daily or 20 mg daily. Serum potassium should be monitored 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and throughout treatment, and the dose adjusted as needed.

This is actually similar to the recommended procedure for RASi oversight, per KDIGO guidelines on diabetes management in CKD, which state "Monitor serum creatinine and potassium (within 2–4 weeks after starting or changing dose)". Finerenone should be temporarily discontinued if serum potassium concentrations are > 5.5 mmol/L and can be restarted at 10 mg daily when serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 5.0 mmol/L. Finerenone has a short half‐life of 2–3 h and no active metabolites; therefore, hyperkalemia can be treated by discontinuing treatment. For patients with moderate liver disease (Child‐Pugh B), additional potassium monitoring should be considered (Table 4).

### Potassium chloride (potassium chloride for oral solution) [^112jCLAA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Real world evidence for treatment of hyperkalemia in the emergency department (REVEAL-ED): a multicenter, prospective, observational study [^114cwdHY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Contemporary emergency department (ED) standard-of-care treatment of hyperkalemia is poorly described.

Objective

Our aim was to determine the treatment patterns of hyperkalemia management in the ED.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, observational study evaluated patients aged ≥ 18 years with hyperkalemia (potassium [K +] level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in the ED from October 25, 2015 to March 30, 2016. K + -lowering therapies and K + were documented at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after initial ED treatment. The primary end point was change in K + over 4 h.

Results

Overall, 203 patients were enrolled at 14 U.S.-based sites. The initial median K + was 6.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.7–6.8) mmol/L and median time to treatment was 2.7 (IQR 1.9–3.5) h post-ED arrival. Insulin/glucose (n = 130; 64%) was frequently used to treat hyperkalemia; overall, 43 different treatment combinations were employed within the first 4 h. Within 4 h, the median K + for patients treated with medications alone decreased from 6.3 (IQR, 5.8–6.8) mmol/L to 5.3 (4.8–5.7) mmol/L, while that for patients treated with dialysis decreased from 6.2 (IQR 6.0–6.6) mmol/L to 3.8 (IQR 3.6–4.2) mmol/L. Hypoglycemia occurred in 6% of patients overall and in 17% of patients with K + > 7.0 mmol/L. Hyperkalemia-related electrocardiogram changes were observed in 23% of all patients; 45% of patients with K + > 7.0 mmol/L had peaked T waves or widened QRS. Overall, 79% were hospitalized; 3 patients died.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia practice patterns vary considerably and, although treatment effectively lowered K +, only dialysis normalized median K + within 4 h.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1136PaYq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the management of hyperkalemia in these patient populations may include reduction or discontinuation of RAASi, this may have a negative impact on outcomes. Adverse cardiorenal outcomes have been observed to increase with RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation, particularly in cohorts with CKD and HF. 50 Therefore, optimizing the therapeutic dosage of RAASi is encouraged, despite any difficulties in managing hyperkalemia. Due to the high prevalence of comorbidities among patients with HF, there is a risk that target doses of the disease‐modifying drugs cannot be achieved, reducing the effectiveness of the therapy.

Although the problem of hyperkalemia in these patients appears significant, one if its clear causes are the lack of sufficient control of potassium levels in primary care, which leads to the hyperkalemia rates described above, together with their complications. Nilsson et al. examined patients starting MRA therapy between 2007 and 2010 in Sweden and found that only 24% were adequately monitored at the recommended intervals. 51 The prompt recognition of hyperkalemia usually leads to its treatment, improving the rates of optimum treatment in HF patients.

In general, HF patients with renal dysfunction, high potassium levels (> 5.0 mEq/L) or bilateral renal stenosis might need a rechecking of potassium levels within 1 to 2 weeks after the initiation of RAASi and then every 3 to 5 months, while treatment may be stopped or the dose reduced when potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L. Regarding MRAs in these patients, potassium is checked after 1 week, then 4, and then every 3 months; again, treatment is stopped or tapered when the potassium level reaches > 5.5 mEq/L.

In every case, we should try to restart treatment. HF treatment guidelines do not encourage MRAs use in patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L. In addition, it is important to instigate dietary counseling regarding potassium and reappraise concomitant medications (eg, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, etc.) in those patients.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111LZUAQ]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of hyperkalemia during antihypertensive treatment with esaxerenone

Clinical data from phase III studies showed that serum potassium levels returned to normal after withdrawal of esaxerenone, and no additional treatment was required. In the J301 and J302 studies, esaxerenone treatment was discontinued in five and four patients, respectively, with serum potassium measurements of ≥ 6.0 or ≥ 5.5 mEq/L on two consecutive occasions. In all patients, potassium levels normalized within 28 days.

Available clinical study data can be used to develop a profile of patients at higher risk of developing hyperkalemia, allowing appropriate selection of patients for esaxerenone therapy. Based on patient factors such as lower renal function (reduced eGFR, albuminuria) and older age, gradually increasing the esaxerenone dosage from 1.25 to 2.5–5 mg/day has been suggested as a good strategy to reduce the risk of developing hyperkalemia compared with starting treatment at a fixed dosage.

4 POTASSIUM MANAGEMENT AND POTASSIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD

In the FIDELIO‐DKD and the FIGARO‐DKD trials, hyperkalemia was reported using thresholds of > 5.5 mmol/L for mild hyperkalemia and > 6.0 to < 6.5 mmol/L for moderate hyperkalemia, in accordance with the latest KDIGO guidance based on the protocol. The earliest time point after which serum potassium was measured in both trials was 1 month after treatment initiation. The second scheduled assessment of serum potassium was at the fourth month after treatment initiation and at 4‐month intervals thereafter. The frequency of potassium monitoring in both trials was consistent with that recommended in the KDIGO guidelines for patients with CKD (3–4 times per year for patients with UACR > 300 mg/g and eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and 2–3 times per year for patients with UACR 30–300 mg/g and eGFR 15–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). In both trials, the risk of hyperkalemia from finerenone (14.0%) versus placebo (6.9%) was more than doubled. This occurred despite the fact that potassium‐increasing drugs other than ACE inhibitors and ARBs were prohibited and subjects with baseline potassium concentrations > 4.8 mmol/L were excluded from the trials.

Finerenone had a predictable impact on serum potassium concentrations in both trials with a maximum difference in mean serum potassium between groups of 0.23 mmol/L in FIDELIO‐DKD and 0.16 mmol/L in FIGARO‐DKD. Given the higher mean eGFR in the FIGARO‐DKD trial compared with the FIDELIO‐DKD trial (68 vs. 44 ml/min/1.73 m 2), the incidence of hyperkalemia with finerenone treatment was lower in the former (10.8% vs. 18.3%), despite the longer median follow‐up (3.4 vs. 2.6 years). Of note, a post‐hoc analysis of the FIDELIO‐DKD data showed that independent risk factors for mild hyperkalemia were higher serum potassium, lower eGFR, increased urine albumin/creatinine ratio, younger age, female sex, ß‐blocker use, and finerenone assignment. Diuretic or SGLT2 inhibitor use reduced risk.

### Response to: hyperkalaemia in heart failure: binding the patient to improved treatment? [^114KWHhL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

We appreciate the insightful and balanced Editorial 1 by Dr Konstam regarding our study. 2 However, we wish to take issue with one of his statements and its implications. The Editorial states, "Over 4 weeks, in each trial, patients were allowed to have serum potassium levels as high as 6.2 mmol/L (HARMONIZE) or 6.5 mmol/L (OPAL‐HK) without intervention and, apparently, they tolerated these levels without difficulty", as well as the follow‐up statement, "These findings strongly suggest that down‐titration of RAASi in response to lower levels of hyperkalaemia may be unnecessarily conservative for most patients as long as potassium levels and kidney function are carefully monitored". 1 We would like to point out that in OPAL‐HK, 3 during the first 3 weeks of the study, patients were treated using a dosing algorithm that required increasing the patiromer dose or discontinuing the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) if serum potassium was observed to be 5.5 to < 6.5 mmol/L. Patients were only allowed to maintain a serum potassium in this range during a relatively short period (up to ∼9 days) of dose adjustment of either patiromer or their RAASi. 3 While there were no apparent deaths related to a serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L during the initial 4‐week treatment phase of this relatively small study, 2 this does not suggest that these levels of serum potassium or even levels as low as 5.1 mmol/L can be safely tolerated without intervention. There is increasing evidence that in patients with comorbidities — such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and/or diabetes mellitus — especially those over 65 years of age and those who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction, a serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L is associated with an increased risk of death. 4 Of particular importance is a study of VA patients in which increased mortality was found within 1 day of observing a serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L. 5 We would caution against allowing patients with even mild hyperkalaemia to remain without appropriate intervention. We would, however, agree with Dr Konstam's statement that, "With the availability of these newer, safer, more tolerable potassium‐binding agents and the demonstrated potential for retaining higher doses of RAASi, it is important to take the next step and explore a connection between the pharmacodynamics of these agents and reduced morbidity and mortality through well‐designed, prospective randomized clinical trials in patients with heart failure". 1

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

Abnormal potassium levels (specifically < 3.5 and > 5.4 mEq/L) are included in the APACHE illness severity score for predicting in‐hospital mortality among intensive care unit patients. 4 However, while the APACHE score defines hyperkalemia as a potassium level > 5.4 mEq/L, a study of 39 705 critically ill patients by McMahon et al 18 observed higher 30‐day mortality among patients with serum potassium levels > 4.5 mEq/L at the time of critical care initiation. We noted significantly higher mortality among patients with serum potassium levels between 5.0 and 5.4 mEq/L, emphasizing the mortality hazard associated with mild hyperkalemia. 18 McMahon et al 18 found that potassium supplementation leading to hyperkalemia did not increase mortality, implying that hyperkalemia is likely indicative of underlying pathophysiology rather than being causally associated with mortality.

2.3 Recommended Dosage

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose of potassium phosphates and are intended for most patients who weigh 40 kg or greater. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose.
The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Consider overall volume status of the patient when determining whether Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is an appropriate product for phosphorus replacement.
Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

Selection of the ready-to-use container solution concentration and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter. The infusion rate may also be adjusted based on patient characteristics and the specific institution policy.

The maximum recommended concentration and infusion rates for Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection are shown in Table 2 for adults and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or greater.

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates higher than potassium 10 mEq/hour.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of additional doses, assess the patient clinically, obtain serum phosphorus, calcium, and potassium concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

Data for the proportions of patients who achieved a serum K + level of ≤ 5.1 mmol/L are presented in Additional file 2: Figure S2. In general, similar proportions of patients achieved i-STAT K + goals over time in the overall population and in all baseline serum K + strata (Additional file 3: Figure S3).

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112fF8mn]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte management in ventricular arrhythmias — administration of potassium and magnesium has been proposed as helpful adjuncts in the prevention of VA; in patients with torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium is first-line therapy, and when both potassium and magnesium are deficient, magnesium should be replaced to facilitate potassium repletion. For potassium targets, some recommend keeping the potassium level between 4.5 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L to prevent VA and SCD; in acute MI, the lowest death rates were seen with serum potassium between 3.5 mmol/L and < 4.5 mmol/L, and the rates of VA did not rise unless potassium was < 3.5 mmol/L or ≥ 5 mmol/L. A large randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous magnesium in the post-MI period demonstrated no benefit in 30-day mortality, and it remains quite reasonable to monitor potassium and magnesium during aggressive diuresis and in the post-MI period.

### Controversies in management of hyperkalemia [^114N7A4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that can result in morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.

Objectives

This review evaluates the classic treatments of hyperkalemia and discusses controversies and new medications for management.

Discussion

Potassium (K+) plays a key role in determining the transmembrane potentials of "excitable membranes" present in nerve and muscle cells. K+ is the predominant intracellular cation, and clinical deterioration typically ensues when patients develop sufficiently marked elevation in extracellular fluid concentrations of K+ (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia is usually detected via serum clinical laboratory measurement. The most severe effect of hyperkalemia includes various cardiac dysrhythmias, which may result in cardiac arrest and death. Treatment includes measures to "stabilize" cardiac membranes, to shift K+ from extracellular to intracellular stores, and to promote K+ excretion. Calcium gluconate 10% dosed 10 mL intravenously should be provided for membrane stabilization, unless the patient is in cardiac arrest, in which case 10 mL calcium chloride is warranted. Beta-agonists and intravenous insulin should be given, and some experts recommend the use of synthetic short-acting insulins rather than regular insulin. Dextrose should also be administered, as indicated by initial and serial serum glucose measurements. Dialysis is the most efficient means to enable removal of excess K+. Loop and thiazide diuretics can also be useful. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not efficacious. New medications to promote gastrointestinal K+ excretion, which include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hold promise.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia can be deadly, and treatment requires specific measures including membrane stabilization, cellular shift, and excretion.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^116wEk37]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

Aldosterone antagonists — initiation and monitoring: Spironolactone should be initiated at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg daily, or occasionally on alternate days, and eplerenone was used at 25 mg per day, increasing to 50 mg daily. Potassium supplementation is generally stopped after initiation, patients should be counseled to avoid high potassium-containing foods, and patients should be cautioned to avoid the addition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Potassium levels and renal function should be rechecked within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation; subsequent monitoring should occur at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with any addition or increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) triggering a new cycle of monitoring. In view of hyperkalemia risk, the Writing Committee recommends that the routine triple combination of ACEIs, ARBs, and an aldosterone antagonist be avoided. The development of potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq per liter should generally trigger discontinuation or dose reduction of the aldosterone antagonist, and patients should be instructed specifically to stop the aldosterone antagonist during an episode of diarrhea or while loop diuretic therapy is interrupted.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the acute management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department [^112EjyE5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited evidence exists examining the use of potassium binders for the acute management of hyperkalemia.

Objective

The objective of the study is to evaluate the use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) for the acute management of hyperkalemia.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department with an initial potassium ≥ 5.6 mEq/L and treated with the institutional hyperkalemia order set.

Results

Overall, 189 patients were included. There was no significant difference in serum potassium change from baseline to first potassium within 6 hours between the SZC and non-SZC groups (-1.096 ± 0.71 vs -1.067 mEq/L ± 0.81, P = 0.798), respectively. No significant difference was seen between the SZC and non-SZC groups for time from initial hyperkalemia to order set medication administration (1.9 ± 1 vs 2.5 ± 2.9 hours, P = 0.63), mean hospital length of stay (5.5 ± 4.5 vs 6.6 days ± 6.9, P = 0.197), or potassium level at first recheck (5.17 ± 0.68 vs 5.34 mEq/L ± 0.76, P = 0.108). Time from the first medication administration to potassium recheck differed by about 1 hour between groups (4.1 ± 3.1 vs 5.1 hours ± 3.2, P = 0.035), and patients in the SZC group were less likely to have a potassium > 6 mEq/L at the first recheck (10.1% vs 21%, P = 0.047).

Conclusion and Relevance

The optimal use of SZC in the acute management remains uncertain based on results from this study with no difference in potassium levels at first recheck.

2.2 Dosage for Administration in Intravenous Fluids to Correct Hypophosphatemia

POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION provides phosphorus 3 mmol/mL (potassium 4.7 mEq/mL).

The dosage is dependent upon the individual needs of the patient, and the contribution of phosphorus and potassium from other sources.

Initial or Single Dose

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose and are intended for most patients. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose. The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium serum concentrations.

cup to a maximum of phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq) as a single dose.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

The concentration of the diluted solution and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter.

Peripheral administration:

The maximum recommended concentration is phosphorus 6.4 mmol/100 mL (potassium10 mEq/100 mL).
The maximum recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 6.4 mmol/hour (potassium 10 mEq/hour).

Central administration:

The maximum recommended concentration is phosphorus 18 mmol/100 mL (potassium 28.2 mEq/100 mL).
The maximum recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 15 mmol/hour (potassium 23.5 mEq/hour).

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates of potassium higher than 10 mEq/hour in adults and 0.5 mEq/kg/hour in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of
additional doses, assess the patient clinically and obtain serum phosphorous, calcium and potassium
concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^115MCQ91]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — RAS inhibitor safety, monitoring, and hyperkalemia management: Since RAS inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia, monitoring for hyperkalemia within 1–2 weeks after initiation remains appropriate. Although serum creatinine concentrations often increase acutely with RAS inhibitor initiation, an initial increase of ≤ 30% followed by stabilization within 2 months is associated with long-term preservation of kidney function. Therefore, every effort to maintain adequate dosing of RAS inhibitors, even in individuals more likely to develop hyperkalemia, could be useful, and an approach to maintain adequate RAS inhibition may be facilitated by dietary restrictions and/or potassium binders. The guideline also notes that the concurrent use of ACEIs and ARBs or inclusion of direct renin inhibitors in conjunction with an ACEI or ARB increases adverse outcomes and should be avoided. Consistent with practice point 1.2.6, ACEIs or ARBs should only be reduced or discontinued as a last resort in patients with hyperkalemia, and a recent retrospective cohort study found a higher risk of death and major cardiovascular outcomes after discontinuation of ACEI or ARB therapy in individuals who reached eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^115GDr43]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.

### Relationship between serum potassium concentration and risk of recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation [^115AvpFR]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Electrolyte abnormalities are considered a correctable cause of a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia according to American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Practice Guidelines, and ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in the setting of an electrolyte abnormality is considered a class III indication for defibrillator implantation. However, there are little data to support this recommendation. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of a recurrent sustained ventricular arrhythmia in patients with a low serum potassium concentration at the time of an initial episode of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia.

Methods and Results

One hundred sixty-nine consecutive patients who presented with a sustained ventricular arrhythmia and a serum potassium concentration determined on the day of the arrhythmia underwent defibrillator implantation. All patients had structural heart disease and left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.32 ± 0.15. On the day of the index arrhythmia, 30% of the patients had a serum potassium concentration < 3.5 or > 5.0 mEq/L, including 7% who had a serum potassium concentration < 3.0 or > 6.0 mEq/L. For the entire cohort of patients, freedom from a recurrent sustained ventricular arrhythmia was 18% at 5 years and was not significantly different among patients with a serum potassium concentration < 3.5 mEq/L (23%), between 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L (16%), and > 5.0 mEq/L (5%; P = 0.1).

Conclusion

The results of the present study suggest that patients with structural heart disease and an abnormal serum potassium concentration at the time of an initial episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation are at high risk for a recurrent ventricular arrhythmia; therefore, implantable defibrillator therapy may be reasonable.

Discussion

The results of the present pre‐specified analysis of the OPAL‐HK trial show that patiromer reduced mean serum K + to within the normal range in patents with HF. Compared with placebo, patiromer also reduced the percentage of patients with recurrent hyperkalaemia and, importantly, there were no differences in patients with and without HF in regard to these effects of patiromer. Mean serum K + level was reduced from ≥ 5.6 mEq/L to < 5.0 mEq/L in patients with HF during the initial treatment phase of the study, and 76% of patients with HF achieved normokalaemia. Conversely, in the randomized withdrawal phase, only 8% of patients on patiromer developed recurrent hyperkalaemia (when defined as serum K + ≥ 5.5 mEq/L) compared with 52% on placebo, allowing significantly more patients to remain on guideline‐recommended RAASi. This has important implications for patients with HF because RAASi including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Despite the proven efficacy of RAASi and their class 1 indication in guidelines for patients with HFrEF, many clinicians have avoided their use, especially MRAs, because of the fear of inducing hyperkalaemia. 8, 10 In those patients with HF in whom MRAs are initiated, they are often discontinued during the first several months because of an increase in serum K + or worsening renal function. 9, 19, 20, 21 While many clinicians consider a serum potassium of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L indicative of hyperkalaemia and an increased risk for sudden cardiac death, increasing evidence indicates that in patients with HF and CKD a serum K + of > 5.0 mEq/L is associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk. 22 Recurrent hyperkalaemia, when defined by serum K + ≥ 5.1 mEq/L, occurred in 95% of placebo patients with HF compared with 36% of patiromer patients with HF. The present analysis also suggests that hyperkalaemia occurring in a patient with HF can be relatively easily controlled with patiromer as shown by the finding that all of the HF patients on patiromer were able to be maintained on their RAASi during the randomized withdrawal phase despite the need for patiromer dose adjustment to manage hyperkalaemia in 11% of patients. Importantly, the use of patiromer in patients with HF has the potential to allow titration of RAASi doses to target levels and to maintain these dose levels. Target doses of RAASi appear to be more effective than lower doses in patients with HF as shown by the results in the HEAAL study. 23

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^117GpeCK]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypokalaemia is prevalent in 20% of hospitalised patients. Furthermore, inadequate management of hypokalemia was identified in 24% of these patients. Associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality, the identification, investigation, and treatment of hypokalaemia was identified as an area for improvement in the management of medical inpatients. The project aims to measure the assessment, management, and therapeutic monitoring of medical inpatients with hypokalaemia in a district general hospital. All medical inpatients over a one week period who met the criteria for hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L on standard biochemical sample) were included in the audit. Patient's notes were located and evaluated to identify if they had mild, moderate, or severe hypokalaemia. Further data on ECG requests, repeat U&Es, serum magnesium analysis, treatment prescribed, and medication review dates was collated. A re-audit was completed after the introduction of a set of interventions which included a hypokalaemia treatment algorithm. Pre-intervention analysis of all medical inpatients, who met our inclusion criteria for hypokalaemia, identified 32 patients. 25 of these patients met the criteria for mild hypokalaemia (3.1–3.4 mmol/L) and 7 met the criteria for moderate hypokalaemia (2.5–3.0 mmol/L). Only 7/32 (22%) patients were receiving adequate treatment based on trust guidelines. Post intervention results showed marked improvement in the management of patients with hypokalaemia. A total of 30 patients were identified in this post-intervention group. There were 16/30 patients who qualified as mild hypokalaemia (3.1–3.4 mmol/L) and 14/30 with moderate hypokalaemia (2.5–3.0 mmol/L). 19/30 (63%) patients in the post-intervention group were correctly prescribed appropriate medication doses consistent with the treatment algorithm. Following the initial success of the project, analysis at 3 months showed a positive trend for sustained improvement when compared to the pre-intervention results.

Between January 1999 and December 2000, 125 patients in Lima, Peru were enrolled in individualized treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Hypokalemia was observed to be an important adverse effect encountered in this cohort.

Objective

To identify risk factors associated with the development and persistence of hypokalemia during MDR-TB therapy, and to review the incidence and management of hypokalemia in patients receiving MDR-TB therapy.

Methods

A retrospective case series of 125 patients who received individualized therapy for MDR-TB between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2000.

Results

Among 115 patients who were screened for electrolyte abnormalities, 31.3% had hypokalemia, defined as a potassium level of < 3.5 mEq/L. Mean serum potassium at time of diagnosis was 2.85 mEq/L. Diagnosis of low serum potassium occurred, on average, after 5.1 months of individualized therapy. Multivariate analysis of risk factors for this adverse reaction identified two causes: administration of capreomycin, and low initial body weight. Normalization of potassium levels was achieved in 86% of patients.

Conclusions

Electrolyte disturbance was frequently encountered in our cohort of patients with MDR-TB. Successful screening and management of hypokalemia was facilitated by training the health-care team in the use of a standardized algorithm. Morbidity from hypokalemia can be significant; however, effective management of this side effect is possible without sacrificing MDR-TB treatment efficacy.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^115m9UAn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The regulation of potassium homoeostasis changes dramatically in patients with kidney failure who are treated by haemodialysis. With the kidney largely out of the equation, haemodialysis patients rely on potassium removal during each dialysis session to prevent hyperkalaemia. In addition, the gut becomes an important accessory organ for potassium excretion. Despite these adaptations, hyperkalaemia (defined as serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L) remains a common electrolyte disorder occurring in approximately 14% of haemodialysis patients. Although seemingly counterintuitive, a minority of haemodialysis patients is hypokalaemic (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L), and this is usually related to poor dietary intake. The target serum potassium in haemodialysis is unknown, but one study suggests that a serum potassium between 4.6 and 5.3 mmol/L is associated with the greatest survival. Of note, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), this optimal serum potassium range seems to be lower (4.0–4.5 mmol/L). Furthermore, when analysing serum potassium in haemodialysis patients, it is important to factor in when it was measured (after the long or short interdialytic interval, time of day and seasonality), and to analyse serial measurements to exclude transient hyperkalemia. Nephrologists can manage potassium balance in haemodialysis patients in three ways, including (i) by modifying the dialysate potassium concentration, (ii) by prescribing potassium binders and (iii) by modifying dietary potassium intake (Figure 1). The reason to implement such interventions is usually driven by recurring predialysis hyperkalaemia and the related risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Although the prevention of acute complications is important, another relevant question is how these interventions affect long-term outcomes in haemodialysis patients. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of randomized controlled trials in this area. Therefore, instead, we need to rely on registries, which often provide useful insights into how real-world management influences long-term outcomes. A good example of such a registry is the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN). In this issue, Mercadal et al. use this registry to analyse the effect of prescription patterns of dialysate potassium and potassium binders on survival in over 25 000 patients who started haemodialysis in 2010–13 and were followed until the end of 2014. Using Cox proportional hazard models, the investigators show that dialysis centres that used two or three dialysate potassium concentrations had a lower mortality risk than centres that only used one formula. In addition, patients who used the potassium binder sodium or calcium polystyrene sulphonate in a dose of 4–8 or ≥ 8 g/day had a lower mortality risk than patients who did not use potassium binders. Conversely, patients who used potassium binders in a dose < 4 g/day had a higher mortality risk. Oral potassium supplements, which were used in 6% of patients, were not associated with a survival benefit. What does this study teach us on potassium management in haemodialysis patients and what are the implications for clinical practice?

Regarding medical management for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to gastrointestinal excretion, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to administer sodium zirconium cyclosilicate as an option for the management of persistent hyperkalemia with a confirmed serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L in adult patients with CKD stage 3b-5 (not on dialysis) or HF receiving a suboptimal dose of RAAS inhibitors. Start sodium zirconium cyclosilicate by a specialist and continue in primary care.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111GvgLG]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with diabetes, multiple studies have reported that treatment with MR blockers, ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or a direct renin inhibitor is associated with an increase in potassium levels and a risk of severe hyperkalemia in a small number of patients. In patients with systolic heart failure, large randomized studies investigating ACE inhibitors or ARBs have demonstrated significant increases in serum potassium during treatment. In one study, the mean serum potassium level increased by 0.2 mEq/L during treatment with enalapril, and the proportion of patients with a serum potassium level > 5.5 mEq/L was significantly higher in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (6.4% vs. 2.5%; p < 0.01). Similarly, the rate of hyperkalemia leading to treatment discontinuation was higher in the candesartan group than in the placebo group in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) (1.9% vs. 0.3%; p = 0.0005).

Combination therapy has the potential to further worsen the risk of hyperkalemia. In one study, the addition of spironolactone or losartan to ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and albuminuria was associated with significant increases in serum potassium level compared to the outcome in the placebo group (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.03, respectively). In parallel-group RCTs of spironolactone added to an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB, increases in serum potassium ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 mEq/L. Corresponding increases in serum potassium in crossover RCTs were 0.1–0.3 mEq/L, and in nonrandomized trials, they were 0.1–0.4 mEq/L.

Management of hyperkalemia in hypertension

To ensure patient safety, it is important to monitor and manage potassium at a personalized level owing to interindividual variations in risk, symptoms, and treatments.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114UwrE9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of hypertension in diabetes and chronic kidney disease — recommended follow-up intervals specify that after initiation or changes in antihypertensive therapy, reassess in < 4 wk when systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) is ≥ 140 or < 120, when GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) is < 60, and for serum potassium (mEq/L) if on ACE inhibitor or ARB > 4.5 or if on a diuretic ≤ 4.5; otherwise reassess at 4–12 wk for systolic blood pressure 120–139, for GFR ≥ 60, for potassium if on ACE inhibitor or ARB ≤ 4.5, or if on a diuretic > 4.5. After blood pressure is at goal and drug doses are stable, monitor at 1–6 mo for GFR < 60, GFR decline (mL/min/1.73 m²/y) ≥ 4, or when risk factors for faster CKD progression or acute GFR decline are Yes, and at 6–12 mo when GFR is ≥ 60, GFR decline is < 4, and risk factors are No.

### A serum potassium level above 10 mmol / L in a patient predisposed to hypokalemia [^115YCYRh]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 58-year-old man, previously diagnosed with Bartter's syndrome, presented with a short history of vomiting, diarrhea and weakness. He had severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels > 10 mmol/l), which was successfully managed. Post hoc investigation suggested that the patient had Gitelman's rather than Bartter's syndrome.

Investigations

Physical examination, urine and blood analyses, chest radiography, electrocardiogram, renal ultrasound, and genetic analysis focusing on the SLC12A3 gene, which encodes the thiazide-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter.

Diagnosis

Gitelman's syndrome and hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal failure plus exogenous potassium supplementation.

Management

Intravenous calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose administration. Temporary continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Genetic confirmation of the underlying molecular defect. Long-term treatment for Gitelman's syndrome with oral potassium and magnesium supplements and epithelial sodium channel-blocking drugs. Review of patient education regarding renal salt-wasting syndromes.

### Serum potassium levels and mortality in acute myocardial infarction [^112a5MdK]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinical practice guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium levels between 4.0 and 5.0 mEq/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These guidelines are based on small studies that associated low potassium levels with ventricular arrhythmias in the pre-β-blocker and prereperfusion era. Current studies examining the relationship between potassium levels and mortality in AMI patients are lacking.

Objective

To determine the relationship between serum potassium levels and in-hospital mortality in AMI patients in the era of β-blocker and reperfusion therapy.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort study using the Cerner Health Facts database, which included 38,689 patients with biomarker-confirmed AMI, admitted to 67 US hospitals between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008. All patients had in-hospital serum potassium measurements and were categorized by mean postadmission serum potassium level (< 3.0, 3.0- < 3.5, 3.5- < 4.0, 4.0- < 4.5, 4.5- < 5.0, 5.0- < 5.5, and ≥ 5.5 mEq/L). Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine the association between potassium levels and outcomes after adjusting for patient- and hospital-level factors.

Main Outcome Measures

All-cause in-hospital mortality and the composite of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.

Results

There was a U-shaped relationship between mean postadmission serum potassium level and in-hospital mortality that persisted after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the reference group of 3.5 to less than 4.0 mEq/L (mortality rate, 4.8%; 95% CI, 4.4%-5.2%), mortality was comparable for mean postadmission potassium of 4.0 to less than 4.5 mEq/L (5.0%; 95% CI, 4.7%-5.3%), multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04–1.36). Mortality was twice as great for potassium of 4.5 to less than 5.0 mEq/L (10.0%; 95% CI, 9.1%-10.9%; multivariable-adjusted OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.68–2.36), and even greater for higher potassium strata. Similarly, mortality rates were higher for potassium levels of less than 3.5 mEq/L. In contrast, rates of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest were higher only among patients with potassium levels of less than 3.0 mEq/L and at levels of 5.0 mEq/L or greater.

Conclusion

Among inpatients with AMI, the lowest mortality was observed in those with postadmission serum potassium levels between 3.5 and < 4.5 mEq/L compared with those who had higher or lower potassium levels.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111cZZL1]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.1 - Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Rationale

Historically, it was often difficult to remove the potassium accumulated between dialysis sessions, so dialysate potassium between zero and 2mmol/L was common. The requirement for dialysate with potassium levels that are close to, or within, the normal range reflects the increased efficiency of modern dialysis and the increased age of the modern patient. In most units dialysate potassium is determined by the choice of acid concentrate: zero potassium is no longer used, and suppliers offer concentrates with potassium between 1 and 4mmol/L.

Removal of accumulated potassium by intermittent haemodialysis inevitably leads to a fluctuating profile of serum potassium with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias at both high and low concentrations. This probably contributes to the clustering of sudden cardiac death around the peridialytic period, and at the end of the weekend gap.

### Do hemolyzed potassium specimens need to be repeated? [^116PPkHq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In the emergency department (ED), hyperkalemia in the presence of hemolysis is common. Elevated hemolyzed potassium levels are often repeated by emergency physicians to confirm pseudohyperkalemia and to exclude a life-threatening true hyperkalemia.

Objectives

We hypothesize that in patients with a normal renal function, elevated hemolyzed potassium, and normal electrocardiogram (ECG), there may not be a need for further treatment or repeat testing and increased length of stay.

Methods

Data were prospectively enrolled patients presenting to the ED from July 2011 to February 2012. All adult subjects who had a hemolyzed potassium level ≥ 5.5 mEq/dL underwent a repeat potassium level and ECG. The incidence of true hyperkalemia in this population was measured.

Results

A total of 45 patients were enrolled. The overall median age was 52 years (range 25–83 years); 22 were female (49%). In patients with hyperkalemia on initial blood draw and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60 (n = 45), the negative predictive value was 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.2–99.9%). When patients had hyperkalemia on initial blood draw, GFR ≥ 60, and a normal ECG (n = 42), the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI 93.1–100%).

Conclusions

In the setting of hemolysis, GFR ≥ 60 mL/min in conjunction with a normal ECG is a reliable predictor of pseudohyperkalemia and may eliminate the need for repeat testing. In patients with a normal GFR who are otherwise deemed safe for discharge, our results indicate there is no need for repeat testing.

### Rapid correction of hyperkalemia is associated with reduced mortality in ED patients [^115CeaZx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia (HK) is common and associated with mortality. Our purpose was to determine if the rapid correction of elevated serum potassium level (K +) was associated with reduced mortality in emergency department (ED) patients.

Methods

Design: We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of ED patients with HK (K + ≥ 5.5 mEq/L) from 10/2016–10/2017.

Setting

Large, academic ED.

Participants

Adult ED patients presenting with hyperkalemia. Main outcomes and measures: The main outcome was in-hospital mortality. We compared outcomes of patients whose K + normalized (dropped below 5.5 mEq/L) with those whose K + did not normalize using chi-square and multivariate analyses to determine the associations between predictor variables and outcomes.

Results

From 114,977 ED visits, 1033 patients (0.9%, 95%CI 0.85–0.95%) had HK. Their mean (SD) age was 60 (26) years and 58% were male. Of these, 884 had a second K + measured within a median (IQR) of 5 (3–8) hours. Mortality and admission rates were higher in patients with HK vs. those with normal K + (8.5% vs. 0.8%, P < 0.001 and 80% vs. 39%, P < 0.001, respectively). Mortality was lower in patients whose HK normalized compared with those whose K + remained elevated (6.3% vs. 12.7%, P = 0.001). After adjusting for age, creatinine, comorbidities, and initial K +, normalization of K + was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.28 to 0.80).

Conclusions

Normalization of K + during the ED stay in patients with HK is associated with a 50% mortality reduction. Efforts to rapidly identify and treat HK in the ED are needed.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

Management of torsades de pointes with QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics — monitoring high-risk patients during initiation and recognizing the syndrome early are emphasized; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 and 5 mEq/L shortens QT, although no specific data are available on the efficacy of potassium repletion to prevent torsades de pointes; intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes even when serum magnesium is normal; magnesium toxicity can occur when concentrations reach 6 to 8 mEq/L but is a very small risk with doses usually used, 1 to 2 g intravenously; temporary pacing is highly effective for recurrent torsades after potassium repletion and magnesium supplementation, and isoproterenol can also be used to increase heart rate and abolish postectopic pauses; anecdotes have reported that lidocaine, verapamil, and even occasionally amiodarone have been effective, although amiodarone may itself cause torsades de pointes, albeit much less commonly than with other QT‑prolonging antiarrhythmics.

### Treatment of hyperkalemia… [^1169uo2j]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Potassium is a key cation with tightly regulated extracellular concentration. Hyperkalemia, commonly considered present if the potassium concentration exceeds 5. 0 mEq/L, appears to be a relatively rare event. Although representative data on hyperkalemia in the overall population are lacking, a study of US veterans indicated a hyperkalemia event rate of approximately 4 per 100 person-years, with the majority of events occurring during hospitalizations. 1 Individuals in this study were required to have at least 1 hospitalization and 1 outpatient creatinine measurement; thus, it is likely that the population was at higher risk for hyperkalemia.

In contrast to the low rate of hyperkalemia in the general population, individuals with certain comorbid conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or congestive heart failure have been shown to be highly prone to developing hyperkalemia, especially if receiving treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which are often recommended in such patients. For example, in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of losartan in patients with diabetic nephropathy, the cumulative incidence of hyperkalemia was 38. 4% in the losartan group. 2 Winkelmayer WC.
