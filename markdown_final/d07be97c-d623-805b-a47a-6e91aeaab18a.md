## Question

Anemia, iron deficiency treatment plan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about an iron deficiency anemia treatment plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing severity. Then, I should identify the underlying cause and decide whether to investigate immediately or after a therapeutic trial. Next, I will select the route and formulation of iron therapy, including dosing and optimization strategies. After that, I need to set monitoring intervals and response criteria. Finally, I will address special populations, recurrence prevention, and when to escalate to IV iron or transfusion, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with iron deficiency anemia rather than anemia of chronic disease or mixed etiologies. In adults without inflammation, ferritin less than 45 ng/mL supports iron deficiency, whereas in inflammatory states, ferritin less than 100 ng/mL is more sensitive but should be interpreted with transferrin saturation and CRP; a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks of iron therapy is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency even if iron studies are equivocal, which I should keep in mind if labs are discordant [^44a745d9] [^d926af9f] [^80df5a00].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I plan investigations. I should categorize the patient by risk: premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding may warrant a therapeutic trial with gynecologic evaluation as indicated, whereas men and postmenopausal women generally require bidirectional endoscopy to exclude occult gastrointestinal malignancy or other pathology; in all cases, I should check for H. pylori and consider celiac serology when appropriate, and I must remember not to defer iron replacement while awaiting endoscopy unless colonoscopy is imminent [^c75f1a44] [^02750bb5] [^d926af9f].

> Next, I should review the route of iron therapy. Oral iron remains first-line for most stable patients because it is effective, safe, and inexpensive, but I need to ensure I choose a formulation and dosing strategy that balances efficacy and tolerability; ferrous sulfate is preferred for cost, and I should consider every-other-day dosing to improve absorption and reduce side effects, while reserving intravenous iron for intolerance, malabsorption, active inflammation, or when rapid repletion is needed [^73dba1e6] [^66e48c4d] [^cbd61487].

> I will now examine oral iron dosing and optimization. Standard dosing uses 40–65 mg elemental iron once daily or every other day, with vitamin C to enhance absorption; taking iron away from calcium, PPIs, and dairy can reduce chelation and improve uptake, and I should confirm adherence and side effects at follow-up because poor tolerance is common and often drives nonresponse [^73dba1e6] [^66e48c4d] [^d926af9f].

> Wait, let me verify the monitoring cadence and response thresholds. I should check hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks to confirm a reticulocyte rise and a hemoglobin increase of about 10 g/L within 2 weeks, which supports absolute iron deficiency; if there is inadequate response, I should reassess adherence, ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, or an alternate diagnosis, and if response is adequate, I should continue therapy for approximately 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin to replete stores, with periodic CBC thereafter to detect recurrence [^80df5a00] [^586f90e2] [^cbd61487].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy. I should treat iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy because it is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes; oral iron is first-line, but if not tolerated, not absorbed, or if anemia is severe or late in gestation, IV iron is appropriate, and I should monitor hemoglobin and ferritin to guide therapy and avoid overtreatment [^a923787e] [^bcc91ecc] [^ce94c7db].

> For inflammatory bowel disease, I need to ensure I account for active inflammation and hepcidin-mediated blockade. IV iron is generally more effective than oral iron in active disease, with meta-analytic data showing higher odds of hemoglobin rise and better treatment continuity; I should screen CBC, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP every 3–6 months depending on disease activity and treat all patients with IBD and IDA, tailoring route to severity and activity [^cdb68180] [^72338ce7] [^dbaf4284].

> In chronic kidney disease, I should double-check for absolute versus functional iron deficiency. Functional iron deficiency with ferritin 30–100 ng/mL and low transferrin saturation warrants iron repletion, and IV iron is often preferred due to impaired absorption and the need to support erythropoiesis-stimulating agents; I should avoid excessive ferritin targets and monitor for iron overload risk with repeated dosing [^acf51a64] [^e471c185].

> For perioperative patients, I need to ensure timely correction. If time permits, oral iron is reasonable, but when rapid repletion is needed or oral iron is unlikely to be effective, IV iron is preferred; institutional pathways should define preoperative anemia evaluation and iron repletion to reduce transfusions and complications, and I should align with anesthesia and surgical teams on timing and targets [^4b7c8398] [^a4204e41] [^02cef0d2].

> But wait, what if the patient is iron-refractory due to TMPRSS6-related IRIDA. In that scenario, oral iron is typically ineffective because of high hepcidin, so I should confirm the diagnosis and proceed directly to IV iron, avoiding excessive dosing and monitoring ferritin and transferrin saturation to prevent iron overload; I should also counsel that responses vary and long-term management may require intermittent IV iron rather than pursuit of normal hemoglobin [^de68e35f] [^8271d660] [^efd28965].

> I should confirm when to escalate to IV iron in general. Indications include intolerance to oral iron, failure of hemoglobin to rise after 4 weeks with confirmed adherence, malabsorption states such as post-bariatric surgery or celiac disease with villous atrophy, active inflammatory disease, or when rapid repletion is required; when choosing IV iron, formulations that replete in 1–2 infusions are preferred, and I should counsel that serious hypersensitivity is rare, with most reactions being infusion-related and manageable [^e894aa8b] [^eaec0037] [^a4cf83f5].

> Hold on, I should verify transfusion thresholds. Red cell transfusion is reserved for severe symptomatic anemia, typically hemoglobin less than 7–8 g/dL in adults, or when there is hemodynamic instability; even after transfusion, iron replacement is still necessary to correct the deficit, and I should avoid reflex transfusion in stable, non-acute IDA when oral or IV iron can safely correct the anemia [^ef4bc942] [^cbd61487].

> Next, I should review recurrence prevention. Once iron repletion is achieved, I should monitor CBC periodically, for example every 6–12 months, and consider long-term iron therapy if the cause is irreversible or unknown; in IBD, I should proactively screen and retreat when ferritin falls below 100 mcg/L or hemoglobin drops below sex-specific thresholds, integrating this into routine disease monitoring [^cbd61487] [^9274ebc2] [^7bda54a5].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is documented and communicated clearly, including the confirmed diagnosis, suspected etiology and investigation plan, chosen iron route and dosing, monitoring schedule, and patient education on adherence, side effect mitigation, and when to seek care; this aligns with best-practice pathways and supports coordinated care across specialties [^e0113de0] [^0535a5a6].

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) management centers on **confirming the diagnosis** with hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation [^44a745d9], then **identifying and treating the cause** (notably gastrointestinal or menstrual blood loss) [^c75f1a44]. Oral iron is **first-line** (typically 40–65 mg elemental iron once daily or every other day) [^73dba1e6] for 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin to replete stores [^586f90e2]; IV iron is indicated for intolerance, malabsorption, active IBD, CKD, or when rapid repletion is needed [^e894aa8b] [^cdb68180] [^acf51a64]. Monitor hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks [^d926af9f]; expect a rise of about 1 g/dL every 2–3 weeks if responding. Transfuse only for severe symptomatic anemia or hemodynamic instability, and monitor for recurrence every 6–12 months [^4f9b4a7f].

---

## Diagnosis and severity assessment

- **Confirm IDA**: Hemoglobin below age/sex-specific normal, ferritin < 15 ng/mL (or < 45 ng/mL if inflammation) [^44a745d9], and transferrin saturation < 20% [^d926af9f].

- **Severity**: Mild (Hb 10–11.9 g/dL), moderate (8–9.9 g/dL), severe (< 8 g/dL) [^notfound].

- **Identify cause**: Evaluate for GI blood loss (endoscopy/colonoscopy) [^c75f1a44], menstrual blood loss, malabsorption (celiac, bariatric), and chronic disease (CKD, IBD, HF) [^d926af9f].

---

## General principles of treatment

Treat the **underlying cause** to prevent recurrence [^caa14b92], and **replenish iron stores** with oral or IV iron to normalize hemoglobin and ferritin [^09bc7871].

---

## Oral iron therapy (first-line)

- **Formulation**: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg elemental) once daily or every other day [^73dba1e6]; alternate-day dosing may improve absorption and tolerability [^66ca1a28].

- **Duration**: Continue for ~3 months after Hb normalization to replete stores [^586f90c7].

- **Enhance absorption**: Take on an empty stomach with vitamin C; avoid calcium, PPIs, and antacids [^9dd8c36d].

- **Monitor**: Check Hb at 2–4 weeks; expect ~1 g/dL rise every 2–3 weeks if responding [^d926af9f].

---

## Intravenous iron therapy (second-line)

Indications include intolerance or nonresponse to oral iron, malabsorption (post-bariatric, celiac), active IBD, CKD, or when **rapid repletion** is needed (severe anemia, pre-op) [^e894aa8b] [^cdb68180] [^acf51a64]. Common formulations are ferric carboxymaltose (1–2 infusions), iron sucrose (multiple infusions), and ferric derisomaltose (1–2 infusions) [^eaec0037]. Safety is favorable: serious reactions are rare (< 1%), and hypophosphatemia can occur with ferric carboxymaltose [^d926af9f].

---

## Special populations

| **Population** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|
| Pregnancy | - Oral iron first-line <br/> - IV iron if intolerance, nonresponse, or severe anemia <br/> - Monitor Hb every 4 weeks [^a923787e] [^bcc91ecc] |
| Chronic kidney disease | - IV iron preferred due to impaired absorption and functional iron deficiency [^notfound] |
| Inflammatory bowel disease | - IV iron first-line in active disease or intolerance <br/> - Oral iron if mild anemia and inactive disease [^cdb68180] [^afa31476] |
| Elderly | - Evaluate for GI malignancy <br/> - Consider IV iron if oral not tolerated or malabsorption [^f7fc4df2] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks to confirm a **1 g/dL rise every 2–3 weeks** [^d926af9f], and monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation to confirm repletion. Continue treatment for about 3 months after Hb normalization to rebuild stores [^586f90c7], and arrange **surveillance** every 6–12 months to detect recurrence [^4f9b4a7f].

---

## Red flags and indications for transfusion

Transfuse for **severe symptomatic anemia** (e.g. chest pain, syncope, heart failure) or when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL in stable patients without symptoms [^ef4bc942]. Also transfuse for hemodynamic instability or ongoing active bleeding [^ef4bc942].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Emphasize **adherence** to therapy and review strategies to manage side effects (constipation, nausea) [^d926af9f]. Reinforce dietary iron intake and factors that affect absorption [^8005a93d]. Teach patients to recognize recurrence and when to seek care [^cbd61487].

---

## Summary algorithm

Confirm IDA → Identify cause → Oral iron first-line → Monitor Hb at 2–4 weeks → If no response or intolerance, switch to IV iron → Treat underlying cause → Continue 3 months after Hb normalization → Monitor for recurrence every 6–12 months [^d926af9f] [^586f90c7] [^4f9b4a7f].

---

Effective IDA care requires **confirming the diagnosis**, treating the cause, and using oral iron first-line with timely escalation to IV iron when indicated, alongside structured monitoring and patient education to sustain response and prevent recurrence.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^99564ccb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^caa14b92]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^8157aa96]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^de68e35f]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA) is a rare hereditary microcytic anaemia characterized by partial or complete resistance to oral iron supplementation, caused by elevated plasma hepcidin levels resulting from pathogenic variants in the TMPRSS6 gene. Although intravenous iron supplementation is often effective, patient responses can vary significantly due to various factors, and potential side effects of this treatment remain unclear. Additionally, evidence-based international guidelines for diagnosing and managing IRIDA are lacking. This review aims to provide patient-tailored treatment strategies, informed by case studies and expert opinion, to address the specific therapeutic needs of both children and adults with IRIDA.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^8b511868]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions — strength of recommendation: For Strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, and most individuals should receive the recommended course of action, with formal decision aids not likely to be needed. For Conditional recommendations, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and different choices will be appropriate for different patients; decision aids may be useful in helping individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences, and clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^7b627bd7]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease-specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

Iron deficiency anemia remains a common referral to the pediatric hematology-oncology subspecialist. Improved understanding of iron homeostasis, including the effects of the regulatory hormone hepcidin, recent adult and pediatric clinical trial data, as well as the availability of safer formulations of intravenous iron, have resulted in additional considerations when making treatment recommendations in such patients. Young children and adolescent females remain the most commonly affected groups, but children with complex medical or chronic inflammatory conditions including comorbid gastrointestinal disorders also require special consideration.

Abstract

Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease‐specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^09bc7871]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected with this condition. Although the most common causes of IDA are gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women, decreased dietary iron and decreased iron absorption are also culpable causes. Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the haemoglobin to a normal level. This has shown to improve quality of life, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron deficiency occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This article will provide an updated overview on diagnosis and management of IDA in patients with chronic conditions, preoperative and in pregnancy. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron replacement in each cohort, with an overview on cost analysis between the different iron formulations currently on the market.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^59d94a70]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication of inflammatory bowel diseases. An international working party has formed and developed guidelines for evaluation and treatment of anemia and iron deficiency that should serve practicing gastroenterologists. Within a total of 16 statements, recommendations are made regarding diagnostic measures to screen for iron- and other anemia-related deficiencies regarding the triggers for medical intervention, treatment goals, and appropriate therapies. Anemia is a common cause of hospitalization, prevents physicians from discharging hospitalized patients, and is one of the most frequent comorbid conditions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It therefore needs appropriate attention and specific care.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^ba9ec1ff]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are some of the most common systemic complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Symptoms such as fatigue, reduced ability to concentrate and reduced exercise tolerance can mimic common symptoms of IBD and can therefore easily be overseen. Furthermore, clinicians tend to see mild to moderate anemia as an inevitable accompaniment of IBD that is sufficiently explained by the underlying disease and does not require further workup. But in contrast to these clinical routines, current guidelines recommend that any degree of anemia in patients with IBD should be further evaluated and treated. Multiple studies have shown that anemia is a main factor for decreased quality of life (QoL) in patients with IBD. Correction of anemia, however, can significantly improve the QoL of patients with IBD. It is therefore recommended that every patient with IBD is regularly screened for iron deficiency and anemia. If detected, appropriate workup and treatment should be initiated. Over the last years, a number of new diagnostic tools and treatment options have been developed. Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety of newer formulations of intravenous iron in patients with IBD and have compared oral and intravenous iron in various situations. Treatment recommendations have changed and new evidence-based guidelines were developed. However, to date these guidelines are still not widely implemented in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to draw attention to the need for treatment for every level of anemia in patients with IBD and to provide some practical guidance for screening, diagnostics, treatment and follow up of IDA in patients with IBD following current international guidelines.

### Management of iron deficiency [^ef4bc942]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

### Identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^bac5d8cd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common during pregnancy, and while most anemia is physiologic, the most common pathologic cause is iron deficiency. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends confirmation of iron deficiency anemia with iron studies when anemia is diagnosed during pregnancy but acknowledges that presumptive treatment for suspected iron deficiency anemia is common in practice. Currently ACOG does not recommend treating iron deficiency without anemia during pregnancy. Though the benefits of treating iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are clear, the optimal route of iron repletion remains uncertain. Results of ongoing large, randomized trials will help define the optimal route of iron treatment for pregnant patients diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency: a concise review [^95c40166]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a major worldwide health problem. There is recent evidence that the anemia is only the last manifestation of the syndrome and that symptoms occur before the anemia is manifest. Advances in outlining the physiology of iron deficiency have been made, gaps remain in the current understanding. While oral iron supplement remains the mainstay, some indications for the intravenous administration have developed. This review will highlight the epidemiology, physiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^d926af9f]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^f7fc4df2]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^9dd8c36d]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — iron deficiency anemia management states that iron repletion may be through oral or intravenous (IV) routes depending on the etiology and severity of iron deficiency (ID), tolerance of oral iron, and likelihood of successful repletion through oral iron administration, and that IV iron is safe and effective in patients with severe ID or in those whom oral iron is unlikely to be effective. It also states that further studies are needed to determine optimal formulations and routes for iron repletion and to identify patients who would benefit from earlier IV iron administration, and that additional studies to elucidate optimal gastrointestinal management of difficult-to-treat conditions such as PHG, GAVE, and small-bowel angioectasias also are needed.

### International consensus statement on the peri-operative management of anaemia and iron deficiency [^b70029d4]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Despite current recommendations on the management of pre-operative anaemia, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in an expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After presentation of our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the peri-operative period. These statements include: a diagnostic approach for anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients; identification of patients appropriate for treatment; and advice on practical management and follow-up. We urge anaesthetists and peri-operative physicians to embrace these recommendations, and hospital administrators to enable implementation of these concepts by allocating adequate resources.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^cdb68180]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^66ca1a28]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although a recent clinical trial in adults with iron deficiency anaemia showed no added benefit from ascorbic acid, this may not exclude its potential benefit in IRIDA. Moreover, reported cases showed varying outcomes with this combination therapy. Iron should be taken apart from certain foods (e.g. dairy products, fibres) and medications (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, calcium supplements, antacids), which can reduce iron availability by forming insoluble complexes. Alternate‐day dosing may reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which for iron‐deficient adult women has been described to last for approximately 24 h after iron intake.

In absolute iron deficiency anaemia, a weekly haemoglobin increase of approximately 0.8 g/dL is expected; however, in IRIDA, this haemoglobin increase in time is likely lower due to reduced iron availability. We define IRIDA non‐responders as those with less than a 1 g/dL haemoglobin increase after 4 weeks of oral therapy. As extended use appears more effective, oral supplementation should be continued for at least 3 months before considering switching to IV therapy. However, in practice, most patients diagnosed with IRIDA have already completed multiple unsuccessful attempts at oral iron supplementation. For these children, if they have been compliant with the prescribed therapy, reinitiating or extending oral therapy for 3 months is unnecessary. Instead, we recommend initiating IV iron therapy as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.

### Iron deficiency anemia in women across the life span [^8567d688]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a global health issue with disproportionately high prevalence in women. In addition to being an independent risk factor for decreased quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality, anemia in women has been linked to unfavorable outcomes of pregnancy and other issues for children born to anemic women. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia in many populations. Guidelines recommend proactive screening for anemia, particularly in the preoperative setting. Once anemia is diagnosed, treatment should be based on etiology (most commonly, iron deficiency followed, in order of prevalence, by inflammation or chronic disease). Iron supplementation (oral and intravenous) offers safe and effective treatment for anemia associated with iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic disease may be more challenging to treat, and attention must be given to the underlying disease, along with use of hematinic agents. Given its enormous impact on the health and well-being of women and the availability of simple and effective treatment options, anemia should never be left unmanaged.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^73dba1e6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Management of iron deficiency in children, adults, and pregnant individuals: evidence-based and expert consensus recommendations [^d26ff216]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Oral iron is often recommended as first-line treatment, but there is no consensus on the optimal formulation, dosing strategy, or which patients should be treated preferentially with intravenous iron. To address these challenges, the Iron Consortium at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) convened an international panel of 26 experts in haematology, primary care, paediatrics, obstetrics, gastroenterology, cancer, and patient advocacy among its members. This panel was supplemented by insights from a four-person patient focus group to develop current recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel developed clinically relevant questions in five priority topic areas, a systematic literature search was performed, and studies meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables for recommendation development. Evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations were made through a structured anonymous consensus voting process at an in-person meeting in Portland, OR, USA, hosted by OHSU on Feb 16–17, 2024. The expert panel made seven evidence-based recommendations for three demographic groups with iron deficiency: non-pregnant adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, children, and adolescents. Expert opinions supported the recommendations on 21 aspects of care for which there is insufficient evidence. This Review provides evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of iron deficiency, detailing best practices for oral and intravenous iron repletion across diverse patient populations.

### How we diagnose and treat iron deficiency anemia [^a04bc3d2]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is anemic, the majority being due to iron deficiency (ID). In adults, ID is associated with fatigue in the absence of anemia, restless legs syndrome, pica and, in neonates, delayed growth and development. In adolescents, ID is associated with decrements in learning and behavioral abnormalities. In the absence of a clear cause, search for a source of bleeding is indicated. No single test is diagnostic of ID unless the serum ferritin is low or the percent transferrin saturation is low with an elevated total iron binding capacity. Oral iron is considered front line therapy except for conditions such as gastric bypass, heavy uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Oral iron has many unpleasant side effects, resulting in low patient adherence. For patients intolerant of, or unresponsive to, oral iron, intravenous (IV) administration is the preferred route. While early formulations were associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), newer formulations are much safer with SAEs occurring very infrequently. Full replacement doses can be administered in a matter of minutes to a few hours. Nevertheless, there remains a reluctance to use IV iron due to a misunderstanding of the safety of the available formulations. IV iron is safe and effective in all clinical circumstances including pregnancy. The preponderance of published evidence suggests IV iron therapy is underutilized and we believe that IV iron should be moved forward in the treatment of ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA).

Iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease — Celiac disease is present in 2% to 6% of asymptomatic patients with IDA; in most patients without another explanation for iron deficiency, anemia will improve after initiation of a strict gluten-free diet without iron supplementation, but up to 20% of patients will remain iron deficient even with strict gluten avoidance. Oral iron is less likely to be effective in patients with more severe degrees of villous atrophy, and IV iron may be indicated in these patients or in patients with more severe symptoms of iron deficiency; IV iron also may be indicated in patients whose iron stores do not recover sufficiently with oral iron and a strict gluten-free diet, and appropriate evaluation of other micronutrient deficiencies, sources of chronic blood loss, or anemia of chronic inflammation should be undertaken in patients whose iron stores are slow to recover.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^1bcc9073]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations for treatment

Recommendations for iron supplementation vary according to the guidelines. The NCCN guidelines are mainly for anemic patients receiving ESA, not with ID alone. Intravenous or oral iron is recommended for absolute ID (serum ferritin < 30 ng/ml and TSAT < 20%); failure to correct anemia within 4 weeks should lead to consideration of functional ID. Intravenous iron is recommended in functional ID (serum ferritin 30–500 µg/L and TSAT < 20%) in patients on ESA therapy.

According to ESMO guidelines, ID should be corrected as soon as serum ferritin levels are < 100 µg/L and TSAT is < 20% regardless of anemia. Oral iron treatment can only be considered in patients with absolute ID with ferritin < 30 µg/L and in the absence of an inflammatory state (C‐reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L).

Knowledge gaps

ID remains insufficiently diagnosed in cancer patients and guidelines recommendations are insufficiently applied. Iron therapy is generally considered only a supportive care treatment, combined with ESA in advanced cancer disease. There is a lack of data on ID with or without anemia in the early phases of cancer in patients with adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. The insufficient use of iron therapy by oncologists may be related to previous concerns and uncertainties regarding iron administration in this setting. Although iron therapy is recommended in patients controlled with antitumor treatment, iron is also considered as a promising target in cancer progression because it facilitates cell proliferation and growth. In addition, blood transfusion has been associated with an increased risk of cancer development. Long‐term studies on the efficacy and safety of iron therapy could help convince oncologists to systematically diagnose and treat ID, especially during the early phase of the cancer disease, thus avoiding the need for ESA or transfusions when anemia is established and more problematic to treat.

### Anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel diseases: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^7f618902]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia coexists with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in up to two-thirds of patients, significantly impairing quality of life. The most common types of anemia in patients with IBD are iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease, which often overlap. In most cases, available laboratory tests allow successful diagnosis of iron deficiency, where difficulties appear, recently established indices such as soluble transferrin-ferritin ratio or percentage of hypochromic red cells are used. In this review, we discuss the management of the most common types of anemia in respect of the latest available data. Thus, we provide the mechanisms underlying pathophysiology of these entities; furthermore, we discuss the role of hepcidin in developing anemia in IBD. Next, we present the treatment options for each type of anemia and highlight the importance of individual choice of action. We also focus on newly developed intravenous iron preparations and novel, promising drug candidates targeting hepcidin. Concurrently, we talk about difficulties in differentiating between the true and functional iron deficiency, and discuss tools facilitating the process. Finally, we emphasize the importance of proper diagnosis and treatment of anemia in IBD. We conclude that management of anemia in patients with IBD is tricky, and appropriate screening of patients regarding anemia is substantial.

1.2 Defining iron deficiency

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. 31 Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, 31, 32, 33 but not as a medical condition in and of itself. 34

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

1.3 Expert recommendation

We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency:

Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia

1.4 Clinical impact of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (eg, pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue, and exhaustion. 35, 36, 37, 38 This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present and, as a consequence, diagnosis is not pursued and the condition is left untreated.

Physicians may need to actively ask their patients about such symptoms, especially for those patient populations where iron deficiency is highly prevalent, so that appropriate diagnostic tests can be performed and, if necessary, treatment can be given. 35 In this section, we outline the iron deficiency symptoms that have been commonly reported in patients with CHF, CKD and IBD, as well as its associated clinical outcomes that further call for its prompt diagnosis and management.

Description

In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we will Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In individuals with inflammatory bowel disease and iron-deficiency anemia, clinicians first should determine whether iron-deficiency anemia is owing to inadequate intake or absorption, or loss of iron, typically from gastrointestinal bleeding. Active inflammation should be treated effectively to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Intravenous iron therapy should be given in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, and active inflammation with compromised absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia, oral iron supplements initially should be used to replenish iron stores. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond to oral iron therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia without another identified source of chronic blood loss, treatment of portal hypertension with nonselective β-blockers can be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In individuals with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastric antral vascular ectasia who have an inadequate response to iron replacement, consider endoscopic therapy with endoscopic band ligation or thermal methods such as argon plasma coagulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease, ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet to improve iron absorption. Consider oral iron supplementation based on the severity of iron deficiency and patient tolerance, followed by intravenous iron therapy if iron stores do not improve. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Deep enteroscopy performed in patients with iron-deficiency anemia suspected to have small-bowel bleeding angioectasias should be performed with a distal attachment to improve detection and facilitate treatment. Small-bowel angioectasias may be treated with ablative thermal therapies such as argon plasma coagulation or with mechanical methods such as hemostatic clips. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Endoscopic treatment of angioectasias should be accompanied with iron replacement. Medical therapy for small-bowel angioectasias should be reserved for compassionate treatment in refractory cases when iron replacement and endoscopic therapy are ineffective.

### CDC issues guidelines for prevention, detection and treatment of… [^dda8037b]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and Treatment in Infants and Preschool Children Check a positive anemia screening result by obtaining a repeat hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit test. If the tests agree and the child is not ill, a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia can be made and treatment begun. Treat presumptive iron deficiency anemia by prescribing 3 mg per kg per day of iron drops, to be administered between meals. Counsel parents or guardians about adequate diet to correct the underlying problem of low iron intake. Repeat anemia screening in four weeks. An increase in the hemoglobin concentration of 1 g per dL or more, or an increase in the hematocrit of 3 percent or more, confirms the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. If iron deficiency is confirmed, reinforce dietary counseling, continue iron treatment for two more months and then recheck hemoglobin concentration.

Reassess hemoglobin or hematocrit approximately six months after successful treatment is completed. Children Ages Five to 12 Years and Adolescent Boys Only children and adolescent boys who have a history of iron deficiency anemia, special health care needs or low iron intake should be screened for anemia. Treatment for iron deficiency anemia includes one 60-mg iron tablet each day for school-age children and two 60-mg iron tablets each day for adolescent boys. Counseling about dietary intake of iron should be carried out. Follow-up and laboratory evaluation are the same for this age group as they are for infants and preschool children. Follow-up of adolescent girls and women of childbearing age is the same as that for infants and preschool children. For a confirmed case of iron deficiency anemia, continue iron treatment for two to three more months.

If after four weeks the anemia does not respond to iron treatment despite compliance with iron supplementation and the absence of acute illness, further evaluate the anemia by using other laboratory tests, including MCV, RDW and serum ferritin concentration. In women of African, Mediterranean or Southeast Asia ancestry, mild anemia unresponsive to iron therapy may be due to thalassemia minor or sickle cell trait. Treat anemia by prescribing an oral dose of 60 to 120 mg per day of iron. Counsel about correcting iron deficiency anemia through diet. If after four weeks the anemia does not respond to iron treatment despite compliance and absence of illness, further evaluate the anemia by using other tests, including MCV, RDW and serum ferritin concentration.

### Iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease: updates on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^acf51a64]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a complication that affects a majority of individuals with advanced CKD. Although relative deficiency of erythropoietin production is the major driver of anemia in CKD, iron deficiency stands out among the mechanisms contributing to the impaired erythropoiesis in the setting of reduced kidney function. Iron deficiency plays a significant role in anemia in CKD. This may be due to a true paucity of iron stores (absolute iron deficiency) or a relative (functional) deficiency which prevents the use of available iron stores. Several risk factors contribute to absolute and functional iron deficiency in CKD, including blood losses, impaired iron absorption, and chronic inflammation. The traditional biomarkers used for the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with CKD have limitations, leading to persistent challenges in the detection and monitoring of IDA in these patients. Here, we review the pathophysiology and available diagnostic tests for IDA in CKD, we discuss the literature that has informed the current practice guidelines for the treatment of IDA in CKD, and we summarize the available oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations for the treatment of IDA in CKD. Two important issues are addressed, including the potential risks of a more liberal approach to iron supplementation as well as the potential risks and benefits of IV versus oral iron supplementation in patients with CKD.

Monitoring

Iron overload is a potential risk of IV iron therapy. Our experience suggests that IV iron therapy in IRIDA elevates ferritin levels without significantly affecting TSAT, indicating that iron is primarily stored in the reticuloendothelial system. An increase in TSAT suggests iron redistribution from the reticuloendothelial system to the circulation, signalling that the ferritin set point — the level at which iron becomes available for erythropoiesis and other (parenchymal) tissues — has been reached. While this iron redistribution improves iron availability and haemoglobin levels, it may also result in a decreased erythropoietic iron demand, potentially leading to toxic parenchymal iron overload, necessitating reduced treatment frequency.

Unlike inappropriately low‐hepcidin disorders such as HFE‐hereditary hemochromatosis, where iron accumulates in parenchymal tissues with a higher toxicity risk, IRIDA primarily results in iron overload in the reticuloendothelial macrophages. Although the long‐term effects of such iron accumulation remain unclear, patients with (loss‐of‐function) ferroportin disease, who have similar biochemical profiles, typically do not experience severe complications despite excessive high ferritin levels. Additionally, evidence from CKD patients suggests that excess reticuloendothelial iron, during at least a few years, is well tolerated.

Given the unknown long‐term risks, we recommend checking ferritin, TSAT and haemoglobin before each administration. If TSAT levels rise but the patient remains symptomatic with low haemoglobin requiring therapy, we advise reducing IV iron administration frequency. As IRIDA patients typically cannot achieve TSAT within the reference range due to hepcidin dysregulation, we recommend maintaining TSAT around 15%. In our experience, this percentage allows for sufficient iron availability for erythropoiesis without causing unnecessary excessive iron loading in the reticuloendothelial system. Importantly, the goal is not to normalize haemoglobin, as we cannot exclude that prolonged iron loading in the reticuloendothelial system may pose long‐term risks. Ferritin levels should be kept as low as possible while ensuring acceptable haemoglobin and quality of life.

### Anemia and iron deficiency in heart failure: current concepts and emerging therapies [^9ae164f6]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia and iron deficiency are important and common comorbidities that often coexist in patients with heart failure. Both conditions, together or independently, are associated with poor clinical status and worse outcomes. Whether anemia and iron deficiency are just markers of heart failure severity or whether they mediate heart failure progression and outcomes and therefore should be treated is not entirely clear. Treatment of anemia in patients with heart failure with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has been evaluated intensively during the past several years. Unfortunately, these agents did not improve outcomes but were associated with a higher risk of adverse events. Iron deficiency in patients with heart failure can be absolute, when total body iron is decreased, or functional, when total body iron is normal or increased but is inadequate to meet the needs of target tissues because of sequestration in the storage pool. Whereas iron replacement is appropriate in patients with anemia resulting from absolute iron deficiency, it has been unclear whether and how absolute or functional iron deficiency should be treated in nonanemic patients with heart failure. Recently, small studies found that administration of intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and absolute or functional iron deficiency with or without anemia improves symptoms and exercise capacity, but long-term outcomes and safety data are not yet available. In this review, we discuss the causes and pathogenesis of and treatment options for anemia and iron deficiency in patients with heart failure.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review [^e471c185]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

Objective

We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

Design

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and in main professional association websites, limited to documents published between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2014.

Results

Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or postpregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 μg/L (n = 5) or 800 μg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%.

Conclusions

It appears that for the diagnosis of ID, a cutoff of 100 μg/L for serum ferritin concentration should be considered in most conditions and 20% for TSAT, except in particular situations, including young healthy women with heavy menstrual flow. New indications of intravenous iron supplementation are emerging.

### Management of nutritional iron deficiency anemia for young children in the emergency department [^b8374807]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines for young children with nutritional iron deficiency anemia (IDA) presenting to the emergency department (ED) are lacking, leading to variability in care. We aimed to standardize management of these patients through the development and implementation of an evidence-based algorithm using quality improvement methodology.

Procedure

Baseline data of the target population (n = 42; 60% male; median age 22.5 months, median hemoglobin 5.3 g/dl) identified variability across four key measures of clinical management: laboratory evaluation, therapy choice, therapy administration, and patient disposition. Literature review and consensus from pediatric hematology providers informed a draft algorithm that was refined in an iterative multidisciplinary process. From September 2020 to June 2021, we aimed to increase IDA management per the algorithm by ≥ 20% relative to baseline for the four key outcome measures using sequential Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. Process measures focusing on provider communication/documentation and balancing measures involving efficiency and therapy-related adverse events were assessed concurrently.

Results

Thirty-five patients were evaluated among four PDSA cycles and shared similar characteristics as the baseline population. Improvements of ≥ 20% above baseline adherence levels or 100% adherence were achieved for all outcome measure across four PDSA cycles. Adherence to recommended laboratory evaluation improved from 43 (baseline) to 71%, therapy choice from 78 to 100%, therapy administration from 50 to 83%, and disposition from 85 to 100%. ED length of stay remained stable.

Conclusions

Implementation of a standardized algorithm for young children with nutritional IDA in the ED increased adherence to evidence-based patient care.

### Treating preoperative anemia to improve patient outcomes after orthopaedic surgery [^3c58d098]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

For patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, preoperative risk modification and control of comorbidities can maximize safety and improve outcomes. Anemia is common among orthopaedic patients, and its prevalence increases with patient age. Although surgeons are well versed in intraoperative blood conservation, preoperative anemia treatment is often deferred to primary care physicians, who may not understand the importance of a thorough assessment and treatment. Orthopaedic surgeons should understand the causes and treatments of anemia to advocate that patients receive appropriate preoperative care. Mean corpuscular volume and reticulocyte count can help determine the cause of anemia and assess the bone marrow's ability to produce red blood cells. These values can be used to aid in diagnosis and treatment plans. Iron deficiency anemia, the most common type, is a microcytic anemia easily treated with iron supplementation. In cases of trauma, anemia can be related to acute blood loss and underlying conditions. Fracture patterns and preexisting comorbidities should be assessed. The role of intravenous iron supplementation in this setting has not been clearly shown. Patients needing urgent procedures that might involve substantial blood loss should receive transfusions if they have hemoglobin levels < 8 g/dL or symptomatic anemia.

Treatment

Anemia is one of the manifestations of IBD that often remains undertreated. It has to be considered that IDA is already the endpoint of iron deficiency. As described above, multiple studies have shown a strong correlation between Hb levels and quality of life in patients with IBD. Therefore, IDA should be treated in every patient with IBD, for every level of anemia. The goal of treatment should be complete normalization of anemia and iron stores.

In patients with IBD and iron deficiency without anemia, there is no clear evidence of benefits of iron supplementation. Studies in patients with congestive heart failure or in patients with chronic fatigue have demonstrated an increase in QoL when iron deficiency was treated, but there are no data available for patients with IBD. Therefore, the decision to treat iron deficiency without anemia should be based on the symptoms of the individual patient.

A number of comparative studies between oral and intravenous iron supplementation have been conducted and have confirmed that GI side effects are significantly less frequent when intravenous iron is used. – More recently, two meta-analyses could confirm these results. Furthermore, intravenous iron could replenish iron storage and improve anemia faster and more efficiently than oral iron in clinical studies, as well as in a recent meta-analysis. However, the clinical significance of faster Hb level increase remains unclear as differences in QoL were not different between the intravenous and the oral treatment arm. Disease activity was also not significantly different.

The choice of front-line therapy varies between continents. While intravenous iron is considered the standard treatment in patients with IBD (with active disease) in Europe, oral iron remains the first-line treatment in the US. Some authors propose intravenous administration as the preferred route for all patients with IBD (e.g. Gasche and colleagues), while other authors point out that both routes can be efficient and safe to use, especially when considering the facts that GI side effects to oral iron may be dose dependentand that newer oral formulations might minimize these effects.

Taking together all the evidence today and in line with current international guidelines, oral iron is sufficient in some situations but intravenous iron should be preferred in other specific clinical situations depending, for example, on side effects to oral iron, disease activity and level of anemia. The recommended algorithm for the treatment of IDA in patients with IBD is summarized in Figure 1 in section 'Summary'.

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre (Figure 2). These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

FIGURE 2
Course of haemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients. The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3); the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels. Case 1: Hb and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow up. At age 26 (6 years post‐diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range. Case 2: Hb and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32‐year‐old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non‐pregnancy periods. Case 3: Hb, CRP and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (totalling 5800 mg FS at 200 mg/dose) was administered every 2 months, maintaining ferritin > 500 μg/L for nearly a decade, with Hb within the reference range. Diagnosis of IRIDA was made at t = 5 when she was 41 years old. Ferritin and TSAT varied widely, likely due to chronic inflammation (CRP ~25 mg/L). In the final years (following t = 15), heavy menstrual bleeding led to a Hb decline, requiring additional IV iron therapy (totalling 1700 mg FCM).

Treatment of IDA

17. We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

18. We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

19. Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

20. We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

21. We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see text), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

22. There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see text), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality-low, consensus-92%, statement strength-weak).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes. An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

### Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy-opportunities to optimize perinatal health and health equity [^dff477e2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Third, oral iron is well-established as a safe and effective treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Because of the lack of studies of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in a screen-detected population, the USPSTF, focused primarily on supplementation doses, with most included studies using doses between 20 and 50 mg of elemental iron. Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy, and the increased iron requirements, these doses are likely insufficient for adequate treatment and resulted in the lack of benefit observed. Future studies should evaluate the outcomes of iron supplementation in 3 distinct groups: participants who are iron replete, participants who are iron deficient without anemia, and participants with iron deficiency anemia. We recommend that future guidelines focused on the management of iron deficiency in pregnancy should include literature that differentiates between supplementation for prevention and treatment for diagnosed iron deficiency. In addition, future reviews should distinguish between supplemental and treatment doses of oral and intravenous iron and their impacts on outcomes. Guidance on appropriate supplementation (including formulation, dosage, and timing) is also necessary due to the lack of consensus and the variability in dosing strategies found in the literature.

As the rates of iron deficiency during pregnancy increase, so too may pregnancy morbidity. Given these significant implications for public health, it is critical to conduct additional studies to examine the advantages and disadvantages of screening for and treating subclinical iron deficiency. To harmonize future study findings, it is important to standardize the diagnostic cutoff values for iron deficiency across different populations and settings and clearly differentiate between indications for supplementation vs treatment. This will also help improve the identification and treatment of at-risk individuals, address disparities in care, and ultimately mitigate adverse pregnancy and offspring outcomes.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^72338ce7]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: all patients with IBD are at risk for anemia. For laboratory screening, a complete blood count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein should be used. For patients in remission or mild disease, measurements are suggested every 6–12 months, and in active disease it is suggested to repeat screening every 3 months. In the presence of iron deficiency, iron supplementation is advised; intravenous iron is considered more effective and often better tolerated than oral iron, oral iron repletion is reasonable in mild anemia or clinically inactive disease, and dosing is based on baseline hemoglobin and body weight.
