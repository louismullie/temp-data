## Question

Enterococcus faecium uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing Enterococcus faecium urinary tract infections, including how to distinguish colonization from true infection, select therapy based on susceptibility patterns, and outline special scenarios and stewardship principles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how to define a true UTI versus asymptomatic bacteriuria. Then, I should verify the microbiology and resistance patterns that drive therapy. Next, I will review first-line and alternative agents for vancomycin-susceptible versus vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, including dosing and pharmacokinetic considerations. After that, I need to consider special populations and source control. Finally, I will integrate duration, monitoring, and stewardship checkpoints to ensure safe, effective care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and diagnostic thresholds, because overtreatment of colonization is common with enterococci. True UTI requires compatible urinary symptoms or systemic features, and pyuria alone is insufficient to distinguish UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria; colony counts of at least 10⁵ CFU/mL increase the likelihood of UTI, but specificity remains limited, so I should correlate with symptoms and risk factors before treating [^840f291c]. Hold on, I should verify that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures; otherwise, treatment does not improve outcomes and may promote resistance, so I need to ensure I am not inadvertently treating colonization [^7f372088].

> Next, I should review the microbiology and resistance patterns that shape therapy. E. faecium has higher intrinsic and acquired resistance than E. faecalis, with frequent ampicillin resistance and a high prevalence of vancomycin resistance in many regions, which explains why vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium is often treated with ampicillin when active, whereas vancomycin-resistant E. faecium requires linezolid or daptomycin [^1644dda3] [^85afa494]. Wait, let me verify the vancomycin resistance burden; contemporary data indicate roughly 70–80% of E. faecium isolates are vancomycin-resistant in some settings, reinforcing the need to tailor therapy to susceptibilities and local epidemiology [^aeac151a].

> For vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium, I should confirm that ampicillin remains first-line if the isolate is susceptible, typically at high doses such as 2 g IV every 4–6 hours, with consideration of combination therapy with an aminoglycoside for severe infections when synergy is appropriate and high-level aminoglycoside resistance is absent. Vancomycin is an alternative when ampicillin cannot be used, though it is less active than ampicillin against E. faecium and should be reserved for specific contexts [^726a3cfa] [^85afa494]. Hold on, I should verify that routine combination therapy is not required for uncomplicated lower UTIs; synergy is generally reserved for severe infections or endovascular involvement, not simple cystitis.

> For vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, I need to ensure I select agents with reliable activity and adequate urinary exposure. Linezolid 600 mg IV or orally every 12 hours is a standard option with strong activity against VRE, but I should monitor for myelosuppression and serotonin toxicity, and I must remember that the FDA-labeled duration for enterococcal infections is 14–28 days, which is longer than typical UTI courses, so I should align duration with clinical syndrome and source control rather than defaulting to the label [^c83a1964] [^6e3b10a8]. Daptomycin is bactericidal and achieves meaningful urinary excretion, with CLSI recommending higher doses of 8–12 mg/kg/day for E. faecium given the susceptible-dose dependent breakpoint; I should confirm renal function and adjust frequency if clearance is impaired, and consider ID consultation for dosing and monitoring [^3b05de4a] [^a083c0a6]. But wait, what if daptomycin is not suitable or resistance emerges? Tigecycline has in vitro activity but poor urinary concentrations and is not preferred for UTIs, and quinupristin-dalfopristin is inactive against E. faecalis and has limited E. faecium data, so I should avoid these for UTI unless no alternatives exist and the clinical scenario justifies the risk [^85afa494].

> I should double-check oral options for lower-tract disease when IV therapy is not required. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin can be effective for cystitis if the isolate is susceptible, but activity against E. faecium is less predictable than against E. faecalis; nitrofurantoin is generally not reliable for E. faecium given frequent resistance, whereas fosfomycin may have activity in some isolates but lacks robust E. faecium data, so I should reserve these for carefully selected cases with documented susceptibility and avoid use in pyelonephritis due to inadequate tissue levels [^6ae1a601] [^868445cc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought fosfomycin might be broadly active against E. faecium, but I should correct that assumption; in vitro data suggest possible activity, yet clinical evidence is limited and resistance mechanisms like FosA can emerge, so I need to ensure susceptibility before relying on it [^6ae1a601] [^10879d18].

> Special populations require tailored choices, so let me consider a few. In pregnancy, daptomycin has supportive case-level evidence for VRE pyelonephritis with favorable maternal-fetal outcomes, and its pregnancy category B profile makes it a reasonable option when standard oral agents are unsuitable; I should coordinate with obstetrics and monitor closely [^e4c2989d]. In pediatrics, ampicillin remains first-line for susceptible E. faecium, with linezolid or daptomycin reserved for VRE; durations are typically 10–14 days total, with early IV-to-oral switch when stable and active oral options are available, and I should involve pediatric infectious diseases for complex cases [^ca0d435c]. For patients with severe renal impairment, I need to adjust daptomycin frequency rather than dose, and consider that linezolid does not require renal adjustment, though hematologic monitoring remains essential [^a083c0a6] [^c83a1964].

> Source control is critical and I should not overlook it. Indwelling catheters should be removed or replaced when feasible, obstructive uropathy must be relieved, and abscesses or collections require drainage; these measures materially improve the likelihood of microbiologic cure and reduce recurrence, so I should prioritize them alongside antibiotics [^4dd55ae8]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent bacteriuria despite appropriate therapy often signals inadequate source control or biofilm-related tolerance, prompting reassessment of devices and anatomy rather than simply escalating antibiotics [^6ca5d678].

> Duration should be syndrome-specific and anchored to clinical response. For uncomplicated cystitis due to E. faecium, 7–10 days is reasonable if an active oral agent is used, whereas complicated UTI or pyelonephritis generally warrants 10–14 days, and if bacteremia is present, 14–28 days is typical depending on source control and clinical trajectory. I should count duration from the first day of effective therapy and extend if response is slow or source control is delayed [^cecdd4d0] [^0b65ff30]. I need to ensure I do not conflate the linezolid label duration for enterococcal infections with UTI syndromes; while the label supports 14–28 days for enterococcal infections, many UTIs resolve with shorter courses when appropriately managed, so I should individualize based on syndrome and response [^c83a1964].

> Monitoring and follow-up should be pragmatic. I should obtain repeat urine cultures about 48–72 hours after initiating therapy if the patient is not improving as expected, and at the end of therapy for complicated cases or when treating VRE. I should also track symptoms, fever curve, and renal function, and monitor for adverse effects such as CPK with daptomycin and hematologic toxicity with linezolid [^a083c0a6] [^c83a1964]. If the patient deteriorates or bacteriuria persists despite appropriate therapy, I should reconsider the diagnosis, look for unrecognized obstruction or biofilm, and repeat susceptibilities if the clinical course is atypical [^6ca5d678].

> Finally, I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship principles are embedded throughout. That means avoiding treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, de-escalating to the narrowest active agent once susceptibilities return, and reassessing the need for ongoing therapy every 48–72 hours. I should also engage infection control for VRE colonization or outbreaks and document the indication for antibiotics clearly to support appropriate use [^7f372088] [^72779681]. Hold on, I should verify that overtreatment of enterococcal bacteriuria is a recognized driver of resistance and costs; indeed, studies show frequent misclassification and unnecessary vancomycin or fluoroquinolone use, underscoring the need for disciplined diagnostic reasoning and stewardship [^840f291c].

Enterococcus faecium UTIs are **best managed with pathogen-directed therapy** based on culture and susceptibility results [^a57efdd4]. For **vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium**, ampicillin is first-line; for **vancomycin-resistant E. faecium**, linezolid or daptomycin are preferred [^726a3cfa] [^3b05de4a]. Nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin are options for **uncomplicated cystitis** if susceptible, but not for pyelonephritis or complicated infections [^6ae1a601] [^868445cc]. Remove indwelling devices and address urinary obstruction to improve outcomes [^4dd55ae8]. Treat for 7–14 days depending on severity and response, and monitor for adverse effects, especially with linezolid or daptomycin [^cecdd4d0] [^c83a1964].

---

## Clinical significance and epidemiology

E. faecium is a **common cause of healthcare-associated UTIs**, particularly in patients with indwelling urinary catheters, diabetes, or immunocompromised states [^6f0b5b02] [^7afb34b9]. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) is a major concern due to limited therapeutic options and increased morbidity and mortality [^aee57661] [^4478f1bb].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate diagnosis relies on **urine culture with susceptibility testing** to distinguish E. faecium from other enterococci and to determine antimicrobial resistance patterns [^c0de247a]. Clinical correlation is essential to differentiate colonization from true infection, especially in catheterized patients [^840f291c].

---

## Antibiotic resistance patterns

E. faecium exhibits **intrinsic and acquired resistance** to multiple antibiotics, including:

- **Beta-lactams**: Intrinsic resistance due to low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins; ampicillin resistance is common [^c0de247a].
- **Vancomycin**: Resistance mediated by vanA or vanB genes, leading to VREfm [^1644dda3].
- **Aminoglycosides**: High-level resistance is common, limiting synergistic combinations [^85afa494].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Increasing resistance limits utility [^notfound].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment should be guided by **culture and susceptibility results**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ampicillin | Vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium | 2 g IV every 4–6 hours | First-line agent [^7ea12323] |
| Vancomycin | Vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium | 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours | Alternative to ampicillin [^7ea12323] |
| Linezolid | Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium | 600 mg IV/PO every 12 hours | Preferred agent; monitor for myelosuppression and serotonin syndrome [^c83a1964] [^6e3b10a8] |
| Daptomycin | Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium | 8–12 mg/kg IV daily | Bactericidal; monitor for muscle toxicity [^3b05de4a] [^a083c0a6] |
| Nitrofurantoin | Uncomplicated cystitis | 100 mg PO every 12 hours for 7 days | Use only if susceptible; not for pyelonephritis [^6ae1a601] [^868445cc] |
| Fosfomycin | Uncomplicated cystitis | 3 g PO single dose | Alternative for susceptible strains; not for complicated infections [^6ae1a601] [^868445cc] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence

Clinical outcomes depend on **severity of infection**, patient comorbidities, and adherence to therapy. Recurrence is common, particularly in patients with indwelling catheters or structural abnormalities [^6ca5d678]. Mortality is higher in VREfm infections compared to vancomycin-susceptible strains [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines; consider daptomycin or nitrofurantoin if susceptible [^e4c2989d].
- **Pediatric patients**: Ampicillin is first-line; linezolid or daptomycin for resistant strains [^ca0d435c].
- **Catheter-associated infections**: Device removal or exchange is critical for cure [^4dd55ae8].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **infection control measures**, including:

- Strict adherence to hand hygiene and aseptic technique [^72779681].
- Limiting indwelling catheter use and prompt removal when no longer indicated [^72779681].
- Antibiotic stewardship to prevent resistance [^72779681].

---

Enterococcus faecium UTIs require **pathogen-directed therapy** based on susceptibility results, with ampicillin for susceptible strains and linezolid or daptomycin for resistant strains. Device management and source control are essential, and treatment duration should be tailored to clinical response and severity [^a57efdd4].

Discussion

The data in this case series show daptomycin to be a safe and effective therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs. Limitations of the present study include the fact that this is a retrospective case series with a small number of patients and clinical records that are often limited and variable. Furthermore, because of the paucity of data in the literature, it is unclear what the most appropriate daptomycin dose is for the treatment of VRE UTIs. Nevertheless, it is clear that VRE are increasingly involved in nosocomial infections. Of concern, VRE may transfer vancomycin resistance to other bacterial species, including S. aureus. Uncontrolled dissemination of VRE infections within health care institutions has been facilitated by incautious contact with contaminated medical equipment and surfaces, colonized health care personnel, and infected patients. For example, the spread of a strain of linezolid-resistant VRE has been reported in one zone of a transplantation unit despite extensive precautions.

Another major factor that has led to the spread of VRE infection is poor infection control techniques that rely on cephalosporins and other antibacterials inactive against enterococci. A recent report found that more than 30% of all clinical isolates of Enterococcus were resistant to vancomycin, including more than 90% of E. faecium isolates. For these reasons, appropriate antibiotic susceptibility testing is a mainstay of good clinical practice to limit the spread of multidrug-resistant strains, and agents that have specific activity against these strains must be used to eradicate these difficult-to-treat infections.

The urinary tract is one of the main portals for entry of VRE, so it is hardly surprising that the urinary tract is a major site of infection. Management of VRE UTIs usually requires correction of any factors contributing to the infection. Catheter removal, obstruction relief, abscess drainage, and initiation of antimicrobial therapy are all initial steps taken in clinical practice.

### Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options [^1215154d]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.

### Linezolid bladder irrigation as adjunctive treatment for a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^aa6297f1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the first reported successful use of adjunctive linezolid bladder irrigation.

Case Summary

An 89-year-old woman with 10% TBSA burns developed septic shock and anuric acute kidney insufficiency. She acquired a urinary tract infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm). Based on clinical status, a linezolid bladder irrigation was initiated in addition to high-dose intravenous linezolid and demonstrated microbiological cure with 7 days of treatment.

Discussion

Linezolid is primarily hepatically cleared and has no labeled indication for urinary tract infections. Anuria adds an additional complication of potentially reduced urinary drug concentrations. Bladder irrigation offers the benefit of achieving high local drug concentrations, but there are no data regarding such a route for linezolid. This case report is the first demonstrating the use, stability, safety, and efficacy of linezolid as a continuous bladder irrigation.

Conclusions

Linezolid use as a bladder irrigation may be a feasible route of administration in anuric, critically ill patients with VREfm and few antimicrobial options. Further studies are warranted.

### Evaluation of the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections in a large academic medical center [^fd16921d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a common cause of nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTIs) among hospitalized patients. Clinicians need to differentiate between VRE-associated urinary colonization, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and UTIs to determine the need for treatment and length of therapy.

Objective

To characterize the diagnosis and management of VRE from urinary sources, including compliance with institutional treatment guidelines, and identify risk factors associated with clinical failure.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, single-center, cohort study among patients with VRE-positive cultures from urinary sources over a 3-year study period (July 2008-September 2011). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate demographics, diagnostics, guideline compliance, pharmacotherapy, and outcomes. Risk factors associated with clinical failure were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

Two hundred sixty-nine distinct episodes of VRE met inclusion criteria among 252 patients. Forty-seven percent and 77% of episodes occurred in patients admitted to an intensive care unit and hospitalized for 7 or more days, respectively. Fifty-eight percent of the episodes were classified as asymptomatic bacteriuria or colonization. Compliance with institutional treatment guidelines for the appropriate drug, dose, and duration occurred in approximately 70% of the cases. Among noncompliant cases (n = 83), 48 (58%) were overtreated, and 35 (42%) were undertreated. Clinical failure among all cases was common, including mortality (17.1%). Factors independently associated with clinical failure determined on multivariate analysis included weight 100 kg or more (OR 5.30; 95% CI 1.42–12.21; p = 0.014), renal disease (OR 2.57; 95% CI 1.02–6.47; p = 0.048), indwelling catheter (OR 4.62; 95% CI 1.05–18.24; p = 0.046), and VRE bloodstream infection (OR 15.71; 95% CI 2.9–128.7; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Improved education is needed to minimize cases of overtreatment and undertreatment of VRE-associated UTIs and decrease inappropriate drug-related costs and clinical failure rates. Risk factors for clinical failure can be used to risk stratify VRE-associated UTIs and further guide treatment decisions.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^66cc1bbf]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

In this case series, patients with VRE UTIs were treated with daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that has rapid bactericidal activity against a variety of Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin acts by binding to bacterial cell membranes and inducing rapid depolarization, which inhibits DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and leads to cell death. In the 10 cases described here, daptomycin was chosen as the treatment option because of its efficacy profile, sensitivity testing, and low resistance rates for both major species of Enterococcus.

Another important consideration when appropriate treatment for VRE UTI is chosen is the presence of intact drug at the site of infection. Daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidney; approximately 52% is excreted unchanged into the urine after intravenous administration. Other agents active against VRE, such as linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline, have a lower fraction of urinary excretion, which may potentially limit their effectiveness in the management of VRE UTIs.

Most strains of VRE are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin, although higher-dose ampicillin, doxycycline, and nitrofurantoin remain viable treatment options. More often, drug choices used to treat VRE include daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline. These compounds have similarly low MIC values against VRE species. All these antibiotics except daptomycin exhibit bacteriostatic properties; daptomycin is bactericidal. Daptomycin has similar MIC values for E. faecium and E. faecalis and is effective in treating either pathogen. Daptomycin resistance among VRE strains remains rare; numerous global surveillance studies have demonstrated higher susceptibility levels in VRE strains using daptomycin than in strains using linezolid or quinupristin–dalfopristin. Resistance to linezolid among VRE isolates has been well described and is of increasing clinical concern. Quinupristin–dalfopristin has limited activity against E. faecalis. In addition, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains have shown emerging resistance to quinupristin–dalfopristin; 3.4% of urinary tract isolates were resistant in a study at 28 medical centers in the United States. Use of quinupristin–dalfopristin is also limited by its potential systemic and infusion site–related adverse effects, including myalgia and arthralgia.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^6f0b5b02]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States, the Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus accounts for 12% of all cases of hospital-acquired infection and is most often implicated in urinary tract infections (UTIs). Recent data show that approximately 33% of all clinical enterococcal isolates in the United States are vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In North America, VRE are mainly derived from the species Enterococcus faecium (92.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.7%). In the past decade, VRE have become increasingly involved in nosocomial infections in the United States, which has resulted in excessive morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Nearly 10% of all urinary enterococcal isolates in the United States are VRE; most of these are also E. faecium (88.4%).

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^f7ffe150]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the current case series, daptomycin was shown to be a safe and effective therapeutic option in the management of VRE UTIs. Because of the increasing prevalence of VRE infection and the limited treatment options available, we anticipate that management of VRE UTIs will continue to be challenging for the clinician. Based on our experience, we believe that daptomycin is a valuable treatment option for problematic UTIs. These findings must be confirmed in larger randomized clinical trials. However, despite the lack of data about therapeutic options for VRE UTIs and the intrinsic limitations of descriptive case reports, our positive experience with daptomycin may be of value to the clinical community.

### Interpretable machine learning-based decision support for prediction of antibiotic resistance for complicated urinary tract infections [^d6f2f39c]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent years have seen rapid increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which is threatening the efficacy of many antibiotic therapies, and ultimately leading to treatment failure –. Although new drugs are urgently needed, new antibiotic development is restricted by costs, limited government support, and regulatory requirements. For instance, as of 2019, major pharmaceutical corporations, commonly known as "big pharma", were progressively divesting themselves of antibiotic research and development (R&D) assets. This shift restricts the opportunities available to smaller companies and their investors, leading to heightened financial constraints and a lack of infrastructure for antibiotic R&D.

Furthermore, antibiotic resistance leads to increased reliance on broad-spectrum therapies, which select for further resistance, exacerbating the issue at hand. To avoid these risks, it is critical for clinicians to accurately align available antibiotic therapies with the precise susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens. Ideally, this alignment should occur when initiating empirical treatment, even before culture results are obtained (which might take several days to be available). In this study, we present interpretable machine learning (ML)-based methods for predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which decreases the risk of non-susceptible and therefore, ineffective treatment, and facilitates rapid effective clinical intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these systems for urinary tract infections (UTIs), where the problem of antibiotic resistance is of particular importance.

UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide, affecting more than 150 million people each year. The pathogens that cause UTIs, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, can be carried asymptomatically and thus, are frequently exposed to antibiotics, including those intended for other infections. This exposure, combined with high recurrence rates, often results in multidrug-resistant strains, with resistance rates of over 20% for commonly used drugs. As treatment-outcome is associated with the infecting pathogen's susceptibilities, clinicians are faced with the challenging task of correctly prescribing patients with the most appropriate antibiotics. However, to offer rapid intervention, treatment is commonly administered empirically, lacking insight into the specific antibiotics that the infecting pathogen may be susceptible to. This scenario adds to the potential of choosing an inadequate treatment regimen.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^91e8a31e]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Our experience confirms and extends the findings of a previous case series on the use of daptomycin for the treatment of VRE UTIs. The previous study of 5 hospitalized patients with indwelling catheters and VRE UTIs who received 5-day courses of daptomycin showed that all patients achieved complete eradication of infection at daptomycin doses of 1.4 to 3.7 mg/kg daily. Taken together, these case studies emphasize the importance of further analyses to delineate the appropriate doses of daptomycin for the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^cd8ef029]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^db6409bf]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Because VRE, particularly E. faecium strains, exhibit resistance to many antimicrobials traditionally used to target vancomycin-susceptible isolates, the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs remains a challenge for the clinician. Indeed, no drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs, and reliable clinical data about the optimal management of VRE UTIs are lacking in the scientific literature. Among the therapeutic options to be considered are those that have demonstrated activity against VRE in vitro, including older agents such as doxycycline, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin and newer agents such as daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline.

Daptomycin is a bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide approved by the FDA for the management of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible isolates of a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and for the management of bacteremia, including that associated with right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus. Although the approved use of daptomycin in enterococcal infections is limited to the treatment of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by vancomycin-susceptible isolates of E. faecalis, 100% and 99.7% of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively, were susceptible to daptomycin in more than 700 nonurinary VRE strains collected in the United States between 2007 and 2008. The daptomycin minimal inhibitory concentration required for 90% inhibition (MIC 90) of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis was determined to be 1 μg/mL, whereas that for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was 2 μg/mL. The use of daptomycin is a particularly promising pharmacotherapeutic approach against VRE UTIs because 50% to 70% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine 24 hours after intravenous administration compared with 30% to 40% for linezolid, 15% to 19% for quinupristin–dalfopristin, and 20% to 30% for tigecycline. Moreover, another case series has described the successful use of daptomycin in patients with VRE UTIs.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^dffd6966]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^e56f26e9]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

In light of the scarcity of treatment options for VRE UTI and clinical data related to daptomycin use in this setting, the purpose of this report is to describe the clinical experience with daptomycin as part of the management of VRE UTIs in our acute care hospital. Our objective is to offer further evidence supporting daptomycin as a viable approach to managing a continuing therapeutic challenge.

### Urinary tract infection in children and the potential role of pivmecillinam as a treatment option [^600be8ca]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

We investigated the potential role of pivmecillinam in the treatment of urinary tract infections in children. Among 351 children (0–6 years) with urinary tract infections, 83% could be treated with pivmecillinam following urine culture. Resistance was highest in infants (0–3 months) caused by the high prevalence of Enterococcus faecalis. This result emphasizes the necessity for developing a pediatric oral form of pivmecillinam.

### Gut uropathogen abundance is a risk factor for development of bacteriuria and urinary tract infection [^0f485652]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Our study also investigated antibiotic usage associated with increased fecal Escherichia and Enterococcus abundances. We found that beta-lactams increased the risk for development of greater than 1% relative gut abundance of Enterococcus. Enterococcus, particularly Enterococcus faecium, is inherently resistant to many antibiotics in this class, allowing expansion of Enterococcus in the setting of the depletion of other gut bacteria by these antibiotics. Our current data support the notion that antibiotics can alter the gut microbiota and increase abundances of pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Recent studies have reported that these dysbiotic states with pathogenic bacteria can lead to infectious complications beyond C. difficile infection. Taur et al. investigated the gut microbiome profiles of 94 bone marrow transplant recipients and reported that elevated gut Enterococcus abundances were associated with future development of Enterococcus bacteremia and that elevated gut Proteobacteria abundances were associated with future development of Proteobacteria bacteremia. In a study of 28 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, Montassier et al. reported that gut microbial diversity was a predictor of future development of bloodstream infections.

The gut microbiota's relationship with bacteriuria development highlights a potential for novel gut microbiota-focused treatments. There are case reports that supports the notion that FMT could be a potential treatment for recurrent UTIs. In a case report of a heart and kidney transplant recipient who developed multiple events of Enterococcus bacteremia and UTIs as well as recurrent C. difficile infections, FMT decreased the fecal abundance of Enterococcus in the gut and led to resolution of Enterococcus infections in the subject for up to 14 months. In a case series of FMT for recurrent C. difficile infections in a non-transplant population, the number of UTIs in the year after FMT was significantly lower than the number of UTIs in the year prior to FMT. In this case series, however, the fecal microbiome was not profiled prior to and after FMT.

### Urinary tract infections in cystic fibrosis patients [^5149ac8b]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Improved understanding of non-respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients will be vital to sustaining the increased life span of these patients. To date, there has not been a published report of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in CF patients. We performed a retrospective chart review at a major academic medical center during 2010–2020 to determine the features of UTIs in 826 CF patients. We identified 108 UTI episodes during this period. Diabetes, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), and nephrolithiasis were correlated with increased risk of UTIs. UTIs in CF patients were less likely to be caused by Gram-negative rods compared to non-CF patients and more likely to be caused by Enterococcus faecalis. The unique features of UTIs in CF patients highlight the importance of investigating non-respiratory infections to ensure appropriate treatment.

### Nosocomial urinary tract infections due to Enterococcus… [^68b21553]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- From 1975 through 1984, 473 cases of enterococcal nosocomial urinary tract infection were identified by prospective hospital-wide surveillance at the University of Virginia Hospital, Charlottesville. The rate of infection increased progressively from 12. 3 to
32. 2 cases per 10 000 patient discharges, and the proportion of nosocomial UTIs due to this organism increased from 6% to 16%. During the study period, crude mortality was 15%. Patients with the diagnosis of neurogenic bladder accounted for 26% of cases and had a crude mortality of 7. 3%; all other cases had a crude mortality of
18. 1% Risk factors associated with fatal outcome in cases having a nosocomial enterococcal UTI included age of more than 50 years, concurrent acute respiratory failure, hospitalization on the internal medicine service, and concurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Enterococcus is the second most frequent cause of nosocomial UTI in our hospital.

The emergence of this pathogen may reflect, in part, its selective advantage imparted by resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics. Morrison AJ, Wenzel RP. Nosocomial Urinary Tract Infections due to Enterococcus: Ten Years' Experience at a University Hospital. Arch Intern Med. 1986; 146: 1549–1551.

XERAVA is a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of complicated intra‑abdominal infections in patients 18 years of age and older. (1.1)

Limitations of Use XERAVA is not indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). (1.1)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XERAVA and other antibacterial drugs, XERAVA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. (1.2)

1.1 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections

XERAVA is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra‑abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus group, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides species, and Parabacteroides distasonis in patients 18 years or older [see Microbiology (12.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Limitations of Use

XERAVA is not indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.2 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XERAVA and other antibacterial drugs, XERAVA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^7f372088]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in healthy nonpregnant women — screening and treatment recommendation: In healthy premenopausal, nonpregnant women or healthy postmenopausal women, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). The prevalence of ASB in healthy, premenopausal women ranges from 1% to 5%, and in healthy postmenopausal women in the community from 2.8% to 8.6%. While symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs significantly more frequently in women with bacteriuria than in nonbacteriuric women, observational studies report no differences in rates of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, serum creatinine levels, abnormal intravenous pyelogram findings, or mortality in women with or without bacteriuria. Randomized data show there were no differences in the frequency of subsequent UTI during 1 year of follow-up after a 1-week course of nitrofurantoin versus placebo. Prior guideline conclusions were that healthy, premenopausal women with ASB have an increased risk for UTI, but no long-term adverse outcomes, and that treatment of ASB neither decreases the frequency of symptomatic infection nor prevents further episodes of ASB; similarly, the US Preventive Services Task Force stated that evidence does not support screening of nonpregnant women or men for ASB, as improved clinical outcomes cannot be demonstrated. A systematic review concluded antimicrobial treatment of ASB may improve short-term microbiologic outcomes, but resolution is not sustained and there is no measurable improvement in morbidity or mortality. Additional studies reported that during 15 months of follow-up there was no difference in symptomatic UTI and that ASB was not a predictor for symptomatic UTI, while a randomized trial found antimicrobial therapy was an independent risk factor for symptomatic UTI (hazard ratio, 3.09 [95% CI, 2.19–4.20]) with 1 episode of pyelonephritis in the untreated group and 2 in the treated group, noting a high proportion (33%) of Enterococcus species and that symptomatic episodes were not confirmed microbiologically.

### Optimising genomic approaches for identifying vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium transmission in healthcare settings [^aee57661]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Enterococcus faecium comprises part of the normal gastrointestinal tract flora in humans, but in recent years, has become an increasingly important healthcare-associated pathogen, causing a range of infections, including bloodstream and urinary tract infections –. Enterococcus faecium is particularly difficult to treat due to intrinsic resistance to a range of antibiotics, and although vancomycin was once the treatment of choice for E. faecium, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium is now common in many countries. Consequently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) listed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) as a "high priority" in its recent list of priority bacterial pathogens due to the limited treatment options available.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) allows high-resolution investigation of pathogen outbreaks and transmission networks, facilitating accurate targeting of infection control interventions and consequently reducing the number of infections. Conventional genomic approaches for determining genetic relatedness and transmission links include multilocus sequence type (MLST) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances, generated from core genome alignments usually using recombination masking. However, these methods are not optimal for highly recombinogenic and very genetically diverse species, such as E. faecium, and may result in isolates being labelled as more closely/less closely related than they actually are. More recently, alternative approaches such as core genome MLST (cgMLST) and kmer-based methods (genomic data broken down into smaller pieces of known size k) have been developed to deal with some of the pitfalls of the conventional approaches. In all approaches, genomic data are combined with epidemiological information for a more accurate determination of transmission links and outbreak status.

### Biofilm-associated infection by enterococci [^6ca5d678]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Enterococci are ubiquitous members of the human gut microbiota and frequent causes of biofilm-associated opportunistic infections. Enterococci cause 25% of all catheter-associated urinary tract infections, are frequently isolated in wounds and are increasingly found in infective endocarditis, and all of these infections are associated with biofilms. Enterococcal biofilms are intrinsically tolerant to antimicrobials and thus are a serious impediment for treating infections. In this Review, we describe the spatiotemporal development of enterococcal biofilms and the factors that promote or inhibit biofilm formation. We discuss how the environment, including the host and other co-colonizing microorganisms, affects biofilm development. Finally, we provide an overview of current and future interventions to limit enterococcal biofilm-associated infections. Overall, enterococcal biofilms remain a pressing clinical problem, and there is an urgent need to better understand their development and persistence and to identify novel treatments.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^2ee308e5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with severe clinical presentation with sepsis features and no previous risk factors for resistance, E. coli is the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. Treatment with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins is recommended in moderately unwell children. If a child is severely unwell with sepsis potentially of urinary origin, local sepsis guidelines should be followed, considering the individual child's risk and/or history of resistance and whether it is hospital-acquired. There is occasionally a case for using empirical carbapenems in children with cUTI, for example, in a child with sepsis and a history of highly resistant organisms. This should be in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist to tailor empirical treatment and switch, when possible, with susceptibility.

For nephronia/renal abscess, E. coli is the most common pathogen, but urine culture is frequently negative. Since urine culture may not identify the organism or its susceptibility, if progress is poor, penicillin/ampicillin may be added to cover Enterococcus spp. Early consultation with infectious diseases and urology is also recommended in case abscess drainage is needed. In specific clinical circumstances, S. aureus (including MRSA), C. albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may cause renal abscess.

Children with nonurologic underlying conditions have different risks of unusual organisms and resistance depending on hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. In children postrenal transplant, especially with urological abnormalities, there is a greater likelihood of Enterococcus spp. S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. In immunocompromised patients, in addition to Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa, less virulent organisms such as CoNS, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococcus may cause cUTI. Fungal infections and viruses, for example, adenovirus, can also infect the urinary tract. Choice of antibiotic in chronic renal impairment, immunocompromise or other chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), therefore, depends on likely pathogens and risk of antibiotic resistance based on past antibiotic use and hospitalization. Mild acute or chronic renal impairment does not preclude use of aminoglycosides, which are generally well tolerated in children with renal dosing adjustment. Blood levels should be monitored closely. In moderate/severe renal failure, aminoglycosides should be used only when there is no alternative, as there is a higher risk of accumulation and an unknown risk to hearing.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^481e61eb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to highlight the variability in limit of detection (LOD) for each of the assays in Table 3, which range from 100 to 10,000 CFU/mL equivalent. The assay's LOD (and availability of relative quantitation) is an important feature when determining the best use case for these assays, across patient populations. For instance, detection of low-level microorganisms (below 10⁴ CFU/mL) may be appropriate for patients who are clearly symptomatic with negative standard cultures, but inappropriate for patients as a first line for uncomplicated UTI, due to the risk of clinically false-positive results.

Antimicrobial resistance gene targets are included in most assays. These range from standard detection of mecA, vanA, and vanB to detection of multiple Gram-negative beta-lactamases, such as bla CTX-M and the carbapenemase genes bla KPC, bla NDM, bla VIM, bla IMP, and bla OXA-48. Detection of these antimicrobial resistance genes, which are highly applicable to bloodstream infections, are unstudied in urine specimens. S. aureus only rarely causes true uncomplicated UTI, and treatment is generally doxycycline or trimethoprim, both of which maintain high rates of susceptibility among methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). However, S. aureus detection in the urine may indicate a disseminated infection or complicated UTI, in which case, knowledge of mecA is of value to determine vancomycin use. In contrast, UTI caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) are often treated with nitrofurantoin or doxycycline, both of which are high level of activity against VRE, or aminopenicillins, which retain clinical activity for uncomplicated UTI, despite MICs above the susceptible breakpoint. In this case, knowledge of vanA / vanB status may provide little clinical benefit. For Gram-negative infections, knowledge of CTX-M may not be value-added for uncomplicated UTI, but provides direction to treatment of cUTI, and pyelonephritis. As such, detection of additional targets for antimicrobial resistance outside those used in blood culture molecular tests would be of value for assays targeting urine specimens, as is planned by some tests in development (e.g. Unyvero UTI Panel, Curetis GmbH, Holzgerlingen, Germany; PathoKey UTI ID&AMR, Vela Diagnostics, Fairfield, New Jersey; and the Vivalytic UTI Test, Randox, Crumlin, UK). These assays include resistance markers for antimicrobial agents commonly used for treatment of UTI, such as sulfonamides (sul1) and/or fluoroquinolones (qnrB, qnrS). The prediction of resistance to these agents by evaluating a limited number of resistance gene targets is unclear, although it is likely to vary regionally, as the prevalence of these markers may vary by geography. For example, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance may be due to dfrA and fluoroquinolone resistance is most commonly due to mutation to DNA gyrase, rather than the qnr plasmid-mediated mechanisms targeted by these assays.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^c9885831]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 3.3 — CRE infections outside the urinary tract that are not carbapenemase producing: For isolates that exhibit susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem (ie, MICs ≤ 1 μg/mL) but are not susceptible to ertapenem (ie, MICs ≥ 1 μg/mL), the use of extended-infusion meropenem (or imipenem-cilastatin) is suggested; if such isolates do not exhibit susceptibility to any carbapenem, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are preferred treatment options. The rationale notes that less than 3% of the 1249 isolates resistant to ertapenem but susceptible to meropenem and imipenem contained a carbapenemase gene, and that standard-infusion meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin may be reasonable for uncomplicated cUTIs. For isolates susceptible to meropenem but not imipenem (and vice versa), the panel suggests basing treatment on severity of illness and site of infection. The panel suggests against the use of meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam to treat ertapenem-resistant, meropenem-susceptible and imipenem-susceptible infections, and suggests against the use of extended-infusion carbapenems with or without a second agent when susceptibility to meropenem or imipenem has not been demonstrated. Tigecycline or eravacycline are alternative options for CRE infections not involving the bloodstream or urinary tract.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^7ea12323]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Alarming rates of resistance have been described for non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumanniii complex. These difficult-to-treat MDR bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, but also can acquire resistance to most classes of antibiotic agents. Multiple mechanisms may be present simultaneously, conferring resistance to several classes of antibiotics, including membrane permeability defects, expression of efflux pumps, and production of antibiotic-hydrolysing enzymes such as AmpC beta-lactamases or carbapenemases. S. maltophilia and A. baumanniii complex are rare cIAI pathogens, but can cause postoperative pneumonia among high-risk critically ill patients with cIAI.

Among gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus spp. is associated with increased morbidity in IAIs, but the effect on mortality is uncertain. Whereas the role of enterococci in high-risk patients is well documented, their role in cIAIs in low-risk patients is doubtful. Zhang et al. found by meta-analysis that anti-enterococcal regimens provide no improvement in cIAI treatment success, with similar mortality and adverse effects, in RCTs enrolling young patients with lower-risk community-acquired infections (median APACHE-II score, 6 points). Malignant disease, corticosteroid use, surgery, any antibiotic treatment, admission to an ICU, and an indwelling urinary catheter each predisposed patients with cIAI to a higher risk of enterococcal infection. The prevalence of enterococcal isolation was 2- to 5-fold higher from hospital-acquired IAIs.

Empiric anti-enterococcal therapy for cIAI is not necessary for most community-acquired infections, but is indicated in hospital-acquired IAIs and may be considered for immunocompromised patients, critically ill patients with sepsis and previous antimicrobial therapy lacking enterococcal coverage, or patients with valvular heart disease or intravascular prosthetics at high risk for endocarditis or blood-borne device-associated infection. The ideal regimen for high-risk patients is undetermined. E. faecalis is generally susceptible to ampicillin whereas E. faecium, encountered increasingly, is almost always ampicillin-resistant and 70% of strains are resistant to vancomycin. The first-line treatment of glycopeptide-susceptible E. faecium is vancomycin. Linezolid or daptomycin may be used to treat vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, but occasional resistance has been reported to both agents. The glyclcyclines also have useful activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.

### Multicenter evaluation of the novel ETEST fosfomycin for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterobacterales, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus species [^8e8f92e9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Fosfomycin (FO) is a bactericidal antibiotic that disrupts cell wall synthesis by inhibiting phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase thus interfering with the production of peptidoglycan. FO shows in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The phosphonic acid derivative was first discovered in 1969, and is available as fosfomycin trometamol in the United States and Europe (EU) for oral use, as well as fosfomycin (di-)sodium for intravenous application in most EU countries. It is excreted in unchanged form in urine and feces; hence, qualifying for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Fosfomycin trometamol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) in women caused by susceptible strains ofand. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved fosfomycin trometamol for oral use in uUTI in adult and adolescent females and for intravenous use for all susceptible pathogens. EMA has recently made recommendations to only use intravenous FO for serious or complicated infections when other antibiotic treatments are not feasible. The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) provide different FO breakpoints, one for oral treatment of uUTI forand a different breakpoint for FO i.v. use for Enterobacterales andspp. EUCAST also recommends use of FO in severe infections always in combination with a β-lactam, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, or glycopeptide antibiotic. FO has been long established for treating UTI, but due to the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens (MDR) FO caught attention because there is no cross-resistance known to pathogens producing extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), or methicillin-resistant(MRSA). Studies showed that FO can be used among others as an additive and synergistic compound against Gram-positive or Gram-negative MDR, and also has favorable pharmacokinetics (for example, penetrating biofilms and abscesses) making it an interesting tool for modern anti-infective therapy.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci utilise antibiotic-enriched nutrients for intestinal colonisation [^1644dda3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are multidrug-resistant pathogens and a major cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. These hospital-acquired pathogens pose a major therapeutic challenge as they have intrinsic resistance to several commonly prescribed antibiotics and also have acquired resistance to many available antibiotics.

E. faecium and E. faecalis are responsible for 75% of enterococcal infections and are commonly associated with hospital outbreaks of invasive infections such as bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and endocarditis. E. faecalis was more virulent and more prevalent in healthcare-associated infections than E. faecium, however, the prevalence of E. faecium is increasing due to the rise of vancomycin-resistant and lactam-resistant E. faecium strains. E. faecium has higher levels of intrinsic and acquired resistance than E. faecalis, where 80% of E. faecium isolates are vancomycin-resistant compared to 10% of E. faecalis isolates. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium has gained attention as the World Health Organisation classified it as a high priority pathogen due to its unfavourable rankings in several criteria, including mortality, trends of resistance, transmissibility, preventability, treatability, and pipelines for new medicines and diagnostics.

### Management of serious nosocomial bacterial infections: do current therapeutic options meet the need? [^54537153]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired bacterial infections pose a formidable challenge for healthcare providers, as patients often need to be treated empirically, at least initially, although delay of appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is known to increase morbidity significantly and to increase mortality among affected patients. This elevated risk is compounded by the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Prompt initiation of treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial agent that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms is prudent for patients with nosocomial infections. As the continued usefulness of vancomycin comes into question, the number of alternative agents that provide efficacy equal to that of vancomycin remains limited. The development of novel and effective alternative agents, such as tigecycline, is therefore important.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^ca0d435c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In neonates and infants < 2 months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. group B streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical IV ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal UTI by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered with maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancyor maternal ESBL-E cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates, although if unable to access these, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

Antibiotic Duration and Timing of IV to Oral Switch

For most children with cUTI, there is not enough evidence to support varying from current practice and expert opinion recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D).
When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D).
Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal USS is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B).
For frequently relapsing UTI with the same organism, investigations should assess for an ongoing focal source of infection (GRADE D).
Shorter total durations (6–9 days) and a single dose IV component show early promise, but prospective studies are needed with more children with complicated UTI (GRADES C and D).

### Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice – an observational study [^81e90d2a]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Guideline recommendations on therapy in urinary tract infections are based on antibiotic resistance rates. Due to a lack of surveillance data, little is known about resistance rates in uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in general practice in Germany. In a prospective observational study, urine cultures of all women presenting with urinary tract infections in general practice were analysed. Resistance rates against antibiotics recommended in German guidelines on UTI are presented.

Methods

In a prospective, multi-center observational study general practitioner included all female patients ≥ 18 years with clinically suspected urinary tract infection. Only patients receiving an antibiotic therapy within the last two weeks were excluded.

Results

40 practices recruited 191 female patients (mean age 52 years; range 18–96) with urinary tract infections. Main causative agent was Escherichia coli (79%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (14%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%). Susceptibility of E.coli as the main causative agent was highest against fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, with low resistance rates of 4,5%; 2,2%. In 17,5%, E.coli was resistant to trimethoprim and in 8,5% to ciprofloxacin.

Conclusions

Resistance rates of uropathogens from unselected patients in general practice differ from routinely collected laboratory data. These results can have an impact on antibiotic prescribing and treatment recommendations.

### Enterococcus faecalis urinary-tract infections: Do they have a zoonotic origin? [^9816c313]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Major human pathogens are frequently isolated from meat-producing animals, particularly poultry. Among them is Enterococcus faecalis, which is known to be one of the main cause of human urinary-tract infections worldwide. Early in 2015, we detected several, consecutive abnormal increases in the weekly number of human E. faecalis infections in various medical settings in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of France, especially including community-acquired urinary-tract infections. Speculating that this region-wide epidemiological event may have originated from animal-based food, we initiated this work to provide an overview of the epidemiology of E. faecalis, with a particular focus on the possible link between E. faecalis clones isolated from food-producing animals and those responsible for human urinary-tract infections. At that time, only one study had clearly identified strong epidemiological links between E. faecalis clones isolated from food-producing animals and human E. faecalis urinary-tract infections. This observation, coupled with our region-wide epidemiological experience, leads us to strongly believe that E. faecalis is a real zoonotic pathogen with potentially highly significant impact on human health. This is of particular concern because of its ability to acquire antibiotic-resistance genes and to infect animals and humans. Various strategies must be urgently implemented to address this public health threat, in particular through the development and implementation of large integrated automated surveillance systems based on animal and human health data to enable us to detect E. faecalis epidemiological events.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Enterococcus faecium bacteremia… [^4976579d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

From January 1992 until December 1995, there were 32 episodes of bacteremia caused by vancomycin-susceptible E faecium and 21 caused by VRE. An intra-abdominal site was the most common source of bacteremia in both groups. All of the VRE and 78% of VSE bacteremia cases were nosocomially acquired. ENTEROCOCCUS faecium has grown in importance as a nosocomial pathogen during the past decade. 1, 2 While there once was controversy regarding the pathogenic role of enterococci in causing infection, mounting evidence has now established E faecium as a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients who are infected with this organism. 3–6 Notorious for resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, the acquisition of vancomycin resistance has made this organism a formidable pathogen.

The intensive care units were the most frequent hospital location for development of enterococcal bacteremia: 38% of patients with VSE compared with 57% of those with VRE. Table 1 summarizes the clinical features of the patients with E faecium bacteremia. We did not find VRE bacteremia in our patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, likely reflecting shorter lengths of hospitalization for these patients. The use of indwelling bladder catheters was also associated with VRE bacteremia, although the urinary tract was not found to be a common source for VRE bloodstream infections. This may be explained in part by the serious underlying diseases in the patients with VRE. However, Morris and colleagues18 found that urinary tract catheterization was a risk factor for the development of urinary tract infections caused by this organism.

Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent therapy appears to be an important predisposing factor to E faecium bacteremia. We found a strong correlation between parenteral vancomycin use and the subsequent development of VRE. This supports previous findings by Morris and coworkers, 18 who found that patients with urinary tract infection caused by VRE were more likely to have prior exposure to parenteral vancomycin than those with VSE urinary tract infections. Aside from this one report, accumulating evidence confirms that vancomycin resistance does indeed have a significant adverse impact on the outcome of patients who develop E faecium bacteremia.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^75ae50f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Successful treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium pyelonephritis with daptomycin during pregnancy [^e4c2989d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report successful treatment using daptomycin for pyelonephritis associated with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) in a 27-week pregnant woman.

Case Summary

A 20-year-old 27-week pregnant patient with a history of spina bifida, neurogenic bladder, and multiple hospitalizations for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) was diagnosed with pyelonephritis. She was treated with daptomycin 260 mg (4 mg/kg) daily for 14 days on the basis of a urine culture that revealed E. faecium resistant to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, and vancomycin. All cultures following treatment revealed no growth, and the patient as well as the neonate displayed no adverse effects.

Discussion

VRE UTIs can be treated safely in pregnancy with nitrofurantoin, if the organism is susceptible. Other viable options in the treatment of VRE, including linezolid, doxycycline, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, have lower urinary concentrations, teratogenic risk, or limited findings regarding their safety in pregnancy. Daptomycin was selected in this case due to its efficacy in the treatment of VRE, high urinary concentrations, pregnancy category B, and one case report indicating its successful use in pregnancy.

Conclusions

Treatment of VRE in pregnancy can be challenging due to the teratogenicity or unknown safety of available options. The use of daptomycin in our patient enabled a successful outcome of multidrug-resistant E. faecium in a complicated pregnant patient without observed neonatal abnormalities.

### Levofloxacin in 5% dextrose (levofloxacin) [^4aeb4f02]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.10 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: 10-day Treatment Regimen

Levofloxacin injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa [see Clinical Studies (14.8)].

1.11 Acute Pyelonephritis: 5 or 10-day Treatment Regimen

Levofloxacin injection is indicated for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14.7, 14.8)].

1.12 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections

Levofloxacin injection is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin injection, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.15)] and for some patients uncomplicated urinary tract infection is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin injection for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^a083c0a6]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Once a patient was determined to have a VRE UTI, screening creatinine values were measured in all cases, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were determined in most cases. Daptomycin was generally administered at a planned dosage regimen of ≥ 5 mg/kg every 24 hours (if creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 30 mL/min) or every 48 hours (if CrCl < 30 mL/min). Dosage was determined based on actual body weight for all patients in this analysis. A dose of ≥ 5 mg/kg was chosen to provide ample urinary concentrations of the drug.

Clinical cure was defined by the resolution of symptoms in the best judgment of the ID clinician involved in the care of the patient (SJS). These included urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, and changes in urine character. Other symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, malaise, and anorexia were also monitored for improvement. Follow-up urinalysis and urine culture were typically performed at the end of the daptomycin treatment course. The presence or absence of pyuria in urinalysis at the end of treatment was not in itself a strict criterion for clinical cure because it might have resulted from bladder irritation, drugs, or other causes. Regardless of whether pyuria was initially present and remained present at the end of the treatment course, microbiologic data were examined to help determine whether microbiologic cure was achieved. Microbiologic cure was defined by the eradication of VRE in urine cultures taken after completion of the daptomycin treatment course.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^aeac151a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favour of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for IAIs in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative cIAIs; 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of E. faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, E. faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to BSIs. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains teicoplanin should be considered the preferred drug.

What are the optimal daily doses and modality of administration of antibiotics in patients with IAIs?

19. In patients with IAIs and sepsis or septic shock, appropriate dose and administration mode of antibiotics should include: 1) proper loading dose, 2) extended or continuous infusion for beta-lactams and 3) knowledge of the peritoneal/biliary penetration rate (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

20. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit good penetration rate in the peritoneal exudate fluid. In critically ill patients, continuous infusion should be implemented to grant optimal PK/PD target attainment at the infection site (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Administering adequate doses of antibiotics should be based on the intrinsic pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of each antibiotic class, the specific agent, and the specific pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient.

### Postoperative urinary tract infection after urogynecologic surgery: timing and uropathogens [^be37755c]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Although postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs) after urogynecologic surgery are a common adverse event, there is no standardized postoperative time period used to assess this outcome, and the uropathogens unique to this sub-population of patients have not been well described. Our objective is to describe the timing and uropathogens of postoperative UTI after urogynecologic surgery.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed postoperative UTI occurring within 90 days following urogynecologic procedures from November 2013 to January 2018 at a single academic institution. Postoperative UTI was defined as any uropathogen growth from standard urine culture. Continuous variables were compared with independent samples t-test and categorical variables with chi-square with Bonferonni corrections as appropriate.

Results

One hundred and two of 1085 (9.4%) patients experienced UTI; 63.7% occurred within 6 weeks and 78.4% within 8 weeks; 36.3% of UTIs occurred at a time period of 6 weeks to 90 days. Most commonly isolated uropathogens were Escherichia coli (47.8%) with an additional 11.2% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli. Other bacteria included Enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%), and one culture each for ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant (VRE) Enterococcus faecium.

Conclusions

More than one third of UTIs after urogynecologic surgery occur between 6 weeks and 90 days postoperatively. A plateau of UTI incidence occurs at 8 weeks, a time period at which 78.4% of all UTIs were captured. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated uropathogen, and multi-drug-resistant bacteria were implicated in 12.8% of UTIs.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^6ae1a601]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Fosfomycin (the active component of fosfomycin tromethamine) has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms which are associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Fosfomycin is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses. The bactericidal action of fosfomycin is due to its inactivation of the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase, thereby irreversibly blocking the condensation of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine with penolpyruvate, one of the first steps in bacterial cell wall synthesis. It also reduces adherence of bacteria to uroepithelial cells.

There is generally no cross-resistance between fosfomycin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

Fosfomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms

Enterococcus faecalis

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms

Escherichia coli

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

Fosfomycin exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of 64 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of fosfomycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials:

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms

Enterococcus faecium

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms

Citrobacter diversus

Citrobacter freundii

Enterobacter aerogenes

Klebsiella oxytoca

Klebsiella pneuomoniae

Proteus mirabilis

Proteus vulgaris

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^24e7615f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States (US), primarily affecting women. In the US, half of women experience ≥ 1 UTI by the age of 35 years, and 1 in 3 women experiences ≥ 1 UTI requiring antibiotic treatment in her lifetime, with 11% experiencing ≥ 1 UTI per year. UTI incidence in the US increased by 52% between 1998 and 2011, resulting in 400 000 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of $2.8 billion in 2011. UTIs have also been increasing in outpatient settings and cause substantial negative impact on activity and health-related quality of life.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen causing UTIs. Escherichia coli accounts for up to 80% of uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs), which typically affect otherwise healthy individuals without underlying structural abnormalities or instrumentation, and approximately a quarter of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), which occur in the presence of structural abnormalities or instrumentation compromising the urinary tract. Other gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B Streptococcus can also cause UTIs. Following an initial uUTI, subsequent UTIs are common and may be caused by the same or different pathogens.

Antibiotic treatment for UTI is often empiric without urine culture or susceptibility testing, and is usually based on national guidelines and local resistance profiles. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy. UTIs also have a high recurrence rate, leading to increased use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has been increasing, resulting in increased risk of treatment failure, patient morbidity, healthcare costs, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further exacerbating antibiotic resistance.

Given the continued burden of UTIs, current data on repeated occurrence of UTI are needed. Also, despite global increases in multidrug resistance (MDR), recent data on antibiotic resistance of uropathogens are lacking, especially antibiotic resistance patterns for those patients experiencing UTI recurrences. Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) from a cohort of individuals with uUTI at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), we described the antibiotic resistance of subsequent uUTIs and cUTIs (from 2016–2021) following an initial uUTI (from 2016–2020).

### Multicenter evaluation of the novel ETEST fosfomycin for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterobacterales, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus species [^10879d18]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

There are different EUCAST breakpoints for oral and i.v. breakpoints treatment because the breakpoints for uncomplicated urinary tract infections were reviewed late 2020 and led to the conclusion that a 90% reduction in growth ofin urine is only achieved if the MIC was at a maximum of 8 μg/mL. The breakpoint was changed from 32 μg/mL to 8 μg/mL which might still be too high and the epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF) is still under investigation. For i.v. administrations, there are limited data available and the breakpoint was not changed. It should be considered in the treatment, that bacteria with a MIC of > 16 μg/mL very likely express some resistance mechanism, e.g. FosA.

Nevertheless, the number of resistant isolates for(see Table 8),(n = 10), and(n = 2) was low. At the time of testing there were no resistant isolates available for, C. koseri,… Therefore, the ability of ETEST FO to detect resistant isolates of these species is unknown.

Daptomycin-based courses of antibiotic treatment achieved clinical cure and successful eradication of VRE in all patients in this representative sample of a diverse patient population in our medical facility (Table 2). Indwelling catheters are common sites of infection, and similar results of daptomycin treatment were observed in patients with and without Foley catheters. Daptomycin was effective at eradicating VRE in patients regardless of whether they had had previous UTIs. Additionally, daptomycin eradicated VRE regardless of the level of renal function. Overall, daptomycin was well tolerated, and no reports of adverse events such as alteration of kidney function, muscle weakness or pain, and elevated levels of CPK enzymes were included. For most patients, CPK levels were measured at the time of daptomycin therapy initiation and once or twice more in the next 7 to 10 days. Even for the patient receiving the highest dose (13 mg/kg, patient 3), no elevation was above the normal CPK range.

1.6 Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis due to Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

1.7 Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The effectiveness of levofloxacin tablets is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.

Levofloxacin tablets have not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of levofloxacin tablets in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged levofloxacin tablets therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk [see Clinical Studies (14.9)].

1.8 Plague

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) and prophylaxis for plague in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Efficacy studies of levofloxacin tablets could not be conducted in humans with plague for ethical and feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals [see Clinical Studies (14.10)].

### First characterization of a cluster of vanA-type glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Colombia [^dfc000bf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Resistance of enterococci to multiple antibiotics is common, making treatment problematic. Studies suggest that enterococci inhibited in vitro by < 64 µg/mL of ampicillin may be susceptible in vivo to high-dose ampicillin or therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam and gentamicin (if the isolate does not exhibit high-level resistance to gentamicin). However, the isolates from this study exhibited high-level resistance to ampicillin (MIC 128 µg/mL), gentamicin (> 1,000 µg/mL), and streptomycin (> 2,000 µg/mL), which further limits the therapeutic alternatives. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that has been used as an alternative for the treatment of GRE infections, but it was inactive against the isolates examined here.

As found by others, chloramphenicol was one of the two agents that retained in vitro activity against GRE in this investigation. In a retrospective study of 14 patients with clinical responses, 57% showed improvement after treatment with chloramphenicol. Microbiologic response was 73% in 11 patients evaluated in the same study. Although no lasting adverse effect related to use of the drug occurred, treatment with chloramphenicol was discontinued for two patients because of chloramphenicol-induced bone marrow suppression. In another study of 51 patients with bloodstream infection due to vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, 61% and 79% showed a clinical and microbiologic response to chloramphenicol, respectively, but no corresponding decrease in deaths occurred. In our study, patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) (eight cases) were initially treated successfully with nitrofurantoin (100 mg/6 h). Ampicillin (12 g/day) was used in patients with infections other than UTI. In the latter group, however, the death rate was 33%, mostly because of severe sepsis. Chloramphenicol was not used in this group of patients. Although no controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of chloramphenicol for the treatment of GRE, this antibiotic could be a therapeutic alternative in Colombia.

(1.1)

Usage to Reduce Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BLUJEPA and other antibacterial drugs, BLUJEPA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (1.2)

1.1 Treatment of Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections

BLUJEPA is indicated for the treatment of female adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (kg) with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii complex, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis.

1.2 Usage to Reduce Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BLUJEPA and other antibacterial drugs, BLUJEPA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis — aminoglycoside and fosfomycin considerations are as follows: Treatment with a single IV dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative treatment option for uncomplicated ESBL-E cystitis, and a single IV dose is generally effective for uncomplicated cystitis, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical trial data are lacking. Susceptibility of E. coli to fosfomycin is not routinely tested by most clinical microbiology laboratories but E. coli resistance to fosfomycin remains rare in the United States, and among gram-negative species, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints are only available for E. coli for fosfomycin. Fosfomycin is not suggested for the treatment of infections caused by K. pneumoniae and several other gram-negative organisms, which frequently carry fosA hydrolase genes that may lead to clinical failure. A randomized open-label trial indicated that a single dose of oral fosfomycin is associated with higher clinical failure than a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis, and although this trial was not limited to E. coli cystitis, in a subgroup analysis exclusively of E. coli infections, outcomes remained poor in the fosfomycin group.

### Management of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections [^85afa494]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Enterococci are organisms with a remarkable ability to adapt to the environment and acquire antibiotic resistance determinants. The evolution of antimicrobial resistance in these organisms poses enormous challenges for clinicians when faced with patients affected with severe infections. The increased prevalence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium worldwide has resulted in a major decrease in therapeutic options because the majority of E. faecium isolates are now resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, and exhibit high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, which are three of the traditionally most useful anti-enterococcal antibiotics. Newer antibiotics such as linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have good in vitro activity against enterococcal isolates, although their clinical use may be limited in certain clinical scenarios as a result of reduced rates of success, possible underdosing for enterococci and low serum levels, respectively, and also by the emergence of resistance. The experimental agent oritavancin may offer some hope for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci but clinical data are still lacking. Thus, optimal therapies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections continue to be based on empirical observations and extrapolations from in vitro and animal data. Clinical studies evaluating new strategies, including combination therapies, to treat severe vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections are urgently needed.

### Granules for oral (Fosfomycin tromethamine) [^8e9319a3]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Fosfomycin (the active component of fosfomycin tromethamine) has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms which are associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Fosfomycin is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses. The bactericidal action of fosfomycin is due to its inactivation of the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase, thereby irreversibly blocking the condensation of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine with p-enolpyruvate, one of the first steps in bacterial cell wall synthesis. It also reduces adherence of bacteria to uroepithelial cells.

There is generally no cross-resistance between fosfomycin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

Fosfomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms

 Enterococcus faecalis

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms

 Escherichia coli

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

Fosfomycin exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of 64 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of fosfomycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials:

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms

 Enterococcus faecium

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms

 Citrobacter diversus

 Citrobacter freundii

 Enterobacter aerogenes

 Klebsiella oxytoca

 Klebsiella pneuomoniae

 Proteus mirabilis

 Proteus vulgaris

 Serratia marcescens

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^40e2a8d4]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus and MRSA management in intra-abdominal infection (IAI) is addressed with graded suggestions: We suggest that ampicillin may be used for treatment of IAI in adults and children to provide pathogen-directed therapy against susceptible enterococcal strains (Grade 2-B). We suggest that vancomycin may be used for treatment of IAI in adults and children to provide empiric or pathogen-directed therapy for suspected or proven infections from vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (Grade 2-B), and we suggest inclusion of vancomycin in an aztreonam-based regimen for coverage of gram-positive organisms (Grade 2-B). We suggest that linezolid and daptomycin may be used for management of IAI in adults and children to provide empiric or pathogen-directed therapy for suspected or proven infections from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., and as an alternative to vancomycin for suspected or proven infections because of MRSA (Grade 2-B).

### Overtreatment of enterococcal bacteriuria… [^840f291c]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results A total of 375 urine cultures growing Enterococcus were reviewed, with 339 cultures meeting inclusion criteria. Of these 339 episodes, 183 were classified as ABU and 156 as UTI. In 289 episodes accompanied by urinalysis, pyuria was associated with UTI in 98 of 140 episodes compared with 63 of 149 episodes of ABU. as UTI and inappropriately treated. 6–9 Enterococci have become an increasingly common cause of UTI, accounting for greater than 30% of all bacterial isolates causing UTI among hospitalized patients. 10–13 Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobials and can rapidly develop resistance to a broad range of antibiotics, implying that overuse of antibiotics for enterococcal bacteriuria should be avoided. 14, 15. Catheterization was associated with a nearly 2-fold increase in UTI compared with ABU.

Having at least 10⁵ CFU/mL of Enterococcus was associated with a 3 times greater likelihood of having UTI compared with ABU, with a sensitivity of 41% and a specificity of 83%. Of 133 episodes of treated UTI, 4 were followed by a subsequent infection, whereas 1 of 23 untreated episodes of UTI resulted in distant infection. When the original urinary isolates and subsequent sterile site isolates were compared, 3 had the same susceptibility to vancomycin hydrochloride, 3 differed in their susceptibility to vancomycin, and in 1 episode the susceptibility pattern of the urinary isolate had not been determined. Both of the distant infections that followed ABU occurred in patients with significant comorbidities. The most commonly used antibiotics were fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. Quinolone use was nearly equivalent between the UTI and ABU groups. On the other hand, use of vancomycin was more common for UTI.

Our study confirms prior reports that laboratory values, such as colony count and pyuria, play a limited role in distinguishing UTI from ABU. 31.

### The etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens [^7afb34b9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. Escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen (80%) isolated in acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (10% to 15%). Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. The pathogens traditionally associated with UTI are changing many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. The etiology of UTI is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate UTI, such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. Consequently, complicated UTI has a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated UTI, and organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients can cause significant disease in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying disease. The majority of community-acquired symptomatic UTIs in elderly women are caused by E coli. However, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to 1 in 3 infections in the elderly. In comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated UTI are Enterobacteriaceae. Etiologic pathogens associated with UTI among patients with diabetes include Klebsiella spp. Group B streptococci, and Enterococcus spp., as well as E coli. Patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have E coli infections. Other common uropathogens include Pseudomonas and Proteus mirabilis. Recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate the identification of new etiologic agents for UTI. The need for accurate and updated population surveillance data is apparent, particularly in light of concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. This information will directly affect selection of empiric therapy for UTI.

### New antimicrobial agents for use in the intensive care unit [^5100817b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Timely provision of adequate antimicrobial coverage in an initial anti-infective treatment regimen results in optimal outcomes for bacterial and fungal infections. However, selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging due to expansion of resistance, which typically requires use of multidrug anti-infective regimens to provide adequate coverage of important pathogens commonly seen in the ICU setting. Indeed, a recent additional call to action by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has enforced the impact that antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can have on patient care. The term ESKAPE has been coined by this IDSA group to refer to Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, the etiologic causes of the majority of hospital-acquired infections in the United States that are able to effectively "escape" our antibiotic arsenal and that also mandate discovery of new antimicrobial agents. This article reviews select antibacterial agents and an antifungal agent in late stages of clinical development that appear to have potential for treatment of infections in the ICU.

### Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid: evidence and opinion [^95b89ed8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid demonstrate in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including many isolates resistant to earlier antimicrobials. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is inactive against Enterococcus faecalis but has been effective for treatment of infections due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium associated with bacteremia. In comparative trials, linezolid proved to be equivalent to comparator agents, resulting in its approval for several clinical indications. The almost-complete bioavailability of linezolid permits oral administration. Each agent can cause adverse effects that may limit use in individual patients. Resistance to these drugs has been encountered infrequently among vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin is rare among staphylococci in the United States, and resistance to linezolid is very rare. Whether there is any benefit to use of these agents in combination regimens, and whether there are circumstances in which they might be alternatives to cell-wall active antibiotics for treatment of bone or endovascular infections, are questions that deserve further study.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^868445cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Development of daptomycin susceptibility breakpoints for Enterococcus faecium and revision of the breakpoints for other enterococcal species by the clinical and laboratory standards institute [^3b05de4a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Daptomycin is one of the few treatment options for infections caused by enterococci that are resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The emergence and clinical significance of daptomycin-resistant enterococci and evolving microbiologic, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic, and clinical data indicated that the pre-2019 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) susceptible-only breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL for daptomycin and enterococci was no longer appropriate. After analyzing data that are outlined in this article, the CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing established new breakpoints for daptomycin and enterococci. For E. faecium, a susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL was established based on an increased dosage of 8–12 mg/kg/day (≥ 8 μg/mL-resistant). CLSI suggests infectious diseases consultation to guide daptomycin use for the SDD category. For Enterococcus faecalis and other enterococcal species, revised breakpoints of ≤ 2 μg/mL-susceptible, 4 μg/mL-intermediate, and ≥ 8 μg/mL-resistant were established based on a standard dosage of 6 mg/kg/day.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for enterococci [^c0de247a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Enterococci are major, recalcitrant nosocomial pathogens with a wide repertoire of intrinsic and acquired resistance determinants and the potential of developing resistance to all clinically available antimicrobials. As such, multidrug-resistant enterococci are considered a serious public health threat. Due to limited treatment options and rapid emergence of resistance to all novel agents, the clinical microbiology laboratory plays a critical role in deploying accurate, reproducible, and feasible antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods to guide appropriate treatment of patients with deep-seated enterococcal infections. In this review, we provide an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of existing manual and automated methods that test susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis to β-lactams, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, lipoglycopeptides, oxazolidinones, novel tetracycline-derivatives, and daptomycin. We also identify unique problems and gaps with the performance and clinical utility of antimicrobial susceptibility testing for enterococci, provide recommendations for clinical laboratories to circumvent select problems, and address potential future innovations that can bridge major gaps in susceptibility testing.

### A study of female urinary tract infection caused by urodynamic investigation [^e3fb55f1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of female urinary tract infection before and after urodynamic investigation and to identify the risk factors for urinary tract infection after urodynamic investigation.

Study Design

Eight hundred twenty-two consecutive incontinent women were recruited. All women were "double-screened" and treated for urinary tract infection before urodynamic investigation: first by mid stream urine culture 4 to 6 weeks before investigation and then by reagent strips for urine leukocytes and nitrites at the time of investigation. The investigation was postponed until the urinary tract infection had been treated. All women then received a standard urodynamic investigation.

Results

The prevalence of urinary tract infection before urodynamic investigation was 5.1% (95% CI, 3.6–6.6), and the prevalence after the investigation was 8.4% (95% CI, 6.5–10.3). Three independent risk factors were identified: age ≥ 70 years (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.14–3.48), previous continence surgery (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.05–3.43), and urinary tract infection before urodynamic investigation (odds ratio, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.43–6.83). The 3 most common uropathogens in the urinary tract infections after the urodynamic investigation were Escherichia coli (46.3%), Enterococcus spp (16.4%), and Enterococcus faecalis (11.9%).

Conclusion

Despite a stringent screen-and-treat protocol before urodynamic investigation, patients still experienced urinary tract infection.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Administer ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) as an alternative option. Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs caused by AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

### Health care-associated infections: best practices for prevention [^72779681]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Common examples include catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line-associated bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, surgical site infections, and Clostridioides difficile infections. Standardized infection control processes and precautions have been shown to reduce the rate of HAIs, and targeted practices for HAIs have shown further reductions. Patient safety tools have been developed for various HAIs to help guide administrators and are free for public use through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STRIVE (States Targeting Reduction in Infections via Engagement) initiative. The Choosing Wisely initiative makes best practice recommendations for physicians to improve quality of care and reduce costs; targeted recommendations were developed to reduce the risk of HAIs. For example, using invasive devices only when indicated and for the shortest time possible reduces the risk of device-related HAIs. The goal of antibiotic stewardship is to reduce C. difficile infections and further development of multidrug-resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Antibiotic stewardship targets physician behaviors such as reviewing antibiotic therapy choices every 48 to 72 hours, reviewing culture results as soon as available, de-escalating antibiotic therapy when appropriate, and documenting the indications for initiating and continuing antibiotic therapy.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to choice of antibiotics, AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, or fosfomycin depending on the local antibiogram data as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with rUTIs.

### Emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [^12ff656d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and ampicillin resistance in clinical Enterococcus faecium strains has developed in the past decade. Failure to adhere to strict infection control to prevent the spread of these pathogens has been well established. New data implicate the use of specific classes of antimicrobial agents in the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Extended-spectrum cephalosporins and drugs with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria may promote infection and colonization with VRE and may exert different effects on the initial establishment and persistence of high-density colonization. Control of VRE will require better understanding of the mechanisms by which different classes of drugs promote gastrointestinal colonization.

### Evolution of the resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in urinary tract infections: a 7-year surveillance study [^40a2a484]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a retrospective analysis on the identification and antibiogram of all bacteria isolated from urine samples with microbiological confirmation of urinary tract infection (UTI) in a Spanish reference hospital over a 7-year period.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed of the identification and antibiogram data.

Results

A total of 31,758 uropathogens were isolated. Escherichia coli accounted for the majority (55.2%) of these, followed by Enterococcus faecalis (18.0%) and Klebsiella spp (10.3%). The highest E coli susceptibility rates were to imipenem (93.0%-99.8%), amikacin (97.3%-99.5%), nitrofurantoin (96.7%-98.9%), and fosfomycin (95.3%-100%), and the lowest were to cefuroxime (67.8%-86.4%), ciprofloxacin (61.2%-69.8%), and co-trimoxazole (55.0%-65.5%). We highlight the overall high activity of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin on isolates versus the low activity of fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, or cephalosporins. The activity of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and fosfomycin decreased significantly over the 7-year study period.

Conclusions

Imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam appear to be good options for the empiric treatment of UTI acquired in hospital or requiring hospitalization, whereas nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin can be first-choice antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired cystitis. However, surveillance studies are required to detect resistance to these antibiotics, given that an increase in uropathogen resistance rates may contraindicate its future use in empiric UTI therapy.

Infection-attributable Mortality

All BSIs were associated with increased odds of death (Figure 3A). Enterococcus faecium BSI patients were associated with a death OR of 4.5 (95% CI, 2.7–7.3) compared with uninfected patients. This was followed by K. pneumoniae BSI (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.3–4.3) and E. coli BSI (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.3–3.7) patients, who had an additional 3-fold increased risk of death compared to control patients. The death OR was significant only for E. faecium UTI patients (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; Figure 3B) and P. aeruginosa RTI patients (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.0–2.8; Figure 3C). Differences in death ORs between resistant and susceptible infections were not statistically significant, but were most notable in P. aeruginosa (BSI OR, 1.6 [95% CI, −1.1 to 4.2]; UTI OR, 1.6 [95% CI,.5–2.7]; and RTI OR, 1.6 [95% CI,.6–2.1]).
