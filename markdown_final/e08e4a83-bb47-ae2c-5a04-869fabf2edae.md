## Question

PUD treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about peptic ulcer disease treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and epidemiology to anchor decisions. Then, I should verify the etiologic framework and how it drives therapy. Next, I will examine uncomplicated PUD management, followed by complicated disease (bleeding and perforation). After that, I should review special populations and refractory disease. Finally, I will integrate emerging therapies, safety, and a practical algorithm, making sure each step is supported by high-quality evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions. PUD remains common globally, with a lifetime prevalence around 5–10% and annual incidence roughly 0.1–0.3% in Western countries, though incidence has declined with H. pylori eradication and PPIs; complications still account for 10–20% of cases, and mortality remains substantial, particularly with bleeding and perforation, so I need to keep risk stratification front and center [^afcf66d4] [^748a2eb1] [^1fa2fe8f].

> I need to check the etiologic framework because treatment hinges on it. The two dominant causes are H. pylori infection and NSAID/aspirin exposure, with H. pylori present in about 42% and NSAIDs in about 36% of PUD cases; idiopathic and stress-related ulcers make up the remainder, and this distribution guides whether I prioritize eradication, NSAID modification, or both [^1fa2fe8f] [^748a2eb1]. Hold on, I should verify that H. pylori prevalence varies by region and age, which it does, and that rising antimicrobial resistance complicates empiric choices, reinforcing the need for local resistance data when available [^19992bb4] [^54534083].

> Next, I should review uncomplicated PUD management. For H. pylori–positive ulcers, eradication therapy is first-line and reduces recurrence dramatically from roughly 50–60% to 0–2% in trials; standard triple therapy (PPI plus amoxicillin plus clarithromycin) remains appropriate where clarithromycin resistance is low, whereas bismuth-based quadruple therapy or sequential/concomitant regimens are preferred in high-resistance settings or after failure, and I should confirm eradication 4–6 weeks after antibiotics and at least 2 weeks off PPIs using urea breath or stool antigen testing [^1fa2fe8f] [^7c726512] [^0b7e4689] [^3a4876b1]. Wait, let me verify the role of PPIs in healing; PPIs heal most ulcers within 4–8 weeks and are superior to H2RAs for healing, so I should continue PPI therapy for 4–8 weeks after eradication to ensure mucosal healing, especially for larger gastric ulcers [^1fa2fe8f] [^2250248d].

> For NSAID-associated ulcers, I should confirm that the cornerstone is stopping the NSAID when feasible; discontinuation heals about 95% of ulcers and drops recurrence from 40% to 9%, and if NSAIDs must continue, co-therapy with a PPI is indicated to reduce recurrence and complications, with H. pylori testing and eradication if present to further mitigate risk [^1fa2fe8f] [^748a2eb1]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to low-dose aspirin as well; yes, even low-dose aspirin increases ulcer risk, so PPI gastroprotection is reasonable in high-risk patients, balancing cardiovascular indications [^748a2eb1].

> Now, I will examine bleeding peptic ulcer management, and I need to ensure I sequence steps correctly. Early risk stratification, hemodynamic resuscitation, and urgent upper endoscopy within 24 hours are standard; endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata (active bleeding, nonbleeding visible vessel, adherent clot) reduces rebleeding, surgery, and mortality, and should be followed by high-dose PPI therapy to stabilize the clot and promote healing [^85c6f554] [^cdbf82c7] [^336cd0b4]. I should double-check the PPI regimen; continuous infusion (e.g., 80 mg bolus then 8 mg/hour for 72 hours) is recommended after successful endoscopic therapy, with transition to oral PPI for a total of 6–8 weeks, and H. pylori testing with eradication is mandatory to prevent recurrence [^8865dce1] [^812fbd1d] [^53df3469]. But wait, what if the patient is on antithrombotics? I need to balance bleeding risk against thrombotic risk, often continuing aspirin and delaying other antiplatelets/anticoagulants briefly after hemostasis, in coordination with cardiology [^notfound].

> For perforated peptic ulcer, I should confirm that this is a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Early recognition, aggressive resuscitation with MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h, and lactate normalization, plus prompt broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control, are essential; minimally invasive repair (laparoscopic omental patch) is preferred when feasible, with open surgery reserved for instability or extensive contamination, and leak rates after repair are 12–17%, necessitating close monitoring and a low threshold for endoscopic or surgical rescue [^ae249b58] [^1f7341dd] [^af806343]. Hold on, I should verify antibiotic duration; short-course therapy (3–5 days or until inflammatory markers normalize) is recommended in perforated cases, and I should tailor operative strategy to ulcer size and location, considering resection for large, suspicious gastric ulcers and pyloric exclusion for complex duodenal leaks [^8b998bc3] [^b22eda7d].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, I should avoid endoscopy unless absolutely necessary and favor antacids, sucralfate, or H2RAs; PPIs can be used if symptoms persist or complications arise, with careful risk–benefit discussion. In pediatrics, H. pylori testing and eradication are recommended when PUD is diagnosed, with PPI monotherapy continued for 2–4 weeks after eradication and confirmation of cure 4–6 weeks later. In the elderly, I need a lower threshold for endoscopy, a higher suspicion for NSAID-related disease, and vigilance for drug interactions with antithrombotics [^27e49d0e] [^3a4876b1] [^748a2eb1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought PPIs were contraindicated in pregnancy; let me reconsider — they are not absolutely contraindicated and can be used when clinically indicated after conservative measures fail, though H2RAs are often tried first [^27e49d0e].

> Next, I should review refractory and recurrent PUD. I need to ensure I reassess the diagnosis, adherence, and etiology: confirm H. pylori status with appropriate testing off PPIs, review NSAID/aspirin exposure including OTC agents, consider gastrinoma or other acid hypersecretory states, and evaluate for malignancy in gastric ulcers. If H. pylori is positive, use a salvage regimen guided by local resistance; if negative, long-term PPI therapy is appropriate, and surgery is reserved for failure of medical therapy or complications [^799a2713] [^08a3bba3]. Hold on, I should verify that evidence for medical versus surgical management in refractory cases is limited; indeed, high-quality comparative data are sparse, so decisions should be individualized in MDT settings [^08a3bba3].

> I should confirm the role of emerging therapies. Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) like vonoprazan and tegoprazan show noninferior healing to PPIs in trials and may enable simpler H. pylori regimens, but current guidance advises against routine first-line use in PUD due to cost, limited experience, and lack of superiority data; they may be considered after PPI failure or in selected contexts, and ongoing trials in bleeding PUD may clarify their niche [^8770b531] [^527eab1d] [^7e7057f5]. Let me verify secondary prophylaxis data; in patients on long-term aspirin or NSAIDs, P-CABs are noninferior to PPIs for preventing ulcer recurrence, which is promising but not yet practice-changing given access and economics [^d66946c1].

> I need to ensure I address safety and de-prescribing. Long-term PPI use is associated with potential harms including fractures, hypomagnesemia, enteric infections, and possible cardiovascular and renal signals in observational studies; therefore, I should use the lowest effective dose, reassess indication periodically, and attempt de-prescribing when the indication resolves, while recognizing that in high-risk patients (ongoing NSAIDs, prior bleeding), continued PPI prophylaxis is justified [^ebac413b] [^748a2eb1]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; many safety signals are observational and confounded, so I should individualize decisions and document risk–benefit discussions with patients [^ebac413b].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. For all patients with PUD, test for H. pylori and assess NSAID/aspirin exposure; if H. pylori–positive, eradicate and continue PPI for 4–8 weeks with confirmation of cure; if NSAID-related, stop the NSAID when possible and treat with PPI for 4–8 weeks, adding H. pylori eradication if positive; if both are present, address both. For bleeding, add early endoscopy with hemostasis and high-dose PPI infusion. For perforation, resuscitate, give antibiotics, and pursue urgent surgical repair, preferably laparoscopic. For refractory or recurrent disease, re-evaluate etiology, adherence, and consider salvage H. pylori therapy or long-term PPI, with surgery for failures or complications. Throughout, tailor to age, comorbidities, pregnancy, and local resistance patterns, and avoid unnecessary long-term PPIs when indications resolve [^748a2eb1] [^85c6f554] [^1f7341dd] [^812fbd1d].

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) management centers on **eradicating H. pylori** [^8197d3c9] when present, stopping NSAIDs [^1fa2fe8f], and using **PPIs** [^c304157f] to heal ulcers and prevent recurrence. For bleeding ulcers, combine **endoscopic hemostasis** [^cdbf82c7] with high-dose PPIs [^8865dce1] to reduce rebleeding and surgery [^8831473e]; for perforation, urgent surgery [^1f7341dd] with antibiotics is required [^8b998bc3]. Most patients heal with medical therapy, but surgery is reserved for refractory cases or complications [^baaeb526].

---

## General principles of PUD treatment

- **Identify and treat underlying causes**: H. pylori infection and NSAID use are the primary drivers; eradicating H. pylori [^8197d3c9] and stopping NSAIDs are essential [^1fa2fe8f].

- **Acid suppression**: PPIs are first-line [^c304157f] for healing and preventing recurrence; H2RAs are alternatives if PPIs are unavailable or contraindicated [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and dietary adjustments support healing and reduce recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Medical management

### Helicobacter pylori eradication

- **Test-and-treat strategy**: Test all patients with PUD for H. pylori and eradicate if positive [^748a2eb1].

- **First-line regimens**: Standard triple therapy (PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin) for 10–14 days is recommended where clarithromycin resistance is low [^7c726512]; bismuth quadruple therapy or non-bismuth sequential/concomitant regimens are preferred in high-resistance settings [^0b7e4689].

- **Confirmation of eradication**: Test 4–6 weeks after therapy, off PPIs, using urea breath test or stool antigen [^3a4876b1].

---

### NSAID-associated ulcers

Stop NSAIDs when possible; if continued, co-prescribe a PPI [^c304157f]. For high-risk patients (prior ulcer, age > 65, multiple NSAIDs, anticoagulants), **PPI prophylaxis** is recommended [^748a2eb1].

---

### Acid suppression therapy

PPIs are the most effective agents for ulcer healing and recurrence prevention [^c304157f]; **duration** is typically 4–8 weeks, extending to 8 weeks for large or complicated ulcers [^1fa2fe8f]. H2RAs are less effective but may be used when PPIs are unavailable or contraindicated [^notfound].

---

## Management of complications

### Bleeding peptic ulcers

- **Endoscopic therapy**: First-line for active bleeding or high-risk stigmata (Forrest Ia–IIb) [^cdbf82c7]; methods include injection, thermal coagulation, or mechanical clips [^071fe69b].

- **High-dose PPI therapy**: Initiate after successful endoscopic hemostasis [^8865dce1] (e.g. 80 mg IV bolus then 8 mg/h infusion for 72 hours) [^9087f3ba], then transition to oral PPI for 6–8 weeks [^812fbd1d].

- **Rebleeding management**: Repeat endoscopy is first-line; surgery or interventional radiology is reserved for refractory cases [^33315c50].

---

### Perforated peptic ulcers

Immediate resuscitation and early surgical consultation are essential [^9157a45e]. Laparoscopic repair with omental patch is preferred when feasible [^1f7341dd]; open surgery is reserved for unstable patients or complex cases. Antibiotics are given for 3–5 days or until inflammatory markers normalize [^8b998bc3].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is now reserved for **complications or refractory disease** [^baaeb526]. Indications include perforation, uncontrolled bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, or failure of medical therapy [^baaeb526]. Common procedures include omental patch closure, truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty, or distal gastrectomy, selected based on patient factors and ulcer location [^b22eda7d].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) are noninferior to PPIs for healing and may enable simpler H. pylori regimens, but **limited experience and cost limit routine use** [^8770b531] [^d66946c1]. Personalized therapy based on local resistance patterns and patient factors is increasingly emphasized [^f46af66a]. Endoscopic innovations continue to improve hemostasis and reduce recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and prevention of recurrence

Confirm H. pylori eradication and document ulcer healing with endoscopy when indicated [^3a4876b1]. For high-risk patients — including those with prior bleeding, ongoing NSAID use, or H. pylori-positive status — **long-term PPI maintenance** may be needed [^748a2eb1]. Educate on adherence, NSAID avoidance, and symptom recognition to reduce recurrence [^1c2495fd].

---

PUD treatment is **multidisciplinary**, combining H. pylori eradication, NSAID management, and acid suppression, with endoscopic or surgical care for complications. Most patients heal with medical therapy, but surgery remains vital for refractory disease or emergencies [^748a2eb1].

## References

### Refractory peptic ulcer disease [^799a2713]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Refractory PUD is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Optimal management of severe or refractory PUD requires a multidisciplinary team approach, using primary care providers, gastroenterologists, and general surgeons. Medical management has become the cornerstone of therapy. Identification and eradication of H pylori infection combined with acid reduction regimens can heal ulceration and also prevent recurrence. Severe, intractable or recurrent PUD and associated complications mandates a careful and methodical evaluation and management strategy to determine the potential etiologies and necessary treatment (medical or surgical) required.

### Management of perforated peptic ulcer: a review [^1f7341dd]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Perforated peptic ulcer disease (PUD) affects 4 million people annually worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 5% to 10%. Of those affected, 5% will progress to the point of perforation. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment, perforated PUD continues to have a high rate of morbidity (48.5%) and mortality (9.3%). This review summarizes the current evidence on management of perforated PUD, including management of failed repairs.

Observations

Approaches for repair include primary closure and omental patch closure. Omental patch may be most useful in large perforations with friable tissue. Minimally invasive surgery is the preferred approach in perforated PUD, with improved outcomes compared with open techniques. Leak from the ulcer after repair is seen in approximately 12% to 17% of cases. Approaches to releak include expectant management, radiologic and/or endoscopic intervention, and repeat surgery. Morbidity and mortality after releak are especially high, and complete healing of the leak may take time.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite advances in medical management and surgical techniques, perforated PUD continues to have a relatively high rate of morbidity and mortality. Minimally invasive surgery is the current preferred treatment approach.

### Trends in hospitalizations for peptic ulcer disease, United States, 1998–2005 [^e475871c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a common illness that affects > 6 million persons in the United States each year, causing considerable illness and a large economic cost to the healthcare system. Infection with Helicobacter pylori substantially increases the risk for PUD and its complications. Appropriate antimicrobial drug regimens to eradicate the infection and cure ulcers have been available since Marshall and Warren discovered H. pylori as an etiologic agent of ulcers in the early 1980s. Eradicating these infections prevents recurrence and ulcer complications such as bleeding or perforation. Therefore, a decline in hospitalizations for PUD and its complications could be expected since treatment for H. pylori infection became available.

Although rates of hospitalization for PUD declined in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, rates remained high. One reason was the lack of knowledge among the general public and clinicians about the link between H. pylori and PUD. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with partners from other federal agencies, academic institutions, and private industry, initiated an educational campaign in 1997 to increase awareness of the relationship. The goals of the campaign were to promote the increased use of appropriate antimicrobial drug treatment to eradicate H. pylori, which would thus lead to a further decline in rates of hospitalization for PUD and its complications. Accordingly, reducing hospitalizations for PUD 35% from the 1998 baseline rate of 71/100,000 population to 46/100,000 population by the year 2010 was included in the Healthy People 2010 objectives that were developed in 1998 by the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Implications for research

Given the global prevalence of PUD and the increasing elderly population in both developed and developing nations, optimizing emergency care is crucial for mitigating the burden of PPU. This necessitates international collaboration to conduct robust trials investigating various aspects of the disease.

Firstly, further research is needed to define precise selection criteria for conservative management, differentiating between healthy and frail patient cohorts. Moreover, establishing standardized criteria for disease severity will facilitate the development of tailored management strategies and improve treatment outcomes.

Future RCTs should rigorously compare laparoscopic and open approaches, utilizing robust endpoints such as morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, future studies should focus on identifying risk factors for less common but potentially serious complications, such as reoperation and intra-abdominal abscesses.

Concerning operative variables, further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal use of omental patches and to establish evidence-based guidelines for antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis.

Lastly, studies reporting long-term outcomes, particularly in younger populations, are urgently required to better analyze recurrence rates and patient-reported quality-of-life measures.

### Peptic ulcer and Helicobacter pylori [^98c871e0]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Although there has been an explosion of data not only since the discovery of H. pylori in 1982, but also since the first comprehensive review of H. pylori in the Gastroenterology Clinics in 1993, much remains to be learned. In 1993, there were many skeptics doubting the importance of H. pylori in ulcer disease. Although this skepticism has dissipated, many ulcer patients infected with H. pylori still do not receive appropriate therapy. This situation possibly relates to the safety, efficacy, and simplicity of prescribing acid-suppressive therapy in contrast to the confusion regarding anti-H. pylori treatment regimens. Among the many continuing unanswered questions regarding the role of H. pylori and PUD are the still enigmatic nature of host, environmental, and H. pylori-related factors that determine outcome. Why do only some infected individuals (and why do more men than women) develop PUD, and what determines whether gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers develop? What is the explanation for the seasonal variation in ulcer disease? Although PUD is an infectious disease, are other environmental factors critical for the manifestation of ulcers in association with infection? What factors govern the outcome of the combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use? Has attention been too focused first on the pathophysiology of acid secretion and now on H. pylori? In curing H. pylori in association with PUD, are clinicians going to displace disease northward, substituting erosions, inflammation, and neoplasia (and associated symptoms) in the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction for an ulcer crater (and its associated symptoms) in the duodenum or stomach? The epidemiology of PUD is changing — in more recent reports of ulcer patients, H. pylori and NSAID use are less prevalent than in earlier reports. These questions and comments should not be misinterpreted as advocating a lack of aggressiveness in diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori in the setting of PUD, however. Nevertheless, the pendulum is swinging.

### Surgical therapy of gastric ulcer disease [^baaeb526]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical advancements, including Helicobacter pylori eradication and antisecretory agents, have reduced peptic ulcer disease (PUD)-associated hospital admissions, mortality, and surgical interventions over the past 30 years. Surgery plays an important role in the treatment of life-threatening complications of PUD, such as bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction, as well as for disease that is refractory to medical management. The article highlights the critical role of surgery in cases where medical therapy is insufficient or in the event of emergency complications arising from PUD.

### The global, regional and national burden of peptic ulcer disease from 1990 to 2019: a population-based study [^afcf66d4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD), a common disorder of the digestive system, is defined as digestive tract injury that results in a mucosal break greater than 3–5 mm, with a visible depth reaching the submucosa. Mainly occurring in the stomach and proximal duodenum, PUD accounts for an estimated lifetime prevalence of 5–10% and an annual incidence of 0.1–0.3% in the general population in Western countries. Due to nonspecific symptoms, PUD assessment and treatment requires clinical caution due to severe complications such as bleeding, perforation, penetration into adjacent organs and gastrointestinal obstruction, all of which could require acute endoscopic or surgical treatment.

Similar to several digestive disorders, the prevalence of PUD initially increased and then subsequently decreased. Jennings et al. analyzed PUD epidemiological data spanning 150 years and found that the incidence of and mortality due to PUD increased markedly during the nineteenth century and then decreased steadily due to improvements in environmental hygiene and medical therapeutic strategies. During the first 50 years of the twentieth century in the United States, PUD affected approximately 10% of the adult population. Several studies which were conducted in the past 20–30 years indicated a sharp decreasing tendency in the PUD prevalence, PUD-related hospital admissions and PUD-associated mortality due to new anti-PUD therapies application, such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) using. However, the widespread use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), histamine 2 receptor antagonists, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as increased physiological stress, have been reported as risk factors and have changed the landscape of PUD in recent years. The details of the epidemiological changes caused by these relatively new risk factors are still controversial.

In this study, we analyzed PUD burdens in 204 countries or territories from 1990 to 2019 based on data from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors (GBD) Study, which is updated in 2020 and contains epidemiological and socioeconomic data of 354 diseases globally, allowing evaluations of the burdens, distributions and trends of PUD in different regions. Our study aims to investigate the current landscape and changes in the epidemiological characteristics of PUD to support healthcare-associated policy makers in developing improved PUD prevention strategies.

### Advances in the treatment ofinfection in children [^98aa5e5e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Who should be treated?

In the presence of H. pylori -associated peptic ulcer disease (PUD), eradication of the micro-organism is recommended

In adults, several meta-analyses demonstrate that eradication of H. pylori in patients with PUD significantly reduces the relapse rate of ulcer disease and recurrent bleeding ulcers. In children, previous studies showed a high relapse rate in patients with PUD if they were not treated for their H. pylori infection although only one randomized controlled pediatric trial in H. pylori -infected children with PUD (n = 106) has been published. This trial compares the eradication rate of H. pylori and the cure rate of PUD by using three different treatment regimens, but does not report the recurrence of ulcer or bleeding ulcer in those who failed bacterial eradication. However it can be assumed that H. pylori -related PUD recurrence would be prevented in children by eradication of the infection.

When H. pylori infection is detected by biopsy-based methods in the absence of PUD in children with dyspeptic symptoms, H. pylori treatment may be considered

The finding of H. pylori -associated gastritis in the absence of PUD during diagnostic endoscopy poses a dilemma for the endoscopist. According to the literature review, there is inadequate evidence supporting a causal relationship between H. pylori gastritis and abdominal symptoms in the absence of ulcer disease in children. Therefore, eradication of the organism in the absence of ulcers may not result in improvement in symptoms. Also in adults, it is considered that only one of 12 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia will improve by eradication of H. pylori. However, H. pylori is a risk factor for the development of gastric malignancies. The carcinogenic risk is modified by strain-specific bacterial factors, host responses and/or specific host-microbe interactions. Current evidence suggests that in high risk populations such as the Chinese, the eradication of H. pylori may have the potential to decrease the risk of gastric cancer in a subset of individuals without precancerous lesions. In adults with non-ulcer dyspepsia eradication of H. pylori may reduce the development of peptic ulcers. A potential benefit of chronic infection with certain H. pylori strains cannot be excluded. Therefore, the decision to treat H. pylori -associated gastritis in the absence of duodenal or gastric ulcers is subject to the judgment of the clinician and deliberations with the patient and family taking into consideration the potential risks and benefits of the treatment in the individual patient.

### Perforated peptic ulcers in children: a systematic review [^bdccaf19]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a relatively rare but clinically significant condition in the pediatric population, characterized by mucosal injury of the stomach or duodenum resulting from an imbalance between aggressive luminal factors and mucosal defense mechanisms. Although peptic ulcers are more commonly diagnosed in adults, their incidence in children has increased over recent decades, largely due to improved access to endoscopic procedures.

Pediatric peptic ulcers are classified as primary, most often associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, or secondary, typically resulting from physiological stress, systemic illness, or the use of medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Among the potential complications of PUD, perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) represents a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency in children, associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed promptly.

Children with PPU may initially present with non-specific symptoms of peptic ulcer disease; however, the onset of acute abdominal pain, peritoneal signs, and a systemic inflammatory response usually indicates perforation. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and radiological imaging — most commonly plain radiographs demonstrating pneumoperitoneum — and is confirmed by computed tomography (CT) in equivocal cases. Surgical repair, typically performed via primary closure with an omental patch (Graham patch), remains the standard treatment, with laparoscopic approaches being increasingly utilized.

PPU in the pediatric population is infrequently reported in the literature, with most available data derived from isolated case reports, small case series, or retrospective studies with limited sample sizes. To date, no systematic review has synthesized the available evidence regarding the presentation, management strategies, and outcomes of PPU in children. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to summarize the current literature on PPU in the pediatric population, with a particular focus on epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, treatment approaches, and patient outcomes.

### Proton pump inhibitor treatment for acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^8831473e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer (PU) bleeding is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and healthcare cost. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in peptic ulcer bleeding have yielded conflicting results.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of PPIs in the management of acute bleeding from PU using evidence from RCTs.

Search Strategy

We performed a search of CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2003) and proceedings of recent major meetings through to February 2003. We searched the reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field for additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of PPI treatment (oral or intravenous) compared with either placebo or H(2)-receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) in patients with acute bleeding from PU were included if they met pre-defined criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data independently on a purpose-designed data extraction form. Validity of included studies was assessed by adequacy of randomisation method and other pre-defined criteria. Studies were summarised and meta-analysis was undertaken. The influence of factors on the outcomes was assessed.

Main Results

Twenty-one RCTs with a total of 2915 participants were included. Statistical heterogeneity was found among trials for rebleeding (P = 0.05), but not for mortality (P = 0.26) or surgery (P = 0.42). There was no significant difference in mortality rates between PPI and control treatment; pooled rates were 5.2% on PPI versus 4.6% on control (odds ratio (OR) 1.11; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.57). PPI treatment significantly reduced rates of surgical intervention compared with control; pooled rates were 8.4% on PPI versus 13.0% on control (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.76). PPIs significantly reduced rebleeding compared to control; pooled rates were 10.6% with PPI (range: 0% to 24.4%) versus 18.7% with control treatment (range: 2.3% to 39.1%), the OR was 0.46 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.64). Results on mortality and rebleeding rates were independent of route of PPI administration, type of control treatment or application of initial endoscopic haemostatic treatment. Surgical intervention rates varied with type of control (PPI significantly reduced surgical intervention rates compared with placebo and not when compared with H(2)RA) but not with route of PPI administration or application of initial endoscopic haemostatic treatment.

Reviewers' Conclusions

PPI treatment in PU bleeding reduces rebleeding and surgical intervention rates in studies comparing treatment with placebo or H(2)RA, but there is no evidence of an effect on mortality.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^748a2eb1]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Annual prevalence estimates of peptic ulcer disease range between 0·12% and 1·5%. Peptic ulcer disease is usually attributable to Helicobacter pylori infection, intake of some medications (such as aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications), or being critically ill (stress-related), or it can be idiopathic. The clinical presentation is usually uncomplicated, with peptic ulcer disease management based on eradicating H pylori if present, the use of acid-suppressing medications-most often proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)-or addressing complications, such as with early endoscopy and high-dose PPIs for peptic ulcer bleeding. Special considerations apply to patients on antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. H pylori treatment has evolved, with the choice of regimen dictated by local antibiotic resistance patterns. Indications for primary and secondary prophylaxis vary across societies; most suggest PPIs for patients at highest risk of developing a peptic ulcer, its complications, or its recurrence. Additional research areas include the use of potassium-competitive acid blockers and H pylori vaccination; the optimal approach for patients at risk of stress ulcer bleeding requires more robust determinations of optimal patient selection and treatment selection, if any. Appropriate continuation of PPI use outweighs most possible side-effects if given for approved indications, while de-prescribing should be trialled when a definitive indication is no longer present.

### Should anti-Helicobacter therapy be different in patients with dyspepsia compared with patients with peptic ulcer diathesis? [^1d91e16f]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Physicians should try to reach an optimal cure rate with initial anti-Helicobacter therapy. Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is more likely to be cured then in patients with 'functional' dyspepsia (FD). Differences in cure rates of 5–15% are usually reported, which is considered to be clinically relevant. Different strains (virulent v. non-virulent) in PUD and FD may induce different alterations in the gastric mucosa, and thereby either facilitate or impair antimicrobial efficacy. A study in this journal showed that triple therapy with ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) was superior to triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but only in the more-difficult-to-cure FD patients. Clinicians should be aware that most published treatment studies have included only PUD patients. This means that in clinical practice the cure rates obtained in patients with FD or even uninvestigated dyspepsia will usually be lower then those reported in the literature. One way to deal with this is to consider prolonging the duration of an initial anti-Helicobacter therapy from 7 to 10 or 14 days in patients without ulcers.

### Management of perforated peptic ulcer: what you need to know [^040550ec]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite therapeutic advancements and the significant efficacy of medical management, peptic ulcer disease still affects millions of people. Elective surgical treatment, once a common intervention in General Surgery departments, is now nearly obsolete. Surgical treatment is reserved solely for complications, which occur in approximately 10% to 20% of cases. Perforation is the most common indication for surgery in peptic ulcer disease and accounts for nearly 40% of deaths from the disease. Treatment success depends on various factors, with early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention being highlighted. Perforation is associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. This article aims to analyze the different aspects related to the treatment of perforated peptic ulcers and define the best therapeutic approaches.

### Clinical profile and outcome of surgical treatment of perforated peptic ulcers in northwestern tanzania: a tertiary hospital experience [^59cea2d4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Delay in diagnosis and initiation of surgical treatment of perforated PUD has been reported to be associated with high morbidity and mortality after surgery for perforated PUD. Early recognition and prompt surgical treatment of perforated PUD is of paramount importance if morbidity and mortality associated with perforated PUD are to be avoided. A successful outcome is obtained by prompt recognition of the diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation and early institution of surgical management.

Little work has been done on the surgical management of perforated peptic ulcer disease in our local environment despite increase in the number of admissions of this condition. The aim of this study was to describe our experience on the surgical management of perforated peptic ulcer disease in our local environment outlining the incidence, clinical presentation, management and outcome of patients with peptic ulcer perforation in our setting and to identify predictors of outcome of these patients.

Postendoscopic management

Pharmacotherapy plays a second major role in the treatment of PUB. PPIs can be administered orally or intravenously depending on the rebleeding risk.

In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 767 PUB patients treated with endoscopic therapy because of high-risk stigmata, high-dose intravenous PPIs (80 mg esomeprazole bolus plus 8 mg/h continuous infusion for 72 h) significantly reduced rebleeding (5.9% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.03) and the need for endoscopic retreatment.

Similar results were found by meta-analysis; high-dose intravenous PPIs after endoscopic therapy significantly reduced rebleeding, need for surgery and mortality compared with placebo/no therapy.

PPIs are recommended for 6–8 weeks following UGIB and/or endoscopic treatment of PUD to allow mucosal healing.

Once mucosal healing has been achieved, how long it should last the PPIs use is still controversial.

Studies have shown that in patients who have PUD complicated by bleeding, there is a 33% risk of rebleeding in 1–2 years. Furthermore, there is a 40%-50% rebleeding risk over the subsequent 10 years following the initial episode of bleeding.

Randomized prospective trials have demonstrated a benefit to long-term acid-suppression therapy in two settings: chronic NSAID users and H. pylori -infected patients.

Testing for H. pylori is recommended in all patients with PUB.

This should be followed by eradication therapy for those who are H. pylori -positive, with subsequent assessment of the effect of this therapy, and renewed treatment in those in whom eradication fails.

High-dose continuous intravenous PPIs is recommended in patients with PUB and high-risk stigmata.

### AGA clinical practice update on integrating potassium-competitive acid blockers into clinical practice: expert review [^8770b531]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease — Best Practice Advice 8 states that clinicians should generally not use potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) as first-line therapy in the treatment or prophylaxis of peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Randomized trials showed noninferiority of vonoprazan 20 mg vs lansoprazole 30 mg for gastric ulcer healing at 8 weeks (94% vs 94%) and duodenal ulcers at 6 weeks (96% vs 96%), and of tegoprazan 50–100 mg vs lansoprazole 30 mg for gastric ulcer healing at 8 weeks (95% vs 96%). Ulcer etiology may affect treatment success, with observational data of Japanese patients treated with vonoprazan 20 mg for 6–8 weeks finding higher healing rates for HP-associated ulcers compared with idiopathic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–related ulcers. Given present higher costs and limited clinical experience, P-CABs may be best reserved for treatments after failure of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with PUD.

### Diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease [^9fcdb086]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease continues to be a source of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Approximately two-thirds of patients found to have peptic ulcer disease are asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients, the most common presenting symptom of peptic ulcer disease is epigastric pain, which may be associated with dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal fullness, nausea, or early satiety. Most cases of peptic ulcer disease are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or both. In this review, we discuss the role of proton pump inhibitors in the management of peptic ulcer disease, highlight the latest guidelines about the diagnosis and management of H. pylori, and discuss the latest evidence in the management of complications related to peptic ulcer disease, including endoscopic intervention for peptic ulcer-related bleeding. Timely diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its sequelae are crucial in order to minimize associated morbidity and mortality, as is prevention of peptic ulcer disease among patients at high risk, including those infected with H. pylori and users of NSAIDs.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^df7060dc]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease had a tremendous effect on morbidity and mortality until the last decades of the 20th century, when epidemiological trends started to point to an impressive fall in its incidence. Two important developments are associated with the decrease in rates of peptic ulcer disease: the discovery of effective and potent acid suppressants, and of Helicobacter pylori. With the discovery of H pylori infection, the causes, pathogenesis, and treatment of peptic ulcer disease have been rewritten. We focus on this revolution of understanding and management of peptic ulcer disease over the past 25 years. Despite substantial advances, this disease remains an important clinical problem, largely because of the increasingly widespread use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and low-dose aspirin. We discuss the role of these agents in the causes of ulcer disease and therapeutic and preventive strategies for drug-induced ulcers. The rare but increasingly problematic H pylori-negative NSAID-negative ulcer is also examined.

### Eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease in Helicobacter pylori positive patients [^8197d3c9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease is the cause for dyspepsia in about 10% of patients. 95% of duodenal and 70% of gastric ulcers are associated with Helicobacter pylori. Eradication of H pylori reduces the relapse rate of ulcers but the magnitude of this effect is uncertain.

Objectives

The primary outcomes were the proportion of peptic ulcers healed initially and proportion of patients free from relapse following successful healing. Eradication therapy was compared to placebo or pharmacological therapies in H. pylori positive patients. Secondary aims included symptom relief and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

Searches were conducted on the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL (which includes the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 3 2002) MEDLINE (1966 to July 2002) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2002). Reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching were handsearched to identify further relevant trials. Published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) were handsearched. The search was updated in September 2003, November 2004 and November 2005. Members of the Cochrane UGPD Group, and experts in the field were contacted and asked to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of short and long-term treatment of peptic ulcer disease in H. pylori positive adults were analysed. Patients received at least one week of H pylori eradication compared with ulcer healing drug, placebo or not treatment. Trials were included if they reported assessment from 2 weeks onwards.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected on ulcer healing, recurrence, relief of symptoms and adverse effects.

Main Results

63 trials were eligible. Data extraction was not possible in 7 trials, and 56 trials were included. In duodenal ulcer healing, eradication therapy was superior to ulcer healing drug (UHD) (34 trials, 3910 patients, relative risk [RR] of ulcer persisting = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58, 0.76) and no treatment (2 trials, 207 patients, RR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.26, 0.53). In gastric ulcer healing, no significant differences were detected between eradication therapy and UHD (14 trials, 1572 patients, RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.88, 1.76). In preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence no significant differences were detected between eradication therapy and maintenance therapy with UHD (4 trials, 319 patients, relative risk [RR] of ulcer recurring = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.42, 1.25), but eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (27 trials 2509 patients, RR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.15, 0.26). In preventing gastric ulcer recurrence, eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (11 trials, 1104 patients, RR = 0.29; 95% CI 0.20, 0.42).

Authors' Conclusions

A 1 to 2 weeks course of H. pylori eradication therapy is an effective treatment for H. pylori positive peptic ulcer disease.

### Eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease in Helicobacter pylori-positive people [^5acc2a04]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease is the cause of dyspepsia in about 10% of people. Ninety-five percent of duodenal and 70% of gastric ulcers are associated with Helicobacter pylori. Eradication of H. pylori reduces the relapse rate of ulcers but the magnitude of this effect is uncertain. This is an update of Ford AC, Delaney B, Forman D, Moayyedi P. Eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD003840. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003840.pub4.

Objectives

To assess the proportion of peptic ulcers healed and the proportion of participants who remained free from relapse with eradication therapy against placebo or other pharmacological therapies in H. pylori-positive people. To assess the proportion of participants that achieved complete relief of symptoms and improvement in quality of life scores. To compare the incidence of adverse effects/drop-outs (total number for each drug) associated with the different treatments. To assess the proportion of participants in whom successful eradication was achieved.

Search Methods

In this update, we identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to March 2016) and Ovid EMBASE (1980 to March 2016). To identify further relevant trials, we handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching, and published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology). The search was last updated in March 2016. We contacted members of Cochrane Upper GI and Pancreatic Diseases, and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.

Selection Criteria

We analysed randomised controlled trials of short- and long-term treatment of peptic ulcer disease in H. pylori-positive adults. Participants received at least one week of H. pylori eradication compared with ulcer healing drug, placebo or no treatment. Trials were included if they reported assessment from two weeks onwards.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on ulcer healing, recurrence, relief of symptoms and adverse effects. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3) based on intention-to-treat analysis as far as possible.

Main Results

A total of 55 trials were included for one or more outcomes for this review. In duodenal ulcer healing, eradication therapy was superior to ulcer healing drug (UHD) (34 trials, 3910 participants, RR of ulcer persisting = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.76; 381/2286 (adjusted proportion: 12.4%) in eradication therapy plus UHD versus 304/1624 (18.7%) in UHD; low quality evidence) and no treatment (two trials, 207 participants, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.53; 30/125 (adjusted proportion: 21.7%) in eradication therapy versus 48/82 (58.5%) in no treatment; low quality evidence). In gastric ulcer healing, the differences were imprecise between eradication therapy and UHD (15 trials, 1974 participants, RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.68; 220/1192 (adjusted proportion: 16.0%) in eradication therapy plus UHD versus 102/782 (13.0%) in UHD; very low quality evidence). In preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence the differences were imprecise between maintenance therapy with H.pylori eradication therapy and maintenance therapy with UHD (four trials, 319 participants, RR of ulcer recurring 0.73; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; 19/159 (adjusted proportion: 11.9%) in eradication therapy versus 26/160 (16.3%) in UHD; very low quality evidence), but eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (27 trials 2509 participants, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26; 215/1501 (adjusted proportion: 12.9%) in eradication therapy versus 649/1008 (64.4%) in no treatment; very low quality evidence). In preventing gastric ulcer recurrence, eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (12 trials, 1476 participants, RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.45; 116/697 (adjusted proportion: 16.3%) in eradication therapy versus 356/679 (52.4%) in no treatment; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported proportion of people with gastric ulcer not healed after initial therapy between H.pylori eradication therapy and no active treatment or the proportion of people with recurrent gastric ulcer or peptic ulcers during maintenance therapy between H.pylori eradication therapy and ulcer healing drug therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

Adding a one to two-week course of H. pylori eradication therapy is an effective treatment for people with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer when compared to ulcer healing drugs alone and no treatment. H. pylori eradication therapy is also effective in preventing recurrence of duodenal and gastric ulcer compared to no treatment. There is currently no evidence that H. pylori eradication therapy is an effective treatment in people with gastric ulcer or that it is effective in preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcer compared to ulcer healing drug. However, confidence intervals were wide and significant benefits or harms of H. pylori eradication therapy in acute ulcer healing of gastric ulcers compared to no treatment, and in preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcers compared to ulcer healing drugs cannot be ruled out.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric Helicobacter pylori — clinical evaluation and symptom management: We recommend that the primary goal of clinical investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms should be to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and not solely the presence of H pylori infection; in the absence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) defined as gastric or duodenal ulceration or erosions, eradication of H pylori infection is not expected to result in improvement of symptoms. In cases of abdominal pain in which an organic cause is considered, a diagnostic upper endoscopy rather than noninvasive testing for H pylori should be performed, and based on current evidence, treatment to eliminate H pylori infection is not expected to improve symptoms in children, except in cases of PUD, therefore if peptic lesions are not clinically suspected or identified by endoscopy, invasive diagnostic testing for the sole purpose of detecting H pylori infection should not be undertaken.

2024. 6724 Importance. Perforated peptic ulcer disease affects 4 million people annually worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 5% to 10%. Of those affected, 5% will progress to the point of perforation. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment, perforated PUD continues to have a high rate of morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the current evidence on management of perforated PUD, including management of failed repairs. Observations Approaches for repair include primary closure and omental patch closure. Omental patch may be most useful in large perforations with friable tissue. Minimally invasive surgery is the preferred approach in perforated PUD, with improved outcomes compared with open techniques. Leak from the ulcer after repair is seen in approximately 12% to 17% of cases.

Approaches to releak include expectant management, radiologic and/or endoscopic intervention, and repeat surgery. Morbidity and mortality after releak are especially high, and complete healing of the leak may take time. Conclusions and Relevance Despite advances in medical management and surgical techniques, perforated PUD continues to have a relatively high rate of morbidity and mortality. Minimally invasive surgery is the current preferred treatment approach. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Acid peptic disease [^9643ebef]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The management of peptic ulcer disease has radically changed over the last 40 years from primarily surgical treatment to medical therapy nearly eliminating the need for elective surgery in these patients. Although there has been a decline in patients requiring acute surgical intervention for complications of peptic ulcer disease (perforation, bleeding, and obstruction), these patients still make up a significant proportion of hospital admissions every year. The modern acute care surgeon must have significant knowledge of the multiple treatment modalities used to appropriately care for these patients.

### WITHDRAWN: proton pump inhibitor treatment for acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^bebce80c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in peptic ulcer (PU) bleeding yield conflicting results.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of PPIs in acute bleeding from PU using evidence from RCTs.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2004), EMBASE (1980 to November 2004), proceedings of major meetings to November 2004, and reference lists of articles. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of PPI treatment (oral or intravenous) compared with placebo or H(2)-receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) in acute bleeding from PU.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data independently, assessed study validity, summarised studies and undertook meta-analysis. The influence of study characteristics on the outcomes was examined by subgroup analyses and meta-regression.

Main Results

Twenty-four RCTs comprising 4373 participants in total were included. Statistical heterogeneity was found among trials for rebleeding (P = 0.04), but not for all-cause mortality (P = 0.24) or surgery (P = 0.45). There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality rates between PPI and control treatment; pooled rates were 3.9% on PPI versus 3.8% on control (odds ratio (OR) 1.01; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.40). PPIs significantly reduced rebleeding compared to control; pooled rates were 10.6% with PPI versus 17.3% with control treatment (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.65). PPI treatment significantly reduced surgery compared with control; pooled rates were 6.1% on PPI versus 9.3% on control (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.78). There was no evidence to suggest that results on mortality and rebleeding were dependent on study quality, route of PPI administration, type of control treatment or application of initial endoscopic haemostatic treatment. PPIs significantly reduced surgery compared with placebo but not when compared with H(2)RA. There was no evidence to suggest that study quality, route of PPI administration or application of initial endoscopic haemostatic treatment influenced results on surgery. PPI treatment appeared more efficacious in studies conducted in Asia compared to studies conducted elsewhere. All-cause mortality was reduced only in Asian studies; reductions in rebleeding and surgery were quantitatively greater in Asian studies. Among patients with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessel, PPI treatment reduced mortality (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.91), rebleeding and surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

PPI treatment in PU bleeding reduces rebleeding and surgery compared with placebo or H(2)RA, but there is no evidence of an overall effect on all-cause mortality.

### Peptic ulcer disease: a review [^1fa2fe8f]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, peptic ulcer disease affects 1% of the population and approximately 54 000 patients are admitted to the hospital annually for bleeding peptic ulcers.

Observations

Approximately 10% of patients presenting with upper abdominal pain in a primary care setting have a peptic ulcer as the cause of their symptoms. The principal causes of peptic ulcer disease are Helicobacter pylori infection, which affects approximately 42% of patients with peptic ulcer disease, and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, which are etiologic factors in approximately 36% of people with peptic ulcer disease. Complications of peptic ulcer include bleeding (73% of patients), perforation (9% of patients), and pyloric obstruction (3% of patients). Annually, 10 000 people die of peptic ulcer disease in the US. Endoscopy definitively diagnoses peptic ulcer disease. Acid blockers, such as omeprazole, can heal peptic ulcers in approximately 80% to 100% of patients within 4 weeks, but gastric ulcers larger than 2 cm may require 8 weeks of treatment. Eradication of H pylori decreases peptic ulcer recurrence rates from approximately 50% to 60% to 0% to 2%. Discontinuing NSAIDs heals 95% of ulcers identified on endoscopy and reduces recurrence from 40% to 9%. When discontinuing an NSAID is not desirable, changing the NSAID (eg, from ketorolac to ibuprofen), adding a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, and eradicating H pylori with treatment such as bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline combined with omeprazole can reduce recurrence rates.

Conclusions and Relevance

Peptic ulcer disease is associated with increased hospitalization rates and mortality. Acid blocking with proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, is the primary treatment. Recurrence of ulcers can be prevented by eradicating H pylori if present and discontinuing aspirin or NSAIDs if applicable.

Notes on the use of the guidelines: aims, targets, and limitations

The Guidelines are aimed to present the state-of-the-art regarding diagnosis and therapeutic options for an optimal management of complicated peptic ulcer. These guidelines are thus intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on the specific topic of complicated peptic ulcer, providing an up-to-date tool that can help during the decision-making process. For this reason, the Guidelines are evidence-based and the grade of recommendation is provided to summarize the evidences present in literature. The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^d5c5838a]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary of the current evidence

PPIs represent a key component of any currently adopted regimens for H. pylori eradication. The degree and duration of acid suppression influence the eradication rate. While almost all H. pylori- positive ulcers are cured by H. pylori eradication, H. pylori- negative and NSAID/aspirin-negative PUs need high dose PPIs to be healed and, often, lifelong acid suppression is required to prevent recurrence.

After the discovery by Warren and Marshall of the infectious etiology of PU disease in 1984, several lines of evidence confirmed that H. pylori eradication cures PU disease without the need for subsequent long-term maintenance antisecretory therapy, and can also be beneficial to other H. pylori -related diseases. While previously used only to heal PUs, PPIs have become a key component of all the currently adopted eradication regimens, thus gaining a new role in the management of PU disease.

H. pylori is located within the gastric mucus layer, deep within the mucus-secreting glands of the antrum, attached to cells and even within cells, and is able to survive over a wide pH spectrum. Since the survival capabilities of H. pylori within the stomach make its eradication difficult, several different drug combinations have been developed, with variable and inconsistent success, with no single therapy being effective worldwide. Therefore, the search for a new regimen to treat H. pylori infection still continues today.

An effective therapy should be able to eradicate the organism from each of these potential niches, which is an overwhelming task for any single antibiotic, whose in vitro susceptibility does not necessarily correlate with successful treatment in vivo. Since the very beginning, it was recognized that therapy with a single antibiotic leads to poor cure rates and various recipes were attempted, resulting in several effective combinations of antimicrobials, bismuth, and antisecretory drugs.

### Non-perforated peptic ulcer disease: multidetector CT findings, complications, and differential diagnosis [^bc6cd23b]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) refers to development of gastric or duodenal mucosal defects which penetrate through the muscularis mucosa. Until the end of the twentieth century, PUD represented a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since then, the availability of effective therapies, including H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors and Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication treatment, resulted in decreasing incidence of PUD. However, PUD continues to be a major global health issue that affects roughly 10% of the world population, due to the combined effect of persistent HP epidemics in low-income countries and of widespread use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Patients affected by PUD may suffer from chronic symptoms such as dyspepsia, epigastric discomfort, nausea and early satiety, and often experience acute bouts of abdominal pain. Upper digestive endoscopy is definitely the mainstay diagnostic technique for PUD, but is invasive and often unfeasible in urgent conditions unless gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected. As a result, many patients with unknown PUD present to emergency departments with unexplained acute abdomen and commonly undergo multidetector CT. Since perforated gastroduodenal ulcers represent the commonest cause of spontaneous pneumoperitoneum, suggesting the underlying presence of PUD is relatively straightforward when radiologists are faced with upper abdominal free air or peritonitis without CT signs of colonic diverticulitis and digestive tract masses.

Conversely, due to the widespread belief that CT has no role in detecting uncomplicated PUD, most non-perforated ulcers are missed at primary CT interpretation. Unfortunately, unless clinical suspicion of PUD exists, endoscopy may not be performed for days or weeks after CT, thus allowing time for complications to develop. Albeit superficial ulcers are generally inconspicuous, careful multiplanar CT interpretation and attention to subtle mural and extraluminal signs may allow diagnosing non-perforated PUD prospectively. Suggesting the possibility of unexpected PUD may allow planning early endoscopy for diagnostic confirmation and timely start of appropriate treatment with nasogastric tube aspiration, intravenous fluids, and HP "triple therapy" eradication.

Therefore, this pictorial essay aims to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with CT appearances of non-perforated PUD. After an overview of the current epidemiology of PUD, we explain the appropriate multidetector CT acquisition and interpretation techniques. Then, the imaging findings of uncomplicated peptic disease, PUD-related digestive haemorrhage, gastric outlet obstruction and biliopancreatic fistulisation are presented with examples and a focus on their respective differential diagnoses.

### Current management of peptic ulcer bleeding [^42a3f240]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common and potentially fatal condition. It is best managed using a multidisciplinary approach by a team with medical, endoscopic and surgical expertise. The management of peptic ulcer bleeding has been revolutionized in the past two decades with the advent of effective endoscopic hemostasis and potent acid-suppressing agents. A prompt initial clinical and endoscopic assessment should allow patients to be triaged effectively into those who require active therapy, versus those who require monitoring and preventative therapy. A combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy (using a combination of injection and thermal coagulation) offers the best chance of hemostasis for those with active bleeding ulcers. Surgery, being the most effective way to control bleeding, should be considered for treatment failures. The choice between surgery and repeat endoscopic therapy should be based on the pre-existing comorbidities of the patient and the characteristics of the ulcer.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^2301446b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Peptic ulcer disease is still common among the world population and its incidence pattern is evolving in relation to the rise of new risk factors, i.e. the increasing incidence of the Helicobacter pylori infection, the extensive use of NSAIDs and the increase in alcohol and smoking abuse. Despite the tremendous improvement in preventive therapies, the rate of complication of this disease is still high and is burdened by high morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment of the complications lead invariably to a better outcome, especially in elderly and frail patients. For this reason, these guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of complicated peptic ulcer from a collaboration of a panel of experts and are intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic. We divided our work into two main topics, bleeding and perforated peptic ulcer, and structured it into six main topics that cover the entire management process of patients with complicated peptic ulcer, from diagnosis at ED arrival to post-discharge antimicrobial therapy, to provide an up-to-date and easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^9220ba66]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, peptic ulcer disease is responsible for substantial premature mortality, with much of the burden in low-income and middle-income countries. Peptic ulcer disease comprises both gastric and duodenal ulcers — defects that penetrate, respectively, beyond the muscularis mucosae of the gastric or duodenal mucosa — and its complications can include upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation and, rarely, gastric outlet obstruction. Gastroprotectant drugs, defined here as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), prostaglandin analogues, and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), have been developed for the protection of the mucosa, healing of mucosal damage, and stabilisation of gastrointestinal bleeding, and are prescribed for the prevention of peptic ulcer disease, to promote healing, and as treatment for bleeding complications.

Research in context

Evidence before the study

We searched MEDLINE and Embase from Jan 1, 1950, to Dec 31, 2015, for randomised controlled trials of gastroprotectant drugs (including proton-pump inhibitors [PPIs], histamine-2 receptor antagonists, and prostaglandin analogues), with no language restrictions. These searches revealed a very large number of studies that have assessed the use of such therapy for the prevention or treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported varying efficacy for specific drugs, or drug classes, on certain peptic ulcer disease outcomes in particular clinical settings, often in patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, a comprehensive summary of the relative and absolute effects of different gastroprotectant drugs on different types of upper gastrointestinal outcomes, with or without NSAID use, and in the context both of prevention and treatment, has not been reported.

### Impact of anti-peptic ulcer disease medications on type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in patients with PUD: a population-based retrospective cohort study [^b4ed1179]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Anti-PUD medications focus on reducing gastric acid and enhancing mucosal defense. H2 receptor antagonists, such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine, ranitidine, and roxatidine, inhibit the H2 receptor, reducing 90% of basal, food-stimulated, and nocturnal acid production. While effective, long-term use often leads to ulcer recurrence.H2 receptor antagonists have additional benefits, such as reducing hunger and postprandial blood glucose levels. Previous studies have reported an inverse relationship between H2 receptor antagonist use and insulin resistance (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.95). Cimetidine amplifies insulin secretion and, along with ranitidine, reduces postprandial glucose levels significantly. – In the present study, H2 receptor antagonist treatment was associated with a 34% lower risk of developing T2DM, further highlighting their potential therapeutic benefits.

PPIs, including esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, and dexlansoprazole directly inhibit the stomach's proton-pump, blocking the final stage of acid secretion and controlling both basal and nocturnal acid release.PPIs also inhibit H. pylori growth and are currently first-line PUD therapy, surpassing H2 receptor antagonists. Studies have explored the relationship between PPIs and glycemic control, with mixed results. For example, Singh et al.conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study assessing pantoprazole's effects on glucose-insulin homeostasis in T2DM patients, finding reduced HbA1c levels and increased gastrin levels. It suggests that PPIs may enhance β-cell activity, stimulate insulin production, and slow gastric emptying, reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. This mechanism resembles incretin-based therapies, as gastrin, such as incretin hormones, promotes insulin secretion following meals. However, a meta-analysis of one randomized trial and seven cohort studies found no significant association between PPI use and T2DM risk. Conversely, a large Italian population-based study linked prolonged PPI use to a higher risk of T2DM, with increased risks of 19%, 43%, and 56% for use durations of 8 weeks to 6 months, 6 months to 2 years, and over 2 years, respectively. These conflicting results, driven by variations in ethnicity, sex, diagnostic criteria, follow-up duration, and PPI assessment methods, highlight the critical need for standardized long-term studies to clarify PPIs' role in T2DM management or risk.

### Comparison of 10-day sequential therapy with 7-day standard triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication in inactive peptic ulcer disease and the efficiency of sequential therapy in inactive peptic ulcer disease and non-ulcer dyspepsia [^e805e2c4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been proved to be a major cause of chronic gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease. Furthermore, H. pylori infection is also a crucial cause of gastric cancer and is associated with an increased risk of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. WHO has categorized H. pylori as a class I carcinogenic agent in humans; therefore, its eradication has been an important step in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and prevention of gastric malignancy.

Treatment of H. pylori has been evolving rapidly over the past two decades and several regimens have been proposed to maintain or even increase eradication rates. When first introduced, the now standard triple therapy using proton pump inhibitors, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin, was popular and recommended as first-line therapy for H. pylori in Asia and other regions of the world. The eradication rates of this regimen, however, have declined below 80% as observed in many of the latest studies because of increasing drug resistance, mostly to clarithromycin. Several approaches have been proposed to overcome the low eradication rates. Sequential therapy was first proposed by Zullo et al, in Italy. This two-phase treatment regimen, which involves a proton pump inhibitor plus amoxicillin for the first 5 days followed by a proton pump inhibitor plus clarithromycin and tinidazole or metronidazole for a further 5 days, achieved better results than standard triple therapy.

Many studies have proved that successful eradication of H. pylori substantially reduces the recurrent rate of duodenal ulcers and its recommendation has a worldwide consensus. However, no study has yet demonstrated the efficacy of sequential therapy for H. pylori eradication exclusively in an inactive duodenal ulcer (iDU). On the other hand, a significant portion of non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) patients are infected with H. pylori and its eradication improved dyspeptic symptoms. An early study, which compared triple therapy with ranitidine bismuth citrate based quadruple therapy in treatments between peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and NUD patients, revealed better eradication results in PUD. With a similar regimen in another study, there was no convincing evidence to imply that NUD patients responded to H. pylori eradication treatments differently from those with PUD.

The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of currently used two-phase sequential therapy with standard triple therapy for H. pylori eradication in patients with iDU and the efficiency of sequential therapy in iDU and NUD in the Taiwanese population.

Secondary ulcer prophylaxis in prior PUD — Randomized Japanese trials in patients at risk for ulcer recurrence found vonoprazan 10–20 mg noninferior to lansoprazole 15 mg: among those on long-term low-dose aspirin, 24-week ulcer recurrence was 0.5%–1.5% vs 2.8%, with cumulative gastro-duodenal bleeding 0% vs 3% over 24 weeks and low rates over an additional 6 months; among those requiring long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, 24-week ulcer recurrence was 3% vs 6%, with single-blind extension to 104 weeks showing 4%–6% vs 8%. These data suggest that P-CABs are noninferior to PPIs for secondary peptic ulcer prophylaxis, but do not support their routine use as first-line prophylactic therapy.

### Physician perspectives of Helicobacter pylori diagnostic and treatment practices in Canada: results of a Canadian survey [^15a9cc03]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori infection is prevalent worldwide and can lead to peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastric cancer. Effective diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection by gastroenterologists and family physicians is crucial. However, there are differing views on optimal diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this study is to understand the impressions of Canadian physicians regarding H. pylori diagnosis and treatment and whether impressions differ between gastroenterologists and family physicians. A second objective is to understand physician perspectives on rising antibiotic resistance and how that guides empiric management.

Methods

A survey facilitated via REDCap was administered to Canadian gastroenterologists and family physicians. A total of 105 participants completed the survey, including 43 gastroenterologists and 62 family physicians. Gastroenterologists were recruited from across the country and family physicians were recruited from Manitoba.

Results

For diagnosis of H. pylori, 67% of gastroenterologists reported endoscopic biopsies for histology assessment as most common and 73% of family physicians reported serology as their main diagnostic test. While nearly all gastroenterologists believed antibiotic resistance to be a problem, nearly one quarter of family physicians did not believe it was a problem.

Conclusions

There is variability in practices among both gastroenterologists and family physicians regarding diagnosis of H. pylori infection. There was consensus that local antibiotic resistance patterns should guide management. If known, the degree and patterns of antibiotic resistance could bring a more uniform consensus to H. pylori management. Greater education of physicians, especially family physicians regarding management of H pylori is needed.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^19992bb4]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The rapidly declining prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection and widespread use of potent anti-secretory drugs means peptic ulcer disease has become substantially less prevalent than it was two decades ago. Management has, however, become more challenging than ever because of the threat of increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide and widespread use of complex anti-thrombotic therapy in the ageing population. Peptic ulcers not associated with H pylori infection or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are now also imposing substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This Seminar aims to provide a balanced overview of the latest advances in the pathogenetic mechanisms of peptic ulcers, guidelines on therapies targeting H pylori infection, approaches to treatment of peptic ulcer complications associated with anti-inflammatory analgesics and anti-thrombotic agents, and the unmet needs in terms of our knowledge and management of this increasingly challenging condition.

Conclusions

Minimally invasive techniques, including laparoscopic and endoscopic interventions, represent viable alternatives to open surgery for PPU. While laparoscopic repair offers distinct advantages in reducing surgical site infections and postoperative pain, endoscopic approaches may be particularly beneficial for high-risk patients. Individualized treatment plans considering patient characteristics and perforation features are crucial to optimizing outcomes and reducing the burden of PPU. Randomized trials with larger sample sizes and multicenter collaborations are essential to validate the findings of this analysis and provide further robust evidence for clinical guidelines.

### Medical versus surgical treatment for refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer [^08a3bba3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Refractory peptic ulcers are ulcers in the stomach or duodenum that do not heal after eight to 12 weeks of medical treatment or those that are associated with complications despite medical treatment. Recurrent peptic ulcers are peptic ulcers that recur after healing of the ulcer. Given the number of deaths due to peptic ulcer-related complications and the long-term complications of medical treatment (increased incidence of fracture), it is unclear whether medical or surgical intervention is the better treatment option in people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcer.

Search Methods

We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Upper GI and Pancreatic Diseases group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers until September 2015 to identify randomised trials and non-randomised studies, using search strategies. We also searched the references of included studies to identify further studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies comparing medical treatment with surgical treatment in people with refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We planned to calculate the risk ratio, mean difference, standardised mean difference, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with Review Manager 5 based on intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

We included only one non-randomised study published 30 years ago in the review. This study included 77 participants who had gastric ulcer and in whom medical therapy (histamine H2 receptor blockers, antacids, and diet) had failed after an average duration of treatment of 29 months. The authors do not state whether these were recurrent or refractory ulcers. It appears that the participants did not have previous complications such as bleeding or perforation. Of the 77 included participants, 37 participants continued to have medical therapy while 40 participants received surgical therapy (antrectomy with or without vagotomy; subtotal gastrectomy with or without vagotomy; vagotomy; pyloroplasty and suture of the ulcer; suture or closure of ulcer without vagotomy or excision of the ulcer; proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy alone; suture or closure of the ulcer with proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy). Whether to use medical or surgical treatment was determined by participant's or treating physician's preference. The study authors reported that two participants in the medical treatment group (2 out of 37; 5.4%) had gastric cancer, which was identified by repeated biopsy. They did not report the proportion of participants who had gastric cancer in the surgical treatment group. They also did not report the implications of the delayed diagnosis of gastric cancer in the medical treatment group. They did not report any other outcomes of interest for this review (that is health-related quality of life (using any validated scale), adverse events and serious adverse events, peptic ulcer bleeding, peptic ulcer perforation, abdominal pain, and long-term mortality).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no studies that provide the relative benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers. Studies that evaluate the natural history of recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers are urgently required to determine whether randomised controlled trials comparing medical versus surgical management in patients with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers or both are necessary. Such studies will also provide information for the design of such randomised controlled trials. A minimum follow-up of two to three years will allow the calculation of the incidence of complications and gastric cancer (in gastric ulcers only) in recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers. In addition to complications related to treatment and disease, health-related quality of life and loss of productivity should also be measured.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^846073a4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease is common with a lifetime prevalence in the general population of 5–10% and an incidence of 0.1–0.3% per year. Despite a sharp reduction in incidence and rates of hospital admission and mortality over the past 30 years, complications are still encountered in 10–20% of these patients. Peptic ulcer disease remains a significant healthcare problem, which can consume considerable financial resources. Management may involve various subspecialties including surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists. Successful management of patients with complicated peptic ulcer (CPU) involves prompt recognition, resuscitation when required, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and timely surgical/radiological treatment.

Methods

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the 5th WSES Congress, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached.

Conclusions

The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of complicated peptic ulcer from a collaboration of a panel of experts and are intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic. We divided our work into the two main topics, bleeding and perforated peptic ulcer, and structured it into six main topics that cover the entire management process of patients with complicated peptic ulcer, from diagnosis at ED arrival to post-discharge antimicrobial therapy, to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^c304157f]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Gastroprotectant drugs are used for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and might reduce its associated complications, but reliable estimates of the effects of gastroprotectants in different clinical settings are scarce. We aimed to examine the effects of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), prostaglandin analogues, and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in different clinical circumstances by doing meta-analyses of tabular data from all relevant unconfounded randomised trials of gastroprotectant drugs.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and Embase from Jan 1, 1950, to Dec 31, 2015, to identify unconfounded, randomised trials of a gastroprotectant drug (defined as a PPI, prostaglandin analogue, or H2RA) versus control, or versus another gastroprotectant. Two independent researchers reviewed the search results and extracted the prespecified outcomes and key characteristics for each trial. We did meta-analyses of the effects of gastroprotectant drugs on ulcer development, bleeding, and mortality overall, according to the class of gastroprotectant, and according to the individual drug within a gastroprotectant class.

Findings

We identified comparisons of gastroprotectant versus control in 849 trials (142 485 participants): 580 prevention trials (110 626 participants), 233 healing trials (24 033 participants), and 36 trials for the treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (7826 participants). Comparisons of one gastroprotectant drug versus another were available in 345 trials (64 905 participants), comprising 160 prevention trials (32 959 participants), 167 healing trials (28 306 participants), and 18 trials for treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (3640 participants). The median number of patients in each trial was 78 (IQR 44·0–210·5) and the median duration was 1·4 months (0·9–2·8). In prevention trials, gastroprotectant drugs reduced development of endoscopic ulcers (odds ratio [OR] 0·27, 95% CI 0·25–0·29; p < 0·0001), symptomatic ulcers (0·25, 0·22–0·29; p < 0·0001), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (0·40, 0·32–0·50; p < 0·0001), but did not significantly reduce mortality (0·85, 0·69–1·04; p = 0·11). Larger proportional reductions in upper gastrointestinal bleeding were observed for PPIs than for other gastroprotectant drugs (PPIs 0·21, 99% CI 0·12–0·36; prostaglandin analogues 0·63, 0·35–1·12; H2RAs 0·49, 0·30–0·80; p het = 0·0005). Gastroprotectant drugs were effective in preventing bleeding irrespective of the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (p het = 0·56). In healing trials, gastroprotectants increased endoscopic ulcer healing (3·49, 95% CI 3·28–3·72; p < 0·0001), with PPIs more effective (5·22, 99% CI 4·00–6·80) than prostaglandin analogues (2·27, 1·91–2·70) and H2RAs (3·80, 3·44–4·20; p het < 0·0001). In trials among patients with acute bleeding, gastroprotectants reduced further bleeding (OR 0·68, 95% CI 0·60–0·78; p < 0·0001), blood transfusion (0·75, 0·65–0·88; p = 0·0003), further endoscopic intervention (0·56, 0·45–0·70; p < 0·0001), and surgery (0·72, 0·61–0·84; p < 0·0001), but did not significantly reduce mortality (OR 0·90, 0·72–1·11; p = 0·31). PPIs had larger protective effects than did H2RAs for further bleeding (p het = 0·0107) and blood transfusion (p het = 0·0130).

Interpretation

Gastroprotectants, in particular PPIs, reduce the risk of peptic ulcer disease and its complications and promote healing of peptic ulcers in a wide range of clinical circumstances. However, this meta-analysis might have overestimated the benefits owing to small study bias.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^8befaedb]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

The paucity in clinical progress and basic understanding of perforated peptic ulcers begs for increased attention in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Compared to the toll on human health worldwide, there is poor understanding of the pathophysiology underlying perforation, the ability to self-heal and the development of the sepsis syndrome in these patients.

Identification of prognostic factors and pathways of care that may enhance recovery, reduce morbidity and potentially also reduce mortality should be further investigated. Novel techniques may be further explored to seek alternatives to invasive surgical repair. Similarly, some patients with minimal symptoms may also benefit from less invasive therapeutic approaches. However, groups should be investigated in prospective protocols and trials dedicated to find the safest and most efficacious management strategies and the appropriate criteria for selection. Long-term follow up studies with evaluation of quality of life are needed.

### Physician perspectives of Helicobacter pylori diagnostic and treatment practices in Canada: results of a Canadian survey [^54534083]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori infection is prevalent worldwide and if left untreated can lead to peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastric cancer. It is responsible for over 80% of cases of gastric cancer. Diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection is thus crucial for gastroenterologists and family physicians. However, there are differing views on optimal diagnosis and treatment. For instance, a Canadian study in 2007 found differences in inpatient and outpatient treatments of H. pylori infection in London, Ontario with inpatients generally being undertreated compared to outpatients. There are also increasing concerns of antibiotic resistance to common antibiotic regimens used to eradicate H. pylori which affects optimal empiric management. Current guidelines recommend using local antibiotic resistance patterns to guide empiric treatment of H. pylori infection. While these guidelines exist, access to antibiotic resistance patterns are limited in North America. The lack of antimicrobial resistance patterns for H. pylori is primarily due to (i) the widespread use of culture-independent diagnostic tests that preclude phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and (ii) limited access to both phenotypic and molecular methods for H. pylori susceptibility testing.

Previous studies have outlined differing perspectives on H. pylori treatment. A 2003 study surveyed primary care physicians in countries around the world and found that there were contrasting approaches to diagnosing and treating H. pylori infection depending on the country where the providers practiced. This study also showed that despite quadruple therapy being the main recommendation for H. pylori treatment, most survey respondents had provided treatment with triple therapy regimens. A study in 1998 surveyed Canadian physicians and determined that there were many different strategies used to manage new-onset dyspepsia in the primary care setting. It is unclear from the literature whether current guidelines for H. pylori diagnosis and management are being applied in Canada. It is also unclear whether perspectives and management differs between gastroenterologists and family physicians, both of whom regularly diagnose and manage H. pylori infections. The objective of our study is to better understand the impressions of Canadian physicians regarding H. pylori diagnosis and treatment and whether the impressions are different between gastroenterologists and family physicians. A second objective is to understand physician perspectives on rising antibiotic resistance and how that guides empiric management.

### Overuse of intravenous proton-pump inhibitors in the treatment of low-risk upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^e7f684dd]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with acute upper GI bleeding (UGIB), current best practice is to discontinue or transition (to oral) intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) when esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) reveals low risk or no peptic ulcer disease (PUD).

Study

This retrospective study from a large academic medical center evaluated the use of intravenous PPIs in patients admitted with acute UGIB due to low-risk PUD or non-PUD UGIB. Complete clinical data including endoscopic lesions and the duration of intravenous PPI therapy were recorded.

Results

Of 335 patients with acute UGIB, 253 had no PUD or an ulcer with only low-risk stigmata; 79 patients [31% (95% CI: 26%-37%)] received the appropriate duration of IV PPI. For patients with low-risk PUD (n = 42), patients received on average 5.3 excess doses of intravenous PPI, and patients receiving continuous intravenous PPI received an average of 41 additional hours of IV PPI. Likewise, excess PPI therapy was common for patients found to have no lesions or no PUD. Lesions most often associated with inappropriate IV PPI use included: no identifiable lesion (n = 59; 34%), low-risk PUD (n = 42; 24%), gastritis (n = 31; 18%), esophagitis (n = 24, 14%), and AVMs (n = 21, 12%). The length of hospital stay was shorter in patients who received appropriate PPI therapy after EGD compared with those who did not (4.3 vs. 7.2 d, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

IV PPIs are grossly overused in patients with UGIB, suggesting that there is substantial room for improvement in the use of PPIs in patients with acute UGIB.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^cac72a8a]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastroprotectant drugs are used for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and might reduce its associated complications, but reliable estimates of the effects of gastroprotectants in different clinical settings are scarce. We aimed to examine the effects of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), prostaglandin analogues, and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in different clinical circumstances by doing meta-analyses of tabular data from all relevant unconfounded randomised trials of gastroprotectant drugs.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and Embase from Jan 1, 1950, to Dec 31, 2015, to identify unconfounded, randomised trials of a gastroprotectant drug (defined as a PPI, prostaglandin analogue, or H2RA) versus control, or versus another gastroprotectant. Two independent researchers reviewed the search results and extracted the prespecified outcomes and key characteristics for each trial. We did meta-analyses of the effects of gastroprotectant drugs on ulcer development, bleeding, and mortality overall, according to the class of gastroprotectant, and according to the individual drug within a gastroprotectant class.

Findings

We identified comparisons of gastroprotectant versus control in 849 trials (142485 participants): 580 prevention trials (110626 participants), 233 healing trials (24033 participants), and 36 trials for the treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (7826 participants). Comparisons of one gastroprotectant drug versus another were available in 345 trials (64905 participants), comprising 160 prevention trials (32959 participants), 167 healing trials (28306 participants), and 18 trials for treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (3640 participants). The median number of patients in each trial was 78 (IQR 44·0–210·5) and the median duration was 1·4 months (0·9–2·8). In prevention trials, gastroprotectant drugs reduced development of endoscopic ulcers (odds ratio [OR] 0·27, 95% CI 0·25–0·29; p < 0·0001), symptomatic ulcers (0·25, 0·22–0·29; p < 0·0001), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (0·40, 0·32–0·50; p < 0·0001), but did not significantly reduce mortality (0·85, 0·69–1·04; p = 0·11). Larger proportional reductions in upper gastrointestinal bleeding were observed for PPIs than for other gastroprotectant drugs (PPIs 0·21, 99% CI 0·12–0·36; prostaglandin analogues 0·63, 0·35–1·12; H2RAs 0·49, 0·30–0·80; p het = 0·0005). Gastroprotectant drugs were effective in preventing bleeding irrespective of the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (p het = 0·56). In healing trials, gastroprotectants increased endoscopic ulcer healing (3·49, 95% CI 3·28–3·72; p < 0·0001), with PPIs more effective (5·22, 99% CI 4·00–6·80) than prostaglandin analogues (2·27, 1·91–2·70) and H2RAs (3·80, 3·44–4·20; p het < 0·0001). In trials among patients with acute bleeding, gastroprotectants reduced further bleeding (OR 0·68, 95% CI 0·60–0·78; p < 0·0001), blood transfusion (0·75, 0·65–0·88; p = 0·0003), further endoscopic intervention (0·56, 0·45–0·70; p < 0·0001), and surgery (0·72, 0·61–0·84; p < 0·0001), but did not significantly reduce mortality (OR 0·90, 0·72–1·11; p = 0·31). PPIs had larger protective effects than did H2RAs for further bleeding (p het = 0·0107) and blood transfusion (p het = 0·0130).

Interpretation

Gastroprotectants, in particular PPIs, reduce the risk of peptic ulcer disease and its complications and promote healing of peptic ulcers in a wide range of clinical circumstances. However, this meta-analysis might have overestimated the benefits owing to small study bias.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^b9b6a362]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

Full details of the search strategy, including search terms used, are provided in the appendix (pp 34–36). We searched MEDLINE and Embase using Ovid SP and the Cochrane strategyfrom Jan 1, 1950, to Dec 31, 2015, inclusive, with no language restrictions. Studies were eligible if they were prospective clinical trials with adequate randomisation (ie, randomised sequence generation with robust allocation concealment) and were unconfounded (ie, protocol-mandated use of non-gastroprotectant drugs did not differ between treatment groups). We excluded trials if they were conducted exclusively among participants with non-peptic upper gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, from varices), were of less than 2 weeks' treatment duration (except in acute trials of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, in which there were no duration constraints), were done in a critical care setting, or if treatment was given less frequently than once daily. The review of search results was done independently by two authors (two of HH, KD, KW, and LH).

We included trials if they randomly assigned participants to at least one gastroprotectant drug — defined as a PPI, prostaglandin analogue, or H2RA — and if they included a comparison of a gastroprotectant versus placebo or open control (no gastroprotectant; henceforth referred to as control), or a gastroprotectant of a given class versus a gastroprotectant of another class.

Review of the data indicated that the published trials had assessed gastroprotectant drugs in three main clinical scenarios: people with no ulcer at baseline (so-called prevention trials); people with a non-bleeding ulcer at baseline (so-called healing trials); and people presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding at baseline, with or without a confirmed diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease (so-called acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment trials).

### Peptic ulcer disease today [^0ad44e43]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Over the past few decades, since the introduction of histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective anti-inflammatory drugs (coxibs), and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease and ulcer complications has decreased. There has, however, been an increase in ulcer bleeding, especially in elderly patients. At present, there are several management issues that need to be solved: how to manage H. pylori infection when eradication failure rates are high; how best to prevent ulcers developing and recurring in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin users; and how to treat non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers. Looking for H. pylori infection, the overt or surreptitious use of NSAIDs and/or aspirin, and the possibility of an acid hypersecretory state are important diagnostic considerations that determine the therapeutic approach. Combined treatment with antisecretory therapy and antibiotics for 1–2 weeks is the first-line choice for H. pylori eradication therapy. For patients at risk of developing an ulcer or ulcer complications, it is important to choose carefully which anti-inflammatory drugs, nonselective NSAIDs or coxibs to use, based on a risk assessment of the patient, especially if the high-risk patient also requires aspirin. Testing for and eradicating H. pylori infection in patients is recommended before starting NSAID therapy, and for those currently taking NSAIDs, when there is a history of ulcers or ulcer complications. Understanding the pathophysiology and best treatment strategies for non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers presents a challenge.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^133f585e]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Added value of the study

This meta-analysis of more than 1200 trials included around 200 000 participants and quantified the relative treatment effects of available gastroprotectants in the settings of ulcer prevention, ulcer healing, and treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The findings provide evidence for benefits of gastroprotectant therapy in all three clinical contexts, with PPIs showing consistent superiority to other agents. The relative benefits of gastroprotectants were of broadly similar magnitude irrespective of whether patients were taking NSAIDs. In the absence of large-scale randomised trials, however, some uncertainty remains about whether the effect size estimates in this meta-analysis were inflated by small study bias, and insufficient reliable information is available on the safety of such treatments.

Implications of all the available evidence

This study indicates that, in the context of peptic ulcer disease, gastroprotectants — and in particular PPIs — are effective in ulcer prevention, ulcer healing, and in reducing rebleeding. The relative benefits appear similar irrespective of concomitant NSAID use. Reliable information is still needed about the long-term safety of PPIs; in particular, there is concern that PPIs might have adverse cardiovascular effects. The large ongoing COMPASS trial of pantoprazole versus placebo in 17 000 patients with stable cardiovascular disease might provide useful safety information, and could also help to determine the true size of any beneficial effects.

The most frequent causes of peptic ulcer disease are Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin.NSAIDs are among the most widely used drugs in the world and are known to substantially increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal complications(probably as a consequence of inhibited mucosal prostaglandin production). Optimal use of gastroprotectant drugs might therefore help to reduce the global burden of peptic ulcer disease and its complications. Clinical guidelines currently recommend that PPIs are used as first-choice gastroprotectant drugs, supported by systematic reviews and meta-analyses in particular clinical settings, but to date no comprehensive effort has been made to bring together all of the evidence from randomised trials of gastroprotectant drugs in different clinical contexts. In particular, reliable estimates of the effects of different gastroprotectant drugs in specific clinical circumstances (eg, in the context of prevention, healing, or acute bleeding), at different anatomical locations (gastric or duodenal), and according to concomitant NSAID use are not available.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^ebac413b]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Fourth, we excluded studies in the critical care setting because this clinical scenario is often not considered to represent typical peptic ulcer disease, so the results of this meta-analysis cannot be generalised to prevention of bleeding from stress-related mucosal disease in this context. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of critically ill patients has also reported PPIs as being superior to H2RAs in this setting. Interventional radiology is also now commonly used after failed endoscopy, but this approach was introduced after the completion of most of the trials in our meta-analysis.

Finally, our literature search, although exhaustive, was completed several years ago and is now out of date. However, an updated search to Nov 24, 2017, did not yield any large trials that, had they been included, would have materially altered our conclusions.

Although this meta-analysis provides strong evidence of efficacy for the prevention of upper gastrointestinal complications, the use of gastroprotectant therapy to reduce bleeding risk among patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease is limited by concerns about drug safety, especially if gastroprotectant drugs need to be taken long term. In particular, in observational studies, PPIs have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, bone fractures, hypomagnesaemia, food poisoning and bacterial gut infections, dementia, and chronic kidney disease. Despite the fact that the COGENT trialreported no apparent cardiovascular hazard of omeprazole, concerns about the cardiovascular safety of PPIs have persisted. In 2018, results are expected from a sub-study of the COMPASS trial comparing around 3 years of pantoprazole versus placebo in 17 000 patients with stable cardiovascular disease who were treated with aspirin, rivaroxaban, or both drugs. Not only will this trial provide much needed information about long-term drug safety, but it will also help to determine the magnitude of any beneficial effects of a PPI more reliably than was possible in this meta-analysis.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis of randomised trials summarises the effects of gastroprotectant treatments on a range of outcomes in different treatment settings. PPIs generally appeared to be the most effective class of gastroprotectant for the management of peptic ulcer disease. Gastroprotectant drugs, many of which are available cheaply in generic form, are a potential strategy for reducing the global burden of peptic ulcer disease and, indirectly, might also have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease by allowing wider use of more potent antithrombotic regimens in high-risk patients.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^3c6a75be]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary of the current evidence

PPI therapy in both uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia (FD) is widespread. Indeed, these drugs represent a key component of all the currently employed H. pylori eradication regimens. The search for and eradication of the infection is the first line therapy in the young dyspeptic patient without alarm symptoms. In those patients with persisting symptoms despite successful eradication or naïve-uninfected patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), short-term 4–8 week PPI treatment should be attempted. Finally, PPI co-therapy is indicated in patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, also with the aim of preventing GI events.

Dyspepsia is a common GI condition seen in clinical practice. It is not a single disease, but rather a complex of symptoms referable to the upper GI tract that often overlaps with other disease entities. In front of a patient with dyspeptic complaints, physicians should carefully evaluate the history and perform a physical examination in order to assume that symptoms arise from the upper GI tract. If the patient is young (< 45 years), and there are no alarm symptoms, endoscopy and/or functional investigations are usually not performed, the condition is labeled as "uninvestigated" dyspepsia and treatment is empiric. On the contrary, if endoscopy does reveal a structural abnormality, management of dyspepsia relies on treatment of the underlying disease (e.g. PU, reflux esophagitis, or malignancy). When endoscopy is negative (which is the case in more than 70% of patients with dyspeptic symptoms), FD could be considered and, provided Rome IV criteria are fulfilled, the final diagnosis can be confirmed.

FD is characterized by a continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen for which no organic cause can be determined. According to the most updated Rome IV classification, dyspepsia is subdivided into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS, including fullness, early satiety, nausea) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS, including epigastric pain or epigastric burning). However, symptom overlap with either GERD or irritable bowel syndrome is not infrequent.

FD is widely prevalent in the general population − up to 15% in Italy − so that FD patients are frequently managed in clinical practice by both general practitioners and gastroenterologists. Since the etiology of FD remains unclear and is probably heterogeneous, no definite single treatment is currently available for these patients. Indeed, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed.

### Magnitude, outcome, and predictors of mortality in perforated peptic ulcer disease: a retrospective study in jigjiga town, Ethiopia [^1a1b851f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a significant global health issue due to its high morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. It affects 4 million people worldwide annually, and the incidence of PUD has been estimated to be around 1.5–3%. It is a surgical emergency and life-threatening complication that affects around 2–10% of patients with peptic ulcer disease. And accounts for more than 70% of deaths associated with PUD. Perforation is often the first clinical presentation of PUD. Perforations typically occur in the anterior wall of the duodenum (60%), followed by the antrum (20%) and lesser curvature of the stomach (20%). Patients with perforated PUD often present with an acute abdomen that carries high morbidity and mortality.

There is a geographical difference in the etiology and risk factors of perforated PUD, reflecting variation in socioeconomic development. In the developing world, the patients are males and young, with a strong association with cigarette smoking. In contrast, patients in the developed world tend to be elderly, with a strong association with ulcerogenic drug ingestion. Moreover, the etiology and risk factors also include the use of NSAIDs, steroids, alcohol, H.pylori, cigarette smoking, and previous peptic ulcer disease. There are also some local risk factors in the region, such as kha t, which is common in East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Defining the exact etiological factor in any patient may often be difficult, as multiple risk factors may be present, and they tend to interact.

The most common presenting symptom was sudden onset of abdominal pain followed by abdominal distention and almost all patients have abdominal tenderness. Around 31% have been reported to have a previous history of dyspepsia. While others report up to 69% have had a previous history of dyspepsia and previous treatment of peptic ulcer disease. The diagnosis of perforated PUD is clinical which is based on a high index of suspicion in a condition with acute exacerbation of a patient with known peptic ulcer disease and can be investigated with erect chest x-ray in which the presence of free air under the right diaphragm (pneumo-peritonium) clinches the diagnosis. This sign is present in 65–80% of the cases. Using lateral erect chest X-rays increases the detection of pneumoperitonium by up to 98%.

### Diagnosis and therapy in the era of antimicrobial stewardship [^5ab5654b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Initially, Helicobacter pylori gastritis was largely considered in relation to its role in peptic ulcer disease, which was then one of the major and most important gastrointestinal diseases. H. pylori treatment studies done for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the presence of peptic ulcer and were assigned to the Gastroenterology section. As with other ulcer studies, the focus was on healing of ulcers rather than cure of the infection. A comparator was required because ulcers healed and recurred spontaneously (i.e. a definite placebo response was present). Only during the recent development of the rifabutin triple therapy, Talicia, did the FDA permit H. pylori therapy studies based only on the presence of the infection. Although a comparator was required, approval did not include the requirement of the optimized regimen. It appears that the FDA is slowly making the transition to dealing with H. pylori as an infectious disease of the gastrointestinal tract.

H. pylori infections are typically lifelong and rarely spontaneously disappear until the gastric mucosa replaced by intestinal metaplasia. There is no placebo response to therapy. With optimized current therapies and adherent patients with susceptible infections, one can reliably achieve ⩾95% cure rates. – The ability to obtain cure rates of nearly 100% and lack of a placebo response obviates the need for a comparator other than the theoretically possible, 100% cured. This differs from the majority of gastrointestinal diseases where the etiology is unknown, cure is not possible, and there is a strong placebo effect that requires that therapies for typical gastroenterology diseases include a comparator and often a placebo as the outcome is often based on a change in symptoms or disease activity scored using a validated scoring instrument. Treatment success is determined by comparison with a poorly performing legacy therapy and often a placebo. Cures are not expected and techniques such as meta-analysis are needed to compare regimens. In contrast, with infectious diseases, cures are expected, there is no placebo response, and outcomes are scored in terms of comparison with the theoretical 100% cure rate. Comparisons are typically restricted to highly successful therapies using tests of noninferiority. We hope that soon both the FDA and Gastroenterology will embrace treatment of H. pylori as an infectious disease and focus on results with susceptible infection using therapies optimized to achieve cure rates near the theoretically possible cure rate of 100%.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^b679b22e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, Scarpignato et al. should be commended for this remarkable effort. In addition to the major points detailed above, there are numerous pearls pertinent to comparative PPI pharmacology and metabolism contained within the text. However, the overwhelming message is that the problem with PPIs is that they are good, very good. Consequently, there are a lot of valid indications for their use. However, clinicians cannot be complacent, thinking that the overwhelming efficacy of the drugs in the treatment of peptic esophagitis and ulcer disease will be matched in all other putative applications. Decisions to start, properly dose, continue, or discontinue PPI therapy should be personalized based on indication, effectiveness, patient preferences, and risk assessment. Guidelines are important, but they should not be inflexible. Clinicians need flexibility to tailor therapy to specific patient circumstances and experience. Only then does one achieve the optimal balance between risk and benefit.

### Gastric and duodenal ulcers during pregnancy [^27e49d0e]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The frequency, symptoms, and complication rate of PUD seem to decrease during pregnancy. Yet clinicians often have to treat dyspepsia or pyrosis of undetermined origin during pregnancy because the frequency of pyrosis significantly increases during pregnancy, and clinicians reluctantly perform EGD during pregnancy for pyrosis to differentiate reliably between GERD and PUD. Dyspepsia or pyrosis during pregnancy is initially treated with dietary and lifestyle modifications. If the symptoms do not remit with these modifications, sucralfate or antacids, preferably magnesium-containing or aluminum-containing antacids, should be administered. Histamine2 receptor antagonists are recommended when symptoms are refractory to antacid or sucralfate therapy. Ranitidine seems to be a relatively safe H2 receptor antagonist. If symptoms continue despite H2 receptor antagonist therapy, the patient should be evaluated for possible EGD or PPI therapy. Pregnant women with hemodynamically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding or other worrisome clinical findings should undergo EGD. Indications for surgery include ulcer perforation, ongoing active bleeding from an ulcer requiring transfusion of six or more units of packed erythrocytes, gastric outlet obstruction refractory to intense medical therapy, and a malignant gastric ulcer without evident metastases.

Purpose Of Review

This review reports and attempts to place in some context current key observations in the literature, as they relate to peptic ulcer disease.

Recent Findings

Focus areas in this review are general, the usefulness of symptom-based triage in management decision making and critical review of current practice as it relates to foregut malignancy; Helicobacter pylori, important observations regarding gastric cancer prevention are presented, the role of the organism in "acid rebound" is discussed, and further evidence to support the role of H. pylori eradication in peptic ulcer disease is provided; medication, a number of studies comparing steady state and onset of action efficacy of current proton pump inhibitors at a gastric pH level are reviewed and a new agent is introduced. Problems with and strategies for the safe use of antithrombotic agents are reviewed, and exciting data with regard to a new class of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug are provided, now at the "proof of concept" stage.

Summary

The review period's main "new" information relates to the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in which a number of exciting agents are being developed. Although inconclusive, the observations with regard to the effect of H. pylori eradication on gastric carcinogenesis is likely to lead to more work in this field.

### Peptic-ulcer disease [^e0d7bb79]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

The discovery of Helicobacter pylori has greatly changed our approach to peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial, host, and environmental factors all have a role in peptic-ulcer disease. Although the prevalence of uncomplicated peptic ulcers is falling, hospital admissions for ulcer complications associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are rising. Evidence suggests that prescription of NSAIDs along with potent antiulcer agents and the use of highly selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors reduce gastroduodenal ulceration. Whether these therapeutic advances will translate into clinical benefits remains to be seen. The interaction between H pylori and NSAIDs is one of the most controversial issues in peptic ulcer disease. With the fall in rates of H pylori infection, the proportion of ulcers not related to this organism and NSAIDs has risen, which will affect the management of peptic ulcer.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: a review of the literature [^1a02f3de]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A peptic ulcer is a mucosal break with a size over 5 mm that forms in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum. Many kinds of etiologies can result in peptic ulcer disease. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Other uncommon etiologies for peptic ulcers are named Hp-negative, NSAID-negative ulcers, including gastrinoma (Zollinger–Ellison syndrome), gastric malignancy (adenocarcinoma and lymphoma), Crohn disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, viral infections, Behcet disease, acute stress, and mucosal ischemia.

Gastric acid, bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes compose the gastric environment with a dynamic pH value between 1.5 and 3. In normal conditions, protective mechanisms of the stomach can protect and repair the gastric mucosa. When an imbalance between gastric acid and mucosal protection occurs, such as gastric acid hypersecretion and impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion, it may result in peptic ulcer disease. Hp infection can disrupt the protective mucous layer, causing gastritis and impair the mucosa healing. Hp-induced antral inflammation can also increase basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion.NSAIDs inhibit mucosal prostaglandin synthesis, which can reduce the mucosa blood flow, the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the amount of bicarbonate.

Common symptoms of peptic ulcers include epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, bleeding or perforation of the stomach or duodenum. The most common complication of peptic ulcers in emergency departments is bleeding, approximately 100–170 per 100,000 worldwide. Peptic ulcer bleeding is a serious medical condition causing hematemesis, melena (tarry stool), or hematochezia. Patients without timely treatment can progress into anemia, hypovolemic shock, multiorgan failure, or even death. The mortality rate of peptic ulcer bleeding is approximately 5%–12%. Therefore, clinicians have been dedicated to developing the most effective treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding for decades.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^9157a45e]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) is a surgical emergency and is associated with short-term mortality and morbidity in up to 30 and 50% of patients, respectively. Worldwide variation in demography, socioeconomic status, Helicobacter pylori prevalence and prescription drugs make investigation into risk factors for PPU difficult. PPU presents as an acute abdominal condition, with localized or generalized peritonitis and a high risk for developing sepsis and death. Early diagnosis is essential but clinical signs can be obscured in the elderly, or the immunocompromised and thus delay diagnosis. Imaging has an important role in diagnosis, as does early resuscitation including administration of antibiotics. Appropriate risk-assessment and selection of therapeutic alternatives becomes important to address the risk for morbidity and mortality. This review will present an update on the current understanding and management of perforated peptic ulcer.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^f70f1d96]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Prevention trials: effects of gastroprotectants on endoscopic and symptomatic ulcers

For 97 trials for the endoscopic outcome and 36 trials for the symptomatic outcome, in which the total number of ulcers was not reported but the breakdown was, we assumed that the total number of ulcers was equal to gastric plus duodenal: 1256 of 7414 events vs 2277 of 5766 events for endoscopic ulcers and 469 of 2492 events vs 927 of 2021 events for symptomatic ulcers. PPI = proton-pump inhibitor. H2RA = histamine-2 receptor antagonist. *Summary odds ratios, indicated by diamonds, are presented with 95% CIs; all other odds ratios are presented with 99% CIs.

Few data were available with which to assess the relative efficacy of drugs within each gastroprotectant class, but the available trials provided no evidence that any individual PPI or prostaglandin analogue was more effective for the prevention of endoscopic ulcer than any other in the same class and we found little evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects among H2RAs (p het = 0·0286; appendix p 4).

Overall, compared with control, allocation to a gastroprotectant drug resulted in a substantial reduction in the odds of a symptomatic ulcer (OR 0·25 [95% CI 0·22–0·29]; absolute benefit 67 [59–75] events avoided per 1000 allocated treatment; p < 0·0001; figure 2). However, because there were only about a third as many symptomatic ulcers as endoscopic ulcers available for analysis, the relative effectiveness of individual gastroprotectant classes on symptomatic ulcers was less clear. Overall, PPIs were more effective than were H2RAs and prostaglandin analogues (between the three classes p het = 0·0018), but data were insufficient to provide separate estimates of effectiveness for duodenal and gastric ulcers (figure 2). We found no clear evidence that any individual PPI or prostaglandin analogue was more effective for the prevention of symptomatic ulcer than any other of the same class (appendix p 5), and only weak evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects among H2RAs (p het = 0·0447; appendix p 5).

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^2250248d]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

In the healing trials, we found that allocation to a gastroprotectant drug more than trebled the odds of endoscopic ulcer healing overall, compared with control (207 trials with median duration 0·9 months [IQR 0·9–1·4]: OR 3·49 [95% CI 3·28–3·72]; absolute benefit 261 [247–274] avoided per 1000 allocated treatment; p < 0·0001; figure 5). Based on trials comparing a gastroprotectant with control, the order of effectiveness of gastroprotectant classes for duodenal and gastric ulcer healing was: PPIs as the most effective, followed by H2RAs and finally prostaglandin analogues (p het < 0·0001 and p het = 0·0325 respectively; figure 5). This order was consistent with the ordering implied by the results of direct comparisons of one gastroprotectant class versus another gastroprotectant class (appendix p 9).

Figure 5
Healing trials: effects of gastroprotectants on ulcer healing

We counted the number of patients who became ulcer free on endoscopy post treatment. For 204 trials for the endoscopic outcome, the total number of ulcers was not reported but the breakdown was; we assumed that the total number of ulcers was equal to gastric plus duodenal: 8861 of 11 844 events vs 4040 of 8312 events. PPI = proton-pump inhibitor. H2RA = histamine-2 receptor antagonist. *Summary odds ratios, indicated by diamonds, are presented with 95% CIs; all other odds ratios are presented with 99% CIs.

Individual PPIs were all effective for endoscopic ulcer healing, but differed in their degree of effect (p het = 0·0010; appendix p 10), with lansoprazole and pantoprazole seemingly exhibiting the largest effects and esomeprazole the smallest. We found no significant differences between individual H2RAs or prostaglandin analogues (appendix p 10).

### Management of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1c2495fd]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the cause of most peptic ulcer disease and a primary risk factor for gastric cancer. Eradication of the organism results in ulcer healing and reduces the risk of ulcer recurrence and complications. Testing and treatment have no clear value in patients with documented nonulcer dyspepsia; however, a test-and-treat strategy is recommended but for patients with undifferentiated dyspepsia who have not undergone endoscopy. In the office setting, initial serology testing is practical and affordable, with endoscopy reserved for use in patients with alarm symptoms for ulcer complications or cancer, or those who do not respond to treatment. Treatment involves 10- to 14-day multidrug regimens including antibiotics and acid suppressants, combined with education about avoidance of other ulcer-causing factors and the need for close follow-up. Follow-up testing (i.e., urea breath or stool antigen test) is recommended for patients who do not respond to therapy or those with a history of ulcer complications or cancer.

Basic conclusive suggestions and data concerning the best approach to H. pylori treatment from the worldwide existing guidelines and consensuses in relation to antibiotic resistance

It seems that the best treatment approach to H. pylori is running at full speed toward treatments based on a national consensus that should exist for each country. Undoubtedly, guidelines of a neighboring country or a continental consensus could be used in a tutorial manner, particularly when local information is lacking.

14.5 Helicobacter pylori Eradication in Patients with Peptic Ulcer Disease or Symptomatic Non-Ulcer Disease in Adults

The U.S. multicenter study was a double-blind, parallel-group comparison of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 3, 7, or 10 days vs. omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 10 days. Therapy consisted of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (RAC) or omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (OAC). Patients with H. pylori infection were stratified in a 1:1 ratio for those with peptic ulcer disease (active or a history of ulcer in the past five years) [PUD] and those who were symptomatic but without peptic ulcer disease [NPUD], as determined by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The overall H. pylori eradication rates, defined as negative13C-UBT for H. pylori ≥ 6 weeks from the end of the treatment are shown in the following table. The eradication rates in the 7-day and 10-day RAC regimens were found to be similar to 10-day OAC regimen using either the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) or Per-Protocol (PP) populations. Eradication rates in the RAC 3-day regimen were inferior to the other regimens.

Table 13: Helicobacter pylori Eradication at ≥ 6 Weeks After the End of Treatment

The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg twice daily with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 7 days.

14.6 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions, Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome in Adults

Twelve patients with idiopathic gastric hypersecretion or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated successfully with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets at doses from 20 mg to 120 mg for up to 12 months. Rabeprazole sodium produced satisfactory inhibition of gastric acid secretion in all patients and complete resolution of signs and symptoms of acid-peptic disease where present. Rabeprazole sodium also prevented recurrence of gastric hypersecretion and manifestations of acid-peptic disease in all patients. The high doses of rabeprazole sodium used to treat this small cohort of patients with gastric hypersecretion were well tolerated.

The recommended starting dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 60 mg once daily.

### Risk of uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease in a cohort of new users of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events [^f8869072]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

To confirm the validity of our case ascertainment further, we sent a questionnaire to the corresponding PCPs requesting confirmation and copies of paper-based records for 100 patients randomly sampled from the definite cases (n = 96) and possible cases (n = 4). We received records for 98 patients. The uncomplicated PUD diagnosis was confirmed by the PCPs for 76 patients. The confirmation rate among the definite cases was 80% and only 25% among possible cases. We retained as cases all definite cases confirmed by a questionnaire (n = 75) and those definite cases for which we did not have a questionnaire (n = 233). Due to the low confirmation rate among possible cases, we only retained the single patient initially classified as possible, whose diagnosis was confirmed by the PCP. The majority of patients who were not retained as uncomplicated PUD cases had a discharge letter with a diagnosis of a complication (e.g. bleeding) not recorded in their computerized file.

Following this two-step review process, 309 patients were considered to be incident cases of uncomplicated PUD: 308 individuals from those initially classified as definite and 1 from the possible cases (Figure 1). The index date was defined as the date of the computer-recorded diagnosis (n = 144) or the date of the first symptom leading to the diagnosis of PUD (n = 165), whichever occurred first. When the date of the first symptom was used as the index date, the mean time to the computer-recorded diagnosis of uncomplicated PUD was 35 days. The peptic ulcer was located in the stomach for 188 patients (61%), the duodenum for 103 (33%) and multiple sites (stomach and duodenum) for 18 (6%).

Figure 1
Study design and case ascertainment. Abbreviations: GI- Gastrointestinal; PUD -Peptic ulcer disease.

Selection of controls

A date within the study period was generated at random for each member of the study cohort, excluding PUD cases. If the random date was included in the individual's person-time contribution, we marked that person as an eligible control. The random date for each control individual was used as the index date in the nested case–control analysis. In total, 2000 controls, frequency-matched to cases by age (within 1 year), sex and follow-up time (interval between start date and index date), were randomly selected from the pool of eligible controls.

### Tegoprazan and lansoprazole effectiveness in bleeding peptic… [^d5737642]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Tegoprazan And Lansoprazole Effectiveness in Bleeding Peptic Ulcer Treatment ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Peptic ulcer disease is a condition characterized by disruption of the gastric and duodenal mucosal lining due to exposure to gastric acid or pepsin. Major causes include Helicobacter pylori infection, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, gastric bypass surgery, lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, and genetic predisposition. PUD affects 5–10% of the global population and poses a significant healthcare burden, with prevalence rising from 6. 43 million to
8. 09 million cases between 1990 and 2019. Current PUD treatment involves acid-suppressing agents and H. pylori eradication when indicated. Proton pump inhibitors play a key role by irreversibly inhibiting H⁺/K⁺ ATPase in gastric parietal cells, effectively maintaining gastric pH ≥ 4, which is essential for ulcer healing and preventing complications like bleeding.

Lansoprazole, a widely used PPI, has demonstrated strong efficacy, with healing rates of 64%, 75. 6%, and
95. 7% at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively. However, PPIs have limitations, including short plasma half-life, food dependency, breakthrough symptoms, and potential long-term adverse effects such as hypergastrinemia, acid rebound, and gut microbiota alterations. Studies suggest that PCABs are non-inferior to PPIs in treating PUD, with some data indicating that tegoprazan offers stronger, faster, and more stable acid suppression than vonoprazan. However, no studies have compared the healing rates of tegoprazan and lansoprazole specifically in bleeding PUD patients over a 2-week treatment period. Given the importance of optimizing treatment for bleeding PUD in Indonesia, this study aims to compare the effectiveness of tegoprazan and lansoprazole in ulcer healing over a short-term evaluation period.

This research is expected to contribute to the scientific literature by providing clinical trial data specific to the Indonesian population, inform clinical decision-making by identifying the most effective treatment for bleeding PUD, and ultimately improve patient outcomes by ensuring faster healing and better symptom management.
